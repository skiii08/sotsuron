The King's Speech," The King's Speech is one of the best historical dramas I've recently seen
","This movie-The King's Speech-is an inspirational, funny, and ultimately touching true story of eventual King George VI's overcoming his stammering speaking patterns when reading his first public speech as the new royal head of Buckingham Palace. As played by Colin Firth, Bertie-his actual given name-reluctantly lets himself be taught elocution lessons by one Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has him do various crazy things to achieve results like singing some words to American tunes like 'Camptown Races' or 'Swanee River' and letting some profanities out freely in session! Also giving a fine performance is Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's wife Elizabeth especially when she reveals why she eventually agreed to marry him. If Firth wins Best Actor at the Oscars, it will be much deserved. So on that note, The King's Speech is highly recommended. P.S. When I first saw Timothy Spall on screen, I thought he was doing Alfred Hitchcock until I realized that Winston Churchill had the same face shape!",10,2,8,9 February 2011
Despicable Me 2," Despicable Me 2 was an okay sequel to its previously okay predecessor
","I remember partly enjoying the first Despicable Me movie. My problem with that one, though, was that I thought it was too cutesy to make the satire effective enough for me. With this version, I sorta expected the cuteness, especially with all those minions, so I wasn't as disappointed as I partly was with the first one. In this one, Gru is recruited to help the anti-villain league with outing a former villain in a mall. An agent named Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig) is picked as his partner. Oh, and his kids are trying to play matchmaker for him. I'll stop there and just say that while I did enjoy this sequel, I didn't find myself thinking it was hilariously funny. But I was amused enough with what I saw so on that note, Despicable Me 2 is worth a look if you like this sort of thing.",6,1,3,27 July 2013
The Avengers," The Avengers is a nearly excellent first movie featuring Marvel's Earth's Mightiest Heroes
","After waiting a couple weeks, I finally got to see The Avengers with my movie theatre-working friend. Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angel', and 'Firefly'), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her 'How I Met Your Mother' co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a 'Buffy' star, have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon. How I'd like to be a fly on that wall!",8,2,9,19 May 2012
Million Dollar Arm," Million Dollar Arm was quite entertaining as a true 'fish-out-of-water' sports story
","Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this true story of a sports agent's going to India to find a couple of potential baseball players to take to America. Jon Hamm plays the leading character with charm despite his not-too-subtle way of sometimes coming off as a jerk. The players picked to play the baseball athletes and English interpreter were also quite compelling. And I also liked Lake Bell as the border of Hamm's who might just win his heart and Alan Arkin as the retired talent scout who also teaches Hamm a thing or two. Oh, and Bill Paxton as the coach. And the whole India scenery also was fascinating to watch. So on that note, I highly recommend Million Dollar Arm.",8,2,3,3 June 2014
Angels & Demons," I had an adequate time watching Angels and Demons
","In the interest of full disclosure, I fell asleep during some of the more talky scenes in the beginning but I awoke enough when the first chase came on. So with that said, this probably wasn't one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year though it did get better as the movie went on. Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me. Still, it wasn't a bad time I spent with my friend who works at the theatre seeing this film it was playing especially since, once again, I got to watch for free...",6,3,5,25 May 2009
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 was a good teaser for what to expect in the next part
","I have to admit that when I watched the beginning of this one, I had to fight some sleep. But when Peeta realizes how much in danger Katniss is in, that's when I managed to really stay awake! Julianne Moore is a fine addition to the cast this time. There was a great sequence of Katniss trying to get her sister and her cat back in the building before the doors closed for good. And what happens at the end, wow! Let me also say that what I've seen of Philip Seymour Hoffman is fine. I hope his death didn't affect his scenes too much in both this and the second part due next year. It should be a very interesting ride, that's for sure! So on that note, I very much recommend The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.",8,12,39,23 November 2014
Black Swan," Natalie Portman certainly did a compelling enough job to earn all those awards for Black Swan
","Just watched this movie on a Netflix disc. It features Natalie Portman in her Oscar-winning performance as a ballerina who seems to be lost in her role as the Black Swan. Mila Kunis plays her rival...or is she? Barbara Hershey is her mother, Winona Ryder an aged ballerina who resents being cast aside, and Vincent Cassel as the teacher who can be pretty controlling but still inspirational. Director Darren Aronofsky provides such haunting images concerning the transformation of the Portman character that you wonder if she's truly mad before coming to a definite conclusion. I'd say this was quite a beautifully realized dream-like drama that holds on to you till the very end. So on that note, Black Swan comes highly recommended.",10,0,2,7 August 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is another enjoyable romp with Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz
","I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended.",7,9,13,24 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Seeing Josh Brolin playing a young Tommy Lee Jones to Will Smith is one of several highlights in Men in Black 3
","I've previously only seen parts of the original Men in Black and don't remember too much of Men in Black II. So it was that I went to watch the latest one with my movie theatre-working friend with not too much expectations. As a result, I thought it was mostly funny if not hilarious the whole way through. Still, it was pretty entertaining especially when Will Smith went back to 1969 to meet Tommy Lee Jones' character as a young man, here played by Josh Brolin in an uncanny impersonation (though both me and my friend also noticed a bit of George W. Bush there). There was also a fine villain portrayed by Jermaine Clement and a reasonably compellingly amusing future-seeing sidekick enacted by Michael Stuhlbarg. I also thought Emma Thompson's part as the new superior was also quite chuckle worthy. Really, all I'll say now is Men in Black 3 is well worth a look.",7,1,4,31 May 2012
Frost_Nixon," Frost/Nixon was entertaining depicting the interviews between these two
","So after years of only hearing or reading about this, I finally got to see this on Netflix disc with my mom who was also enthralled by this dramatized account of the behind-the-scenes saga of TV talk show host David Frost's interview of former president Richard Nixon. Michael Sheen as Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon-both reprising their stage roles-are very compelling as these real-life people. Frost is quite successful doing shows in England and Australia and thinks an interview with the disgraced president would lead to big numbers. Nixon just wants a chance to redeem himself when agreeing to this interview. Director Ron Howard really does a fine job of opening Peter Morgan's play cinematically with Morgan himself adapting it. Along with Sheen and Langella, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Bacon also do well in supporting roles. And when that interview reaches the climax, well, it's quite a revelation seeing both the president make that statement he does and his and Frost's reaction to it. In summary, Frost/Nixon is quite an entertaining take on such a historical event.",10,1,1,3 December 2015
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk was a way entertaining adaptation of the beloved Marvel character
","Having managed to miss Ang Lee's Hulk from 5 years ago, I watched this version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's green-skinned, gamma-radiated monster with an open mind. In a word: AWESOME! Nice recap of the origin during the opening credits before we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil having basically stayed calm for at least a year. That won't last long. There's also General Ross (William Hurt), Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who later becomes The Abomination, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who tries to cure Banner, and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)-the general's daughter who stands by Bruce through all his trials and tribulations. Great mixture of drama, suspense, and action as provided by director Louis Leterrier. Eagle-eyed viewers who've lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of Banner/Hulk: Bill Bixby in a television scene from his earlier series 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father', and Lou Ferrigno as a security guard who lets Norton in (He also says something as the Hulk in a later scene). And of course, Stan Lee puts in his Hitchcockian cameo! One more person I'd like to mention is Ty Burrell-late of the cancelled show 'Back to You'-playing a shrink who also gets involved with Betty. In short, The Incredible Hulk is another very worthy movie made from a Marvel Comics character. P.S. My first real encounter with the Hulk was from a comic book I got for my 9th birthday that had a 45 r.p.m. record attached from Power Records that provided the voices of the characters and narration in that book. The Abomination was the villain in that one.",9,5,8,16 June 2008
The Monuments Men," George Clooney's The Monuments Men was a good enough period drama for me
","Before I review the movie proper, some anachronisms: While there was a song called 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' in 1944 (Judy Garland introduced it in Meet Me in St. Louis), the words Ms. Garland sang then were a little different from what we know today. Like, instead of 'Hang a shining star upon the highest bough' which was the line introed by Frank Sinatra in his 1957 recording, the line should have been 'Until then, we'll have to muddle through sometime' which Judy sang in that movie I mentioned. Anyway, I very much enjoyed this dramatization of some art experts attempt to save as much of other countries' art from the Nazi regime as possible during World War II. Nice characterizations from Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, among others, and George Clooney who also did a nice job directing as well. Maybe there could have been a bit more drama in characterization but I was satisfied with what I got. There were some nice humorous scenes as well. So on that note, I recommend The Monuments Men.",7,11,17,16 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips was a good depiction of a recent real-life event that didn't take sides
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This is the one in which Tom Hanks portrays Captain Rich Phillips, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates in 2009. The narrative was quite absorbing and while my friend did clap a few times when some rescues of the main character was attempted, he did not feel the need to boo the pirates as if they were irredeemable bad guys. Neither did the rest of the audience so on that note, the film did a good job in presenting the areas of gray in the characterizations. I, myself, was simply intent in paying attention to how the whole thing was presented and managed to feel quite relieved when the end came though I wasn't too emotional when that happened though I did feel some, no doubt about that. Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Captain Phillips.",9,2,5,17 October 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Being a Wallflower has perhaps the most realistic touching of teen relationships depicted on film
","When one watches a movie about high school life, one doesn't always expect realism especially if the characters are nothing but stereotypes of jocks, cheerleaders, and nerds, or geeks, to use the more current term. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on a popular novel whose author also wrote the screenplay and directed the film, seems to accurately capture what it was like during the late '80s/early '90s to be offbeat and withdrawn and to still manage to have some fun despite troubles with family, social conventions, and the discovery of one's sexuality during the painful adolescent phase. The young people picked to play the main parts are all good at what they did here, but Emma Watson-previously best known as Hermione in the Harry Potter series-is really a standout as the troubled-but-determined Senior named Sam whose friendship with the lead Freshman character named Charlie (Logan Lerman) is perhaps the most touching of the relationships depicted here. I really loved the way things happened in this movie, so on that note, I highly recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower.",9,3,7,23 April 2013
Skyfall," Daniel Craig once again scores as James Bond in Skyfall while Judi Dench does a more dramatic M here
","Who would have thought that 50 years after initially beginning the film series with Dr. No, James Bond would continue on his 23rd in the official cannon with Skyfall? Daniel Craig is back for the third time in the role while Judi Dench is once again playing boss M for the seventh. It seems her career is on trial for some fatal mistakes during it and Ralph Fiennes looks to be taking over. But first, there's Javier Bardem as the latest villain to contend with. All I'll mention now is that while there's still some good action here, there's also some great drama concerning Bond and M and also a nice juicy part for veteran Albert Finney. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend Skyfall.",9,8,25,15 November 2012
The Hangover," The Hangover is perhaps the funniest movie of the year
","Well, I finally got to see the comedy sleeper of the summer: The Hangover. In this one, three groomsmen (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis) are looking for the about-to-be-wed friend (Justin Bartha) after an alcohol-induced bachelor party in Las Vegas. This leads to so many weird twists and turns that listing them here doesn't do them justice. Let's just say a certain boxer is involved as well as a tiger, a baby, and an accidental marriage of one of the groomsmen. Many lines and scenes are both cringe and laugh-inducing enough that I had a pretty good time throughout. By the way, I recommend you stay for some of the ending credit sequence. And I definitely recommend you watch this quite most hilarious and at times touching movie, The Hangover.",10,3,6,6 July 2009
Iron Man 3," Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow still make a pretty good team in Iron Man Three
","When I watched this third Iron Man movie with my movie theatre-working friend and his relatives, I had only previously seen the first one so it's possible I was partially confused by some of the characterizations that were portrayed in this entry in the series because of my not seeing the second one yet. Still, I did like many of the action scenes and some of the humor presented here as well as some of the twists concerning some villains and the fate of Pepper Potts. And Robert Downey Jr. is both intense and fun when playing the charismatic Tony Stark with Gwyneth Paltrow still bringing sparks as his loving partner, the aforementioned Ms. Potts. So on that note, I highly enjoyed watching Iron Man Three.",8,4,13,6 May 2013
It," This movie version of Stephen King's It really delivers the scares!
","Well, just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and I'll just now say: This is quite intense! Stephen King sure can pull the scares, right? The guy who played Pennywise the Clown is such a creepy presence throughout the movie. The loser kids who bond over this really did their parts well, didn't they? I especially like the one girl in the group, Beverly. All I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend It!",9,4,9,13 September 2017
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Panda is one of the best from Dreamworks Animation yet
","While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes (parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training), I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) was teaching Po (Jack Black). In fact, this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features. Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students: Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). The villain, Tai Lung (Ian McShane), was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years. Also of interest is Mr. Ping, Po's restaurateur father (James Hong), who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first. Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect (perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it). So on that note, this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did. P.S. I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie (which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here).",9,3,6,9 June 2008
Rocketman," Rocketman was a fine musical version of Elton John's life and career
","After finishing the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, director Dexter Fletcher then made this musical biopic of Elton John played here by Taron Egerton. And this is very much a musical as not only does Taron sing the famous songs written by Elton and Bernie Taupin but so do the other real-life figures in his life as if characters in a Broadway or movie musical. It's mostly a joyous celebration until John's drug and alcohol fueled excess takes its toll. But he recovered in a big way leading to...well, just watch Rocketman. It's that good!",10,4,8,18 June 2019
A Star Is Born," This version of A Star is Born does justice to both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. It's quite a fine remake of something done three times previous. I've only seen the previous two that Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand did. Lady Gaga does quite well in her acting scenes and, of course, her musical performances are aces. Bradley Cooper also sings well. His direction is also mostly excellent as is his acting. Also, nice supporting turns by Sam Elliott and Andrew Dice Clay. In summary, this version of A Star is Born is highly recommended by me and my friend!",9,5,9,1 November 2018
Gravity," Gravity was quite a treat of a movie about surviving in space when things go wrong
","Just watched this movie in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed it though my friend thought it was 'weird'. Yes, it's about two people in space who get into snafus while there but the images are beautiful, the acting by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are good, Alfonso Cuaron's direction is aces, and the story is suspenseful enough. Ms. Bullock is especially compelling enough for the time on screen when she's by herself not knowing if anyone can hear her when she's on headphones. Her character's monologue never gets boring as she's always addressing what she's going through and how she's coping with what she's dealing with at the moment. And seeing this in 3-D was quite a treat, that's for sure! So on that note, Gravity comes highly recommended.",9,3,8,8 October 2013
I'm Not There," Todd Haynes' I'm Not There. is a fascinating non-conventional look at Bob Dylan
","As a filmmaker, Todd Haynes certainly is an acquired taste. From the bootlegged doll movie bio of Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story to the '50s-style Far From Heaven, Haynes makes movies that conventional-watching audiences must find puzzling. And so it is with his portrait of Bob Dylan in his various phases of his life and music with countless actors playing him using different names each time. Of them, Cate Blanchett probably plays the most familiar one during Dylan's 'electric' period when audiences were booing him for changing his style from pure folk to rock and admirers like poet Allen Ginsberg (a spot-on performance by David Cross) hung around. Richard Gere represents the more fictional aspect of him during the time he played in Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid and seemed to channel the period as through a revisionist western. And then there's Heath Ledger playing him during the singer's domestic life and his arguments with his wife and her female friend about women's lib. Nothing really connects here until the climax at the end and when it's all over, you'll either really be relieved at such and want to go on to something else or want to watch it all over again and explore other things Dylan. I'm Not There. is certainly a unique way of looking at the life and times of one of the most important musical figures of the last century.",9,0,2,16 May 2008
The Birth of a Nation," D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation is still great in epic scope, but awful in promoting race relations
","All right, after previously seeing this on VHS cassette back in the '90s, since it's Black History Month, I decided to again watch this on YouTube. My verdict: It's quite awesome seeing various filming techniques either invented or improved by director D.W. Griffith, not to mention his risk in making such a long movie (remember, many films of the time were usually shorts of either 10 or 20-minute length). And during the first part before the intermission, one gets involved in the saga of the two families-the Stonemans of the North and the Camerons of the South. And the Civil War battle scenes retain their awesome power though more close-ups would've helped. By the second part, however, which emphasizes the exaggeration of the way various blacks and northern 'Carpetbaggers' ruined the Southern way of life and how the Ku Klux Klan 'saved' them, one can't help constantly rolling eyes at the racist way one views those exaggerations including noticing how many of those 'blacks' look obviously like Caucasions in burnt cork. I mean, how ridiculous does that scene with Walter Long-familiar to me because of his subsequent work as one of Laurel & Hardy's nemeses-as a buck named Gus chasing innocent Mae Marsh look now? And then there's the mulatto Silas Lynch character then going after another virginal heroine played by Lillian Gish. Oh, if you're willing to be manipulated, yeah, they're effective. But it's scenes like those that set back positive race relations back 50 years. As negative as those scenes are, they were probably a lightning rod for the NAACP to take action in taking positive steps in presentation of making their race look like a better round up of human beings for the most part. And because of the Klan's rejuvenation as a result of this film's success, the Civil Rights era of the '50s and '60s probably became possible because-having been used to being harassed constantly-African-Americans would eventually become effective with their non-violent methods not to mention making more intelligent arguments. So on that note, I recommend The Birth of a Nation with reservations. P.S. Looking at the cast list on Wikipedia, I found out one of the cast members was a woman named Madame Sul-Te-Wan. She's one African-American in this movie that would subsequently appear in other classics like the original King Kong and Carmen Jones.",5,0,2,11 February 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a worthy Star Wars prequel
","I read one good review of this movie and found out many online like it, so I let my movie theatre-working friend recommended me to watch it. He, himself, had seen it several times by the time I just watched it with him and he seemed to enjoy it once again as we were viewing this on the IMAX 3-D screen. It's basically a prequel to the original Star Wars-the one now called Episode IV: A New Hope-concerning characters not seen before which we find out at the end why. There are some familiar characters that do appear like the villain Darth Vader (once again voiced by James Earl Jones) and R2D2 and C3PO. There's also an appearance of Princess Leia as she originally appeared in that original Star Wars pic. I guess computer imagery really can make the impossible possible! Anyway, that's my recommendation to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. P.S. As I'm writing this, it's now the second day of Carrie Fisher's death. All I'll say now is-Rest in Peace, Princess Leia. P.P.S. I just found out her mother Debbie Reynolds has also passed not long after.",8,1,7,28 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel is another fine Marvel adventure
","After all the hype about this movie, I'll just say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed this one! Brie Larson stars as Vers though we later find out she's had amnesia and that her real name is Carol Danvers. She also finds out about where her loyalties should be when she regains some of her memories. There's plenty of good action concerning her and some of her friends. Also, Stan Lee makes one of his last cameos having passed away several months ago. As a result, the Marvel logo at the beginning has his other cameos over the years with the greeting, 'Thank you Stan' at the end of that. So on that note, we recommend Captain Marvel.",8,28,57,9 March 2019
Coraline," Coraline was an interesting, if not truly thrilling, suspenseful stop-motion animated film
","With Henry Selick as the director, you know, the man behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, I expected a special treat when I watched Coraline especially in 3-D. Don't get me wrong, I did like the images that were presented throughout the movie in the rare stop-motion animation style in an era where everything else that's animated is usually done by computer. And there were interesting characters that made one want to get involved for the whole picture. It's just that after a while, there seemed more style and not enough substance to really keep you involved in the story with your eyes and ears thinking awesome the whole time but your heart wondering if there could have been more to the characterizations. In fact, since this was based on a novel, I'm sure there were some cuts that had to be made to make a certain running time. But like I said, while there wasn't enough intensity to make this truly thrilling, Coroline still was pretty exciting at certain points and many young children watching this will not get bored when the climax comes. So on that note, I am recommending Coroline for animation buffs and anyone who doesn't mind if their under-12 children holds on to them for a while...",6,4,10,11 February 2009
This Is the End," If you don't mind a raunchy comedy with some Armageddon-like premise, This Is the End should be right up your alley
","Just watched this raunchy comedy about the apocalypse with many former cast members of the cult TV show 'Freaks and Geeks', many of whom would also work together on various movie comedies that turned out to be big hits. There's plenty that's funny here and I'm sure many scenes that would make one say 'OMFG' and possibly leave during that moment but, really, if you know what to expect and like this kind of 'anything goes'-type humor at its most disgusting with a mix of some religious discussion, This Is the End should be right up your alley. It certainly was up both mine and that of my movie theatre-working friend as we laughed almost non-stop throughout the whole thing what with all the surprise cameos that abound. So on that note, yes, This Is the End comes highly recommended!",8,4,20,14 June 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Forgetting Sarah Marshall was another entertaining Judd Apatow comedy
","Having been involved in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I think it's about time to call Judd Apatow the John Hughes of this generation. With a script by star Jason Segel and players like Jack McBrayer, Russell Brand, Apatow regulars Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and leading ladies Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis, Apatow has once again tapped into the public's taste for the raunchy and the romantic to a uniquely captivating effect. Seeing Segel's breakup with Bell while performing full-frontal was a bravely hilarious dare on his part. Seeing McBrayer's strained attempts at satisfying his newlywed other are some of plenty of other highlights for me. One of my favorite scenes comes near the end when we see the results of the 'Dracula' puppet musical Segal's character created that looked entertaining enough for me to want to see in real life! The heart, laughs, and the painfully realistic depictions of relationships as enacted here provide a wonderful mix that makes this one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen at the movies so far this year. So with all that said, I highly recommend Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",9,11,24,21 April 2008
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games is perhaps the first great movie of 2012!
","I have to confess that I've never heard of the book 'The Hunger Games' or that novel's author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn't been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public's attention, I probably wouldn't have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can't wait for the sequels when they come!",10,11,31,31 March 2012
Zootopia," Zootopia is another enjoyable Disney computer-animated movie
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this tale of a female rabbit wanting to became a cop and then growing up and becoming one in the title city. She's the first of her species to became one as other kinds of animals have been one before her but not a fox, though initially one isn't one yet here either. The fox she encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself. I'll just now say that this was quite a funny and inspirational Disney computer-animated movie with a nice message of anyone can be what they want to be if they work hard enough to reach that goal. So on that note, I highly recommend Zootopia.",8,13,26,4 March 2016
The Impossible," The Impossible was a truly well made drama about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami
","Just watched this movie on Netflix disc with my mom. This was a real intense movie about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami but ultimately touching story as well especially that of the oldest son and mother's sticking together during the whole ordeal. Naomi Watts truly deserved her Oscar nomination as that mom who suffers some pain but perseveres with the support of that son and eventually the whole family. There might have been some scenes that may have been a bit standoffish but, really, for the most part, this was a really well made drama with great performances by all involved and mostly well made direction as well. So on that note, I highly recommend The Impossible.",9,2,11,6 July 2013
42," 42 is a near-great depiction of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color line in baseball history
","A few years ago during Black History Month, I reviewed The Jackie Robinson Story which starred Robinson. I mentioned he wasn't much of an actor but his skill in baseball was the reason he was used, anyway, so that made it worth seeing. So now we have another depiction of his major league career as portrayed by Chadwick Boseman and, man, he gets to portray his anger after getting some really appalling comments from a manager of the Pirates team (Alan Tudyk, in a really brave performance). But we also see Robinson get some support from his wife, Rachel (Nicole Beharie), a fellow African-American reporting on him named Wendell Smith (Andre Holland), and especially, Brooklyn Dodgers head Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford). In fact, the most touching part was when Rickey mentions something in his past that made him pick someone like Jackie for his team. So for every awful depiction of racism, there's a just as inspirational depiction of strength among his team of overcoming those odds. So on that note, I highly recommend 42.",9,37,48,18 April 2013
Argo," Argo is a worthy drama of the events of the rescue of some Americans during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-80
","The movie's title is the title of the script for a 'proposed' film that Agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) suggests as a cover for a rescue mission concerning six Americans held as guests with some Canadian representatives in Iran in order to avoid capture by the Iranian terrorists during the hostage crises of 1979-80. It's presented like a real '70s film in a documentary-like style that takes its time in getting to the climax. Certainly having such worthy support from John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston contributes immensely to the compelling drama of the situation and Affleck's direction doesn't seem false in presenting the way things happened during that tense time though I'm sure some liberties were taken. So on that note, Argo is recommended as a historical docudrama. P.S. Loved seeing many of the vintage news footage including one from ABC saying a late night rerun of 'The Love Boat' will be delayed for 15 minutes for Ted Koppel's report on the latest Iranian development. That would eventually become 'Nightline'. Oh, and this was the second time I watched a movie with the '70s version of the Warner Bros. logo presented this year. The first time was on Magic Mike.",8,11,19,1 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was an adequate experience as a first-time viewer
","Okay, so I just finished watching this first Pirates of the Caribbean movie on ABC which means that there might have been some edits for either content or time constraints in the three hour slot. Nevertheless, I was a little entertained by some of the fight sequences and many of the lines and attitude of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character. I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey, he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush are also adequate here so this movie was a little enjoyable to me though I couldn't completely connect the disparate sequences that seemed to meander throughout. Still, like I said, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was pretty enjoyable so maybe I'll watch this again someday...",5,1,5,29 December 2008
Stripes," Bill Murray's Stripes can still be pretty entertaining to me after all these years
","Having just reviewed the first three movies that was co-written by Harold Ramis, not to mention the first three of his that also starred at least one SNL cast member-former or present at the time-we're now at his fourth of both categories and also his first in which he also appears. As with the previous two-Meatballs and Caddyshack-Stripes also stars Bill Murray. Also, as with Meatballs, Ramis' co-writers here are Len Blum and Dan Goldberg with Ivan Reitman once again directing. They make a good team here, Murray and Ramis, as they end up joining the Army mainly because of the former's bad luck in his last two hours as a civilian. Among the people they encounter in basic training: Judge Reinhold and John Candy who was familiar with both Bill and Harold since they all worked for Second City during the '70s while Candy and Ramis were on SCTV together as well. Anyway, they have a tough sergeant in Warren Oates who provides at least one serious scene with Murray when he tells him what he really thinks of him. But there's also John Larroquette as a bumbling captain who's threatened with Artic duty if he doesn't shape up. Oh, and besides Ramis and Candy, other Second City/SCTV members in this movie include Dave Thomas as a mud wrestling host and Joe Flaherty as a Russian guard. And finally, Ramis and Murray fall for a couple of female MP's played by Sean Young and P. J. Soles, respectively. Okay, with all that out of the way, I'll just say that I found Stripes hilarious up to the graduation and not as much after that but still pretty entertaining. Now, despite that earlier confrontation scene between Murray and Oates, one doesn't really expect too much learning about Army life on the former's part but part of me did feel he genuinely respected the sergeant and vice versa at the end. One more thing, while you can no longer be asked if you're a homosexual when applying for the military because of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', I still found it hilarious hearing Bill and Harold's replies. Okay, so on that note, I definitely recommend Stripes. And, remember, 'There she was just a-walkin' down the street singing 'Doo Wah Diddy Diddy Dumb Diddy Doo...' P.S. Larroquette is a native of New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, La. And his assistant is played by John Volstad who is best known as one of the Darryls on 'Newhart' and unlike there, he has lines here which was interesting to hear. Update 7/2/10: I've just seen the extended version with 18 minutes of cut footage. There's a funny scene of Bill and Harold ending up in another country when they go AWOL. There's also a sexily funny one of them with P.J. and Sean in Germany. Those I wished had stayed. The others I'm glad they cut.",7,0,0,30 June 2010
Beauty and the Beast," Disney's Beauty and the Beast is still the most enchanted of their animated fairy tales
","Just rewatched Beauty and the Beast with my movie theatre-working friend at where he works. This was actually my first time seeing it on the big screen and in 3-D, to boot! What can I say except after 20 years, it's still one of the most wonderful of the animated Disney fairy tales to be depicted in movies. No wonder it was the first of its kind to be nominated an Oscar for Best Picture. And the songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman like 'Belle', 'Be Our Guest', and the title song were also worthy of the nominations with the last one deserving of the win. And those voices, ah, what voices! I mean, Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts) just make the picture perfect with their line readings and singing. The last one, especially, when singing the already mentioned title song which would also be lovingly rendered by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson during the end credits. Really, all I'll say now is Beauty and the Beast gets a very high recommendation from me. P.S. I also loved the dedication at the very end 'To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)'.",10,6,7,31 January 2012
Ted," Seth MacFarlane's Ted is quite both raunchy and a little touching
","So I finally watched this movie Ted with my movie theatre-working friend today. I knew from the previews that the title character was a walking, talking, pot-smoking, sexually active, stuffed teddy bear who's been best friends with Mark Wahlberg for about much of his life. What I didn't know was the references to various '80s icons like that scene from Airplane! that spoofed Saturday Night Fever that was reenacted here, or that Sam Jones from Flash Gordon (Mark and Ted's favorite movie and it's one I liked enough to see twice back in the day) would appear as himself here partially acting like his character but possibly knowing he's not really that character. I found much of the raunchy stuff involving Ted (voiced by director/co-writer Seth MacFarlane) funny and when things threaten to take a dark and sad turn, I was a little touched, too. I got most of the references though I didn't find it all funny. Still, I was entertained enough to find the whole thing quite enjoyable. So on that note, Ted gets a recommendation from me. Oh, and that scene when Norah Jones communicates with Ted was also good for some laughs...",8,1,6,26 July 2012
Knives Out," Knives Out is a fine modern murder mystery
","So me and Mom finally watched this movie a few weeks after I found it on Amazon Prime Video. It's a pretty fun mystery with Daniel Craig as the investigating detective, Chris Evans as one of the family suspects, and Ana de Armas as the domestic who helps guide Craig in the solving. Oh, and I also liked Christopher Plummer as the family patriarch. So on that note, Mom and I highly recommend Knives Out.",9,1,2,1 July 2020
The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a fine epic tale starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci
","After months of only knowing about this Martin Scorsese picture, I finally watched this on Netflix. It's quite a compelling tale about an aging hitman's (Robert De Niro) telling of his association with a mafia boss (Joe Pesci) and Teamsters Union head Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The movie is a little more than three hours so it takes it's own time in going over several decades of the narrative. In doing so, it also uses new technology when depicting those three actors being much younger and older. Quite convincing, those aging and de-aging processes are. I'll just now say The Irishman is another fine film from Scorsese and company.",10,1,2,24 June 2020
Black Book," Paul Verhoeven's Zwartboek, or Black Book, is excellent
","Paul Verhoeven's Zwartboek, or its English title Black Book, was the second movie (the first was Year of the Dog) I saw at the about-to-close Regal Entertainment Group's (previously United Artists') Siegen Village 10 Theatre in Baton Rouge, La., on its last day of operations of June 7, 2007. I picked its final showing of 6:30pm which had an attendance of maybe about 15 or so. Verhoeven co-wrote and directed a very compelling film about a woman named Rachel (Carice van Houten) who survives the Nazis during World War II in Holland by her connections, personality, and, most of all, her sexuality. van Houten's performance brings such a variety of emotions and intellect to her character that I cried and cheered with her all the way for her safety as well as those of other characters she cared about. Verhoeven brings such great drama and action in every scene that one never gets bored. If you know the director mainly for his American movies like RoboCop, Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, or, most notoriously, Showgirls, Black Book will be a total revelation to you. It certainly was for me!",10,2,3,7 June 2007
"I Love You, Man"," I Love You, Man was a reasonably amusing comedy for me
","Let me admit up front right now that during some of the middle section of this movie, I partly fell asleep. So it's possible I felt a little underwhelmed watching I Love You, Man. That said, while I felt some of the scenes might have been underplayed and the pace wasn't as up as I'd like it to be, there were plenty of funny lines and scenes that I got reasonably entertained during most of what I managed to see. Stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are perfect together as a groom and his potential best man so they alone make the movie worth seeing. It's just that not enough seemed to be done to make the rest of the cast like Andy Samberg, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, Jaime Pressly, and Jon Favreau really stand out though each have their moments. And leading lady Rashida Jones does well with what she has. So on that cautious note, I Love You, Man is at least worth a look.",6,0,6,24 March 2009
Finding Nemo," Watching Finding Nemo again in 3-D after nine years felt like a new experience all over again which I liked very much
","So nine years after first enjoying this at theatres, I decided to watch this again in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. I was astounded to find out how much I forgot since that first time so I was mostly experiencing this as if I hadn't seen this before which made for a wonderfully touching, thrilling, and, of course, very funny time for both me and my friend. So hearing Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres as Marlin and Dory brought plenty of laughter from me especially from the latter. And seeing their adventures in looking for Marlin's son Nemo was even more pleasurable when we find out who all three main players encounter. Really, all I'll say now is if you like seeing classic movies on the big screen, I highly recommend you once again watch Finding Nemo at your neighborhood movie house right now!",10,0,1,21 September 2012
Superbad," Superbad is an uneven teen-sex comedy that still entertains
","After about a month of playing theatres, I finally got to see Superbad with my friend after seeing the other movies that had come out that we wanted to see. My friend liked it though he thought it had too much profanity. I didn't have a problem with the language but I did think the funny stuff came in little doses between several scenes that dragged. I liked the performances of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Chris Mintz-Plasse as the high school seniors trying to get laid two weeks before graduation as well as the slacker cops played by Bill Hader and the movie's co-writer Seth Rogen. But their performances weren't enough to make this a hilariously funny movie like I usually expect from producer Judd Apatow who had no hand in writing this movie like he had in his previously very funny directorial outings, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Still, despite its unevenness, Superbad does get points for making the main characters' growing pains seem real and for getting the potential girlfriends of Hill and Cera not seem like such sluts...",6,7,17,21 September 2007
Creed," Creed is the latest worthy entry in Sylvester Stallone's Rocky series
","My movie theatre-working friend had wanted to watch this since it premiered two weeks ago so he finally got to see it with me just a couple of hours ago. We both very much liked it-he probably more than me as he was more into the fights as I was just observing the way they were staged and managed to be impressed by them as opposed to cheering like my friend was doing. Michael B. Jordan was impressive as the son of Rocky's late opponent/trainer Apollo Creed shown in flashbacks when played by Carl Weathers. And, yes, Sylvester Stallone is fine as Rocky Balboa-now very much an old man resigned to just running his restaurant and later finding out he's suffering from lymphoma cancer-a disease my friend told me his late father suffered from. As you can tell from that, there are both some exciting fight scenes and good drama abounding in this film. And what's a Rocky movie without some of Bill Conti's score from the original one occasionally playing here? Conti, by the way, was a graduate of LSU which is where both my brother and sister attended with the latter graduating from there. In summary, Creed was a worthy entry in the series created by Stallone.",8,3,6,5 December 2015
Rise of the Guardians," Though this wasn't my first choice to watch, I highly enjoyed Rise of the Guardians
","Though I'm an animation fan, I wasn't all intent on seeing this movie until a few weeks into December but my movie theatre-working friend had some time off after 5 today and wanted to see something soon after that since he wanted to be home in time for tonight's Saints game against the Atlanta Falcons (I left his house after half time when New Orleans was beaten 17-7). Anyway, I loved this take on the holiday characters with Santa (or North as he's referred here) is depicted as Russian and the Easter Bunny is Austrailian with an attitude (he's the only one I recognized by voice as Hugh Jackman was so familiar to me). And the way the Jack Frost character was initially reluctant before eventually agreeing to join was well handled. Nice mixture of laughs, scariness, and sentiment throughout and me and my friend both highly enjoyed it. So on that note, yes, that's a recommendation of Rise of the Guardians. P.S. It's now a few hours later and I just found out the final score was 23-13, Atlanta.",9,2,4,29 November 2012
Spotlight," Spotlight was an excellent chronicle of the thorough research of the Catholic priests' molestation scandals
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, this Oscar-winning Best Picture that was quite a compelling account of the reporting of various Catholic priests' molesting children over many years. He had seen it before and didn't mind going again while I was just experiencing this for the first time. No graphic scenes but many of the victims didn't mince words when describing what happened to them at such young ages so I either covered my mouth or hit the chair, not too hard, when those were revealed. Visually, this probably wasn't as impressive as another Best Picture nominee-The Revenant, for instance-but it was riveting enough dramatically, otherwise, for me and perhaps for my friend, as well. So on that note, I highly recommend Spotlight.",10,1,1,2 March 2016
Aquaman," Aquaman was quite a thrilling DC superhero movie!
","I first knew of Aquaman as a kid of the '70s when watching him in the animated series 'Superfriends' when he was teamed with his more-established mates of Superman, Wonder Woman, and the team of Batman & Robin. There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he's very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it's also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here. In summary, Aquaman has such a fine story and great action set pieces, that I heartily recommend it!",8,6,11,17 January 2019
500 Days of Summer," (500) Days of Summer was a nice surprise of a summer relationship movie
","Today, I watched this indie rom-com with my sister before she goes back to her home in Maryland and my best friend who works at this movie theatre showing this film which as a result we all got to see for free. My theatre friend thought it was just okay while my sister loved it while I mostly liked it. There's plenty of amusing scenes between the leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel not to mention many heartbreaking ones too. One of the most entertaining ones was the Hall and Oates 'You Make My Dreams' number that Gordon-Levitt and others dance to with an animated bird that surprised me. Part of me thought Joseph's conversations with that little girl was a bit pretentious. Still, the back and forth of many sequences and the way things end up is enough for me to recommend (500) Days of Summer. P.S. Once again, it's nice to see Clark Gregg outside of his regular role in 'The New Adventures of Old Christine'.",8,0,4,12 August 2009
Juno," Juno is a mostly enjoyable comedy about teen pregnancy and its aftermath
","I just saw this movie with my parents. My dad complained about the title character's lines saying they're more likely to come from an adult than from an actual teenager. My mom just seemed to like the wittiness of the whole movie. During much of the beginning, I was ready to agree how overrated and pretentious some of this movie was based on reading many of the comments I've scanned through here. But while not every pop-culture reference was funny and I half wondered how many viewers would get the comparisons of Dario Agento to Herschell Gordon Lewis (with a scene from one of his movies, to boot!), I was enthralled by the various relationships between the characters and actors and the way they mainly flowed under Jason Reitman's direction of Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning screenplay. While Ellen Page also deserved her Academy Award nom as Best Actress, the most compelling performances to me were the potential adoptive parents played by Jason Bateman and especially Jennifer Garner. As an 'Arrested Development' fan, it's also a little strange seeing Bateman and his TV son Michael Cera here and yet since they're not related in this film, they don't have any scenes together. But that's not too much distraction to me. Add in J. K. Simmons as Juno's father and Allison Janney as her stepmother and this movie is nearly perfect. There's also an amusing turn by Rainn Wilson in the beginning. While perhaps not a great lesson on pregnancy and its choices, Juno does manage to consider there are such choices. All considered, this movie is mostly enjoyable enough that I may consider seeing it again sometime soon.",8,2,4,19 June 2008
Concussion," Concussion is a worthy drama about why some NFL players suffer from some mental problems
","Just watched this 'Based on a True Story' drama with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were enthralled by this story of Will Smith's Nigerian doctor finding out about a former NFL football player's death after suffering a concussion of the head and his later attempts to analyze similar fatalities of other deaths involving football players. Alec Baldwin plays another doctor who was also once a football player who sympathizes with Will's plight especially when the organization tries to put a stop to it all. We also get a little look at Will's character's off-duty life with a woman who's living with him and who's also from his country. Maybe there could have been some improvements, drama-wise. Still, Concussion is worth a look for anyone wanting to learn why not more is done to make sure many of these players are protected from constant injuries when on the field.",7,4,9,26 December 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At World's End was a pretty enjoyable POTC film despite having missed the first two
","Having just seen Knocked Up and Waitress in another theatre earlier in the day, a friend called me up about 15 minutes later at home and proposed seeing one with him. We went back and forth over some titles when he reluctantly picked Knocked Up (he thought I was at work earlier and I didn't tell him I watched some movies and one of his choices, Delta Farce, was in another theatre that wasn't near him). When we arrived at his neighborhood cinema, however, I asked if he enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End the night before with his nephew. He said he did and asked if I was willing to switch to that. I did since I didn't want to see KU again so soon. Now, having not seen the previous two installments and having fallen asleep during some of the movie, I was a little confused at what was going on but by the fight scenes in the final 15 or so minutes, I was genuinely thrilled by many of the action set pieces. As the new pirate king, Keira Knightly delivered a very rousing speech to her new crew. Orlando Bloom certainly proved very sexy and romantic next to her. Seeing multiple Johnny Depps and having a dialogue with his father (and his character's inspiration) Keith Richards provided some of the movie's many amusing moments. I may now have to see the first two POTC films and this one again to really understand what was going on but I must say, I still didn't have a bad time watching this one.",5,0,1,2 June 2007
Don Jon," Don Jon was an interesting movie for me concerning the way some men and women look at sex and relationships
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his grown nephew. Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed, and stars as the title character, someone who gets any woman he wants when going to clubs with friends but gets unsatisfied compared to the porn images he looks up on his computer while getting off. Since he's Catholic, he also confesses to a priest every week for these transgressions and does his penance while lifting weights. When he meets Scarlett Johansson, she doesn't take to him right away so he tries harder with her. She seems to want to change him or at least wants him a certain way based on the romantic movies they go to which he doesn't like but holds his tongue concerning those. It's at night school, which the Scarlett character suggested to him, that he meets another woman played by Julianne Moore who might also change him, perhaps for the better. I'll stop there and just say that while I was fascinated by the repetition of certain scenes in order to get the gradual humor that results when those scenes start changing routines-like especially during the climatic family dinner table scene involving dad Tony Danza, mom Glenne Headley, and sis Brie Larson-it's when things take a more dramatic turn that things get really interesting. Like those concerning the Moore character. So on that note, Don Jon is worth a look if you're interested in the mature subject matter.",7,6,9,29 September 2013
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 was just as good as its predecessor
","So me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this today and like the previous Deadpool, we both highly enjoyed this one as well! There's a tragedy at the beginning but things pick considerably after that. As before, the leading character breaks the fourth wall in his narration and onscreen and other stuff referring to other superhero movies make this quite funny most of the time. Also, we once again see some of the X-Men characters from the previous one appearing to help Deadpool whether he wants it or not as well as some new ones who also are welcome additions. So that's a high recommendation of Deadpool 2 from both of us!",8,6,13,31 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3 is the first very good movie of the summer season
","I just saw Spider-Man 3 with my friend and while I can see why some critics have complained about some of the length and subplots, for the most part I enjoyed it. Certainly it was nice to see Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco together again as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborne. I also liked Thomas Haden Church as The Sandman and Topher Grace as, first, Peter's Bugle photo rival Eddie Brock and then the black Spidey costume-dominated Venom. Hilarious scenes of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as a French waiter who greets Peter. Nice turns from Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May and Mageina Tovah as Ursala, the landlord's daughter (I first noticed her as Luke Giradi's first girlfriend, Glynis Figliola, on Joan of Arcadia). Also nice additions of James Cromwell as Captain Stacy and Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard as his daughter Gwen. And Spidey creator Stan Lee says something to Maguire that seems very poignant here. All this and some of the most thrilling scenes provided by Sam Raimi make this one of the most exciting movies of this young summer season. In other words, don't hesitate, just watch it!",9,2,10,8 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor: Ragnarok was another awesome ride in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
","All right, I've just seen Thor:Ragnarok with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it before and liked it and here's my verdict: It's awesome! I mean, the story of Thor and brother Loki and their just-revealed sister is aces plus the possibility of their losing their home planet of Asgard plus some other people and not to mention the return of a certain green-skinned creature...So that's a high recommendation of Thor: Ragnarok! Oh, and dig another cameo by a creator of these heroes...",8,1,6,15 November 2017
Zodiac," Zodiac was an excellent drama about the search for a real-life serial killer
","When my dad decided to watch Zodiac, he asked if I wanted to join him. I agreed to even though the movie was 162 min. I was so enthralled I didn't care about the length after a while. Director David Fincher provides the most compelling drama of this real-life serial killer despite most of the scenes leading to several false leads and one man's complete obsession to get the right man. Jake Gyllenhaal is that obsessed man, a cartoonist named Robert Graysmith whose Eagle Scout demeanor leads to his determination of finding what makes this killer tick to the point of following reporter Paul Avery's (Robert Downey, Jr.) files and later browbeating police inspector David Toschi's (Mark Ruffalo) time. This then leads to a strained marriage with Melanie (Chloe Sevigny). Also of note are performances of Anthony Edwards (Inspector William Armstrong), John Caroll Lynch (suspect Arthur Leigh Allen), Brian Cox (lawyer Melvin Belli), Richmond Arquette, Bob Stephenson, and John Lacey (other Zodiac killer suspects). The whole thing just enthralled me from beginning to end and I especially was on the edge of my seat when Graysmith visited this man's house who used to work at a theatre where a Zodiac suspect was a projectionist. So on that note, I highly recommend David Fincher's Zodiac.",10,1,3,1 September 2008
Milk," Milk was an educational and entertaining look at the slain San Francisco Supervisor
","My friend (who is gay) and I came into this movie knowing not too much about Harvey Milk other than his assassination and his activist stance and came out learning much more about his lifestyle and the reasons why he did what he did. Director Gus Van Sant and actor Sean Penn bring this movie about the San Francisco Supervisor to life with humor and much admiration of how he kept going with his beliefs despite some death threats and a couple of troubled relationships (as depicted with James Franco and Diego Luna). Also compelling were documentary footage of singer Anita Bryant and her constant fight against what she implied were threats against the children of the world among others. It was also refreshing to hear that even Ronald Reagan was with Jerry Brown and Jimmy Carter against Proposition 6. So all I need to say is if you want to see something both dramatically compelling and educational too, I highly recommend Milk.",10,4,9,18 December 2008
The Prestige," The Prestige was interesting if maybe a little slow to wade through
","When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5.",5,3,9,19 November 2006
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight was another entertaining Quentin Tarantino movie
","I've yet to see Reservoir Dogs but I've seen just most every other Quentin Tarantino movie after that so I wasn't surprised by the kind of dialogue he wrote, nor the way he arranges some scenes out of sequence. I was surprised to hear mostly original music by Ennio Morricone (which just won him a Golden Globe which Tarantino accepted). Some familiar players-Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson-abound. One not normally in a Tarantino flick-Jennifer Jason Leigh-really tears into her part here. The only other movie she was in I watched all the way through was Fast Times at Ridgemont High when I was a teen so this latest of hers really impressed me and I now wished she had won the Globe as well! The expected violence was pretty entertainingly weird which was how my movie theatre-working friend described it when it was nearly over, at least that's what I was thinking when he said weird during that and then told a fellow employee he enjoyed it when asked! Anyway, that's a high recommendation for The Hateful Eight. Note: This review is of the general release version which is not in 70mm and has no intermission, therefore some cuts. Oh, and there's a mention of my current hometown of Baton Rouge in this but not in a good way...",8,5,16,13 January 2016
Dear John," Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' Dear John was a very compelling drama to me
","Just watched this touching drama based on Nicholas Sparks' novel with my movie theatre working friend this afternoon. While I haven't previously seen any movies based on his other books, nor any of director Lasse Hallstrom's other films (other than segments of ABBA videos shown on 'The Midnight Special'), I knew they both had a reputation of doing quiet dramas based on believable situations and characterizations. So I was looking forward to this tale of an Army man named John (Channing Tatum) falling for a college girl named Savannah (Amanda Seyfried). There were also some compelling supporting characters in John's father (Richard Jenkins) and a neighbor friend of Savannah's named Tim (Henry Thomas, who can still deliver years after his breakthrough as Elliott in E.T.). Now, I've only just found out about the changes from the novel but while watching the movie I was emotionally enthralled by the whole thing and, for the most part, I was satisfied by what I saw. Also, how cool was it to see Ms. Seyfried sing and play guitar to her own composition here especially after her recent stint in Mamma Mia! And how dramatic were those battle scenes not to mention the fate of John's father. So for all that, Dear John comes highly recommend.",9,10,16,10 March 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Steven Spielberg does justice to Herge's creation with The Adventures of Tintin
","When I was a kid during the late '70s, I was familiar with a magazine called 'Children's Digest'. During that time, the publication had inside its monthly pages a serialized comic that featured a boyish hero named Tintin of which the first I had read was the middle part of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. That story would continue the following year as 'Red Rackham's Treasure' of which I managed to read all the way through. And so it is about four decades later that having remembered those adventures, I decided to go with my movie theatre-working friend to watch Steven Spielberg's motion capture version of this adaptation of Belgian cartoonist Herge's creation. It had the great sense of humor and entertaining action sequences one would expect from the director of the Indiana Jones spectacles and while the last action set-piece may have been one too many, it wasn't a complete waste of time. And seeing characters like Tintin, his dog Snowy, Captain Haddock, and the comic relief detectives of Thompson and Thomson brought a big smile to my face in the way they were depicted. Also kudos to frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams for providing another entertaining music score (though it's not as memorable as his classic ones for Jaws, the original '77 Star Wars, E.T., and the aforementioned Raiders, that's for sure). Really, Spielberg's done it again! So on that note, The Adventures of Tintin is highly recommended.",7,2,3,31 December 2011
Moana," Moana was another entertaining Disney computer-animated feature
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who hadn't previously seen it, either. It's the tale of a determined young woman who's trying to resurrect her island with the help of a jewel and a god-like man named Maui. There's also a bunch of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda provided to give credence to the characterizations. Possibly the Frozen success of Disney's previously computer-animated feature was a factor here. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is the voice of Maui and he's funny and quite good with his one song. The title heroine is quite plucky and charismatic. It's possible I might have been partly confused by some of the narrative but still, this was quite entertaining in the usual Disney way. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Moana.",8,1,10,30 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man: Homecoming is another worthy entry in yet another reboot of the movie series
","With this entry, Spider-Man is once again rebooted. No origin story this time which is as well since anyone knows how he came to be if they read the comics or at least Wikipedia. Tom Holland is suitably youngish being the high school student Peter Parker originally was and remained for a while during his creation. Nice splashes of humor throughout during even some of the more serious scenes. Awesome seeing Michael Keaton-former Batman portrayer-playing a main villain this time in a superhero movie. Oh, and yes, Stan Lee makes another of his cameos in a MCU movie! Also, there's a scene after the main closing credits and another one after the final end of them. In summary, Spider-Man: Homecoming is worth it to watch for die-hard fans!",8,2,6,12 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Stranglove...can still provide entertainment and intelligence in good measure
","This is my second time watching this classic dark comedy directed by Stanley Kubrick and I must say, it's even funnier than I remembered it. I mean, there's Peter Sellers as an RAF captain named Mandrake, as President Merkin Muffley, and in the title role. He's a little amusing as the first character, quite funny in a deadpan way as the second, and hilarious as the third whenever his hand goes up or he tries to stop from that happening. As General Buck Turgidson, George C. Scott steals his scenes every time he goes on a tangent or when he's talking on the phone with his secretary (Tracy Reed) whom he beds. There's also Sterling Hayden as General Jack Ripper who keeps talking about 'fluids' as if they're the most valuable thing who's both funny and frightening in his attitude. And then there's Slim Pickens as Major Kong whose most defining moment was when he took a ride on that bomb as if he was on a bull in a rodeo! I also was highly amused by Keenan Wynn's role as Colonel Bat Guano especially his line about the Coca-Coca company to Mandrake. And while there was nothing funny about James Earl Jones-in his film debut role-as one of Kong's men on the plane, I did think how amusing it was that his voice would later become the one that became Darth Vader on the Star Wars series. Of course, the accidental possible start of a nuclear war was-and still is-nothing to laugh at. But the way many of these characters talk and react to the possibility of it happening is hilarious in the way some think it's no big deal while others do think so but in the way they think of as celebratory. Stanley Kubrick gave plenty worth to laugh about while also making you think just how dangerous some people in power can get. So on that note, Dr. Strangelove...still can make one think while also still be quite entertaining. P.S. One of the writers, Terry Southern, was later on the staff of 'Saturday Night Live' during the 1981-82 season and wrote a sketch about Dr. Strangelove (Tim Kazurinsky there) conferring with President Reagan (Joe Piscopo's voice since the entire sketch was presented on his point of view shot) on the same thing Sellers' Strangelove did to Muffley here. I thought it was funny enough for me.",10,2,5,12 August 2012
The Expendables," Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables provides great dumb fun action!
","While I wasn't a die-hard '80s action movie fan during that decade, for some reason I was just dying to watch this new Sylvester Stallone action film especially for two other big stars of that genre and decade making cameo appearances alongside him for the first time here. The banter between those three are quite hilarious especially about the one who's currently running a certain state. Anyway, while there's something of a compelling story, it's mainly the action sequences that one is hungry for and while it does go a bit over-the-top at the end, it delivers non-stop thrills in spades! And what a fine supporting cast that's provided for here: Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Crews, 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin (check the fight he has with Stallone), Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts (how ironic he's in a movie that's opening opposite his sister Julia's more softer drama Eat Pray Love), Dolph Lundgren (remember him as Drago in Stallone's Rocky IV?), David Zayas as General Garza, and Giselle Itie as his daughter Sandra. I think I've said enough so I'll just say that I highly recommend The Expendables for a great turn-off-your-brain fun!",8,3,16,14 August 2010
Knocked Up," Knocked Up is another hilariously real Judd Apatow comedy
","Having been a fan of Judd Apatow since 'Freaks and Geeks', I wanted to see Knocked Up since I saw the preview a few weeks ago. Boy, am I glad I did! Seth Rogen, one of Apatow's stock actors from nearly all his projects, does nicely in the leading role of a slacker who meets a beautiful woman (Katherine Heigl) at a dance club one night which leads to a one-night-stand which leads to...Anyway, most of the familiar cast from 'F & G' and 'Undeclared' lend fine support here along with Harold Ramis as Rogen's dad, Joanna Kerns as Heigl's mom, and Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife) as Heigl's sister. There's also a hilarious cameo of the host of the Most Popular Television Show Right Now. I think you know what I'm talking about. And for SNL fans, there's Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There may be some uncomfortable scenes in between but that just makes this more satisfying when the happy ending inevitably occurs. In fact, I'd say Knocked Up is one of the few adult comedies out that is worth seeing right now. So what are you waiting for? Just watch!",9,1,6,2 June 2007
Megamind," Megamind with the voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Brad Pitt is a wonderful parody of the superhero genre
","On the day of its premiere, my movie theatre-working friend and I decided to watch computer-animated Megamind this afternoon. The story seems to be another Superman parody/tribute as we see the origins of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and the title character (Will Ferrell). Then when they've grown into the hero/villain they become, a reporter named Roxanne (Tina Fey) gets mixed in. But after that, many twists and turns come that take many humorous and even touching scenes entertainingly through a, what seems, a naturally organic plane. And they mostly seem to earn every highly amused and heartfelt emotion I got out of it all. And watching all those action scenes in 3-D added immensely to the experience. Kudos to all for a such wonderful experience provided to my friend and I. So yes, I highly recommend Megamind.",8,3,9,5 November 2010
The Book Thief," The Book Thief was a very compellingly told historical fictional tale of one girl's experience during World War II in Germany
","Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. We both were touched by the tale of a young girl in Germany named Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) who's sent to live with foster parents (Emily Watson, Geoffrey Rush) at the outbreak of Nazism and World War II. She is befriended by schoolmate Rudy (Nico Liersch) and a border hiding in her foster parents' basement named Max (Ben Schnetzer). Quite a dramatically compelling fictional tale concerning real-life happenings during the timeline of the narrative depicted here. So beautifully sad and yet also inspirational concerning the girl's survival instinct of constantly reading, telling tales, and dealing with the tragedies of her life. So on that note, I highly recommend The Book Thief.",10,0,2,7 December 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton's Sweeney Todd with Depp is an excellent adaptation indeed
","A few years ago, I watched on VHS the television version of the Broadway musical Sweeney Todd with Angela Lansbury and the Emmy-winning performance of George Hearn. I enjoyed it very much so I was psyched to see the movie version starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton. Despite, or maybe because of the deletion of many of the chorus segments, I thought this was an excellent version of the bloody Stephen Sondheim horror musical. Depp brings a David Bowie-quality to his singing in the title role. Helena Bonham Carter brings a creepily romantic vibe in her role of Mrs. Lovett, Todd's accomplice. Alan Rickman brings a crafty charisma to Judge Turpin. Timothy Spall, who I had just seen in Enchanted, brings a droll goofiness as Beadle Bamford. And Sacha Baron Cohen makes a humorously insolent Signor Adolfo Pirelli. Also compelling are Jamie Campbell Bower as the sailor who accompanies Todd back to England, Jayne Wisener as Todd's grown daughter-Johanna-who Anthony the sailor is smitten with and she in return, Laura Michelle Kelly as a beggar woman with a secret, and Ed Sanders as Toby-Pirelli's and, eventually, Mrs. Lovett's boy servant. Most of them provide compelling singing voices. Kudos to the Golden Globes for awarding the Best Actor-Comedy or Musical-statue to Mr. Depp (too bad, because of the writer's strike, he couldn't accept it in person). And congratulations to Mr. Burton for providing such an excellent movie of this most entertaining Stephen Sondheim horror musical.",10,4,7,17 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Blades of Glory is an amusing, at best, comedy
","My friend was very excited to see this movie and since I was a fan of SNL and certainly of former cast member Will Ferrell, I was willing to come along on Blades of Glory's second day of opening. Too silly in the beginning, it picked up after Ferrell and Jon Heder started teaming up with Craig T. Nelson coaching. A subplot involving a rival brother-and-sister team played by real-life married couple Will Arnett and Amy Poehler and little sis Kate played by 'The Office' star Jenna Fischer contributes to the most hilarious scene in the movie: A call to Kate from Heder's character in which each is coached to say certain double entendre lines that don't match their personalities. Amusing cameos by various skaters Nancy Kerrigan, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, and Sasha Cohen partly makes the movie a little more tolerable than it really is though the funniest scenes come from Ferrell even though he seems to be trying a little harder than usual. Scott Hamilton and Jim Lamply also do well with deadpan lines as the announcers and when I read the credits, two of the stunt performers were Canadian Silver/Gold skaters David Pelletier and Jamie Sale. There's also an amusing scene between Ferrell and Fischer that plays sweet and a little sexual that almost-but not quite-crosses the line. I think I've said enough so I'll just say if you're willing to go with all the silliness, go ahead and watch. Just don't expect Mel Brooks or Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker hilarity.",6,1,5,31 March 2007
The Polar Express," I finally got to see The Polar Express. My recommendation, go see it!
","When my movie theatre-working friend offered to let me see this movie for a special IMAX 3-D showing today, I took it! The motion capture images of director Robert Zemeckis are pretty fascinating to watch and it kept me from completely falling asleep most of the time I was watching it. It's told in flashback of a boy who is in danger of no longer believing in Christmas and certainly not in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks voices a lot of the characters in the story, most notably as the train conductor. I wasn't sure I would completely like this but by the end, I was close to loving it! There's also an appearance of a Famous Musician but I don't want to spoil the fun so on that note, I highly recommend The Polar Express.",7,1,1,14 December 2016
The Town," Ben Affleck's The Town was a very compelling action drama
","Well, this is the first time I've seen a movie directed by Ben Affleck, as opposed to both starring and co-writing as well, and I must say that I was very impressed with what I saw! He plays the lead character, a heist thief from the Charlestown suburb of Boston, with compelling empathy that one hopes he doesn't step too much over the line when he does the things he does here. I mean, yes, he steals and shoots and doesn't always make the right decisions but he also has a reasonable background that explains his plight. And he's picked the right cast in people like Rebacca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper among others in bringing this action drama to the screen. I don't think I've seen any flaws, story-wise, while watching but maybe that's because I was just very absorbed on just how things seemed really connected that the whole thing just took me away. So on that note, The Town comes highly recommended.",9,0,5,30 September 2010
Elf," After so many years, I finally got to watch Elf and consider it quite a funny and partly touching movie
","Confession time: Until just a couple of hours ago, I had never seen this now-classic Christmas comedy starring Will Ferrell in the title role. He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids 'from 1 to 92'!",7,5,6,13 December 2018
Shutter Island," Shutter Island is another very good collaboration of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio
","When I agreed to watch this Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film with my movie theatre working friend today, the 'Skip It' reviews of Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott were still on my mind but since I'd like to make up my own mind about anything, I thought, 'What the Hell.' I'll admit also up front that while I almost fell asleep sometimes during this, by the time of the Big Revelation, I was wide awake and wanting to learn more. Also, despite my almost sleepy demeanor, I was enthralled by DiCaprio's lead performance, by Scorsese's direction, as well as fine supporting performances by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Michelle Williams. Nothing much more to say except this was another very compelling opus by the great director and his frequent leading man that I highly recommend.",9,2,14,25 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a great awesome time at the movies!
","Marvel at the return of Captain America (Chris Evans) along with that of The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)! And dig his new co-hort in heroics, The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) at his side! Samuel L. Jackson is also back as Nick Fury and he's opposite Robert Redford for the first time in film history! Oh, and the reveal of the Winter Soldier will either surprise you or not, depending on your familiarity with those Marvel Comics. This was such a slam-bang awesome action pic that I loved seeing this in IMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend as he did as well. Not a dull spot anywhere, that's for sure! So I highly recommend Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Oh, and as always, expect to see Marvel's Stan Lee somewhere in there as well...",10,2,6,13 April 2014
Life of Pi," Ang Lee's Life of Pi is another of his masterpieces
","Just watched this Ang Lee-directed film with my movie theater-working friend. He thought it was 'weird' but enjoyed it as much as I did. I mean, it was so fascinating watching this Indian teen survive being in a lifeboat for who knows how many days with a Bengal tiger always threatening to eat him. And his later adult self telling it to an author provides some explanation for his beliefs and what have you. And the visuals, which we saw in 3-D, were so awesome! Ditto the music. I can't think of anything else to say but oh, what an experience! I really can't think of anything to say except what are you waiting for? If you like adventurous filmmaking, I most definitely recommend Life of Pi!",10,7,15,3 December 2012
Tangled," Disney's Tangled was quite an enjoyable computer-animated movie in 3-D for my friend and me
","This was the first of two movies I watched with my movie theatre-working friend today (The other one was Faster). The trailers made me wonder if the whole thing was gonna be a little too slapstick for my tastes but having now seen it, I shouldn't have been too worried as it had an equal amount of heart, drama, action, and, yes, laughs. And knowing Disney veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with the songs-with the help of lyricist Glenn Slater-made this film even more enjoyable especially when the number of 'I've Got a Dream' was performed by a bunch of bar customers that were considered monsters before that. Of the voice actors, I knew 'Chuck's Zachary Levi was the leading man because of his spots during his show that publicized the movie and about Mandy Moore playing the long-haired princess from some sites but I didn't know about Brad Garrett, Jeffery Tambor, or, best surprise to me, Richard Kiel whom I've long loved for his portrayal of Jaws in both The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (When I mentioned the last to my friend, he says he doesn't remember those movies or maybe he didn't even see them, I don't know). Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Tangled.",8,3,6,2 December 2010
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange was another awesomely adventurous Marvel flick
","This was another AWESOME Marvel superhero movie I watched with my movie theatre-working friend. We were both enthralled by the origin of one Stephen Strange who we find out was first an actual doctor of medicine before his accident from a car wreck. So he travels to a faraway country to cure his body only to become a new man due to his now practicing some mystic arts of magic. I'll stop there and just say this was quite visually stimulating watching various far-out images of the things Stephen goes through. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Doctor Strange. Oh, and yes, there's another Stan Lee cameo and some extra scenes after the closing credits.",10,6,13,9 November 2016
Interstellar," Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative
","Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",9,7,19,1 December 2014
American Sniper," American Sniper was a compellingly dramatic depiction of the heroism and hardships of Chris Kyle
","I consider myself an independent though I usually vote Demoratic. With that in mind, I viewed this movie with an open mind concerning the character of Chris Kyle and his motivations for fighting in the Middle East as well as how he coped with his post-war life and home life concerning his wife and his children. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller do fine in their roles as first single people getting to know each other before they get married and he then goes to a far away country protecting people in a foreign land from committing terrors against other peoples. Clint Eastwood compellingly depicts the hardships involved in doing the job and making it back not only in one piece but also with some lasting issues in trying to get back to a normal life after all that calamity. So on that note, I recommend American Sniper.",8,22,43,25 January 2015
Forrest Gump," After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!
","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years.",10,4,6,9 September 2014
Ant-Man," Ant-Man was one that took a while to get into but I managed to have a very good time by the very end!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his friend and that friend's girlfriend. They laughed throughout the movie but I just smiled at some of the scenes and lines. When it came to the climatic battle, however, I found myself laughing along with them especially during that toy train sequence. Paul Rudd is the appropriate hero as the title character who shrinks and goes back to normal in one quick beat. Michael Douglas is the mentor who previously was that costumed fighter but gave it up after suffering a tragedy. Evangeline Lilly is the daughter of Douglas' character who also wants in on the action. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Ant-Man.",8,4,13,30 July 2015
21 Jump Street," This halfway funny version of the old TV show 21 Jump Street is pretty enjoyable for what it is
","Having just seen lots of other movies either me or my movie theatre-working friend had wanted to watch over the last several weeks, it's only today that we finally decided to look at this one after all that time. For the most part, I found it all quite hilarious during the first hour before seeming to lose some steam during the last 20 or so minutes. Still, Johah Hill and Channing Tatum never lose their energy during that whole time. And there's some occasional good turns by Rob Riggle, Nick Offerman, Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, and Brie Larson to also provide some enjoyment. So on that note, this satiric movie version of the TV series 21 Jump Street is worth a look. Oh, and you can expect some choice cameos when watching something like this.",5,5,9,21 April 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: The First Avenger is the best filmed version of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's creation yet!
","So, after spending the last month watching the previous films that depicted Captain America in live action, I finally watched this latest one in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and I have to say right now, this was the most awesome of them all! I mean, finally, they get it right in having the true origin of how Steve Rogers went from a skinny weakling classified as 4-F to one becoming 1-A because of a scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) showing an interest in him. Those scenes with Tucci and Chris Evans as the eventual superhero bring gravitas to what makes Cap such a great patriot. Also great are the supporting cast of Tommy Lee Jones as the doubting Colonel Chester Phillips and Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter whose spunk and looks make her one of the most alluring leading ladies in these comic book superhero-based movies. Then there's Hugo Weaving as the great villain Johann Schmidt a.k.a The Red Skull. He's sure a hell of a lot more menacing than the one depicted in the 1990 Captain America, that's for sure! If there's one disappointment, it's that while there's a Bucky at last in one of these CA movie adaptations, he's not a teenage boy and he doesn't even wear the costume associated with him. Instead, he's just an enlisted friend about Steve's age who happens to travel with him when they go on missions. Though at least there's still enough of a friendship between them that we get it when Steve tries to drown himself in drink after James Buchanan Barnes (Sebastian Stan) falls off. And I also believed in the almost-relationship between Steve and Peggy. And most of the action scenes were great especially Cap's chase with a stolen taxi. And how about those humorous touches like Steve's shilling for war bonds with dancing girls and 'Adolf Hitler' in tow? So on that note, Captain America: The First Avenger gets a high recommendation from me.",9,2,15,25 July 2011
American Hustle," American Hustle was pretty compelling if a bit overrated
","Today, I watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it previously. I knew of its Golden Globe wins for Best Picture-Comedy or Musical, Best Actress-C or M: Amy Adams, and Best Supporting Actress: Jennifer Lawrence. And this morning, there were Oscar noms for Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, and all four acting categories for Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper as well as Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence. Now, my friend said it was okay after seeing it for the second time. Me, I'm pretty much the same in reacting to it. I mean, there were some funny moments and some compelling scenes and dialogue exchanges but after a while, I did admit to feeling confused at some tone changes and whether we're supposed to feel for some of these characters or not. I thought the Bale character the most compelling of them and if he wins, I'll be glad. The other nominated performances don't seem as compelling but I wasn't too bored even when some scenes seem to not have much of a point. I suppose I would have to watch again to maybe get a better flow of what this picture was trying to accomplish. Still, American Hustle is worth a look.",7,0,6,16 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The Godfather: Part II is even better than its predecessor
","Three years ago, I watched The first Godfather and while I enjoyed it, I didn't think of it as such a great film, partly citing the roles of Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Here, they're both still being somewhat underused but Ms. Keaton has a great scene when she reveals what really happened to her upcoming baby and Ms. Shire has a nearly as such scene when she mentions Fredo near the end. Speaking of whom, John Cazale is fine in reprising the role as the weak Corleone brother. And Al Pacino was probably at his very best in this, his second feat at portraying Michael Corleone especially during scenes with his mentor Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth. Francis Ford Coppola is aces as both the co-writer (with creator Mario Puzo) and director as he handles scenes from both the late '50s concerning Michael and the early 20th century concerning his father Vito, here played in an Oscar-winning turn by Robert De Niro speaking mostly in Italian. So on that note, I highly recommend The Godfather: Part II.",10,0,2,1 May 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum is the best in series so far
","Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass do it again! They provide great action while presenting a logical story and beautiful expository dialogue to help explain most of what is going on. Kudos also to returning cast members Joan Allen and, especially, Julia Stiles, who has more to do here and a better reason for her character to matter than she did in the first two. The relationship between her and Damon's character before his changed identity is a little ambiguous but very interesting. David Strathairn and Albert Finney also shine through here in their provocative roles. All in all, The Bourne Ultimatum is the best in the movie series so far!",10,2,5,18 August 2007
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody was quite an enjoyable take on the life and career of Freddie Mercury
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were enthralled by the performance of Rami Malek as the late Freddie Mercury, the frontman of the '70s/'80s rock group Queen. He seemed to capture in essence both his performing style and what was known of his life. The movie seemed to take liberties of when certain events took place but, dramatically, it seemed believable for the way it was depicted. In summary, me and my friend really enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody!",8,4,6,3 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading is another unique Coen Brothers movie that provides some amusements
","After two weeks of suffering the effects of Hurricane Gustav, I called my friend and we agreed to see another movie at the theatre he works at. We agreed on this one since I was interested in seeing another Coen Brothers film and my friend was interested in seeing Brad Pitt. Pitt was perhaps the most enjoyably funny character here especially when he does one of his dance moves (my friend always says 'Go Brad! whenever that happens). And we also laughed out loud at the contraption that George Clooney made that he showed to Frances McDormand. The best parts for me, however, was the dialogue between the C.I.A. agents David Rasche and J.K. Simmons concerning the whole plot of this movie especially when Simmons says to tell him when all this makes sense! That seems to be the whole point that nothing makes complete sense. (In fact, knowing Joel and Ethan's sense of humor, I didn't really expect that!) And how hilarious was it seeing Pitt and McDormand's 'blackmail' call to John Malkovich has to be one of the most absurd moments ever on film! The scenes with Tilda Swinton aren't as memorable as those of the other actors but she has some moments. In all, if you're a Coen Brothers fan, you should definitely seek out Burn After Reading.",6,5,11,16 September 2008
Justice League," Justice League is quite an awesome ride for the first in the DC superhero group series
","Last year, I compared the Marvel movie-Captain America: Civil War-with the DC one-Superman vs. Batman: Dawn of Justice-and I considered the Marvel one better. This time having previously watched the Marvel one-Thor: Ragnarok-and then the DC one-this one-I'm considering the DC one better mainly based on more action and possibly also more heroes. Besides Batman and Wonder Woman, there are also Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash (By the way, I can't help thinking he's being written and played in the form of the Spider-Man character in the recent Marvel movies: that of a teen/young adult in over his head but with great enthusiasm) . Oh, and one more but that may be considered a spoiler. Oh, wait, I put the warning in my review so here it is: Superman comes back to life! Anyway, this was quite an awesome ride that I just watched with my movie theatre working-friend who had watched before and was also enamored with it enough to agree with me of it being better than the Thor one. So that's a high recommendation for Justice League. P.S. I noticed that besides Ben Affleck (Batman) who previously played Daredevil, another player who previously appeared in a Marvel movie was J. K. Simmons (Commissioner Jim Gordon here) who was J. Jonah Jameson in the first three Spider-Man movies that starred Tobey Maguire. Oh, and Marc McClure-who was Jimmy Olsen in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies-has a cameo as a jail guard.",9,1,4,28 November 2017
Grease," After previously watching this several times during my youth, I got a great kick of seeing the sing-a-long version of Grease
","Just watched most of the sing-a-long version on CBS hours earlier (I came home from work after the first 30 minutes had already played). My mom claimed she had not seen this movie before but when I was younger, I remember her commenting on some of the scenes when watching the VHS version with my siblings. When I was a pre-teen kid, I had watched this particular movie lots of times, whether at the local library, at the Broadmoor Theatre, or on network TV (which censored certain lyrics of 'Greased Lightning' and cut out the mooning scene). The version I just watched on CBS simply muted the offending words-as well as not print them on screen though the sh-one got various typed symbols-from that song and didn't show the bare butts on camera. Anyway, all those times I previously watched it, I enjoyed it sooooo much, it for a while was my favorite movie. Since 1981, It's a Wonderful Life took that place. Still, it's always a treat to watch John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on screen together whether talking, singing, or dancing together. And the songs are always a thrill to watch and listen to especially since I've heard the songs several times on record before my first time watching this movie. The lyrics printed on screen also added some visual symbols to basically humorously comment on the action on screen. Of the older adult characters, I especially liked the interaction of Eve Arden and Dody Goodman as the principal and her assistant, respectively. And Sid Caesar is aces in those PE training scenes with Travolta, that's for sure! And then there's that John Wilson cartoon during the opening credits while Barry Gibb's title song is playing that's also a fine addition to the movie. Really, all I'll say now is Grease is still the word, after a little more than 40 years... Update-I finally got to see the sing-a-long versions of 'Love is a Many Splendored Thing', 'Summer Nights' and the first 'Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' number on YouTube just now...",8,0,0,8 June 2020
The Thing," John Carpenter's The Thing is an entertainingly gore-drenched horror flick
","Having just rewatched Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World, I finally decided to see John Carpenter's The Thing on the HD DVD my dad ordered months ago. In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.",7,2,4,12 October 2009
The Revenant," The Revenant was quite a thrilling drama that I just watched!
","Several weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio won his Best Actor Oscar for this movie, I finally got to see The Revenant with my movie theatre-working friend (who had watched this previously a few weeks ago) just now. DiCaprio played Hugh Glass, a trapper who was left for dead from several men including Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, who is revealed to be quite selfish most of the time. Hardy also gave a fine performance that also got him an Oscar nomination though he lost to Mark Ryland in The Bridge of Spies. Anyway, the nature shots taking place in winter look rough most of the time, appropriately so, so to speak. Oh, and that sequence involving that bear looked really brutal, that's for sure! So on that note, I definitely recommend The Revenant unless that bear sequence makes you squeamish...",9,1,5,16 March 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams provide some nice charms as father and daughter in Trouble with the Curve
","Despite not liking Mr. Eastwood's recent appearance at the Republican National Convention (Really, he used a chair as a prop and pretended it was President Barack Obama and imagined he told him to do something to himself?), I decided to watch his latest movie with my movie theatre-working friend because I still like his acting work. And as an elderly baseball scout who might be losing his bearings, Clint can still bring the charm and the chemistry when performing with the likes of Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, and especially, Amy Adams as his daughter who can be just as stubborn as him. An added benefit to me was when both Eastwood and Adams, separately, were thinking of better times when they started singing the song, 'You Are My Sunshine' which was a tune my late dad frequently warbled during his lifetime (though he always skipped the part that went 'When skies are gray') even before we moved here to Baton Rouge in 1975 and eventually discovered it was co-written and sung by a former Governor of our state Louisiana named Jimmie Davis. Really, all I'll say now is I recommend Trouble with the Curve.",7,1,8,24 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Bridge of Spies was another compelling Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg film
","I finally watched this Steven Spielberg-directed drama starring Tom Hanks on Netflix disc with my mom just now. We were both enthralled by this based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer who previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to first defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a performance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange with Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary Powers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating finding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate, turns out quite a bit. Some scenes would be considered shocking but this was mostly carried by compelling dialogue of which much of it was by Joel and Ethan Coen. So on that note, me and Mom highly recommend Bridge of Spies.",10,1,2,26 May 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine was much better than last year's Best Picture winner
","If I was a member of the Academy and I had to pick Best Picture of the previous year with the choices between Martin Scorsese's The Departed and Little Miss Sunshine, I'd definitely pick the latter. This dysfunctional family road comedy-drama (or dramady) has some of the most realistic-funny dialogue I've watched from recent times. And the performances are all great from Greg Kinnear to Toni Collette to Steve Carell to Oscar nominated Abigail Breslin (what a cute girl!) and, especially, Oscar winner Alan Arkin as the heroin taking grandpa who loves his grandchild and is so hilarious with his salty take on life! Also loved Wallace Langham as the guy who played the music picked by the grandpa (and didn't turn it off when some people got upset) and, nice surprise here, Chloe O'Brien herself, Mary Lynn Rajskub as the lady who accompanies Olive (Abigail's character) to the stage. One of the best independently made movies I've seen in a while!",10,1,6,25 October 2007
Hugo," Martin Scosese's Hugo provides some great insight on the wonders of early cinema
","Before watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, I had previously watched many Martin Scorsese pictures that were violent or at least adult concerning subject matter. This one is meant for families but also offers something of a historical matter concerning the beginnings of the magic of the movies. As the young protagonists, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz provide a nice way to identify with their plight and Ben Kingsley is fine as the now-financially strapped magician/filmmaker Georges Melies who gets a reevaluation with their help and that of a chronologist, Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), who happens to be his biggest fan. Anyone who appreciates film history and preservation should marvel at the way Scorsese shows various clips of many classic silent movies that get showcased here other than those of Melies like my wondrous reaction when a clip of Harold Lloyd's Safety Last (which I recently watched on YouTube) was shown when Hugo and Isabelle were sneaking into a cinema. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Hugo. Oh, and the 3-D imagery was great, too.",9,5,10,5 December 2011
Doctor Zhivago," Doctor Zhivago was mostly as fine as its reputation stands
","This was the very last of the movies I watched on a Korean Air flight going home after so many years of only knowing it by reputation. It's pretty long (in fact, the longest of the films I watched on the plane) but it was mostly compelling watching from beginning to end almost non-stop (I only paused during mealtimes). Omar Sharif was quite the dashing figure here and his relationships with his wife, Geraldine Chaplin, and eventual mistress, Julie Christie, were both romantically compelling. I did wish more had been done concerning the Chaplin character but it was good for what she was given concerning her scenes. Rod Steiger was especially good as the complex villain who's not completely evil. And Alec Guinness's character does a good wraparound as one of the relatives of the leading character. By the way, this is so far the only time I've watched a David Lean film in its entirety so on that note, Doctor Zhivago was a mostly fine movie to watch.",9,1,2,4 July 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse will hopefully blow your mind as it did mine and a couple of friends of mine!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko. So that's a very high recommendation of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.",10,3,7,10 January 2019
American Beauty," In the last 13 years, American Beauty remains a culturally worthy film to observe
","Having first watched this movie when it initially came out in theatres, I just saw it again with my mother on Netflix disc. It was fascinating listening to her react to the various weird things that happen in the movie. (She thought it was sick, by the way.) Certainly, the film is still something of a cultural item concerning the addressing of family dysfunctions as well as the many taboo things socially that get depicted or at the least implied during the whole thing. Kudos to writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, score composer Thomas Newman, and stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper, among others, for putting such a brave and provocative drama with a touch of unique humor that makes this film still a compellingly worthwhile experience to savor. So yes, that's very much a recommendation of American Beauty.",10,1,4,23 June 2012
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa was a pretty enjoyable Dreamworks Animation sequel
","Today, I went with my friend who works at a movie theatre to see this Dreamworks Animation sequel to Madagascar which he had seen twice before. I remember enjoying the first one a few years ago but I waited several weeks after when this one premiered sometime last month. It was pretty uneven in spots but many scenes where Alex (once again voiced by Ben Stiller) either fights or dances were very funny to me. And hearing the zebra pal (Chris Rock) listen other of his species look, talk, and act just like him was also good for a laugh. And how sweet it was to hear Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and that giraffe (David Schwimmer) declare their love for each other. Then there's those penguins, that lemur and his sidekick, and that small one being chased by a shark that provided their own amusements. And finally, there's Alex's father which is voiced by the late Bernie Mac (who like myself and the woman who voices his wife, Sherri Shepard, was born in Chicago, Illinois). Mac is simply both humorous and touching in the right places and what a nice dedication they put for him at the end credits. No great shakes here but for all that, I really enjoyed Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa especially when those penguins took over the Dreamworks logo...",7,1,2,9 December 2008
Salt," Angelina Jolie entertainingly kicks butt in her latest movie Salt
","Okay, I've just seen the Angelina Jolie movie Salt in which she plays the title character with the first name of Evelyn. She's a C.I.A. agent working alongside one Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) or is she? Suddenly, someone from Russia is interrogated by her and he reveals something that makes her run for her life. Along with Winter, she's also pursued by someone named Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor). She also has a husband to worry about not to mention the Russian president and the U.S. one, too. Okay, all I want to say now is what an exciting picture this is what with all the chases and killings and the pulse-pounding score and when the end comes, all I could thing of is, 'Maybe there'll be a sequel.' Considering it's the No. 2 spot in the Box Office charts right now, that seems to be a big possibility. So on that note, director Philip Noyce very much delivers the goods and if it indeed comes, he should make the follow-up very soon!",8,5,12,28 July 2010
Duck Soup," The Four Marx Brothers are at their peak in Duck Soup
","Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the 'mixed hats' routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...",10,1,2,13 January 2013
We're the Millers," We're the Millers was entertaining enough for a raunchy and touching comedy
","Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than 'R' especially when the 'siblings' are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his 'sister' and 'mother'! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston provide plenty of laughs as the 'parental units' along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer! The whole movie was both raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters throughout. And, yes, it was funny enough for me and my friend. So on that note, I recommend We're the Millers.",7,5,10,14 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook deserves all the accolades it gets
","When my movie theatre-working friend suggested seeing a film yesterday, this was the only one currently out that neither of us had seen yet that I wanted to watch. And both of us were very glad for the choice! I mean, you wouldn't think a romantic comedy-drama about two emotionally or mentally depressed people possibly falling in love would hold much appeal but it did for me and my friend. And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence. Also so glad Ms. Lawrence got her Golden Globe and if she wins her Academy Award, I'll be even more happy! Really, despite all the messy emotions that are explored here or maybe because of all that, I really enjoyed and highly recommend Silver Linings Playbook!",10,0,10,7 February 2013
Ender's Game," Ender's Game was a good enough epic drama of teens doing battle in space
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend on an IMAX screen. The battle scenes are awesome and the story is imaginative and much of the dialogue is compelling. Knowing this was based on the first of a series of novels, what I watched was good enough to be nearly entirely enthralled by. Certainly, veterans Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley give their roles some depth as officers knowing what needs to be done. The teens that dominate are well-chosen. The ongoing score was good at moving things along. I also enjoyed feeling some of the sound effects at the bottom of my seat. And the twist at the end was compellingly dramatic. So on that note, I recommend Ender's Game.",8,4,10,1 November 2013
Dreamgirls," Watch Dreamgirls for all the great performances-especially Jennifer Hudson's
","Three days after Christmas, on a day I was off from work, I paid for admission for my two sisters and their husbands for this long-awaited movie version of one of the most popular Broadway musicals of the last 25 years. Of the five of us, only one of my brothers-in-law wasn't too enamored of Dreamgirls the movie thinking it was miscast with comedian Eddie Murphy and Danny 'Lethal Weapon' Glover in it (though he liked the music like the rest of us). From beginning to end, Dreamgirls had the energy to push the drama and music in full force throughout the picture. Murphy is great playing soul pioneer James 'Thunder' Early as he experiences both the ups and downs of his popularity especially whenever he had to entertain more discriminating audiences like the one at a mostly white Miami hotel. Jamie Foxx and Glover are wonderful as Early's younger and older managers whose clashing styles cause an end for one of them (though he resurfaces later on for one of the Dreams). Beyonce Knowles is okay with her part of the beauty Deena's rise to fame from backup to lead singer of her group. Anika Noni Rose is likewise with her Dreams role as a mistress to Early. But the best performance-bar none-is former American Idol contestant Jennifer Hudson as Effie especially when she sings the show stopper: 'And I'm Telling You'. I've read about the spontaneous applause in various movie theatres after this number and while our matinée attendance had a not even half-full audience I still heard some clapping inside. While the film loses some steam after that, Dreamgirls still has some entertaining music and moments through to the end. While watching this most superior movie musical, look for cameos of John Lithgow, John 'The Office' Krasinski, and, as the talent booker who at first refuses to book the Dreamettes after they arrived late then lets them be the last one on, a grown-up Jaleel 'Urkel' White.",10,1,5,29 December 2006
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation was another exciting entry in the movie series
","With the exception of the second one, I've seen all the other Mission: Impossible movies starring Tom Cruise. They've all been fun in their own way but with this one, I think I liked the plot even more than previously. I'm not sure all of it makes sense but I was able to follow most of what was going on this time though I'm sure I'll forget many of it in the days to come. No matter as me and my movie theatre-working friend were riveted enough by the action and much of the dialogue while watching. I certainly was very taken with the great beauty that is Rebecca Ferguson every time she appeared whether in a dress or swimsuit and certainly by her fight scenes! Of the returning cast, I loved both Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames the best. Oh, and Alec Baldwin made a fine superior this time around. So on that note, I highly recommend Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.",9,2,5,2 September 2015
Shrek Forever After," Shrek Forever After should be a great way to end an iconic series
","I've now seen all four Shrek movies in first run in theatres. The first two were great and the last one wasn't so bad to me but this one, which should be the last one considering the way it ends, had a little more heart in characterization that got me quite touched which probably shouldn't surprise anyone who's read many of my comments under my username if they know that my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life since there are many elements here inspired from there. Kudos, as always, to the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, and especially Mike Myers, for providing great pleasure these characters have provided me over the years. Seeing the character of Rumpelstiltskin as the villain was quite a good new twist here. And having the witches battle the ogres was also an exciting touch. And how about the way Puss in Boots lets himself go... Okay, I'll just say I highly recommend Shrek Forever After. And so long, Far Far Away...P.S. This was another animated movie I enjoyed watching in 3-D.",8,4,5,7 June 2010
Dunkirk," Dunkirk managed to keep me up during its runtime but not enough for me to completely understand it
","After seeing this on IMAX with my movie-theatre working friend and reading many comments on Facebook of which many of them expressed confusion of what was going on in the movie, I have to admit I had the same feeling while watching it with my just-mentioned friend. I also fell asleep at parts of the film though the loud sound effects kept me from staying asleep during most of it. In summary, there were some exciting scenes but I didn't get the characterizations that were depicted as clearly as I would have liked. So that's a partial recommendation for Dunkirk.",6,4,11,2 August 2017
Ratatouille," Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Disney/Pixar animated feature
","Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Pixar/Disney animated feature film that should do very well at the box office in its opening weekend. Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it.",8,2,4,30 June 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Without making too much comparisons with the previous Raimi-Maguire series, I enjoyed this version of The Amazing Spider-Man
","So 10 years after the first Spider-Man that was directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire and 5 years after the third and last by that team were released, we now get a reboot helmed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger. This time, we get some additional background concerning Peter Parker's parents when he was a pre-teen before being left in the care of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Though we once again have Ben killed by someone Peter neglected to stop earlier when he could've, the part where he initially becomes a wrestler after getting his powers doesn't happen to this version of his origin story this time. Instead of Mary Jane Watson, we get Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who this time knows Peter's alter ego from the beginning. This is a refreshing change from having previous men behind the masks keep their secret ID from their so-called girlfriends like with Superman and Lois Lane (though it's good to know that's not the case now in the current comics) or Batman and various of his girlfriends. Compared to Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, The Lizard (Ray Ifans) doesn't seem so threatening though he still has a dangerous vibe, just the same. Oh, and for the record, I actually prefer Gwen who's very much of a brave heroine here compared to the often-damsel-in-distress-like fate of Mary Jane. I especially like some of the comic banter between her and Parker and also her father, a police captain played by Dennis Leary. Oh, and the scenes of Spidey swinging from building to building seem more realistic here compared to Raimi's more cartoony-like actions done by CGI. Not surprised to know that actual stunt men were involved. I don't really feel like comparing whether Maguire or Garfield make the better Frendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I just appreciate the different takes both made in portraying such a legendary superhero. I only have some minor quibbles concerning logic: When Aunt May calls Peter on cell, Parker is still in costume with his mask on, so how can she understands what he says when his voice would be a bit muffled as a result? And how come we didn't see a funeral for Uncle Ben? Okay, otherwise, I did enjoy this reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man, even without seeing it in 3-D. So, yeah, that's a recommendation. P.S. I thought the Stan Lee cameo was another hilarious one...",7,2,5,30 July 2012
The Lego Movie," The Lego Movie was entertaining enough without providing too many laughs
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. It was a nice change of pace from the dramas we've been watching lately as this one is mostly animated Legos with voices from various celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Will Ferrell. Since Warner Bros. is the distributor, it shouldn't be a surprise that characters owned by them like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are depicted here though we shouldn't take them for the real thing since they're Lego-based ones. To tell the truth, I didn't find the whole thing hilarious but I was pretty amused throughout and the constant motion of the characters and many moving backgrounds was enough to entertain me and my friend. In summary, I liked The Lego Movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in this sort of thing.",7,1,4,8 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club has fine performances by Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner
","Before I review the movie proper, I have to give props to the filmmakers for making it so I didn't recognize this was shot in New Orleans, which is a two-hour drive from where I currently live. My movie theatre-working friend also didn't know when I showed him the credit that ID'd it and he'd seen this movie before. Anyway, I liked both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto in their roles and am glad they won their Golden Globes. If they win the Oscars, that would be nice, too. McConaughey's character may be something of a bigot but he becomes quite human when confronted with his AIDS treatment. And when he meets Leto's character in the hospital room, Leto becomes quite an ally even though he's not above telling what he really is at one point! I also liked Jennifer Garner's performance as their doctor and friend. The movie doesn't go for big emotions but it makes one feel for the characters, just the same. So, while not perfect, Dallas Buyers Club is very compellingly made. So, yes, that's a recommendation.",7,1,2,27 January 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men: Days of Future Past was another awesome entry in the series
","Well, Bryan Singer outdid himself again in his third outing as the director of an X-Men film! Quite an awesome mix of the younger/older versions of Professor X and Magneto with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine being the connection between them as he gets sent by them to the '70s to prevent a war involving the giant robots called the Sentinels. Also involved are the '70s version of The Beast and Quicksilver. Oh, yes, there's also Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. So not only is there awesome action but also pertinent dialogue in advancing the story and characterization which was based on Chris Claremont's writing when he plotted the comic series during the '70s/'80s. So on that note, I highly recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past.",9,2,5,28 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War is awesome!
","Like the recent DC movie, Batman vs. Superman, this Marvel movie has hero pitted against hero, in this case-Captain America against Iron Man. The conflict was handled more believably here than there. Other superheroes also participate including yet another new version of Spider-Man. This was mostly awesome from beginning to end unlike the DC movie which didn't make sense some of the time. Also unlike B vs. S, this one didn't seem too long even though it's only about 5 minutes shorter than that one. Oh, and Stan Lee makes another amusing cameo here, too! Plenty of great action abound so on that note, yes, Captain America: Civil War comes highly recommended.",9,9,20,10 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a fine adventure by J.K. Rowling
","Just watched this pre-Harry Potter-set movie by J.K. Rowling with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed the story and characters and plenty of special effects that abound throughout. It takes place during the '20s in New York City. One of the characters is a 'No-Maj', an American term for 'Muggle'. Some scenes do feel a little padded but I managed to not be bored most of the time. Actually, this was quite funny and a little exciting most of the time. Oh, and there's a surprise revealed in the closing credits of who played a certain character that appeared near the end. I really don't want to spoil anything so on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.",8,3,7,23 November 2016
No Strings Attached," No Strings Attached provide good turns from Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in this rom-com
","Just watched this romantic comedy starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher with my movie theatre-working friend at the place where he works. Their characters first meet at a summer camp as teenagers where the one who grows up to be Kutcher is experiencing his parents' divorce and the one who becomes Ms. Portman admits she's not good at consoling people. After another meeting at a frat party, it's several more years before the two meet and eventually decide to have a physical relationship with what the title above implies. I'll just say this was a funny and touching rom-com with plenty of good scenes and lines from the two leads and many of the supporting players like that of Kevin Kline as Kutcher's dad, Lake Bell (who I initially thought was Amanda Peet) as Ashton's production associate, and 'The Office's Mindy Kaling as one of Ms. Portman's roommates, among others. All of the above was directed by Ivan Reitman who's long provided many entertaining movies these past 30 or so years (of which one of his earliest, Meatballs, is represented by a poster shown in a couple scenes). By the way, he also cameos as a director here.",8,7,17,25 January 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of the most uniquely enjoyable movies from this summer season
","Since opening opposite Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables and Julia Roberts' Eat Pray Love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World hasn't had a chance to hit it big at the box office. I guess that's because the two pictures I just mentioned have something of a pre-sold audience while this one only has an appeal to those that have read the graphic novels this movie is based on. I'm here to say that despite not having read the source material, I very much enjoyed this movie! Oh sure, it took a while before I got into it but once I did, I never allowed myself to question why things happened the way they did, I just let myself-as one character said-'be in the moment'. Director Edgar Wright put all his creative stops here both visually and dialogue-wise that there were times I wish I could've rewinded some passages just so I could hear and see certain scenes again. So on that note, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World comes highly recommended.",9,7,22,25 August 2010
Enchanted," Enchanted is a nice parody/tribute to fairy tales from Walt Disney Pictures
","Walt Disney Pictures' original animated/live-action musical comedy Enchanted is a mostly wonderful tribute/parody of various fairy tale films that made the company the most enchanting for family entertainment. Amy Adams is simply luminous as Giselle, the maiden who finds herself caught between James Marsden's Prince Edward from her animated life and Patrick Dempsey's Robert Phillip in the real New York one. Also featuring Susan Sarandon as the evil Queen Narissa and Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, her henchman. Then there's the chipmunk Pip, voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia and the director Kevin Lima in New York when Pip can only communicate in chipmunk sounds. Finally, there's Idina Menzel as Robert's fiancée, Nancy, and six-year-old Rachel Covey as his daughter, Morgan. All players I've mentioned contribute wonderfully to this movie that lives up to its title. My favorite sequences, however, both involve Giselle when she sings her heart out in New York. The first involves when she calls to some animals to help clean Robert's apartment when he's gone and many of them are rats and roaches! Then at Central Park when she starts singing to Robert about finding true love, he at first tells her to just keep walking then she encounters some Calypso musicians and they start joining in and then just everyone within walking distance do the same. Well, except Robert who insists he can't sing or dance! The songs by Disney veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz move along at a breezy pace. Also nice to see previous animated Disney princesses Jodi Benson (Ariel), Paige O'Hara (Belle), and Judy Kuhn (Pocohantas) make cameo appearances and to hear Julie Andrews herself narrate. All in all, Enchanted is another Disney movie that should be entertaining enough for all ages who want that feel-good happy ending with some clever satire that makes, in the words of Andrews' Mary Poppins character from that Disney picture, 'the medicine go down'.",8,1,3,27 December 2007
Inside Out," Inside Out was another excellent Disney/Pixar animated feature
","Before this feature and the short that preceded it-Lava-director Pete Doctor appeared and explained how his movie-like many others-can take you to new places and inspire various emotions. He was certainly right about that! This film-which centered on the emotions of a girl who feels alienated moving to a new place after years of being comfortable in the old one-can be funny and sad in all the right places. Especially when it focuses on the characters of Joy and Sadness and also an imaginary friend, this movie hits all the right buttons. Very young children may not completely understand all that's depicted but they should still be pretty entertained by many of the images and characterizations depicted here in computer animated form. I really don't want to reveal much so on that note, I highly recommend Inside Out.",10,10,39,24 June 2015
Yesterday," Yesterday poses a 'What if?' concerning the nonexistance of a certain musical group
","The following sums up this movie's premise-'What if there was a worldwide blackout and only a struggling musician becomes the only one to have known of The Beatles' existence and successfully passed off their songs as his for a while?' Such is what's depicted and what he eventually does with that knowledge. Other culturally relevant things are also non-existant in the world depicted but anyway, I found this quite funny and a little touching and very entertaining concerning the classic Beatles songs performed during the whole thing. So that's a high recommendation for Yesterday.",10,2,6,4 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame was a great way to end the first series of the Marvel Cinematic Univeerse
","If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, 'Excelsior!'",10,131,246,16 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace was another very good entry in Ian Fleming's James Bond series
","Having just seen this, the official 22nd James Bond movie in the EON series, I have to say that Quantum of Solace is a very good, if not great worthy entry. Taking place directly after Casino Royale, the action gets going pretty quickly with the car chases followed not long after by some rooftop running and then later on with planes getting bullets. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Daniel Craig is back as Bond with Judi Dench as M who's worried 007 is out for revenge on Vesper Lynd's death considering how he carelessly kills some suspects. Both are good in their comebacks as are Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis and Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter (Interesting note: the only other actor to return as Leiter was Live and Let Die's David Hedison in Licence to Kill). Mathieu Amalric as Greene isn't as creepy a Bond villain as I expected though I was highly amused with the way James dealt with him at the end. The real villain to me seemed to be this General played by Joaquin Cosio whose presence and backstory provided a good reason for Olga Kurylenko's character to avenge her family. And Gemma Arterton as this watchdog (or maybe 'watchgirl') for Bond named Fields (you'll have to watch the end credits for her first name) provides some amusement in her few scenes. Those action scenes helmed by Marc Forster are probably too 'Bourne'-inspired (i.e. filmed too up-close and edited too quick with shaky camera movements) for traditional 007 fans, though they were entertaining enough for me that I didn't mind. And after reading this was the shortest Bond film on record, well, the movie was certainly long enough. So in summation, Quantum of Solace was another nearly fine entry in the James Bond series.",8,7,14,18 November 2008
The Dirty Dozen," Lee Marvin leads some future stars on a mission in The Dirty Dozen
","After years of reading about it, I finally decided to watch The Dirty Dozen on Netflix Streaming especially since it would be off it by tomorrow. Lee Marvin as Major Reisman is assigned to lead the title group of men either condemned to death or a very long prison term. Among them: Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown, and John Cassavetes. The last one is the first to rebel against Marvin and he's perhaps the one that made the most impression on me as a result. No wonder he got the Oscar nomination. Sutherland has a funny scene when he has to pass himself as a general that I read later got him the movie version of M*A*S*H. Savalas and Brown provide the conflict within the team that gets the exciting climax going. And Bronson essays the authority to go with Marvin in leading the mission. Some mistakes that I noticed-like when the Dozen switch the blue bands for red during the 'War Games' sequence before they seemed to switch back for a few minutes or women wearing '60s hairstyles in a '40s setting-confused me but overall, The Dirty Dozen has enough compelling dramatics and action for me to recommend.",8,1,3,31 January 2012
Gone with the Wind," Having finally watched Gone with the Wind, I'll now just say that I loved it! That's it!
","After hearing about this movie for most of my lifetime, I finally watched Gone with the Wind on two DVD discs. It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict: I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on 'The Jack Benny Program' on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S. Since I like to point out when players from my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life, are in something else, here it's Thomas Mitchell as Scarlett's father and Ward Bond as a military officer.",9,2,5,23 February 2014
Mamma Mia!," I finally know why my mom loves the musical Mamma Mia!
","Okay, so I finally saw what now seems to be my mother's favorite musical-her being an ABBA fan and all-in both stage and movie versions since she loved this when she saw it on her birthday last year and requested it for a Christmas present from me. Overall, it was indeed enjoyable despite the somewhat shallow characterizations and plot. Of the singing cast, Meryl Streep comes off best and Pierce Brosnan the worst. In fact, I wished he and Colin Firth had switched roles since Mr. Firth is the much better singer. Of the supporting cast, both Julie Walters and Christine Baranski had good vocal chops throughout while Stellan Skarsgard was adequate the few times he sang. Then there are the young leads Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper who both warbled in fine form. Nice cameos by both former ABBA members Bjorn Ulvaeus and, in the 'Dancing Queen' number, Benny Andersson on the piano. Overall, Mamma Mia! The Movie was a very enjoyable experience. So to anyone who doesn't mind a little frothy entertainment, that's a recommendation.",7,2,6,5 January 2009
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 is as great as the first three in the series
","For anyone who ever wondered whatever happened to the Bo Peep doll in Toy Story 3, this next installment believably answered that. And with that, Annie Potts makes a return voice appearance doing that character as for once, she becomes a really important part of the story with the theme of being independent and learning to let go when one becomes separated from one's closest friends for whatever reason. As she was something of a love interest for Tom Hanks' Woody voice, they wonderfully share the lion's share of scenes. But there's hilarity plenty still especially with the arrival of a new toy made by new owner Bonnie herself named Forky who for quite some time keeps going to a trash can... This was as worthy an entry for the series as the first three as I laughed and cried quite a bit during this one. So on that note, Toy Story 4 is very highly recommended. Oh, and I also definitely recommend you watch this to the very end when the Disney and Pixar logos come up again...",10,5,10,2 July 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," The Fault in Our Stars was a touching teen drama about a young couple with cancer
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were touched by the story of a couple of young adults, Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), both of whom have cancer, and their eventual love affair. One thing they bonded over was a novel about another character with their disease which got them to take a trip to Holland to meet the book's author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). I'll stop there and just say there's plenty of touching moments between the couple but also some funny scenes and lines to offset some of the sadness. I also liked Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Gus' friend Isaac (Nat Wolff). Really, both me and my friend enjoyed this enough so on that note, I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars.",9,4,10,6 June 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Ralph was another enjoyable Walt Disney computer-animated feature
","Just watched this computer-animated movie from Walt Disney Animation with my movie theatre-working friend. It's the story of Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) who's tired of being the villain of the Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) video game because of the negligent treatment from the rest of the inhabitants of his game. So he goes to another one to get a medal and then another one where he meets a girl who feels as lonely as him. I'll stop there and just say that I throughly enjoyed the creative visuals employed throughout and the way the story went. Other voices like those of Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman were also good but I was most impressed by that of Alan Tudyk as King Candy which he seemed to imitate Ed Wynn for since the character looked like Wynn's Mad Hatter in Disney's Alice in Wonderland from 1951. In summary, Wreck-It Ralph gets a high recommendation from me.",8,5,6,6 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Bridesmaids was a nice showcase for Kristen Wiig who co-wrote this
","Just watched this hilarious and touching comedy with my movie theatre-working friend which stars current SNLer Kristen Wiig today. She also co-wrote and co-produced it. She plays Annie, a failed bakery chef who currently works at a jewelry shop whose best friend-played by her former SNL castmate Maya Rudolph-is getting married. This friend is now chums with someone in her new circle who has a little friction with Annie. I'll just stop there and just say that any comparisons with The Hangover are fine as there are some gross-out humor that can be both funny and maybe a little too much for some tastes. Still, the characterizations and relationships between are real enough that one does care for them. And besides Wiig and Rudolph, there's plenty of funny stuff from the supporting cast with the likes of Ellie Kemper of 'The Office', Melissa McCarthy currently of 'Mike & Molly', and Jon Hamm of 'Mad Men' as a jerk of a boyfriend of Annie. In addition, a couple of former SNLers in Nancy Walls (Mrs. Steve Carell) and Melanie Hutsell also appear in a screamingly funny tennis match (though I only recognized the latter in the movie). So on that note, I highly recommend Bridesmaids. P.S. There's an appearance by the Maya character's favorite group that was a nice surprise especially with the song they sang. And this was the late Jill Clayburgh's last film role as Annie's mother. Incidentally, she hosted SNL twice during the '70s.",8,2,5,19 May 2011
Non-Stop," Non-Stop was one exciting plane thriller!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it. Liam Neeson plays someone taking a flight from London. The only other player we recognized was Julianne Moore and not much is learned about her during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was coming from a trying day. Oh, and she observes most of the action when Liam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens. Plenty of twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for some threatening comments on Neeson's tablet so that was a plus. In other words, it was riveting throughout! Really, all I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend Non-Stop!",9,96,148,2 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," I liked How to Train Your Dragon 2 almost as much as its predecessor
","Well, I looked at my review of the previous How to Train Your Dragon in which I gave it nine stars. I haven't seen it since then but reading it did bring some good memories of watching it. This sequel was also quite enjoyable though part of me admits that I didn't find myself laughing heartily until the near-climax involving some of those sheep. But there was quite a lot to be inspired by like the finding of a character thought to be dead or someone who may end up as such. I saw this on IMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew and we all enjoyed this immensely. I mean, the characterizations were believable enough which brought great emotions when some of the more dramatic scenes were done. And, yes, the action was awesome as well. So on that note, I highly recommend How to Train Your Dragon 2.",8,6,12,17 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Having experienced many of Wes Anderson's movies, I was enamored of seeing another of his called The Grand Budapest Hotel
","Having seen quite a few of Wes Anderson's movies, I knew to expect a certain rhythm and flow concerning characterizations and story. So I knew that most of the characters will speak in a certain clipped tone that never wavers and certain jump cuts were also expected. Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time. So on that note, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel if you don't mind such an unusual experience of a noncommercial nature.",9,2,4,7 September 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tom Cruise does it again in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
","This is the third of four Mission: Impossible films starring Tom Cruise that I managed to watch (I only missed the second one directed by John Woo). I enjoyed each one despite not always knowing what was going on and this was no different. Still, with those awesome stunts and those special effects one still gets entertained and doesn't think too much about the plot until they get to the exposition which always provide somewhat of a reasonable explanation of why things happen. And, really, Cruise still has the charisma to sell it in a believable enough way. And the woman playing Agent Carter is sure hot enough, isn't she? So on that note, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol gets a high recommendation from me.",8,7,11,14 January 2012
Foxcatcher," Foxcatcher was a pretty compelling true story tale
","Just watched this with my mom on Netflix disc. This was a pretty compelling story of Mark Schultz-an Olympic wrestler who won the gold in '84 along with his brother Dave-and his relationship with one John du Pont-a loner millionaire who wants to mentor him for the next Olympics. It gets to a pretty dark place though the tone seems quite slow and cold most of the time the film goes on. Channing Tatum and Steve Carell portray Mark and John quite compellingly as does Mark Ruffalo as Dave. As the events unfold, one feels quite stunned at what happens but one can't completely look away when they do. There's no music score, just background recordings that bring some disorienting feeling to bear. So on that note, I recommend Foxcatcher.",8,3,4,15 November 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Infinity War is an excellent culmulation of all the previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!",10,4,11,3 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood was another worthy Quentin Tarantino film
","Anyone who's very familiar with Quentin Tarantino knows he doesn't make conventional movies. So when watching his meandering narrative here, I just sat back and enjoyed his going wherever he feels he needs to go wherever it might lead us. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio play a stunt man and an actor, respectively, in the late '60s in Hollywood who get mixed with some real-life people resulting in an alternate timeline. I'll stop there and just say me and my movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this (though he thought it was pretty weird) and I certainly enjoyed both Tarantino's dialogue and climatic action scenes. Really fascinating to watch to on that note, I recommend Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.",9,29,49,29 July 2019
Gone Girl," Gone Girl is the film to see this fall, I kid you not!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, his sister, and her husband. We were all enthralled watching this drama-thriller about a man whose wife had disappeared and the revelations about them both. Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again! So on that note, I highly recommend Gone Girl.",10,4,18,16 October 2014
Aladdin," This live action version of Disney's Aladdin was enjoyable enough on its own if one hasn't previously seen the studio's animated version
","Having not previously seen the Disney-animated version of Aladdin-just choice clips usually featuring the Robin Williams-voiced Genie-I do understand this Disney-live-action version is mostly the same sequence of events with the same songs with one addition. So on that note, I very much enjoyed this with my movie theatre-working friend. Will Smith is amusing enough as the Genie now and when the more dramatic scenes come, I was touched enough by the story, characters, and the actors playing them. And those songs are, of course, as awesome as ever! So on that note, I recommend this version of Aladdin.",8,4,5,12 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything was one of the most touching of true-life love stories
","Before this movie, I only knew Stephen Hawking through his appearances on shows like 'The Big Bang Theory' or some news clips showcasing him speaking through his communicating apparatus on his electric wheelchair. So seeing him depicted before his disease took hold and having a relationship with a pretty woman named Jane and their marriage and eventual three offspring was something of a revelation to me and Mom. Also, how touchingly devoted she was to him even with all the ravages of his health coming into effect through the years. The way they grew gradually apart was also sensitively done as well as who their next partners would become as they got introduced later in the narrative. In summary, The Theory of Everything was one of the most touching films from last year. Glad for Eddie Redmayne's Oscar win and Felicity Jones' nomination. So, yes, that's a recommendation.",10,0,2,17 June 2015
Bolt," Bolt is a fine computer-animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures
","Though my friend who works at a movie theatre had already seen this, he agreed to watch it again with me. This was a thrilling, heartwarming, and funny Disney-computer-animated movie for me. All the voices were great from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to the rest. This story of a German Shepard who lives a 'Truman Show' life until he accidentally escapes and meets a cat and a hamster is entertaining from beginning to end. Do yourself and your family a favor and take everyone you know to watch this highly entertaining flick. Not quite Pixar-quality but pretty close. Hope it does even better with the kids out of school this Thanksgiving weekend. So what are you waiting for, just go!",9,8,13,27 November 2008
Frozen," Disney's Frozen is another of the studio's enjoyable computer-animated features
","Just watched this computer-animated movie with my movie theatre-working friend. He had watched this before and enjoyed it and now that I have seen it as well, I liked it as well. It's based on Hans Christen Anderson's 'The Snow Queen' with the modern twist of it being about two princess sisters-one of whom having the uncontrollable power of making ice-at odds with each other. There's also a prince involved, an ice delivery man, and an active snow man in this as well. There are also some songs that move the story along-usually involving those sisters who are voiced by Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell. There's plenty scenes that are funny and touching as well as exciting when involving the weather. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend Frozen.",9,3,7,10 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Ben Stiller's version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was enjoyable enough for me
","Before I review the movie proper, let me just say that I'm familiar with both the original James Thurber short story and the Danny Kaye feature movie version. I think I remember liking both good enough but it's been awhile since I read the former or seen the latter. I did like this version starring and directed by Ben Stiller. When he's daydreaming, I managed to laugh heartily at most of them and when he's experiencing his real-life adventures, I marveled at how he's experiencing something he'll probably never do again but will now have tales to tell to future friends or family members. And Kristen Wiig does well in a more straight role that's much different from her more familiar cartoonish parts, like her recent turn in Anchorman 2, and has the same awkward vibe that matches well with Stiller's character. I also loved her singing of that David Bowie song in one of Mitty's dreams. My movie theatre-working friend thought the whole thing may have been too weird for his tastes but I liked it fine and wouldn't mind seeing it again. So on that note, I recommend this version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",7,5,8,9 January 2014
Stardust," Stardust is an underrated humorous fairy tale of the summer movie season
","While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide 'in the closet' to protect his 'reputation'! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.",10,25,33,7 September 2007
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place is one of the most awesome films of this year!
","After seeing the trailer several times and also reading some of the good reviews, I finally decided to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend just now. Starring real-life husband-and-wife actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt with John also directing, they head a family out in a farmland with, it seems, no one else around except some creatures that seem to be not of this world. The title is accurate as this family has to avoid speaking to each other except in whispered tones and most noise making has to be avoided except to make a louder one over unavoidable ones to counter them in order to be one step ahead of these creatures...I'll just say that me and my friend found the whole thing quite intense and enjoyable. In fact, we found A Quiet Place AWESOME! So, yes, that's a high recommendation for it.",10,6,15,12 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Though I remember enjoying the previous Matt Damon-Bourne movies, they weren't fresh enough to keep me from enjoying The Bourne Legacy as well
","While I had previously seen the Matt Damon-Bourne movies and remember enjoying them, I had watched them once when they came out and therefore can't remember specific details. So it was in seeing this new one with Jeremy Renner as the lead but as a different character from Damon's that I approached this one with a fresh perspective in following what was going on and why. So on that note, I enjoyed this one just as much as the others maybe even a little more since this one doesn't have the shaky-cam the others had. And I also liked Rachel Weisz as the doctor who escaped from her lab after an associate of hers was killing the other lab partners. And I loved seeing Renner and her together just running to survive whether through Maryland (which is where I'm currently vacationing right now) or the Philippines which is where my mom and late dad originally came from and my sisters had visited when they were little but I and my brother have yet to go to. It's possible I might have been a little more critical of this movie if I, like many reviewers on this site, had nearly perfect memory of those previous Bourne movies but as it is now, I highly enjoyed The Bourne Legacy.",8,38,63,12 September 2012
22 Jump Street," Maybe because of my lowered expectations, I slightly enjoyed 22 Jump Street more than its predecessor
","Okay, I looked at my review of the previous 21 Jump Street movie and found out I gave it a 5 and said it lost steam in the last 20 minutes. Well, here the humor was unevenly scattered throughout but I actually enjoyed it a little more as it went on since I didn't really expect to be blown away this time. I mean, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum seem to be having a good time still and I wasn't in the most discriminating mood this time watching with my movie theatre-working friend. So I guess I maybe liked this one a little better because of my lowered expectations is what I'm saying. Certainly the end credits was something creative that was pleasantly unexpected so there was that...",6,2,7,16 June 2014
Cars 2," Pixar's reputation doesn't deserve to be declining because of Cars 2's not being as creatively nourishing as before with the other movies
","You know, I had a feeling Pixar was going to have a backlash going against them someday and wasn't too surprised it was during the release of Cars 2, but I didn't think it would seem a 180 degree like I've assumed from many negative comments about this movie I've read here and other sites. Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, when I saw the trailer for this one and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) made that joke about the pope-mobile and about having 'average intelligence', I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. But now that I have, I'll now say that I highly enjoyed this almost as much as I've enjoyed the previous ones made by this highly creative company. Action scenes are great, there are plenty of humorous moments that are easily laughable mostly concerning Mater, and I liked the additions of Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as British spies mistaking Mater for a fellow agent. And Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen is still useful as a character despite not being on screen as much as in the previous Cars. So on that note, I highly recommend Cars 2 to anyone who's willing to not let Pixar's reputation bring them down simply because this one isn't as creatively nourishing as those previous others. P.S. I also had a nice laugh when Brent Musburger became the voice of Brent Mustangburger.",8,1,2,29 June 2011
The Game," David Fincher's The Game gets another fine performance from star Michael Douglas
","Just watched this suspense thriller directed by David Fincher and starring Michael Douglas on HD DVD. Douglas is a broker in San Francisco who's about to have a birthday coming up. His brother Sean Penn gives him a present in the form of a possible membership in a company with the initials C.R.S. I'll stop there and just say that while things get unbelievably ridiculous, one gets curious anyway because of how one just wants see what they would do next. Fine supporting performances by Deborah Kara Unger as 'Christine', Armin Mueller-Stahl, and James Rebhorn as someone connected with C.R.S. in more ways than one. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend The Game.",8,3,4,24 December 2011
Gran Torino," Gran Torino is a fine showcase for Clint Eastwood's supposed final performance
","Clint Eastwood is Walt Kawalski, a Korean War vet who never completely got over the killings he had to do during that time so that probably contributed to the estrangement of his own adult kids' families. When he ends up having to deal with an Asian family from the Hmong area who live next door, however, because of the teenage son's attempt to steal his prized car whose title is this movie's name, Walt feels a bond that grows complicated when a gang (one of whose members is the family's cousin) tries to bully this son and his sister. As this brother and sister, Be Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor give pretty good performances considering their inexperience before the camera. The same goes for many of the other Hmong players. And Clint is fine making this somewhat racist character lovable because of his sense of honor and decency. In fact, the most humorously edgy scene concerns Eastwood, Vang, and a barber played by John Carroll Lynch as Walt tries to prepare Thao for suitable-if politically incorrect-male adult conversation. I also loved the conversation between Walt and Sue after he picked her up from a near-assault from a black gang. If this is indeed Mr. Eastwood's final acting performance, he certainly couldn't have picked a better role to leave on. And his direction is for the most part fine as well. So for me, that's definitely a recommendation for Gran Torino.",9,3,8,26 January 2009
Shrek the Third," Shrek the Third is pretty entertaining for another sequel
","When I saw the previews for Shrek the Third, part of me felt a little of the 'been there, done that' emotion simply because, having enjoyed the first two Shrek films with the constant pop-culture references and turning clichés upside down, I felt the plot of this one give the vibe of predictability. The movie, however, made the most of advancing the characters to some kind of maturity that seemed, for the most part, natural. Like the title character's impending fatherhood and his nightmare version of it that parodies Rosemary's Baby. Or Shrek's wisecracks and wisdom that surfaces during the spoofs of overblown Broadway musicals. I loved Eric Idle as an aged Merlin and Shrek's heart-to-heart with Arthur that had the beginning of 'That's What Friends Are For' playing. Also loved the body switches of Donkey and Puss-in-Boots and seeing the other fairy-tale princess in kick butt mode. So while not as hilarious as the first two Shrek films, this third one is still entertaining enough for me to recommend to the whole family. And stay for the 'Thank For Letten Me Be Mice Elf Agin' sequence during the credits. Thanks, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett, Larry King, Regis Philbin, Amy Poehler, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri, Maya Rudolph, Eric Idle, Justin Timberlake and all the other voices for making Shrek the Third as entertaining as possible!",7,0,2,19 May 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is both thrilling and touching
","Just watched this in IMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this sequel to the Spider-Man reboot series. Andrew Garfield once again is fine as Peter Parker and it's nice to see Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is still full of spunk as his love. Jamie Foxx is quite compelling as the main villain, Electro. Having a somewhat different background for Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was also interesting. Quite lots of great action abounded but there's quite a touching denouement concerning Peter and Gwen that made both of us cry. I, myself, was thrilled to both see another Stan Lee cameo and hear the Spider-Man theme from the '60s TV animated show represented as a cell phone ring. So on that note, yes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is highly recommended.",9,4,16,12 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Future Part III was a fine way to end the series
","Yesterday, me and my movie theatre-working friend rewatched all three Back to the Future films for a one-time-only showing. Since the second one partially took place on October 21, 2015-that became the reason for that particular day's reshowing of them all. Anyway, this one focuses on Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) traveling to 1885 to search for his pal Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who seemed to accidentally end up there at the end of the last one. Also, in this one, Doc falls for a teacher named Clara (Mary Steenburgen). Oh, and Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson return to play their character's ancestors. After the last one was almost devoid of laughs, this one has quite a bit of them with much of the touching sentiment mostly missing from the previous entry. And the message Doc says at the end is quite pertinent, if I say so myself! So on that note, Back to the Future Part III is well worth seeing.",9,3,3,22 October 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Case of Benjamin Button provided a unique performance from Brad Pitt
","While my friend wanted to watch this movie because he's a big fan of Brad Pitt, I was simply more interested in the premise and the fact it was shot in my neighboring city of New Orleans whose scenery is breathtaking here (the fact that present scenes are set during Hurricane Katrina was also a fine dramatic touch). Pitt is quite touching as a man aging backwards in time and I loved the romantic scenes with both Tilda Swinton as the middle-aged wife of a spy and Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend Daisy especially her dancing scenes. Those scenes on the tug boat with that tattoo captain were also good especially the wartime sequences. If there's one quibble, it's that I didn't see enough of Queenie's daughter to really discern how she got along with either her mother or her brother Ben. Otherwise, this was a fine piece of work from director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth who mined similar adapted territory when he previously worked on Forest Gump.",9,3,6,29 December 2008
Magic Mike XXL," While not as entertaining as its predecessor, Magic Mike XXL still has some good moments
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Once again, this sequel to Magic Mike has a meandering quality that one may not be patient with and for a while, I was thinking this wasn't going anywhere. Still, me and my friend were intrigued enough to keep watching and by the end sequence, we were still reasonably entertained by the stripping performances. There were three good scenes here: first, there was a sequence of one of the 'male entertainers' performing at the convenience store in order to make the female cashier smile. Second, there was Andie MacDowell's Southern charm when talking to them. And third, when Amber Heard gets the ride of her life with Channing Tatum on stage. So on that note, Magic Mike XXL is at the least, worth a look.",6,1,9,8 July 2015
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures is a fine story of the African-American women who were valuable to the NASA space program of the early '60s
","This movie tells a story of NASA's space program of the early '60s that hadn't been told before: that of several black women-with three showcased here-doing some behind-the-scenes math calculations or figuring out the new IBM operations of their computers as the country is readying the flight of the first American man in space, John Glenn. Taraji P. Henson especially shines as Katherine G. Johnson, who was so advanced in her chosen profession that she graduated from college early and eventually was the one who figured the right distance for Glenn's mission to succeed. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae are fine in their roles as well. Nothing more to say except, I highly recommend Hidden Figures. This review is dedicated in memory of the late John Glenn.",9,5,13,19 January 2017
Coco," Coco is one of the best of the Disney/Pixar animated films yet!
","WOW! That's the one word I have for this latest Disney/Pixar computer-animated feature. Based on Mexican folklore, Coco is quite a wondrous display of storytelling, music, images, and touching drama. It concerns a boy who wants to play music against his family's wishes which would be because of an ancestor who abandoned his family for a career in such a profession. We think his ancestor was one person but turns out to be another...oh, just watch and be very touched especially when the song 'Remember Me' is performed. In fact, that's the best song in this and I wouldn't be surprised if that won an Oscar next year! I really don't want to say anymore, just that I highly recommend Coco.",10,9,24,6 December 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was another fine computer animated treat
","As many of you reading my comments can attest, I love animation. So with that said, you probably won't be surprised when I say I loved Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! What a wonderful premise of having a town called Swallow Falls, which mostly has been left behind with just sardines as food for the townspeople, and having the inventor who previously was mocked invent something that provides alternative food choices at a drop from the sky. Good voice is provided by such 'SNL' cast members as Andy Samberg, Will Forte, and as the inventor, Bill Hader. Anna Faris voices the weatherperson who follows the town's progress. And, in a wonderful surprise, Mr. T is the policeman whose son gets a special gift from Hader's scientist. Also cast are Neil Patrick Harris, Benjamin Bratt, and as Hader's father, James Caan. Gags flow smoothly from sequence to sequence with no distracting pop culture references, like that of the last Shrek movie. While hilarious, it's also touching near the end. Oh, and it's always a treat when the Columbia Torch Lady gets a humorous treatment at the beginning...",9,2,3,24 September 2009
Lincoln," Daniel Day-Lewis made a fine Abe in Steven Spielberg's Lincoln
","Just watched this with Mom and my movie theatre-working friend. We all were pretty enchanted by Daniel Day-Lewis' characterization of the 16th president of the United States. Seeing his struggles in getting the 13th Amendment-that's meant to abolish slavery-passed provided most of the drama though there was also some pertinent conflict between Abe and wife Mary (Sally Field) about the death of one son and the about-to-enlist-status of another son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Then there's Tommy Lee Jones as anti-slavery congressman Thaddeus Stevens as he admirably takes charge of his scenes whenever he's on screen. Steven Spielberg really outdoes himself this time in depicting the administration's dilemma during a time of war and a divided country. So on that note, I highly recommend Lincoln.",10,5,12,20 November 2012
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the best pictures of 2004
","I've now seen this movie twice. The first time was in the theatre after it won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Clint Eastwood), Best Actress (Hilary Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). The last was hours ago on HD DVD with my parents. My dad thought it dragged a little while my mom thought it was about more than boxing and liked the slow passages. In between the drama with the three stars, there's some humor involving Clint and Morgan as well as with Morgan and some of the other boxing hopefuls including a really enthusiastic kid who initially calls Freeman the 'N' word but says he doesn't really mean it. Morgan's character also narrates the story in what is revealed to be a letter to Eastwood's long-estranged daughter who we never see. The movie does take its own sweet time and makes Paul Haggis' dialogue shine throughout. Since I've only seen one of the other Best Picture Oscar nominees of 2004 (The Aviator), I can't judge if this was indeed the finest of that year. However, Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the most compelling.",10,3,7,5 January 2008
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous spooky good time!
","Saw The Nightmare Before Christmas a couple of days ago with a friend who was a little down in the dumps. Neither of us had seen this before so it was a pleasant surprise for both of us as we put on our 3-D glasses to watch Tim Burton's classic stop-motion animated film. Technically, Burton didn't direct this since he was busy making Batman Returns at the time but even with Henry Selick listed as director you can see Tim's hand-prints in every frame. With a voice cast that includes Paul Reubens (as Lock), Catherine O'Hara (as heroine Sally and Shock), William Hickey (as Dr. Finkelstein), Chris Sarandon (as leading character Jack Skellington), Ken Page (as the scene stealing Ooogie Boogie), and Danny Elfman, who's also composer of the movie's songs (as the singing voice of Skellington, Barrel, and the Clown with the Tear away Face), this is one of the most humorously spooky movies I've ever seen. What Jack does to Christmas, you have to see to believe! While the 3-D was impressive in the beginning, I forgot about it after a while and just let the story and music entertain me. My favorite part concerned the Halloweentown band trying to do their version of 'Here Comes Santa Claus' which ends up sounding pretty somber! So for anyone interested in Burton's version of a Holloween/Christmas hybrid, The Nightmare Before Christmas may be for you!",8,1,1,8 November 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. makes a fine dramatized documentary
","In making Good Night, and Good Luck., director George Clooney has made a nearly perfect dramatization of the issues legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (perfectly played by David Straithain) had with the 'junior senator from Wisconsin', Joseph R. McCarthy and the way he tried to 'infiltrate' Communists in the United States. There's also some suspense when one of Murrow's assistants receives some info from an associate of McCarthy that accuses Murrow of having some 'Red' connections himself. That assistant, played by Robert Downey, Jr., tells the associate that no one would believe him since publicly, Murrow has proved to the public what a patriot he was since his radio reports from Britain since World War II! Clooney acquits himself nicely taking the supporting part of Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. One Friendly scene that really impressed me was an argument with a Colonel (played by '24's Glen Morshower) whose military base had basically fired a soldier named Milo Radulovich because of his father's Communist sympathies branding the son as a 'risk'. The Colonel did not want that story to air. While many of Straithain's lines as Murrow came verbatim from many of 'See It Now's transcripts, there are some liberties taken with when some events took place (like when the Army-McCarthy hearings were on live, Ed was not doing his other show, 'Person to Person' since that show aired on primetime and the hearings were on the afternoons). Also, seeing Diane Reeves performing her jazz stylings in rehearsal at an adjacent CBS soundstage throughout the movie was obviously meant to ironically comment on many events depicted here such as 'How High the Moon' coming before Murrow eulogizes on a fellow newsman's death (that of Don Hollenbeck who's played by Ray Wise). The screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov (who plays a young Don Hewit here), contained enough info to explain why Murrow felt the way he did about the senator and why his boss, CBS chairman Bill Paley (Frank Langella) who Ed is on a first-name basis with, would initially support him before complaining of an 'upset stomach' concerning the newsman's point-of-view. Other good performances come from Jeff Daniels as a liaison between Murrow and 'See It Now's sponsor, Alcoa (by the way, check out the irony between the 'glamorous' smoking of many of the characters and the way 'Person to Person's sponsor, Kent Cigarattes, tells you how good smoking is in addressing viewers skepticism of many TV messages!) and, as a Louisiana resident who loves to point out performers from the Pelican state, New Orleans native Patricia Clarkson as another Murrow employee who's secretly married to Downey. If there's some quibble with this movie, it's with the long footage devoted to accused 'Communist spy' Annie Lee Moss which almost stops the movie though Murrow's explanation at the end does make some points. So to anyone interested in this fascinating piece of television news history, I highly recommend Good Night, and Good Luck.",9,0,0,13 September 2008
Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6 was a very awesome Disney animated experience!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this twice before and liked it very much. So did I after viewing this-what an awesome display of a bunch of science nerds becoming superheros after some tragic occurrences that happen early on. Baymax, a rubber robot, is also on hand to help his human counterparts to set things right. I didn't watch this in 3-D so when certain scenes came on, I winced a little in not being able to do so. Still, this was such a great mix of humor and action and had very likable characters, I mostly didn't care, one way or another! I mean, this was quite an awesome experience, I was simply just glad for the ride! So on that note, Big Hero 6 is highly recommended. Oh, and don't miss the after-ending credits sequence, it's a great hoot!",10,32,50,24 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," As a Star Wars fan, I highly recommend The Last Jedi
","I had been a kid growing up watching the original Star Wars trilogy from the late '70/early '80s in movie theatres during their first release so I know about the excitement that often greets these movies though I also admit I've only watched Episode II when it came to the prequel trilogy. So it's that in mind that I write this review of the second in the latest trilogy and declare this was even better than The Force Awakens. First, Mark Hamill makes a welcome return as Luke Skywalker though not having the same attitudes as his previous portrayal. I actually found this quite refreshing as it gave Hamill new nuances of his characterization. I also liked many of the new characters introduced here. Also, John Williams has not lost his touch in once again scoring another series entry. He's always the best at what he's done and this is no exception! And finally, the late Carrie Fisher does herself proud in playing Princess General Leia one more time. I especially liked her scene with Luke near the end. Great final scene with both together one last time. So, overall, I loved The Last Jedi and have no hesitation saying so!",10,27,91,21 December 2017
Brave," Brave is another highly entertaining computer animated feature from Disney/Pixar
","Another year, another highly enjoyable Disney/Pixar computer animated feature for the summer. In this one, Princess Merida does NOT want to be chosen for marriage to whoever wins the archery contest as she just wants to be the victor of said contest for herself. Her mother, on the other hand, keeps trying to mold her into what is expected of the certain female royal offspring when she grows up. I'll stop there and just say that what happens after what I just described brings quite of bit of uneasiness between the two but also brings them together and changes both for the better. Not as many laughs as in previous Pixar movies but there are some awesome thrills and quite a touching climax that I really don't want to reveal here. Really, all I'll say is Pixar has done it again with Brave. So, yes, that's a high recommendation!",9,2,4,26 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy was another awesome Marvel movie
","Unlike previous Marvel films, I wasn't familiar with the characters of Guardians of the Galaxy from the comic books. But it was a nice surprise to watch what they're all about in the way they're depicted here. Plenty of awesome action and some funny lines and scenes abound. What really got me going was the various recordings from the '70s of popular songs that I recalled highly enjoying listening to on AM radio back in the day! Hearing mention of the original Footloose and that movie's star, Kevin Bacon, was also awesome! Also such was the by-now-familiar Stan Lee cameo and seeing someone like Glenn Close taking a role here. So on that note, I highly recommend Guardians of the Galaxy.",8,3,9,11 August 2014
The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game was perhaps the best film of last year
","Me and my mom just watched this on Netflix disc and we both enjoyed this very much. It tells of Alan Turing's attempts at breaking the German Enigma code during World War II with his team of associates including a woman named Joan played by Keira Knightly. Both she and Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles. Ms. Knightly is very touching and charismatic as the woman who seems to be one of the few people who could socialize with Alan on an equal basis. Turing's later tragic circumstances are heartbreaking especially when it's revealed how it all ended for him. Times were very different then as the Supreme Court ruling of the last few days can attest. In summary, me and Mom thought that this film, instead of Birdman, was the true Best Picture of last year.",10,0,3,28 June 2015
Caddyshack," Caddyshack was a fine showcase for Chase, Murray, Knight, and Dangerfield
","So after watching Animal House and Meatballs again after so many years, I decided to rewatch this third consecutive movie co-written by Harold Ramis of which this time he also directed. I'm talking, of course, about Caddyshack which is also the third movie I'm reviewing in order that stars a member-or in this case two-of 'Saturday Night Live'. They are Chevy Chase and Bill Murray with the latter stealing many scenes as the groundskeeper who is constantly trying to rid the golf course of a gopher who likes to dance. He also fantasizes about being in the tournament and has dreams about old ladies. There's also a great scene with a bishop played by Henry Wilcoxon as he and Murray play while the rain falls down and music from The Ten Commandments (1956) is heard as the score. (Incidentally, that music not only links Wilcoxon to his previous role in that C. B. DeMille epic but that score's composer, Elmer Bernstein, links him to the previous movies I mentioned at the start of this review.) Anyway, Chase is himself witty whether counseling caddy Danny (Michael O'Keefe) on his golf swing, seducing Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), sharing grass with Murray, or subtly insulting Judge Smails (Ted Knight in an excellent slow burn role). Then there's the lovably obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield with his brash insults that light up every scene he's in. It's hard to believe this was only the second time he's appeared in a feature film as he's a delight throughout especially when pitted against Knight. And besides Ramis, his co-scripter from Animal House-Douglas Kenney, and Brian Doyle-Murray-Bill's brother-contributed many funny scenes and lines. By the way, Doyle-Murray, another SNL alum, also appears as an employer of the country club. And there's one more connection to Animal House: Sarah Holcomb, who was the 13-year-old cashier there, became the Irish-accented waitress who almost got pregnant by Danny here. Perhaps the weakest subplot but at least it got short shrift here. Anyway, while not perfect, Caddyshack is still one of the most hilarious comedies to come out from former SNL players during this era. P.S. I feel honored to mention fellow Chicago natives Harold Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Cindy Morgan, not to mention Brian's brother Bill from nearby Wilmette, in my review. And that animatronic gopher is actually credited as being played by a 'Chuck Rodent'!",9,1,1,29 June 2010
Here Comes the Boom," Kevin James' Here Comes the Boom is a pretty good dramady
","Just saw this Kevin James comedy with my movie theatre-working friend. Mr. James usually does lots of slapstick stunts in his movies and he does a few here too but he's actually a bit more subdued as well as his role is that of a high school biology teacher who's trying to raise lots of money to save a fellow instructor's job-that of Henry Winkler's music teacher. Seeing The former Fonz-30 years after 'Happy Days'-playing such a different role wasn't so surprising to me as I remember when he played a version of Scrooge named Benedict Slade in 'An American Christmas Carol' so long ago on TV. Anyway, like I said, the only time James does some stunts is when he's in the ring fighting to raise the necessary funds for his friend. So while this was not a non-stop hilarious movie, it still had some good amusing moments here and there. Another good turn came from the Filipino singer Charice as a student of his who, yes, does a number near the end. And Salma Hayek is okay as James' love interest. So on that note, Here Comes the Boom gets a recommendation from me.",7,5,10,25 October 2012
Jurassic World," Jurassic World was a worthy sequel in the series though I only previously watched The Lost World before this one
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, who had seen this a couple of times before. I myself had read Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park and seen The Lost World but not the other two movies in the series. I thought most of the action sequences were awesome. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard certainly had some chemistry with their back-and-forth dialogue. The fact that Ms. Howard got to save Chris in one scene was also cool to see. The boy teen and his younger brother were also fine when they were dealing with the chaos around them. Reading the notes on this site, I was pleasantly surprised that this was partly shot in New Orleans, where I live a two-hour drive from, in the abandoned Six Flags park there and some other buildings there. Oh, and knowing Jimmy Buffett makes a cameo was something I knew beforehand but my friend didn't so he was surprised when I told him. In summary, Jurassic World was a worthy sequel to watch.",8,22,55,15 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," The Adjustment Bureau has an intriguing premise that seemed only partially successful in execution
","Knowing this was adapted from a Philip K. Dick story, I knew that the premise of this movie was a little out there. Matt Damon plays a career politician who loses an election and accidentally encounters a pretty woman entering the men's room. She's played by Emily Blunt and we later find out she's a ballet dancer with ambitions of her own. Both seem smitten but there's these men in business suits and hats that are attempting to prevent this romance from blossoming. Why? Well, it seems there are some plans involved from up above...Quite entertaining what with the story, dialogue, acting, and an exciting chase though I did wonder if there really was a point to all the exposition that resulted. Still, it wasn't too bad and I'll maybe watch this again one day so on that note, The Adjustment Bureau is worth a look.",6,3,4,23 September 2011
World Trade Center," Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is fine tribute of two survivors from that day
","On this, the sixth anniversary of the day the Twin Towers got attacked, I bought and watched World Trade Center in order to put me in tribute mode. This Oliver Stone film tells the story of Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and their survival under layers of rubble for hours after the bombing. Almost as compelling as Pena and Cage are Maggie Gyllenhaal and Mario Bello as their wives as they go through various emotions (though, surprisingly, very few confrontational ones) as they wait for news of their spouses' fate. While there's some flashbacks and dream sequences (like the Jesus one concerning Jimeno), this is mostly straightforward storytelling that's a bit unusual for Stone in that his point-of-view here is less obvious than you'd expect from him. While not a great film, World Trade Center certainly still has both touching and intense moments that make this essential viewing for anyone wanting to see an optimistic view of an event that could have made pessimists of both protagonists had things took a turn for the worst. Excellent jobs for everyone involved! Update 9/12/08: Having just survived a tree falling on the roof of my parents' house during Hurricane Gustav, I now think those men that survived being stuck under debris for hours during 9/11 deserve nothing but all the praise they've gotten and more. I now revoke much of my next-to-last statement.",8,1,3,11 September 2007
The Hangover Part II," The Hangover Part II is what you'd expect of a sequel: not as good but not so bad either
","I just watched this sequel to The Hangover with my two brothers-in-law on Netflix disc. Like the previous one that I also saw with them (though it was the second time for me), we all laughed at much of the same places though not always. We all agreed it wasn't as good as the first one but we all enjoyed it just the same. Really, the same leads of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and especially Zack Galifianakis, had some funny lines and scenes, just not as much previously. Also, the return of Ken Jeong and a certain boxer also were some highlights but because some of the surprise was gone, not as compellingly funny. But, really, if you liked the first one, I don't think you'll be wasting any time viewing the second one. Just don't get your expectations too high...",7,0,1,29 December 2011
Prisoners," Prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about the way things eventually turn out
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.",8,1,1,25 September 2013
Logan," Logan is a more than excellent final chapter of the Wolverine saga!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.",10,8,16,15 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Ultron was another awesome epic from Marvel Studios!
","Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!",9,10,28,5 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Genndy Tartakovsky and some 'SNL' veterans provide much clever humor in Hotel Transylvania
","This is the first feature animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky. I knew of him previously from his work on Cartoon Network's 'Samurai Jack' which I remember being quite amused by. So now he's made this computer-animated one about Dracula and his daughter and his attempts to keep her from encountering some humans since he's very much prejudiced against them which gets a good explanation as the film goes on. I'll stop there and just say how funny and touching the whole thing was which wasn't surprising since not only was Tartakovsky involved but a lot of former 'SNL'ers which not only included co-writer Robert Smigel but also the voices of Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Andy Samberg, and Chris Parnell. Oh, and one of my favorite lines concerns how the Dracula character is appalled by how some people think his kind says 'Bla, bla, bla'. How hilarious! Okay, so on that note, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania.",8,1,6,9 October 2012
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight was another awesome Batman movie from Christopher Nolan
","Before I comment on the movie proper, I'd like to mention two things: One, the person I went with-who works at this particular theatre and saw the midnight premiere-thought the bank manager role was played by Jimmy Smits but I immediately recognized him as William Fichtner from 'Invasion', the TV series he did with Eddie Cibrian. Also, when the Joker was threatening Rachel Dawes, it was the only time I was taken out of the picture since I said aloud that he was threatening Jake Gyllenhaal's sister with my friend mentioning her name since we both saw Heath Ledger and Jake in Brokeback Moutain a few years ago. Ledger is fine as the main villain though I stop at saying he's better than Jack Nicholson in the role or deserves an Oscar nomination though it would be fine if he did. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend though I remember liking Holmes fine too. And Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Dawes' new beau, is also fine with his initial role as 'white knight' district attorney later turning into what would become known as Two-Face. And I loved having Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler having a previous background in the battling jungles of Burma so he can tell his master of his dilemma there. Throw in Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and you've almost got a perfect movie. Certainly, Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader is even better here than in Batman Begins and he is to me, like many viewers, The absolute Dark Knight here. While the movie may be longish in spots, Christopher Nolan lets it be that way so he can make us really care for the characters. I certainly was very touched by the sacrifices the new Commissoner Gordon, as played by Gary Oldman, had to make throughout the picture especially when he had to deal with Two-Face and his family's peril near the end. So the many who went to see this once and want to do it again, what are you waiting for? P.S. Having not recognized Anthony Micheal Hall previously, I'll have to look for him the next time I watch which may be soon too!",9,5,11,21 July 2008
Toy Story," The recent 3-D version of Toy Story just adds to a great experience!
","When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in 'You've Got a Friend in Me' that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can!",10,0,0,26 October 2009
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond is a compelling drama about historical events
","Blood Diamond is a compelling dramatization of events in Sierra Leone in the late '90s concerning 'conflict diamonds' that are used to finance war in African regions. Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou are fine as the smuggler and fisherman who reluctantly team up to achieve their own goals of survival and destination. Jennifer Connelly has the more difficult role of a reporter who explains what info she needs and serves as something of a romantic interest for DiCaprio but thankfully something tragic happens before it could come to fruition... Hounsou is especially good when he finds nearly all of his family except for his most cherished child: his son. And the accent and weariness of DiCaprio's character shows how far he's gone in prominence since his heartthrob days in Titanic. Both got well deserved Oscar nominations (though I think DiCaprio's should have been in the other film he made that year: Martin Scorsese's The Departed). Director Edward Zwick, best known for TV's 'Thirtysomething' and 'Once and Again', brings a compelling pace throughout. Well recommended for anyone interested in the events this movie depicts.",8,0,1,15 February 2007
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain deserves all the accolades it gets and more!
","'What a glorious feeling I'm happy again!' That's the feeling I got watching this again on DVD-after 30 years of last seeing it. Gene Kelly's title number is sublime and deserves it's iconic status. Donald O'Connor deserves his place in film musical history by his 'Make 'Em Laugh' number alone. (Never mind that the song is a partial steal from Cole Porter's 'Be a Clown'.) Young Debbie Reynolds does well with such polished hoofers. Jean Hagen is hilarious as the vain and egotistical movie star. The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, who's also the producer, are entertainingly performed. And the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen is just perfect not to mention the original screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green! Nothing more to say except, Singin' in the Rain is indeed perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made! P.S. Great commentary on the track of the DVD in which Ms. Reynolds intros various members of cast and crew and others making their comments. Oh, and it's a shame it was only nominated for two Oscars-none for Best Picture: Ms. Hagen for Best Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton for Scoring of a Musical Picture. At least Donald O'Connor got a Golden Globe (as Best Actor-Musical or Comedy) for it. The eventual winner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards for 1952 was The Greatest Show on Earth which I'm reviewing next...",10,1,3,4 August 2015
Puss in Boots," Puss in Boots is another entertaining Dreamworks animated movie
","From the Shrek movies comes the Puss in Boots character voiced by Antonio Banderas with all the charm one expects from the character with the addition of Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zack Galifianakis) also joining for a fun ride of trying to avoid being pursued by Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). Many funny scenes and lines but also much dramatically compelling close calls abound especially in 3-D. Many amusing mixups of various fairy tales with 'Jack and the Beanstalk' being mostly used as source. If you were among the disappointed (I wasn't by the way) when watching the last 2 Shrek movies, this one may make you forgive the Dreamworks animation factory. So on that note, I highly recommend Puss in Boots.",8,37,59,29 October 2011
Elysium," Elysium gets a high recommendation from me
","Since my movie theatre-working friend was off today, and this was the only movie I hadn't seen that was still playing that I wanted to see, this was what we chose. We both thought it was better than expected with plenty of great action scenes, a good Sci-Fi story, and many fine emotional moments concerning a lady friend of Matt Damon and her daughter that he ends up helping in a big way. Oh, and Jodie Foster as one of the villains was also quite compelling to watch. Things move along at quite a fast pace but not too much so that you couldn't understand what's going on if you pay close attention to the quite descriptive dialogue. So on that note, I highly recommend Elysium.",10,14,28,10 September 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is his compelling version of a literary classic
","Just watched this movie with my movie theatre working friend this afternoon. This Tim Burton version of the famous Alice books by Lewis Caroll is quite visually stunning, especially in 3-D, but that should come as no surprise to anyone who's seen any of Burton's movies. As the title character, Mia Wasikowska is luminous in her presence and provides an appealing spunk to her characterization. Of course, regular players Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter provide their own unique charms as The Mad Hatter and The Red Queen, respectively, while Anne Hathaway is perfectly ingratiating as The White Queen. Another Burton regular, Danny Elfman, provides another resonating complimentary music score. Oh, and I was wonderfully surprised to find out that Stayne-The Knave of Hearts was played by Crispin Glover who I mainly remember as Marty McFly's father in the first Back to the Future. In other words, I was quite enchanted by this latest version of Alice in Wonderland. So on that note, that's a recommendation...",8,3,11,8 March 2010
Avatar," James Cameron does it again with Avatar!
","Just finished watching this movie with my mom and aunt. They both liked it but were also-especially on Mom's part-a little dizzy from all the 3-D action sequences. Director James Cameron's script-while not really Oscar worthy-certainly moves the story along to the point that you're riveted almost throughout the whole thing. (I have to admit here that during some of the beginning live action sequences, I fell asleep but I managed to be awake when the first computer animated scene came on and stayed so afterwards.) Sigorney Weaver is certainly compelling as the scientist character and it was a nice to see Michelle Rodriguez, who I last watched on 'Lost', as a heroic pilot. And how awesome were many of those creatures in the jungle, not to mention those action sequences that climaxed the movie! Okay, so on that note, Avatar is definitely worth seeing.",9,1,14,13 January 2010
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 is nearly as consistently entertaining as it's predecessor
","Like the original Toy Story, I first saw the sequel when it originally came out and it happened to be a birthday wish I had to watch it. Not as consistently funny as the first but it was still very entertaining with basically Buzz and Woody changing roles and attitudes and new characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete adding to the appealing characters lineup. Also, Randy Newman added some new songs like the wistfully sad one called 'When She Loved Me' sung by Sarah McLachlan or the 'Woody's Roundup' TV show theme performed by Riders in the Sky. The additional characters are voiced by such familiar talents like Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, and as Al of Al's Toy Barn, Wayne Knight. Like I said, it takes a while before the laughs came but when they did, they provided more fun entertainment for the recent 3-D double feature of this and the original Toy Story that I just rewatched with my movie theatre working friend. So on that note, rush to this and its predecessor as soon as you can! P.S. My friend that I just mentioned noticed a character mention our current hometown of Baton Rouge in the airport scene. R.I.P Jim Varney and Robert Goulet who warbled 'You've Got a Friend in Me' at the end. And those 'bloopers' during the end credits are still sooooo hilarious!",9,0,1,26 October 2009
Selma," Selma is a fine account of the struggle for voting rights for blacks during the '60s
","Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were enthralled with David Oyelowo's performance of playing the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as both a human being and great speaker. Carmen Ejogo-who I didn't remember seeing playing the same role in Boycott back in 2001-was also fine as his wife Coretta especially when she asked something concerning his supposed affairs. I was also impressed with Tom Wilkinson as a President Lyndon Johnson who seemed reluctant to deal with the voting rights march in Selma as something to deal with head on but seemed on the way to all out support by the end. In summary, Selma was quite a fine historical drama about a very important moment in civil rights history.",9,5,12,11 January 2015
Grindhouse," Grindhouse is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for Tarantino/Rodriguez fans
","Wow! Grindhouse is one of the most awesome movie theatre experiences in my life of 39 years! This Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez joint effort is the closest I'll ever come to what it was like to see a double feature from the '70s of exploitation movie fare. The first thing shown is a bogus trailer for something called Machete, a revenge flick about an assassin turning back on his employers after one of them betrays his trust in a surprise shooting. Cheech Marin has an amusing appearance as a priest. 'They've (f-word) the wrong Mexican', indeed! Oh, and it has an X rating (what NC-17 was then). Then just after the rainbow-colored '70s 'Our Feature Presentation' intro with the funky music (boy, does that bring back childhood memories!), Rose McGowan-looking all hot in her stripper (or go-go) outfit-dances oh so sexily during the opening credits for Planet Terror. Also appearing are Freddy Rodriguez, Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews, Michael Biehn, Marley Shelton, and Stacy Ferguson, better known as Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas. Robert Rodriguez doesn't stint on the gore but many of it looks so fabulously over-the-top entertaining that you can't help but be highly awestruck by it all. Of course, there had to be a missing reel for the sex scene! Oh well, maybe it will be on the DVD! Next, come three 'Prevues of Coming Attractions' (There's that funky music with the psychedelic rainbow colors again!) First, is Werewolf Women of the S.S. with Sybil Danning and Nicholas Cage as a Kung Fu master. Talk about a politically incorrect portrayal of a white playing an Asian! Then comes Don't, a promo for a haunted house horror movie so common during the '70s. Next, is Thanksgiving, a parody of various holiday slasher offerings from the '80s (Halloween, Mother's Day, April Fools' Day, My Bloody Valentine, Silent Night, Deadly Night and let's not forget, Friday the 13th and its sequels...) See the parade turkey get beheaded! See that topless cheerleader get knifed in the anus! (this scene got heavily edited for the MPAA) Perhaps the most sick and hilarious fake trailer there was! Finally, after a cartoon cougar morphed into a Restricted title card, we have Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof (though there is another title that appears briefly before DP crudely appears on a black card). Like many Tarantino movies, this one has many conversations about various pop culture references like the movie Vanishing Point which heavily influenced this movie. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike who likes to kill women either in or with his car. Among some of his victims are Sydney Tamiia Poitier and a blond Rose McGowan. Marley Shelton plays the same character she played in Planet Terror. Then there's a group of stunt women that includes Rosario Dawson and the double for Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill movies, Zoe Bell. The Tarantino dialogue can get a little monotonous here but it's worth it to see the climatic car chase that takes one's breath away. I especially loved the point-of-view shot of Zoe's from the hood of the car. So, in summation, Grindhouse is one of the most exhilarating experiences I've ever had in a movie theater short of actually experiencing a real grindhouse or drive-in. Loved the fake splices and scratches of most of Planet Terror, the previews, and some of Death Proof. Dig Rodriguez's score in his movie and Tarantino's choice of vintage songs in his. Well worth it to experience Grindhouse in a theatre near you! Oh, and Quentin does fine cameos in both movies.",9,1,5,14 April 2007
The Artist," I had two different experiences watching The Artist today and I highly enjoyed them both!
","I just watched this movie twice today. The first time was on Netflix as it was originally presented with Ludovic Bource's score. The second time was at the Baton Rouge Gallery in the first of this year's Music & Movies on the Lawn series with live musical accompaniment by a band called Captain Green. I liked Bource's vintage late-'20s-early-'30s tribute score but I also was entertained by Captain Green's more late-'60s-early-'70s accompaniment especially when they used a couple of Beatles' songs-'Eleanor Rigby' and 'All You Need is Love'-for the climatic scenes. I do have to admit, however, that the sound effects dream sequence and the dialogue scene at the end was more convincing in the original version (since there weren't enough FX and no speaking in the live version). Either way, the performances of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are convincing enough that you root for them all the way and, oh, that dog is such a scene stealer, isn't he? So on that note, The Artist was a great experience for me both times.",10,2,4,25 May 2013
La La Land," La La Land was quite realistic for an original musical but also fantastic in some sequences
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who saw it before and said it was okay. The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy-laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real-life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can't do both. The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are, well, serviceable for their characters. Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end, it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a 'happily ever after' one. So that's a recommendation for La La Land. Oh, and glad it just got 14 Oscar nominations!",9,5,14,25 January 2017
Rio," Rio is one of the best of its kind of this year
","Just watched this computer-animated film in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend, his nephew, and that nephew's friend. We all enjoyed the infectious atmosphere of the story along with the highly enjoyable music-both classical Bossa Nova and original songs-that takes us from the title city to a small town in Minnesota and then back again. The story of a bird poached from his native land who accidentally ends up with a young girl as she grows up during the 15 years that passes before he's summoned by an animal doctor to mate with a female of his breed because of possible extinction is just the start of what I highly consider one of the best of its kind this year so far. And hearing the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, and others just adds to the great fun of the whole thing. Nothing more to say except I highly recommend Rio.",10,8,14,27 April 2011
Invincible," Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are inspirational in Invincible
","I have a friend here in Baton Rouge, La. who was very anxious to see this movie, so for his 38th birthday (which was actually on August 22) I decided to take him to this and pay all admission and concession. From the beginning with Jim Croce's 'I Got a Name' to the exciting end with Vince Papale's triumphant touchdown in his first regular home game, this was one inspirational movie! Mark Wahlberg does a fine job portraying the sad-sack Philadelphian. Greg Kinnear is equally good as a former college football coach taking a chance on an only 'open tryout' player who only did high school games. The best scenes are the ones taking place during the first regular season game at the Dallas Cowboy stadium and then the first regular home game opposite the New York Giants (which Vince's girlfriend Janet supports!). By the way, my birthday friend really enjoyed this movie so on his and my recommendation, by all means seek this one out!",8,6,7,25 August 2006
Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day was one of Harold Ramis' best movies as director
","So after 21 years of only hearing about this movie (though when I worked at a movie theatre at the time, I did manage to watch a few scenes here and there), I finally got to see the whole thing on Netflix disc with my mom who hadn't seen this when it was first released either. She was confused part of the time but she seemed to enjoy it while I knew about the living-the-same-day-over premise the whole time. It's funny seeing Bill Murray at first taking advantage of what he can get away with in going back to what it was before and then experiencing some depression in not going forward before redeeming himself in the process. Andie MacDowell is luminous as his eventual love interest. Chris Elliott has some moments near the end. Bill's brother Brian Doyle-Murray is appropriately boisterous as the groundhog spokesman. And Stephan Tobolowsky is a hoot as this Ned fellow Bill keeps encountering. Harold Ramis did fine as director and co-writer and he provides a nice commentary track on the DVD. Since he died earlier in the year, this review is dedicated in his memory.",9,1,3,3 November 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," How to Train Your Dragon was a wonderfully inspiring animated tale from DreamWorks Animation
","Just watched this 3-D computer animated movie with my movie theatre friend who had seen this a couple of times before. It's an awesome tale of a young man named Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) wanting to become a real Viking like his dad, Stoick (Gerald Butler). But one thing he doesn't want to do is kill dragons especially when he befriends one he names Toothless...While there's some witty lines and some humorous visuals, this was a mainly compellingly stirring adventure tale about standing up for your principals despite the prevailing mood of the crowd. I'll leave it at that and just mention the other voices that were heard here: America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, and, the only one I actually recognized while watching, Craig Ferguson. All of those and others contributed wonderful performances. Special thanks to the writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders for the entire thing, which should come as no surprise since they also did the equally entertaining Lilo and Stitch at Disney back almost 10 years ago. So on that note, I highly recommend How to Train Your Dragon.",9,2,5,5 April 2010
Total Recall," Total Recall was a most enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger-Paul Verhoeven movie
","I just watched Total Recall for the second time though the only things I remember from the first time was when Arnold Schwarzenegger shot Sharon Stone and said, 'Consider that a divorce!' When Michael Ironside had his arms ripped off hanging in that moving elevator and the end. Slow moving at first, things get going real fast when Arnold's character suddenly remembers things even before the people at the Total Recall building put the 'memory' in his mind! From there, it's nothing but fast-paced action and chases as we thrill to see him get his 'identity' back as he has to choose between 'wife' Stone or his more alluring 'fantasy' Rachel Ticotin as they get in one of the coolest catfights in movie history! And how about Michael Ironside and Ronny Cox as the villains? Or the Jerry Goldsmith score? Or the Rob Bottin make up effects like that guy inside of this other guy who helps Arnold's character? Not to mention one of the coolest action/sci-fi directors ever, Paul Verhoeven? Man, I was riveted the whole time and I couldn't believe how enjoyable this was this second time. I don't think I'll forget anything this time around. Certainly not that Johnnycab robot who I just found out was the voice of Robert Picardo who I remember from both 'The Wonder Years' and 'China Beach' during that time. What a funny character that one was especially when he said he didn't know that place when Arnold said, 'Sh--!' I think I've said enough so I'll just say, go see Totall Recall if you haven't and are a fan of Mr. Schwarzenegger.",10,4,10,2 September 2009
Limitless," Bradley Cooper lives up to his Limitless potential as its star
","Since it's been a couple of weeks that I watched this movie, here are my thoughts: Bradley Cooper has now come into his own among compelling movie stars with this, his first film in which he's the whole show. He plays an aspiring novelist who has writer's block. That is, until his former brother-in-law provides him with a drug that helps him functions all parts of his brain. So Cooper does lots of things to the point of him skipping through time and being way over his head when some troubling revelations of his doings come up...Though quite entertaining, some of the logic lapses near the end. Still, with such fine supporting turns from, among others, Abbie Cornish, Anna Friel, and the one and only Robert De Niro, not to mention some trippy camera shots, Limitless is a quite entertaining for the 90 or so minutes that pass.",8,5,9,3 April 2011
Beauty and the Beast," This new version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast seemed just as excellent as the previous animated version
","For weeks, part of me dreaded watching this mostly literal Disney live-action remake of its deservedly praised and Oscar-nominated animated version from 1991. Now that I've seen it, I was mostly enthralled with what I saw. The songs are as well-performed as ever and the added ones don't make the movie too long. The CGI used to animate the inanimate objects were also pretty charming. And the actors cast for the story were very compelling to watch. I remember crying in several spots, that's how much I enjoyed it. And the Dolby screen I saw it on was also a wonderful treat for me and my movie theatre-working friend who had watched it before but not on Dolby. There were some added lines that explained some things more clearly so that was another thing I liked about this version. To tell the truth, I'd probably have to watch the other version again to make comparisons so for now I'd say I like each version equally. So that's a high recommendation of this version of Beauty and the Beast.",10,4,13,6 April 2017
Some Like It Hot," Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot is still among the greatest movie comedies, if not the greatest
","I've only seen this movie once before on the late show when I lived in Jacksonville, FL, with my aunts. I remember thinking this was pretty funny. Now that I've watched this on DVD with my mom (who had never seen this before), it's even more funny than I remembered it. I mean, seeing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon try to convincingly play women in order to escape some gangsters, especially in front of the actual females they're surrounded with, can be pretty funny since they don't really look anything similar to them but I guess the fact that many of them do drink might have been a factor. And then there's Marilyn Monroe, looking as luminous as one expects but also one of the most charismatic of actresses especially considering her off-screen troubles that seemed to affect everyone involved including director Billy Wilder. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay just cackles with such great lines. Oh, and I also loved Joe E. Brown's performance as the millionaire that falls for Lemmon's character. His seemed to be the best one here, even better than Lemmon's who was the only player to get an Oscar nomination. And while George Raft and Pat O'Brien played their typed roles of gangster and cop, they played them well enough to still deliver the goods. In summary, I'm not sure if I agree with the AFI listing this as No. 1 among great comedies, but Some Like It Hot is still one of the most entertaining of them, that's for sure!",9,1,1,19 August 2013
Les Misérables," I loved Les Miserables. There I said it!
","Though I never saw an actual theatrical production of this musical, I did know about this through some of the songs played on piano by my Filipino 'cousin' (technically, he was just someone from my parents' native country but me and my aunts in Jacksonville, Fla., considered him as such) as well as watching the PBS concert special with Lea Salonga doing the Eponine part. So it was with that in mind that I was very excited to watch this movie and as a result, I enjoyed it very much! In fact, this being the day of the Oscar nominations, part of me was very glad to see Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, the original song, and this nominated for Best Picture but was a bit disappointed that Tom Hooper was not given the nod as well as I believe his vision indeed put the whole thing together perfectly! And while Jackman and Hathaway performed their roles greatly, one shouldn't discount also Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Eddie Redmayne, or especially Samantha Barks as Eponine. I'm singling Ms. Barks here because of her song 'On My Own' about her unrequited love for Radmayne which I can relate to all too well. But, really, anything that got a tear from me really deserved one, in fact, by the end, my movie theatre-working friend asked me if I was all right and I assured him I was. I think I've said enough so on that note, Les Miserables is definitely worth seeing!",10,8,17,10 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is almost as good as its predecessor
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew. Like the first one, there's some laughs among the action and touching scenes. And, yes, there's once again some cool '70s recordings that augment the score, the kind of songs I remember very much enjoying listening to on AM radio as a kid whether in my house or when my parents were driving us around. Among the newcomers, Kurt Russell is quite effective with the role he plays here. I admit there were some slow spots but the results were very much worth it. So on that note, we all three highly recommend Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.",8,5,11,8 May 2017
Titanic," James Cameron's Titanic is still entertaining with 3-D adding a little to the experience
","Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song 'My Heart Will Go On' was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron's Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn't really necessary IMHO.",9,2,6,29 April 2012
In Time," In Time is an intriguing thriller about the value of time as literally money for survival
","Just watched this futuristic thriller with my movie theatre-working friend. It has people wearing a 'watch' on their arms which digitally gives them a certain number of time that they use to pay for whatever means they need for survival. It stars people like Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. Oh, and also Johnny Galecki from 'The Big Bang Theory'. The writer/director is Andrew Niccol who also penned the screenplay for another movie I liked called The Truman Show. This was almost as good as that with many expositions in the dialogue that explain whatever plot points you may be a little confused by. So on that note, In Time is a worthy thriller that makes you think about how precious time really is.",6,0,3,2 November 2011
Thor," This movie version of Thor was quite an exciting movie to watch
","Just watched Thor in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and while I admit I fell asleep during some of the beginning parts, by the time the title character's brother Loki reveals his intentions, I was riveted the rest of the picture. Kenneth Branagh is fine directing the dialogue and action sequences and the one picked to play Thor is quite charismatic especially when talking to the mortal Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema. Oh, and Loki as the villain is very compelling when he's revealed as such and one more thing, look for creator Stan Lee in a cameo since this is a Marvel-based movie of a character he created...",8,2,5,9 May 2011
The Shape of Water," If you have a taste for the unusual, I highly recommend The Shape of Water
","When my movie theatre-working friend said this was weird, I said it was also beautiful to which he said 'Huh?' though he also said to a co-worker he also liked it. Kudos to the director, writers, and all the cast for this fine film about a mute woman who feels something for a creature brought to the lab building she works for as a domestic. So on that note, if you have a taste for the unusual, I highly recommend The Shape of Water.",10,30,56,1 February 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Despite some possible flaws, I highly enjoyed The Godfather Part III
","Having previously watched The Godfather, Part I and II, I had to eventually watch this, Part III. It was great to see Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and even Al Martino again, here once again playing singer Johnny Fontane. Too bad Robert Duvall declined to reprise his role as Tom Hagen but I thought George Hamilton was as good a replacement as possible. And Andy Garcia was also aces as the son of James Caan's role from the first one and deserved his eventual Oscar nom for the role. As for Sofia Coppola, well, at least her role didn't have too many scenes which meant whatever her deficiencies as an actress, her father didn't make her look too bad. I still was shocked by her final scene. And if I didn't know when the very last one is supposed to take place, I might have been puzzled by it. In summary, The Godfather Part III was as good a final take on the series as it possibly could be.",8,1,3,1 May 2019
Zombieland," Zombieland should provide a horrifically funny good time!
","In honor of this month being the one where Halloween is celebrated, I've dedicated most of these 31 days to watching horror, sci-fi, or comedies with elements of either or both. So it was in that spirit that I decided to watch this new hybrid with my movie theatre working friend who got us in for free. This is a funny, touching, intense, and sometimes scary good time with good performances all from Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, several zombie extras, and a Famous Celebrity who gets quite a funny death scene. While the plot is nothing to take seriously, the characterizations are believable enough and sympathetic enough that one cares what happens to them. Nothing much else to say except if you don't mind the gore and other intensities, I highly recommend Zombieland.",8,0,1,19 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life is my all-time favorite
","Since I first saw this classic in 1981, I've seen an episode of Laverne and Shirly with this premise (it's Laverne who imagines this scenario), a musical version on stage with Ernie the taxi driver-not Martini-owning a bar, and last year a Baton Rouge Little Theater presentation with dialogue almost taken verbatim from the movie. Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words 'a little atmosphere'. Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George: No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry 'Baby Dumpling/Alexander Bumstead' Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny 'Alvin Fuddle' Mummert (Little Marty Hatch). And Ellen 'Grandma Walton' Corby as the woman George kisses in the run-on-the-bank sequence.",10,0,5,18 December 2006
The Departed," Watch Scorsese's The Departed for Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson
","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg, The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston. Nicholson is at his most charismatic over-the-top as mob boss Frank Costello, Damon is fine as Costello's informant at police headquarters, DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down. Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon's 'father' is on the phone. Also compelling is newcomer Vera Farmiga as Damon's girlfriend and DiCaprio's shrink and lover. Watch also for Anthony Anderson and from 24, James Badge Dale. Well worth seeing for Scorsese enthusiasts.",9,3,8,6 October 2006
Jersey Boys," Having not seen the original Broadway version, I liked this film version of Jersey Boys
","Okay, having not seen the original Broadway musical version of this, I had really wanted to watch this movie version of this group of men who rise to stardom despite a couple of them spending some time in bars previously. I didn't know how much of this story of The Four Seasons with lead singer Frankie Valli was true but it was quite intriguing seeing it depicted the way it was even with the abrupt time jump near the end. Maybe some scenes or lines could have been cut, but still, I was glad to see what was on screen and I was especially enamored of the songs the group made famous being done live on film even though none of the performances could touch the classic recordings of TFS. I felt Clint Eastwood did well enough with the direction and I especially liked the final number done for the end credits. My movie theatre-working friend was okay with it as well. So on that note, Jersey Boys gets a recommendation from me.",7,10,21,26 June 2014
The Holiday," The Holiday was one of the pretty charming romantic comedies I just watched with my mother
","Years after my mom got this movie on DVD as a present, we both finally just watched it right now. It's got Cameron Diaz in Los Angeles as a movie trailer cutter and Kate Winslet in England as a publishing associate. They both experience breakups and are looking for a change of scenery, so to speak so they communicate on the internet and then go to temporarily live in each other's residences for a couple of weeks. I'll stop there and just say that they as well as Jude Law, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach make this quite charming and there are also some funny scenes that make this go down quite easy. There's also a glorious movie star cameo at a Blockbuster Video sequence. So on that note, I recommend The Holiday.",8,1,1,3 January 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty was compelling enough as a drama of the capture of Osama bin Laden
","Finally saw this movie with my mom on a Netflix disc. With most of the film depicting various officials talking about what to do to catch Osama bin Laden, supplemented by some scenes of violent deaths, this is probably not the most dramatically exciting of true life dramas though seeing the lead character played by Jessica Chastain go through her trials is still pretty compelling to watch down to her final scene. No wonder she got an Academy Award nomination (though I'm glad Jennifer Lawrence won for Silver Linings Playbook). The final raid was not presented in that action movie-like climax one would possibly expect but it did its job of providing enough info on what possibly happened there. In summary, Zero Dark Thirty was compelling enough.",8,0,3,6 June 2013
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges gave a compelling enough performance in Crazy Heart that I'm glad he got his Oscar though not sure how deserved it really was...
","Just watched this musical drama with my mother on Netflix. Jeff Bridges plays a down-on-his-luck Country singer who's trying a comeback but has to try to get sober before even getting to writing songs again. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a reporter with a toddler who falls for his charms. Robert Duvall plays a friend of his who ends up attempting to help him. And Colin Farrell plays his protégé. Quite compelling, this drama was and I'm glad Bridges got his Oscar though I haven't seen the other nominated performances of that year so I don't know how much deserved it really was. Still, I enjoyed it enough to recommend it for anyone interested in this sort of thing.",8,1,1,3 December 2011
Love Actually," After reading good reviews, I finally got to watch Love Actually and really enjoyed it!
","After recently reading comments from posters on the tvguide.com site praise this movie, I decided to get this from Netflix to see for myself with my mom. Mom was a little put off by some of the nudity and adult humor though I remember laughing at much of those scenes. Not all funny scenes involved raunchy humor such as the one where Alan Rickman orders a necklace to be gift wrapped and Rowan Atkinson does quite a flourish on that to his consternation. Nice use of music too like 'All You Need is Love' being performed at a wedding, 'Both Sides Now' while Emma Thompson is crying, or 'God Only Knows' at the ending scene. Oh, and a young girl performs a fine rendition of 'All I Want for Christmas is You' at a pageant scene. All I'll say now is I liked Love Actually and I do recommend it.",8,1,3,16 December 2014
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing
","Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations.",10,14,26,26 November 2013
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is one of the most sweet teenage romantic comedies of the year
","When I was in Maryland to see my sister's firstborn get baptized, we both decided to see this movie when I was there. This was a nicely cutting edge teenage romantic comedy about two strangers played by Michael Cera and Kat Dennings who find out about their similarities only after their friends accidentally put them together. Cera still is pining for an ex he puts a mixed CD for while Dennings is friends with that ex. Michael's character is also a member of a band whose other members are gay while Kat's character has a girlfriend who likes to drink. And all this happens while Cera and Dennings and their friends ride around New York City all night looking for their favorite indie band. Plenty of sweet and funny (and a little gross) moments abound and while my sister and I might have a little problem with a sex scene with the leads, the romance was good enough to overcome that. So on that note, I recommend Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. P.S. There are cameos of a couple of current SNLers I pleasantly noticed right away...",7,18,29,11 November 2008
Burlesque," Burlesque is a fine showcase for Christina Aguilera and, especially, Cher
","Just watched this ambitious Cher-Christina Aguilera musical drama with my theatre-working friend and we both found it fabulous! Is it a masterpiece? Well, not quite as the plot seems to be quite derivative not to mention a romance subplot involving Ms. Aguilera's possible 'gets' between her-roommate-with-a-fiancée-far-away (Cam Gigandet) and an-older-rich-man-who's-trying-to-buy-Cher's-club (Eric Dane). But the leading performances of both are fine which also goes for the supporting turns by some of the above not to mention Kristen Bell and especially Stanley Tucci as the right hand man of Cher's at the club. And seeing both Ms. Aguilera and Cher singing their songs-especially the latter on 'You Haven't Seen the Last of Me'-are at their most compelling. There's also the requisite witty lines that make things go more smoothly as the narrative goes on. Oh, and more thing: I didn't recognize neither Julianne Hough nor Dianna Agron when they appeared on screen so I was surprised when I read who they were in the ending credits. But, overall, Burlesque was a rollicking good time for my friend and me.",8,28,49,30 November 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest movie experiences ever
","In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel, 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's (Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck) defending black farmer Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against the testimony of Mayella's (Collin Wilcox Paxton) accusation of her rape by him. These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect (though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the '30s and '40s). Peter's testimony and, especially, Peck's closing statement were especially touching. Since we're talking about black performers, here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie: Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from 'Good Times', David Crawford as Tom's son David, Jester Hairston-who I remember from 'Amen'-as Tom's father Spence, Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen, and Bill Walker as the Rev. Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie, 'Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing.' (I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the 'Our Gang' comedy, Young Sherlocks, which starred his wife, Peggy Cartwright, as a child) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration, Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts, and, as the children, John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill, Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem, and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise, better known as 'Scout'. Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley. What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J. Pakula, directed by Robert Mulligan, with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962. Kudos to Ms. Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had. So on that note, I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.",10,1,3,20 February 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," My and my friend liked Edge of Tomorrow perhaps despite its weirdness
","Just watched this-a Tom Cruise film about his reliving a certain event again and again to possibly defeat some alien foes capable of mass destruction-with my movie theatre-working friend. We both found it pretty weird but enjoyable enough. Emily Blunt is a fellow grunt who knows what he's going through since she's already experienced it plenty herself. Full of some humor and plenty of awesome action, we both managed to stay awake the whole time despite both of us yawning some of the time. So that's a good way to say this wasn't boring, that's for sure! Oh, and I recognized Bill Paxton as one of the officers who orders Cruise and the other men around, so that was another plus. So on that note, I recommend Edge of Tomorrow.",8,2,6,1 July 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Pitch Perfect was almost as good as its predecessor
","Like the previous Pitch Perfect movie, this sequel was also shot in my current hometown of Baton Rouge, LA. I noticed the LSU campus right away, as well as WBRZ-TV 2 anchorperson Sylvia Weatherspoon in the news segments at the beginning. Among the veteran Bellas in the concluding sequence was 'Good Morning America' host Robin Roberts who originally hailed from New Orleans. Oh, and one of the food products showcased in the movie, as in the previous one, was some stuff from a local hangout named Zippy's (which I finally sampled about a year ago, having not done that when the original movie came out). With that out of the way, I'll just say this was quite enjoyable both musically and comedy-wise, if not as believable. Still, it was also a little less vulgar (no barf scenes this time around) and often sweet. So on that note, I recommend Pitch Perfect 2.",6,5,16,16 May 2015
Whiplash," J.K. Simmons deserved his Oscar for his performance in Whiplash
","Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending. She certainly wasn't in love with J.K. Simmons' pretty sadistic music teacher character. Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash.",9,2,6,2 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Caesar! is yet another of the Coen brothers' off-beat films
","As someone who's familiar with Hollywood history, the fact that Josh Brolin played a movie executive named Eddie Mannix and his superior is the unseen Nicholas Schenck-both actual names of movie businessmen, part of me wondered if the studio-Capital Pictures-was the fictional name for M-G-M. The screenplay threw off that tangent when Eddie mentioned the actual Metro studio refusing to lend Clark Gable. Now that I got that out of the way, I'll just say this is another one of Joel and Ethan Coen's creatively unusual movies-the kind you'd only expect them to make. It concerns the makings of the studio's time doing various pictures like a mermaid one, a musical involving sailors, and one involving a Roman soldier discovering the mission of Christ. It's interesting that me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this on Ash Wednesday. There's also a singing cowboy who seems to know more than what he first seems initially. While there are some scenes that are funny, it takes a while to get the plot going since some scenes seem designed to interrupt the flow of the story. No way is this a conventional narrative and I'm sure the Coens prefer it that way. In summary, Hail, Caesar! is worth a look for anyone who likes the unusual.",7,3,6,10 February 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Ice Age: Continental Drift was yet another in the series that I enjoyed enough to recommend
","You know, while I've seen the first two Ice Age movies, I hardly remember them though I do remember enjoying them. So it was that I also enjoyed this one as the continuing adventures of Manny, Sid, and Diego among familiar and new supporting characters managed to be both funny and heartwarming at the same time to my heart's desire. Oh, and seeing Scrat always going after that acorn, among many, in a separate subplot doesn't get old, still. Really, you can't go wrong with the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary along with that of Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and especially Wanda Sykes, among others, doing those characters. So all I'll say now is go ahead, watch Ice Age: Continental Drift, and once again be entertained by them!",8,0,0,11 August 2012
The Reader," The Reader is a most compelling drama concerning two people during a time of trials concerning historical atrocities
","Just watched with my parents this very compelling drama about a man named Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembering his relationship with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz (Oscar-winning Kate Winslet) as a teenager (David Kross) and his later encounter with her when she went to trial for crimes committed during the Holocaust. The actors I mentioned gave really good performances. Also praise worthy is Lena Olin both as a mother and daughter survivors of concentration camps. Fine direction by Stephen Daldry of a screenplay by David Hare as adapted from the book by Bernhard Schlink. Since co-producers Sydney Pollack and Anthony Minghella died during production, the movie is dedicated to them. So on that note, The Reader is highly recommended.",10,0,0,9 November 2011
Dark Shadows," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's version of Dark Shadows is a partly uneven yet still enjoyable movie of a cult classic TV series
","I had first been familiar with the TV series 'Dark Shadows' when it was mentioned in a book about cult TV programs. But it wasn't until the early '90s TV series remake that I even watched anything to do with one Barnabas Collins who was portrayed by Ben Cross in that one. I remember highly enjoying it and was disappointed when it was cancelled after only 13 eps. So while I admire Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and the work they've done together for so long, I was a little disappointed by their latest opus in making a film of this long-beloved series. I mean, I found many of the '70s references funny but also a bit distracting since they didn't seem to advance any characterizations or plot developments. And one doesn't really get the connection Barnabas and Victoria Winters have to each other despite the flashback scene involving the latter. In fact, I enjoyed the scenes Depp has with Eva Green as Angelique better. And Michelle Pfeiffer doesn't really have much to do as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard even when she uses her gun so that was another disappointment. But, like I said, there were some pretty funny '70s flavor involving The Carpenters, some Steve Miller lyrics, and an Alice Cooper appearance. And there is some respect concerning the translating of the plot lines and some characterizations of the show to the movie. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't expect a seriously epic drama concerning vampires, just go with the flow of part-camp, part-dramatic entertainment.",6,2,3,20 May 2012
12 Strong," 12 Strong was quite a compelling military drama concerning events happening soon after 9/11
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Based on a true story of what happened in Afghanistan as American military men were deployed there, I admit to not always knowing what was going on but when the bad guys got it, well, it was quite thrilling to watch, that's for sure! I actually wouldn't mind watching this again, if only so I could understand more about the logistics of getting in and out of the battles so quickly. So on that note, 12 Strong is very much worth a look.",8,12,23,15 February 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Kong: Skull Island is very much worth watching!
","Having previously seen all three versions of King Kong-1933, 1976, and 2005-and knowing of some of the good notices of this particular version, I was very stoked to watch this! My movie theatre-working friend had not yet watched it either so this turned out to be the first time for both of us. In summary: This was quite a different take on Kong and his living quarters on Skull Island with many human characters that we get very much involved in caring about and thrilling in how they resolve to take care of things. And, yes, the fights Kong gets involved in are very exciting to watch. I should note that we watched this in regular screen, not IMAX or 3-D though if we had, it might have been even more thrilling! I really don't want to reveal anymore so I'll just say that me and my friend definitely recommend Kong: Skull Island.",9,4,8,5 April 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, while not great, is still a pretty good Disney animated feature
","After watching the recent Disney animated feature-The Princess and the Frog-I decided to finally see the recent DVD I bought of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs-Uncle Walt's first attempt at a full-length cartoon-for the first time ever. Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the 'Heigh Ho' number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S. The Prince's singing and speaking voice is that of one Harry Stockwell, father of child and adult actor Dean Stockwell.",7,3,5,14 December 2009
The Lion King," Finally, I got to experience The Lion King where it's meant to be and in 3-D, to boot!
","While I had previously seen long segments various times on VHS and theatre showings and was able to piece together the whole story that way, this was the first time I had watched the entire thing in one showing on a big screen and in 3-D, to boot! In short, it was a wonderfully magical time just seeing such a classically made drawn animated movie by the best artists Disney had to offer with great music and songs by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and Tim Rice and perfect voices provided by James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons as the villainous Scar, and especially, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as the great comic relief of Timon and Pumbaa! If there was one slight flaw, it's that how stupid was Scar to reveal his role in killing his brother just as nephew Simba was at death's door. But it did provide Simba to get over himself quickly so maybe that was necessary. Otherwise, The Lion King is one of the greatest experiences I've had at the movies. P.S. If you don't stay for the closing credits and had wondered where the dedication to the late Disney head Frank Wells, previously printed before the film, had gone to-it's now at the very end.",9,2,3,22 September 2011
Inception," Christopher Nolan's Inception is a truly astounding piece of work
","Wow! That's my reaction to pretty much the entire film that writer-director Christopher Nolan has made called Inception. Since this is the first movie I've seen of his that isn't part of the Batman series (correction, I did see The Prestige and review it back in 2006), I just marvel at how creatively compelling his work truly is when he literally uses his imagination to the fullest of his ability. To make a more apt comparison: What 'Lost' is to television, Inception is to the movies-the ability to truly take you to places you've never been before. Plus, what a great cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite, and Michael Caine among others. All deserve the kudos they're getting and more. No wonder it's been No. 1 at the box office these past three weeks! This movie isn't very easy to describe so I won't even try. I'll just highly recommend this to anyone who wants their minds challenged to the fullest extent of their ability and just leave it at that.",10,3,18,4 August 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," The Secret Lives of Pets was quite a funny computer-animated feature film
","In this Illumination (the makers of the Despicable Me series) computer-animated feature film, we see the animals talking after their owners leave for the day (just like the toys in the Toy Story series) and doing their own thing. The main character is a dog named Max who suddenly is being paired with a much bigger dog and he doesn't like it. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a funny and partly touching take on the 'animals on the loose in the city' premise with many fine support from many of the other animals involved including a rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. By the way, I was wonderfully surprised that among the other celebrities doing voices was one Albert Brooks who I previously also just heard reprising his Marlin fish character in Finding Dory. So on that note, I recommend The secret Lives of Pets.",8,9,16,13 July 2016
Finding Dory," Finding Dory was a worthy sequel to Finding Nemo
","So after Finding Nemo, Disney/Pixar decided to make a sequel in which the short-term memory fish Dory suddenly remembers that she has parents and goes out looking for them. Along the way, she encounters a septopus (an octopus with a missing appendage), a near-sighted whale shark who was her pipe pal, and a male beluga whale who has a radar. Also, Marlin and his son Nemo are also along for the ride. There are a few laughs and plenty of touching drama during Dory's search. It's quite a ride as she journeys through various aquariums and oceans, not to mention a few motorized vehicles and strollers. I enjoyed most of what happens here along with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched this before. So on that note, I recommend Finding Dory.",8,2,9,10 July 2016
The Blind Side," The Blind Side was a compellingly filmed version of the true story of Michael Oher and Leigh Anne Touhy
","Whenever my movie theatre working friend sees a trailer of an upcoming film and likes what he sees, he always says, 'That's going to be good.' He said that when we watched the preview ad for this one and when he does that, I sometimes have a skeptical mind about it since I don't always share his tastes in entertainment (his favorite form of such is pro wrestling of which I can do without). Such it was for this movie especially when the new critics of 'At the Movies', Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott, both gave good reasons for saying, 'Skip it.' But while it seemed to be more about Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family than it seemed to be about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and his background, that's only because we don't find out about his past until later on. And I did disagree a bit with Phillips and Scott about not seeing Ms. Tuohy actually mean it when she says to her lady friends, 'I'm learning from him.' She seems to be the smartest one in the whole picture with the way she convinces nearly everyone to her point of view. Oh, and as an Independent, I can appreciate the different ways a conservative, religious, and wealthy family can seem so compassionate toward both a poor, seemingly mentally slow, African-American teenager and a Democratic, possibly liberal, tutor (Kathy Bates). In fact, there was quite a funny line about that and one toward former president George W. Bush at a motor vehicle place where Michael was trying to get a driver's license. It wasn't a nasty one though, so I don't think anyone should be offended. What really impressed me, however, was Michael's turning point after having doubts about his choice of college seemingly based on his adopted family's history there-not to mention his trip back to his former neighborhood in which he sees how wasted his former 'friends' truly are-and really sticking up for himself about why he made that choice. So, fine performances on both Ms. Bullock and Mr. Aaron's behalf, and good ones on the rest of the cast's especially that of Ms. Bates. Okay, maybe not so much on the actual university coaches' scenes especially that of former LSU coach Nick Saban who's on the longest (though if he was still with the Tigers and not at rival Alabama, I might be a little more lenient, LOL). But with all that I've said, I highly recommend The Blind Side.",8,2,5,2 December 2009
Rango," Johnny Depp brings his charming voice, among others, to the computer animated Rango
","In this computer animated feature, Johnny Depp voices a lizard who had previously been used to playacting in a waterball forced to walk the desert after the glass breaks when it fell off a moving vehicle. He then encounters a western town that seems to live in the 19th century...This was quite an amusing enterprise with many pointed pop-culture references like that of John Huston in Chinatown (represented by The Mayor as voiced by Ned Beatty) or Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name (as voiced by Timonthy Olyphant). Oh, and there's also a compelling story with Rango becoming a reluctant hero and a Greek-chorus of guitar-playing birds that add to the fun. So on that note, Rango comes highly recommended.",8,2,4,7 April 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman: Or (The Unexpected of Ignorance) is something else, that's for sure!
","So this is what won the Oscar for Best Picture. The days of something like Titanic winning the award seems long gone now. Then again, most of what's popular are usually some special effects-epic that doesn't say anything particularly important, just meant to entertain for a couple hours. And that includes many superhero pictures that are permeating the industry right now. Michael Keaton plays an actor who once was part of that crowd when he was Birdman. Now he's trying to be legitimate again by starring and directing himself in a play based on a Raymond Carver story. Shot in what seems like one continuous take, this film is a compelling take on art vs. commerce, realism vs. simple playacting, and sanity vs. insanity. Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and others do fine performances on how some actors cope with whatever insecurities they have when things don't always happen like they think they should. All I'll now say is Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is well worth seeing if you want your brain picked on for a couple of hours.",9,0,4,22 June 2015
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman was quite awesome as a female superhero movie!
","I first became familiar with Wonder Woman when watching the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series 'Superfriends' on Saturday mornings on ABC. That network later aired a live action-version of her with Lynda Carter playing her during World War II. When CBS picked the series for a second season, the setting changed to present time. I've never read the Wonder Woman comics though I did read of her adventures in the All-Star Squadron comics during the '80s which depicted her Earth-2 (original Golden Age version) counterpart during WWII. All that I just mentioned were pretty enjoyable. As for this version, Gal Gadot certainly has both the beauty and body strength for the character. Chris Pine was also fine as her heroic partner-both in battle and love-Steve Trevor. Setting it during World War I was a nice change. The action was awesome and the occasional humor was also welcome. In summary, I highly recommend Wonder Woman.",10,20,40,7 June 2017
Despicable Me," Despicable Me was only mildly entertaining as a 3-D computer animated flick
","Unlike the other summer computer animated movies I've seen, Toy Story 3 and, yes, Shrek Forever After, Despicable Me was sort of blah for me. Yes, Steve Carell is pretty amusing as the voice of the leading character and seeing that character in scenes with his minions, those three orphan girls, and some others I won't mention provided some good laughs. And it's also amusing recognizing Julie Andrews as his mother while I couldn't place Kristen Wiig or Jason Segel until after the credits which was a nice surprise for me. And the 3-D effects are awesome as usual. But the story wasn't tight enough and seemed to rely too much on cuteness to provide much comic bite. Not to mention I was fighting sleep during the middle part. So in summation, Despicable Me was mildly entertaining but didn't totally hit it out of the ball park for me like the other two computer animated movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review.",5,8,19,12 July 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Back to the Future Part II was almost as enjoyable as its predecessor
","Yesterday, my best friend and I rewatched this trilogy of Back to the Future in the movie theatre he works at. This second of the series took place partially on October 21, 2015-exactly the day we watched these again. We not only go to that day but also back to 1985-only it's now an alternate one caused by...well, watch if you don't know. We then also go back to 1955-where there are now two versions of the lead characters present. There aren't as much laughs but it's still fun to watch due to many chases. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are still enjoyable enough and seeing Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson reprise their roles as Lorraine McFly and Biff Tanen also added to the fun. So on that note, Back to the Future Part II is still a worthy sequel. P.S. Two actors were replaced for this and the next sequel: Jeffrey Weissman for Crispin Glover as Marty's dad due to a creative/salary dispute from the latter and Elizabeth Shue for Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer due to Ms. Wells temporarily quitting acting to care for her ailing mother.",8,1,2,22 October 2015
The Queen," Helen Mirren deservedly got the Oscar for The Queen
","Helen Mirren delivers a fine Oscar-worthy performance portraying Queen Elizabeth II during the week Princess Diana was killed in that Paris highway accident. Michael Sheen matches her in his portrayal of the just elected Prime Minister Tony Blair. They both come off as human in both their likes and dislikes of certain aspects of each personality. Certainly the constant news footages of Diana's funeral and the actual papers that disparages the queen for her behavior during the whole ordeal give The Queen a close-as-accurate telling as one expects from a modern film recreation. Compelling throughout, The Queen is one for anyone interested in an excellent drama about the royal family.",10,1,1,24 May 2007
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: First Class is another worthy entry in the Marvel Comics film series
","Having previously seen the three X-Men films not to mention read the comics during the Chris Claremont '80s, I had a big interest in seeing this depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded by one Charles Xavier. That said, the real exciting action doesn't go into high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling drama concerning the main characters of the later known Professor X (James McAvoy) and his initial friend-turned-nemesis Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They along with Kevin Bacon as someone Magneto wants vengeance against-Sebastian Shaw-make the film truly worth seeing and brings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a direction that I'm not sure of. Having said that, the director Matthew Vaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters don't get too much short shrift so on that note, X-Men: First Class comes highly recommended.",8,6,10,3 June 2011
The Wolverine," The Wolverine is one of the most thrilling movies of this summer!
","Just watched this latest Wolverine movie with my movie theatre-working friend. How awesome was this! Logan (Hugh Jackman, as always) is in Japan, supposedly to say goodbye to an old friend he saved in Nagasaki during the atomic blast, but he once again ends up helping some of his family members like his granddaughter. There's also another who is sort of his guardian. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a thrilling trip in the Land of the Rising Sun especially when it takes us to the top of a moving train. There's also some nice quiet scenes between the granddaughter and Logan. This was quite a thrill to watch especially in 3-D. So on that note, I highly recommend The Wolverine!",9,6,13,29 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale provided an exciting and heartfelt conclusion to the Batman movie series with The Dark Knight Rises
","Just watched this, the third and final movie in the Christopher Nolan-Christian Bale series of Batman films. This one takes place eight years after The Dark Knight. Both the Caped Crusader and Bruce Wayne have been inactive during that time-enough time for a new terrorist named Bane (Thomas Hardy) to threaten Gotham City. There's also a jewel thief named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) who may or not eventually be persuaded to join Batman when the eventual battle begins...This one takes its time in getting to the exciting conclusion but when it does, it's very worthy of a series finale! New characters played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard are also worthy not to mention the additional return of Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner James W. Gordon. There were also some other returning players that were a pleasant surprise to me but I won't reveal them here. Anyway, on that note, I very highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. P.S. My heart goes out to all those 12 killed and 58 injured as the result of one man's massacre in that Aurora, Colo., theatre during the premiere midnight screening there. And since I live in the Baton Rouge area in Louisiana, I'm especially glad that one of those 58, 18-year-old Bonnie Kate Pourciau, seems to recover with positive attitude intact especially since she also saved fellow traveling BR friend, Elizabeth Sumrall, during that awful day.",9,5,11,2 August 2012
Black Panther," My second time watching Black Panther was even better than the first!
","This review replaces my original one from a few days ago when I said I wasn't as impressed with this one as the other Marvel movies. I also said I didn't think Chadwick Boseman was as impressive playing T'Challa as he was previously when playing Jackie Robinson or James Brown. Since I didn't sleep this time when watching this a second time, I can now say that Boseman was indeed as good, maybe even better, here as when playing those real-life public figures. And since I also now understand why the events happened when they did, I think this is as good, maybe even better, as those other Marvel movies made by that studio for the last several years. So that's a high recommendation of Black Panther.",10,12,38,26 February 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man is an exciting beginning for the summer movie season
","While I have long been a fan of various superhero movies, I admit I only have a passing interest in the 'Iron Man' comic books since I only read some '80s issues my brother owned when Tony Stark was suffering from alcoholism and a black associate had taken the mantle. That said, this was a pretty cool action movie directed by Jon Favreau with some subtle humor shoehorned in courtesy of Robert Downey, Jr. as Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow as his associate Pepper Potts. What a nicely romantic team they play here! While there's also Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges to fill up the capable supporting cast, I must mention Clark Gregg as a SHIELD agent who has his own amusing moments in his brief scenes with Ms. Paltrow. He's a regular on 'The New Adventures of Old Christine'. There's great drama in Afganistan and plenty of kick-butt action in whatever city this movie takes place in that I was wholly enthralled the whole way through. With a sequel already being planned, I wholly look forward to the next adventures of Iron Man! P.S. Check out Stan Lee being mistaken for Hugh Hefner here.",9,1,4,12 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was pretty entertaining much of the time
","I admit I dreaded this movie since I first heard of this being made and while watching it, part of me still wasn't too enamored of some of what was going on concerning the characters of Superman and Batman. Let me also admit that I have yet to watch the previous Zack Snyder/Henry Cavill Superman movie, Man of Steel. Still, there's plenty of cool action and also many touching scenes especially those between Supes and Lois Lane, who in this one already knows Clark Kent's identity unlike what I previously knew of them from comics thorough the '70s-'80s not to mention the Christopher Reeve movies. My movie theatre-working friend possibly liked it more than I did (he clapped during some of the action scenes) but I didn't come away from this thinking it was worthless...just wondering why certain scenes were done the way they were. Really, I'll just say that for much of the time, I enjoyed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and leave it at that. Also, Ben Affleck was as good as he could be as Batman and I felt he was okay as Daredevil way back in '03 as well. Okay, I'm done...",8,27,44,29 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," The Grestest Showman was a fine musical version of the life of P.T. Barnum
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the first time for both of us and we both were enthralled by what we saw and heard. This was the second time Hugh Jackman sang on film after Les Miserables. He was fine warbling then as he is now! He plays famous show business impresario P.T. Barnum. Don't know how much being depicted is true but there didn't seem a false note the whole movie, that's for sure! Nothing more to say except me and my friend highly recommend The Greatest Showman.",8,7,15,4 January 2018
Monsters University," I admit it, I liked Monsters University, the prequel to Monsters Inc.
","It had been years since I watched Monsters Inc. so I wasn't sure how I'd react to watching this prequel. It actually is quite funny in spots but the drama of Mike trying so hard to fulfill his dreams and how Sully often fails to life up to his family reputation permeates most of the film. Still, I had a good enough time watching this and also hearing Steve Buscemi again as one of the college students was a hoot to listen to. Oh, and I recognized another of the voices as that of a Murray brother but I thought it was Brian Doyle-Murray and not Joel! And, yes, Billy Crystal and John Goodman are once again charming enough as the lead voices here. So in summary, Monsters University is a good enough follow-up to its previous predecessor...",7,2,4,24 June 2013
Casino Royale," Casino Royale is great Bond beginning for Daniel Craig
","Since my actual birthday was near, my friend offered to pay for both my admission and concessions when seeing this movie. We both enjoyed Casino Royale, my friend saying it was one of the best. I heartily agree since it was based on the first James Bond novel and as such it stays true to Ian Fleming's version of 007. Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there's still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch's M ('God, I miss the Cold War') and Eva Green's Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour). And there are the great action set-pieces we've come to love in Bond movies involving construction sites and airports. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. So, yes, I highly recommend Casino Royale.",9,2,4,24 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 is an excellent end to the iconic Disney/Pixar series
","Well, after the anticipation caused by the re-release of the first two Toy Story films last October in 3-D, Toy Story 3, in both 2-D and the other aforementioned format finally arrived last Friday. I just couldn't wait so today, my first day off since the weekend, I watched with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen it when it arrived and didn't mind rewatching it with me. Anyway, with Andy now grown up and on his way to college, it seemed he didn't need Woody, Buzz, or the others anymore but while he was going to take the cowboy with him, the others were going to the attic but there was a mix-up and somehow they all end up in a daycare center. I'll just stop there and just say I was laughing, crying, and a little scared all at the same time. It's that enjoyable especially with the way Buzz changes in many sequences. Of course, there has to be a villain and he comes in a teddy bear named Lotso, voiced by Ned Beatty. There's a few more surprises but I don't want to spoil them here (though I'm putting a spoiler warning anyway in case you didn't want to know what I just revealed in previous sentences). One more thing, it was nice to hear the return of the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger and that Blake Clark did a nice job of replacing the late Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog. Oh, and finding out the director, Teddy Newton, of the preceding short-Day & Night-is the voice of the talking Fisher-Price toy telephone is one of the nice things about reading the IMDb board. So on that note, Toy Story 3 is highly recommended. Oh, and I enjoyed seeing both this and Day & Night in 3-D.",10,3,5,21 June 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona was a pretty intellectually stimulating movie
","I'm usually more a fan of Woody Allen's earlier work when he was very much of a funnyman than his later ones when he seems more serious in his intent. So it is with that in mind that I found this one, about two American women (Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson) who found themselves in Spain and end up encountering a painter (Javier Bardem) who has an ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), pretty enthralling throughout but also feeling a bit detached since while I was expecting a comedy, I didn't expect-and didn't get-too much laughs. It was fascinating listening to all the Allen-esque dialogue and getting what he was intending so on that front, it was pretty entertaining. So on that note, Vicky Christina Barcelona is worth a look. P.S. I recognized one of the players, Chris Messina, as currently being in the TV series, 'The Mindy Project'.",8,1,3,26 November 2013
Pitch Perfect 3," Pitch Perfect 3 was an okay entry in the series
","Having seen the first two films in the series, I guess I felt I had to watch the third one as well despite hearing some lackluster reviews of this one. To tell the truth, the subplot concerning the Fat Amy character and her dad-played by a game John Lithgow-seemed like it belonged to another movie though it was fun having Fat Amy becoming an action hero and Lithgow doing an Australian accent. Anna Kendrick is, as always, charming both as her character and singing the familiar songs from the present to about 30 years ago. That goes with the other females in the cast as well. At least with the length (90 minutes), Pitch Perfect 3 doesn't seem TOO padded...",6,1,4,28 December 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," Saving Mr. Banks was a nice, if a bit fictionalized, account of P.L. Travers' visit to the Walt Disney studio and her encounters with the man herself
","Just watched this film with my movie theatre-working friend who is a die-hard Disney fan (mainly because of his constant visits to Disney World). So he loved this movie that he previously watched before and I liked it very much even though I knew that many scenes were fictionalized like the idea that Ms. P.L. Travers would eventually love what Walt did to her character Mary Poppins on film. As Uncle Walt, Tom Hanks does justice to the man who created and voiced Mickey Mouse. The studio even allowed a scene of him putting out a cigarette! Emma Thompson as Ms. Travers was also good though it does take some getting used to seeing her be such a stick-in-the-mud most of the time. The most charming scenes are those involving the songwriters, Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak), and their attempts to entertaining Ms. Travers while the whole thing is being recorded at her command as well as her conversations with her limo driver played by Paul Giamatti. Then there are those scenes of Ms. Travers childhood in Australia that delivers some heartbreak concerning her alcoholic father, played compellingly by Colin Farrell. All in all, I highly enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks.",9,0,1,15 January 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free or Die Hard was an enjoyable first experience with Bruce Willis' John McClane
","Before I review Live Free or Die Hard I have a confession to make: I've never seen the other Die Hard movies that were made in the last 19 years before this one. So I only know about John McClane's most famous line by reputation (and I'm not going to quote it here). Having just said that, I enjoyed most of the action set-pieces (the one with the fighter jet is the only one that seemed too ridiculous to me) and many of the supporting characters and villains. Justin Long and Maggie Q deserve special mention for their entertaining turns as Bruce Willis' sidekick and fight nemesis, respectively. I previously saw Ms. Q in Mission: Impossible III as part of Tom Cruise' team and she's in better use here with her sexy voice, body, and overall kick-ass stance. It's also nice to see that Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter Lucy isn't a complete doormat here. So since I highly enjoyed this latest entry in Willis' highly successful movie series, I may just check one of his previous entries soon maybe starting with the very first one...",7,1,4,12 July 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Thor: The Dark World is a fine sequel to its predecessor
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. In my review of the previous Thor movie, I mentioned I fell asleep during some of it but managed to wake up during the really exciting parts. This time, I was alert the whole time and me and my friend were really into it this time! Thor and his evil brother Loki and mortal Jane Foster are back and better than ever! Oh, and I also was highly amused by Kat Dennings as Darcy. This was exciting enough from beginning to end with spectacular sequences during the last 40 minutes. I don't really feel like mentioning the plot, just watch this if you love Marvel Comics lore. And, oh, if you watch the new series 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D', this movie is a tie-in to tonight's episode so that's a high recommendation to see Thor: The Dark World.",9,4,10,19 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom continues his off-kilter sense of drama
","The only other Wes Anderson movie I ever saw was The Royal Tennenbaums which I remember being quite amusing with the way it often took its time just meandering at points before going to wherever it was going to. So it is here as we meet a couple of unusual teens named Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward). They both run away to a forest from various troubles with either bullies or parents or authorities. Nice adult turns by the likes of Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, and Anderson veteran Bill Murray. Like I said, you may be amused by some of the weird goings on throughout but you may also appreciate the quaint way things go concerning plot and characterization. So on that note, Moonrise Kingdom gets a recommendation from me.",9,0,1,20 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a good continuation of the series as it left off from 30 years ago
","As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",8,30,95,19 December 2015
RED," Red provides Bruce Willis and an all-star cast in an entertaining thriller
","Just watched this action movie with some humor and romance with my movie theatre-working friend this afternoon. With stars like Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich (what a month he's having appearing in both this and Secretariat which we also enjoyed), Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine (wow, in his 90s and still active), Red provided plenty of pleasures in the thrilling department while also slowing down enough to get you to know the characters and their backgrounds. And seeing many scenes from New Orleans-which happen to be a two-hour drive from where me and my aforementioned friend live-was an additional treat. Okay, I'm not sure if what I saw was organically logical from beginning to end, but nevertheless, me and my friend enjoyed Red immensely. So yeah, that's a recommendation.",8,1,2,4 November 2010
Flight," Robert Zemeckis' Flight is a movie that has a great Denzel Washington performance
","Boy, Denzel Washington really uses his acting chops to play such a flawed character who's both heroic and pathetic! I mean, he's a pilot who manages to save most of his passengers on a plane that obviously wasn't very functional when he boarded it despite his drinking and having a snort just several hours ago. That's just for starters on what is perhaps the most compelling dramatic picture of the year directed with a sure hand by Robert Zemeckis in another of his surprise moves since he's usually associated with more commercially entertaining movies like Back to the Furure or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Well, not everything here is meant for serious thinking as John Goodman is a great hoot as his supplier! But just seeing the range Washington displays here is enough for me to highly recommend Flight wholeheartedly. So if you like something more challenging for your brain, see it!",10,2,7,10 November 2012
Unbroken," Angelina Jolie really did a fine job directing Unbroken
","Just watched this filmed version of the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who eventually ended up at a Japanese prison camp during World War II, with my mom. We both were pretty shocked by the atrocious events that happened to him during that war especially that one Jap officer really torturing him in many scenes. Angelina Jolie really made quite a compelling account about his survival instincts and also his expert running during both high school and the Olympics of 1936. We also had a female cousin of mine visiting and she had to leave when it really was threatening to get intense. Also loved the footage of the real-life Zamperini running during the Nagano games of 1998 with the titles mentioning how he ended up forgiving the country where his tormentors were. So on that note, we highly recommend Unbroken.",10,10,14,12 August 2015
Pitch Perfect," Pitch Perfect was an enjoyably slight musical drama
","I got very interested in watching this movie when I found out, here on IMDb, it was shot on the LSU campus here in Baton Rouge which my movie theatre-working friend didn't know about till I told him just before the matinée. We both recognized some landmarks from that university when they showed on screen and I myself recognized some drinks from a local hangout named Zippy's (though I have yet to go there) and a sign for Kean's was also prominently featured (though that's a local chain of dry cleaners, not gas stations as in the movie). Anyway, I noticed players like Brittany Snow, Donald Faison, that woman playing Fat Amy from Bridesmaides, and John Michael Higgins with Elizabeth Smart as those funny commentators. They and the unknowns were good though the script was pretty slight concerning some plot points and I thought the vomiting of one of the main characters was a bit much. Still, I mostly enjoyed the singing of mash-ups and the using of that teen movie The Breakfast Club as another plot point. So on that note, I recommended Pitch Perfect.",7,2,6,9 October 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a well worthy follow-up to its predecessor
","Well, it's been more than a year since I saw The Hunger Games and really enjoyed it so when I watched this sequel with my movie theatre-working friend (who had seen it twice before and liked it), I was very glad I did! The stakes are higher this time as Katniss' actions in the previous one and her actions here really put Donald Sutherland's character in a bind he desperately wants to get out of. And Jennifer Lawrence is once again fine as the conflicted heroine who tries to survive against the madness she constantly has to deal with. This is modern epic storytelling at its finest with some of the best casting I've seen for a movie in recent years, that's for sure! So on that note, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is well worth the time!",10,5,25,4 December 2013
Looper," Looper may not always be easy to understand, but it's still worth seeing
","Okay, I just saw this time travel movie starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were a bit confused (him more so since he had to go to the restroom in the middle of it) at how things were going on during much of it but thought it was redeemed by how things ended. I mean, it was a while what that young mother with her pre-teen kid had to do with the plot that was on my mind much of the time. And I'll probably have to watch this again to really understand. But still, I did enjoy it by the time it ended. And Emily Blunt does another fine performance as that mother. So on that note, Looper gets a recommendation with some reservations.",6,1,2,29 October 2012
Footloose," This version of Footloose is a pretty good remake of the original
","Full disclosure time: I saw the original 1984 version at the now-defunct Cinema 8 multiplex at the also-now defunct Bon Marche Mall (the buildings have been renovated into other places) and I remember enjoying it very much at the one time I watched it in its entirety. I had also bought the soundtrack LP album beforehand and had highly enjoyed that several times as a teenager. Then there were also videos of several of its hits like Deniece Williams' 'Let's Hear It for the Boy', Bonnie Tyler's 'Holding Out for a Hero', and Kenny Loggins' title song which consisted mainly of clips of Kevin Bacon's (or his dance double's) movements. So it was with all that in mind that I saw this remake with an open head. The verdict: I still had a good time though my excitement factor wasn't as overwhelming perhaps because of my fond memories of the original and some of the changes didn't seem necessary. Still, having the actor Miles Teller playing the same role done by Chris Penn nearly 30 years before in learning to dance and enjoying himself as a result was still a highlight in both versions. And former 'Dancing with the Stars' pro Julianne Hough shows some chops in reenacting the Lori Singer role. And while Kenny Wormald won't make you forget Bacon in his iconic role, he's not too bad either. And the same goes for Dennis Quaid playing the John Lithgow part. So on that note, this version of Footloose is recommended.",7,39,70,20 October 2011
Deadpool," Deadpool is for anyone who loves a hilarious R-rated action superhero film!
","Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool.",8,5,18,15 February 2016
Thirteen Days," Thirteen Days was a fine dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis
","Earlier this month I visited my sister in Maryland, to see her first-born child, a boy, get baptized. While there, her husband showed this historical drama to me, my mother, and my other brother-in-law. We were all enthralled at the drama of what happened over 40 years ago being played on the just-unwrapped DVD. Seeing Keven Costner, as White House consultant Kenny O'Donnell, speaking in the same accent and mannerisms of the Kennedy brothers Jack (Bruce Greenwood) and Bobby (Steven Culp who I didn't recognize as the same actor that played Rex on 'Desparate Housewives') made me almost forget his movie star magnetism. Also fine in their real-life roles were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Director Roger Donaldson takes his time in depicting the title's events that, no matter what one knows of the outcome, still provides some suspenseful turns as well as also explaining how and why certain results became. I was especially impressed at how Culp as Bobby was seeming so impatient with the way Stevenson as a UN ambassador was slowly taking his time with the Soviet premier. Maybe Donaldson was a bit much with a couple of shots of the nuclear film footage inserted but overall, I'd say Thirteen Days was an excellent depiction of how close to World War III our country was during what must have been very tense days of October 1962.",10,0,0,31 October 2008
300," 300 was a mildly interesting epic to me
","In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I fell asleep during some of the battle scenes (or maybe during the preparation of said scenes). I did stay alert when the son of one of the soldiers was killed. The scenes I really loved, however, were the ones with the mother queen, Lena Headey, especially when a political rival of her husband's made a deal with her for his support of her views during the next day's council meeting in exchange for his sexually violating her. You'll have to see the movie to watch the twist ending. Since the film was almost over by then, I was only mildly entertained but if you love historical, or maybe legendary would be the better description here, epics, 300 may be what you're looking for.",5,7,18,10 March 2007
Easy A," Emma Stone's Easy A is one of the smartest teen comedies I've seen this year
","I had gone into watching Emma Stone's Easy A with some expectations of a smart teen comedy about reputations and the stereotypes of characterizations that one expects when those kinds of things arise but I got a lot more with the mostly smart dialogue that references everything from the Demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter to the '80s teen hit films like those of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Cameron Crowe (Say Anything...), and Patrick Dempsey (Can't Buy Me Love). There's a few more but I'll just say that I was just overjoyed at both the funny and touching moments that permeated the whole thing and loved not only the performances of Ms. Stone but also Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her parents, Amanda Bynes as her religious-nut enemy, Thomas Haden Church as her favorite teacher, and Lisa Kudrow as a not-always normal guidance counselor, among others. Nothing more to say except Easy A comes highly recommended.",8,2,7,20 September 2010
Green Book," Green Book was one of the best films of last year!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick. Nice surprise to hear it was mostly shot in Louisiana, where I live, even during a snow scene when it actually snowed in my state during December of '17! My friend and I really liked this one so that's a high recommendation!",9,1,2,31 January 2019
Pineapple Express," Pineapple Express is another quite funny Judd Apatow production
","Since tomorrow is the birthday of my friend who works at a movie theatre, I let him pick the movie we were going to see today. He picked this one (I'm just glad he didn't pick the third Mummy movie). Once again produced by Judd Apatow, this is star Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's second screenplay after Superbad from last year. I actually liked this one better than that especially when the 'witnessing the murder' sequence kicked in. There are some scenes though that, while they might be funny, later makes me wonder what relation they have to the plot. Like the beginning black and white scene that takes place in 1937 with Apatow regular and current SNLer Bill Hader. He is indeed funny in his scene but before that, I wondered if I stumbled into the wrong movie. Rogen himself, though, is throughly deadpan hilarious whether nonchalantly romancing his 18-year-old high school girlfriend at her learning center or straight-out telling her parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and former SNLer Nora Dunn) during dinner about being chased by some hit men. And his former co-star from 'Freaks and Geeks', James Franco, matches Seth in offbeat humor whether driving a police car with his foot stuck in the windshield or helping his buddy in untying while he's also in likewise situation. And then there's a third party that manages to stay alive despite being shot at a lot. The stuff with the Asian hit men and Gary Cole and cop Rosie Perez as lovers seems so much filler though they have their moments too. So in summation, Pineapple Express may be a little long but that length provides a pretty satisfying whole for me to recommend.",7,1,5,21 August 2008
Minions," Minions was an okay prequel to the Despicable Me movies
","So me and my movie theatre-working friend saw this today, a prequel to the first Despicable Me taking place 42 years before that one. Many amusing scenes and nice use of various '60s hits and other references to the era abounded. So I did enjoy this one somewhat. But, like the previous two, I did find it a bit cutesy for my tastes half the time I was watching this and also partly bored. One scene that was a nice surprise was the one where that family that picked up those three minions were revealed to be bank robbers. I also liked that slogan for the Nixon presidential campaign-'Finally, someone we can trust!' Also liked that 'Make 'Em Laugh' number done by all those other minions. But while I found some scenes funny enough, I never thought this was completely hilarious. Still, Minions is worth a look for animation fans and families.",5,3,4,16 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2 is another highly entertaining Disney/Pixar feature
","When The Incredibles came out 14 years ago, I remember enjoying it immensely. So me and my same friend just watched this sequel just now and it was also very enjoyable! There seems even more to laugh at-at least more after not much happens during the first 30 minutes-as the narrative goes into overdrive during the climatic scenes near the end. I don't feel like revealing much-and it's not like many reviews here aren't mentioning the highlights that I loved as much as they did-so I'll just say that me and my movie theatre-working friend highly recommend Incredibles 2!",9,6,16,16 June 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted got a few laughs from me though I was also pretty underwhelmed
","Just watched this computer-animated movie with my movie theatre-working friend. While both he and I laughed at many parts of it, it was in different places. And since there wasn't a crowded audience in the screening room, whatever laughs I heard from others were mostly scattered too. Still, I appreciated whatever stuff I thought was funny particularly when something that went over many under-12s heads was said or done. And while part of me did enjoy the movie what with many great 3-D images involving chases, I still felt a little underwhelmed as things seemed to be really frantic even when things seemed to slow down. In summation, if you were a fan of the first two, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is worth a look. Just make sure not to have too much expectations of endless laughter...",6,4,8,11 June 2012
Spectre," Spectre is perhaps the best of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies yet!
","Besides this being the fourth consecutive Daniel Craig James Bond film, it's also the fourth me and my movie theatre-working friend had seen together. While he doesn't consider himself as much of a Bond fan as yours truly, he did really enjoy this one as did I. It had many familiar moments I remember from the previous entries yet there was also plenty that was new like the expanded roles of this current series' versions of both Q and Moneypenny in their helping of Mr. Bond on his mission. It also marked the return of the organization of SPECTRE and the main head of that, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played here by Christoph Waltz though he's not initially ID'd as such. There are two Bond women here, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux, that provide just enough heat to make one like them immediately and also care for them when their backgrounds are revealed. And Craig seems more comfortable in the role than ever now! Great action scenes abound, as always! So on that note, both of us highly recommend Spectre.",10,4,12,25 November 2015
Joy," I managed to enjoy Joy even after finding out much of the narrative was dramatized
","Just watched this movie Joy on Netflix DVD. It's about a woman who seems to feel her life is not satisfying-having to deal with a divorced husband who she lives with along with her divorced parents, a grandmother, and her two kids. One day, she invents a mop that she feels will revolutionize the world. Well, I'm not sure that's what she thinks at first as she simply wants to sell something that will do well for her financially. I'll stop there and just say that this seemed quite inspirational to watch though since I just found out that many passages were dramatized, I do wonder of those fictional parts were really necessary for the narrative. Still, both Mom and me enjoyed Joy and Jennifer Lawrence's performance in it.",8,1,2,25 July 2016
Happy Feet," Happy Feet is wonderful animated musical for whole family
","Happy Feet is a wonderful computer animated musical with a pro-environmental message that doesn't become obvious until the end. It also has a different-from-the-rest-of-the-pack main character in Mumble (Elijah Wood). While all the other penguins are wonderful singers (including Mumble's crush Gloria, voiced by Brittany Murphy), the only musical talent Mumble has is tap dancing (copied from Savion Glover's movements on live-action film). After graduation, Mumble leaves for another land where he encounters another group who appreciates him as he is (led by the voice of Robin Williams who does another one as a messiah-like character). Great use of many '70s and '80s pop standards like Prince's 'Kiss' and Stevie Wonder's 'I Wish'. I especially like the 'Boogie Wonderland' number and a brief rendition of Chicago's 'If You Leave Me Now'. So take the whole family if you want to see a good animated film directed by Mad Max's George Miller.",7,3,9,17 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millionaire was pretty entertaining, if a little okay, as a recent Oscar winner
","Just watched this on a Blu-Ray DVD with my brother-in-law, an elderly aunt, and my mom and dad, both of whom left for long periods. This Best Picture winner being awarded at this year's Oscars, not to mention that of Best Director for Danny Boyle, was heartfelt to me when I watched the 'Academy Awards' earlier several months ago. Despite that, I'm not sure if it actually deserved those awards. Still, I was for the most part touched by the various actors that played Jamal, his older brother Salim, and the girl Latika. And the suspense that surrounded Jamal's answering questions on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' were certainly pretty nail-biting especially concerning the host's treatment of him. So on that note, I highly recommend Slumdog Millionaire.",8,2,11,11 August 2009
The Nice Guys," The Nice Guys was a pretty entertaining detective movie taking place in the late '70s
","I had wanted to watch this movie for a while because of the '70s atmosphere so I just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend just now. It had a pretty weird vibe that was pretty humorous much of the time though not always hilariously so. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling reluctantly team up in search of a young woman who's involved in a porno film and Kim Basinger is also involved somehow. Much of the movie is pretty entertaining though because I was a child of the decade in question and I know what music came out certain years especially the 1977 timeline here, it took me a little out of the picture when I heard something like Rupert Holmes' 'Escape (The Pina Colada Song)'-which came out two years after that year-playing in the background. Still, The Nice Guys is worth a look for anyone interested in the era. Oh, and how cool to once again see the Saul Bass Warner Bros. logo beginning this one...",7,3,8,27 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge was a compelling take on the heroism of one Desmond Doss
","Watched this with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday, the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Desmond Doss was a conscience objector during World War II meaning he refused to carry a gun while in the Army. He eventually managed to save many of his fellow comrades during the battle of Okinawa by moving them to safety using the rope tricks he learned during basic training. If you're familiar with director Mel Gibson's graphic take on The Passion of the Christ, those battle scenes shouldn't surprise here nor how long it is being depicted. Still, there's also a nice romance between Desmond and Dorothy (Andrew Garfield and Teresa Palmer) in the beginning parts. Overall, me and my friend highly recommend Hacksaw Ridge.",9,3,6,8 December 2016
The Social Network," The Social Network was one of the more compelling movies from the last year
","Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While I don't think this was one of the best movies of last year (True Grit and The King's Speech were more worthy to me), The Social Network was certainly quite an attention-grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher's going back and forth from the depositions to the actual-if a little fabricated-events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co-founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors. Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co-founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter's betrayal. So on that note, The Social Network is well worth the viewing.",9,0,1,23 June 2011
Back to the Future," After 30 years, the original Back to the Future is still the best of the series!
","Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on 'The Wonder Years'.",10,0,0,21 October 2015
Goodfellas," Goodfellas is a very good, if not great, Martin Scorsese picture
","While I had previously seen this Martin Scorsese picture before, it was on network television which meant I didn't hear the profanity and the violent scenes were trimmed. Despite that, I remember enjoying the movie very much. Now that I've seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it doesn't impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the director's parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine's as Pesci's mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who lived through it.",8,1,2,24 January 2008
The Great Gatsby," With this being the first time I was familiar with this material, I liked this film version of The Great Gatsby
","I had previously enjoyed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet and Moulin Rouge so when I watched his version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, I wasn't surprised at his modern take on it despite being mostly true to the time period it's set in. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the title character who made himself become rich through not very legal means though has the charms to hide that part of himself to those swayed by his demeanor. Tobey Maguire still has the boyish look to pass himself as the green witness to the party atmosphere that abounds around Jay Gatsby's mansion. And Carey Mulligan just oozes beauty and charm as the flighty Daisy. When I saw the original trailer for this movie, the hip-hop music was distracting knowing about the '20s jazz age setting but it makes sense here in conveying the innovative and provocative way it ushered in a new kind of music to a mass audience. With this being the first time I was encountering this source material, I very much enjoyed this version of The Great Gatbsy.",8,0,2,9 December 2013
Sully," Sully was a fine drama about a good man who happened to be a hero, whether he likes it or not
","I finally watched this after several weeks of it playing with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday. He had watched this before but was willing to watch with me as I hadn't. It was quite a touching true story of Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, played here by Tom Hanks. The drama took its time in telling how the plane ended up where it ended up and why he was being investigated despite being called a hero because none of the passengers suffered badly during the crisis. Clint Eastwood did a good directing job, as usual. Going back and forth during some sequences, I managed to not be confused at all while watching which is a good sign of a fine drama based on something that actually happened. So on that note, I highly recommend Sully.",10,2,5,13 October 2016
Valkyrie," Valkyrie was a mostly compelling historical World War II drama starring Tom Cruise
","In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that after the bombing in the beginning of this movie, I fell asleep during the talky sequences during much of the first hour. That said, when the plans of the title went into action, I was riveted for the most part. Tom Cruise is fine as the attempted heroic von Stauffenberg character despite what that real-life person suffered in his attempt at killing Adolf Hitler. And Bryan Singer does provide some suspenseful moments during the last hour. And while I did miss some of Carice van Houten's scenes as Cruise's wife, what I did see were some beautiful frames of her kissing her husband goodbye. Maybe next time I'd give this movie a higher rating but for now I'm giving this a 7.",7,1,2,22 July 2009
Draft Day," Me and my movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this depiction of an NFL Draft Day on film
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this story of a general manager of the Cleveland Browns who is played by Kevin Costner in trying to pick the right trades on the day of the NFL draft picks while also dealing with a pregnant associate (Jennifer Garner) he's in a relationship with, a coach who doesn't always agree with his choices (Dennis Leary), and a late father who was the previous coach that he had to fire beforehand due to age. I'll stop there and say I found much that was pretty funny and occasionally touching stuff about some of the players being considered. And director Ivan Reitman was pretty creative with some of the wipes involved in many scene transitions. So on that note, Draft Day is worth a look.",7,23,39,28 April 2014
The Wizard of Oz," I finally got to watch The Wizard of Oz on the big screen after years of only seeing it on TV!
","Like I'm sure many of you reading this, I first watched this classic movie when it aired on CBS during the '70s when that network still had annual showings of it. Last month or so, I saw it in a theatre for the first time with my movie theatre-working friend as it celebrated it's 80th anniversary. When Professor Marvel mentioned Isis, we both cracked how that word now inspires dread and when the Scarecrow mentioned some jokes about brains, I mentioned a certain President. I also mentioned to my friend how the only part I didn't like about the movie was the Lion's singing about being the King of the Forest as it really stopped the movie and not in a good way. The role of Dorothy was perfect for then 16-year-old Judy Garland even though the girl in the book was originally a pre-teen. And Thank Goodness calmer heads prevailed and her signature song, 'Over the Rainbow', was not cut out! It won that deserved Oscar as did Judy for that special miniature Academy Award she got (though I hope she later replaced that with the more standard size!) It was such a treat seeing it on the big screen after years of watching it on TV. Only wish we weren't the only ones in the seats that day, though....",9,0,1,19 December 2019
The Fighter," The Fighter may be one of the best movies of 2010
","In a break from watching the usual mainstream comedies or the latest 3-D effects movies, me and my movie theatre-working friend decided to watch this 'based on a true story' drama involving boxing and family conflicts last night at the place where he works. All I'll say now is that this was a fine film with a great screenplay, excellent direction, and suitably realistic performances from Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo, and especially Mark Wahlberg who was also one of the picture's producers. And director David O. Russell deserves whatever praise he gets for this. So on that note, I highly recommend The Fighter. P.S. I also love the use of the period music as both background and underscoring.",10,2,5,15 January 2011
From Here to Eternity," From Here to Eternity was a mostly fine movie made during the Production Code era
","After so many years of only knowing this film by reputation, I finally watched this on a Korean Air flight. It's a very compelling drama but after reading the differences from the novel on Wikipedia, it probably would have even been a better one had it been made after the Production Code era. I mean, I'm glad Donna Reed-who I always first think of as Mary Bailey in my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life-won the Oscar for her performance but if it had been revealed she was a prostitute and not just a dance hall girl, her performance would have been so much more powerful. And Frank Sinatra was very compelling in his first straight role but if he didn't have a death scene-and his character actually survived in the book-he probably wouldn't have been nominated, not to mention eventually won, his Oscar for this. Still, this was a fine showcase for such actors like Montgomery Clift, Bert Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, and Ernest Borgnine of which this was his first major film role. So, overall, From Here to Eternity was mostly a very well made film. P.S. Another of the players was one Philip Ober, who was married to Vivian Vance at the time. She was in the No. 1 show on TV during this period-'I Love Lucy'-and her hubby had appeared on the show twice, the second time as then M-G-M head Dore Schary. They'd eventually divorce in 1959.",8,2,4,3 July 2016
The Godfather," The Godfather was a very compelling film to watch though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time
","After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s.",7,1,2,3 July 2016
