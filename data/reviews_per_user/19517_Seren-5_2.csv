Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie rocked!!!
","I thought this movie was great. I understand complaints about the character Jar Jar Binks because I found him slightly annoying at first. However, he gets better every time you see the movie. I think that this movie did a very good job of doing what it intended to, which was setting up the next two movies. It is very difficult to do that and still come up with a movie that can stand on its own as well. I think George Lucas accomplished this feat admirably. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages. I felt it was well worth the hype.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best movies ever!
","The original Star Wars is one of the best movies ever. This is not because it is the best made movie ever, but because its simple story and memorable characters touch people. What good is a movie if it doesn't strike a chord with its viewers? This was one of the most successful movies ever because it does just that. All the reasons why I like this movie would never fit in the limited space I have for comments. I just suggest people watch it. If you get it, you'll love it for your own reasons and won't need my comments. If you don't, what I have to say won't help. I think people should be sure to watch all three movies. They are all part of the same story.",10,0,0,28 May 1999
