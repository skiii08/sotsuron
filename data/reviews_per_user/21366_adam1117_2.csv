E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Some misconceptions here
","I just want to point out that a lot of people here are pointing to the 'evil adults' thing as a problem in this movie. This is nonsense; there are no evil or villainous adults in this movie. Sure, the scientists come off as a bit frightening, but they aren't malevolent. There are only two adults who really play roles (the detective guy and the mother), and both are 'in touch with their feelings' and, while not always acting towards the same goals as the kids, they never act remotely evil.This is a great Film. Not a sci-fi movie, a film.",10,2,4,11 February 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," That old, weird America
","Reactions to this movie can typically be cut into two groups. Those who love it, and those who just don't understand what's going on. While such a requirement may keep a film from being accessible, to appreciate this movie, you have to know where it's coming from. Forget Homer, what you really need is an understanding of American folk and bluegrass music. This movie is a screwball comedy set in the land where all those bizarre old ballads came from, what Greil Marcus calls 'That old, weird America.' (other movies that have been set there include 'Night of the Hunter' and 'Housekeeping.') This movie uses folk more effectively than any movie since 'Bound for Glory,' and maybe more improves on even that. If you saw the movie and didn't understand it, but would like to understand why so many people are calling it a masterpiece, you should start by reading 'Mystery Train' and 'Invisible Republic' by Greil Marcus, then listen to some of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, or at least some Stanley Brothers. Get a basic understanding of that, and you'll see why this movie is so brilliant.",10,0,0,5 March 2001
