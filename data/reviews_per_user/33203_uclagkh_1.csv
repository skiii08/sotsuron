The Ring," I scream, you scream...
","Although I am not going to use all those lovely big words that the verbose candadian used on this page, i will tell you what i thought of the movie.i am usually pretty weak sauce when it comes to seeing horror flicks, but i was talked into seeing _the ring_ by a couple of good friends. it literally scared me half to death. i have never before screamed aloud involuntarily until i saw that movie, during which it was all i could do to prevent myself from having a coronary and screaming bloody murder [i stifled my screams with my hand].it was superbly directed, and very well written. i liked that key elements of the plot were not introduced all at once, but rather dropped subtly as the film wore on. the plot was a little sketchy, but its a supernatural thriller, so i guess that is to be expected.it was genuinely scary, and very worthy of a viewing. don't see it alone, however, unless you are a horror film fanatic with no sense of fright left in you.cheers.",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
