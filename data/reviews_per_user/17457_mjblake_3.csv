Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," no phantom, no menace, and sod all entertainment....
","please, george, explain the significance of the title too me, as i saw little of menace and no phantoms neither...... i can only recall once going to a cinema with such low expectations - that for the last batman film, and it managed the unlikely feat of falling miles below them - and so was almost pleasantly surprised that this wasn't that bad. lucas manages to keep things moving at sufficient pace that you're left with no time to think about all the film's many, many faults. at least, that was my experience. and the lightsaber battles were amazing. but what a wasted opportunity - the original trio, by giving us enough info about the characters to make us give a damn, and by staging the battles on an epic scale, made us care about the fate of the people concerned and the universe : this one was just a lot of clever, crisp scenes.  we learn nothing of the background of qui-gon or obi-wan, so why should we care when the former is killed?  and there is not a hint of evil in the film - not in palpatine, certainly no trace of it in anakin, and darth maul's scenes fly by so quickly..... even the battle droids pale into comparison with the stormtroopers and their semi-human / semi-automaton feel....... and why in a movie tailored for kids is that first text roll-up couched in trade-barrier talk and the whole plot driven by legal technicalities.... oh we could just keep on going on couldn't we?   finally - people in costumes or puppets still work much better than the cgu stuff - there's one scene where ewan mcgregor is supposed to be talking with jar-jar but seems to be looking somewhere at the back of his head.....",2,0,1,20 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," They think we are stupid.....
","Contains Spoilers! And from the 80% favourable reviews on this site, they seem to be correct. Sure, there were some whiz-bang special effects, some nice developments which gave fans of Episode IV something to relate to, the scenes with Palpatine were actually pretty good, but......I won't even bother with the embarrassing dialogue, the lifeless direction, the complete absence of any reason why we the audience should care about any of this, the fakeness of any shot with non-human characters (and some of the humans didn't look so real either....), the 5-shots per second action sequences to hide the fact that hey, this is just one bunch of cartoons fighting another bunch of cartoon..... Oops, sorry, I couldn't not bother with them completely. But puh-leeeze :R2 can fly?3PO can swing like an Olympic gymnast?Yoda can do a Sonic Hedgehog impression?Jedi can sense poisonous centipedes in another room - but can't sense when 6 others are sneaking up on them from behind?C3PO knew Lars and Beru before Episode 4 (where he didn't even recognise Tatooine, the planet he was made on)?C3PO's can't function in 'Empire' when cut apart, but his head a droid soldier's are fully interchangeable?Anakin will have a very late growth-spurt to fill out that black costume?Why is there a scene from Gladiator in the film?  And why is there a creature from Lost in Space (or Starship Troopers) in Gladiator?Apart from the video-game franchises, is there any point at all for the Coruscant sky-chase and the Geonosis conveyor belt episodes?Who is paying for these clones, and how are they doing so without anyone knowing about it?Does love only happen when you say it lots - until for no apparent reason the other person says it back.  (A bit like Mr Freeze in Batman 4 with his anger.)Isn't Obi-wan a little young - assuming Luke is born in a few years, then Ewan McGregor turns into Sir Alec in just 25 years?How come when you fall a thousand feet and land on a speeder it doesn't hurt?  Yet a slight encounter with a lightsabre later on renders Kenobi and Anakin motionless....Likewise, you can fall off a platform attached to a rope and it doesn't break your wrist?  (Do NOT try that at home....)In a techno world like Kamino, why would someone be riding a large reptilian bird-like creature?  In the rain. Exchange rates make fuel for a speeder / aeroplane-thingy expensive, perhaps?Is it likely that having ignored her for ten years, after first travelling a parsec across the galaxy then zooming through the night across the desert, a young man will find his mother 35 seconds before she dies?Does a senator and former queen really pack her own luggage?In this advanced society why is there so little basic medical care - surely it was worth resuscitating Padme's dying double in the first scene?Are Coruscant short-order chefs really the best place to find information about one planet missing from the databases - (if there are 'thousands of systems' looking to leave the Republic just how many planets can there be in total)?And, finally, my own personal favourite, the one thing which really really reeeeaaalllllly depressed me about this film....In the high-tech world of Star Wars, they can make hand-cuffs which are immune to being opened by Jedi mind control, but by god, they haven't figured out how to make hand-cuffs which can't be picked by a lady's hair-pin!The Star Wars philosophy is clearly to let know no illogicality, no completely and utterly ridiculous piece of plotline, stand in the way of a good action sequence or other excuse to show off your new computer toy (except, the action sequences aren't actually any good - Starship Troopers and most of the Alien films looked way way better....)",4,0,0,20 May 2002
Notting Hill," liable to give you tooth-ache.....
","'Notting Hill' has an attractive leading couple, an interesting supporting cast, and more laughs than your average romantic comedy, but overall it makes 'Four Weddings...' look like gritty social drama.  Sweet, sweet, sweet. After a decent set-up, thought-provoking even, (how would YOU react if your friend brought a mega-movie-star along as a date to your dinner party?) at every juncture thereafter the film leaves all sense of reality behind and heads off on flights of fancies...... If you want to disengage your brain as the lights dim, and enter a fantasy world where movie stars and mortals meet, mix, and fall in love inside 10 minutes, then this is the film for you. If, however, you're hoping for some sort of realism, and any insights at all into relationships in the 90's, try somewhere else, sorry. Where you might expect to hear the sorts of conversations which might explain why Julia should fall in love with Hugh, you'll only get lingering views of beautiful faces and soft music....... .....And how come Hugh demonstrated that he lived on planet earth by recognising 'Anna Scott' but somehow didn't know who Leonardo Dicaprio was?",7,0,0,1 June 1999
