Walk the Line," Awesome movie!
","I was born in the 1980's and didn't really have a thing for country music. I despised country. I hated it so much that I couldn't stand listening to it. I was always a pop kind of listener and I didn't start liking country music until I started dating my husband. And that's when I first heard of Johnny Cash. I know, it's sad but I can't help it.. :) After listening to country music more and more I began to like it and now I don't listen to really anything other than country. I just went and saw the movie tonight and I give it an A++++++++++++. It is a VERY VERY good movie. I will probably go see it again if not, I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. I recommend buying tickets in advance because it will sell out very fast (I learned the hard way). I hope this movie gets an Oscar, an Academy Award AND an Emmy. It deserves to get at least one of those.",10,1,3,20 November 2005
