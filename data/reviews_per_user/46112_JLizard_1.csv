Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Poorly Put Together But Richly Tickles the Brain
","I think this movie was only 84 minutes but if they would have made it the standard 120 it could have all come together less choppy. If they were going to make it this so unsmooth, you would think the directors would have done more 'Blair Witch' kind of shooting. But they didn't, they use sophisticated cameras but the scene to scene thing is unrefined. Again, it's this hey this is a funny idea and this is a funny idea but they don't really have anything to do with each other but let's put the scenes next to each other in the movie anyway.OK, but here is problem. This movie IS FUNNY. THE SCENES ARE Ridiculous. I couldn't stop laughing.Part of the reason this movie is so hysterical is that it abides by absolutely no ethics. Things we are taught not to even consider in life this movie presents in abundance. I work very hard not to be racist in life and I feel guilt if I slip, but this movie has so much bias in it that it kind of makes you realize how ignorant racism is. Shows you that it's not rocket science not to be racist, just simple common sense.As I was watching Borat, I also had reoccurring thoughts of stupid things that I had done in my life. It let me laugh at mistakes that once hounded me.",9,2,8,11 May 2007
