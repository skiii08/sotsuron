Blade Runner 2049," The 35 Year Wait is Worth It
","It's been 35 years since Ridley Scott delivered his iconic sci-fi noir based on Philip K. Dick's novella 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and now director Denis Villeneuve has brought us a sequel that many fans have been anxiously anticipating. Was the three and a half decade wait worth such a lengthy hiatus? Honestly it sure as hell was in this writer's opinion.A brief plot synopsis: 30 years after Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) hunted replicants, Tyrell Corp has now been bought by wealthy financier Niander Wallace (Oscar winner Jared Leto) who now manufactures obedient replicants who don't question their purpose unlike their predecessors. However replicant Blade Runner 'K' (Ryan Gosling) soon begins to find bizarre clues that lead him to question whether he actually is a replicant or may have been human when he finds some bones at the sight of his most recent assignment. Soon the agent goes on the run in order to find the truth and it's a slow-boiling adventure that will make your mind race.Director Denis Villeneuve casts this film quite well especially with Ryan Gosling's portrayal of the new Blade Runner. Gosling's K is the character we stick with for the majority of the film's nearly three hour run-time and the actor is more than capable of commanding the screen and bringing a supposedly emotionless character to life. Gosling sticks to stone-faced expressions for the film as K is quickly revealed as a replicant and is extremely skilled at his profession (like Deckard before him), but when K finds the bones of a female replicant (a character from the original film) and as he probes further into the case K begins to question if he is actually human and Gosling's stony faÃ§ade begins to crumble little by little. K begins to feel some form of love for his A.I. called Joi (Ana de Armas), he has a moment where he cries after finding a wooden horse that he remembered having as a child and even at the film's climax K smiles at Deckard and has a look of serenity after the old Blade Runner leaves K alone outside.Original star Harrison Ford doesn't appear until the film's final act which is beautifully built up. Not much is explained about Rick Deckard's thirty year absence except for hinting about his job being a main reason and who he took off with at the original film's conclusion. Thankfully not having the original film's star appear until near the end helps keep the emphasis on K and his mission.Sadly the most underused character in the film is the primary antagonist, Niander Wallace. Jared Leto brings his usual A-game to this blind mogul, but his screen-time is so limited that we never get to know much about Wallace other than his takeover of the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation and his mission to create replicants who won't question their lives like Roy Batty and company in the original 1982 film. What lead Wallace to create replicants who are subservient is never made clear, but it could be that Wallace is aware of what happened with Roy Batty and his group of rogue replicants in 'Blade Runner'. Leto's performance in the film is good as he has to use his voice and subtle body language as Niander is blind; his voice lilts from his trademark softness when close enough to another actor to a slightly raised when he enters a scene or gives a bit of a lecture. However Leto isn't wasted and makes the most of his brief screen-time and does leave an impression.The film's style is just as distinctive here as it was in the 1982 film. While Ridley Scott's visuals had a little more lighting in a mostly blackened landscape, Villeneuve's film is even bleaker as the cinematography (shot marvelously by Roger Deakins) with grays, dark yellow-gold and black for the shadows; the three leads, K, Rick Deckard and Niander Wallace are introduced in shadow when they each speak their first line of dialogue. With this sequel the new color palate makes the setting of 2049 L.A. even more dystopic than the 1982 film was and also capitalizes on technology that is now available in the film's time-line like the flying cars seen in the original, A.I. being a psychical presence (evidenced by Joi's hologram form) and of course our replicant hero. The film also has some subtle throwbacks to its predecessor like K eating Asian cuisine alone in a Chinatown-like district which is similar to Rick Deckard in the 1982 film. Another highlight of the film is the musical score (co-written by Oscar winner Hans Zimmer) which almost has a war drum feel to it as the pounding percussive vibrations are like a call to arms and echo heart-pounding anxiety.With a nearly 3 hour run-time the film does feel a bit tedious at certain points, but the action scenes help speed some of the slower sections up thanks to the relentless movement of characters and the driving musical score. The story is a potboiler of events; a slowly escalating chase between K and Wallace's replicant assistant, Love, as she is restless in her pursuit of our hero once he essentially goes AWOL. There are many emotional moments that might produce some tears or make you wring your hands.Go see this movie and experience a new adventure",8,6,16,6 October 2017
Vertigo," Fear, Betrayal and Forbidden Love
","The immortal James Stewart once again joins forces with the Master of Suspense to craft this tale of forbidden love and betrayal. Stewart plays the role of acrophobic detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife, Madeline (icy blonde Kim Novak)who has been behaving strangely. Scottie soon develops a dangerous obsession with the beautiful Madeline which takes a tragic turn and shatters Scottie's struggling sanity. Hitchcock delivers a crafty story centered around obsession, betrayal and secrecy. Stewart's performance as the troubled hero is one of a dark, brooding man who is clearly unbalanced from the opening scene after his partner falls to his death. Kim Novak as the alluring blonde is chilling and haunting with her calm, icy demeanor and lovely looks.",7,0,1,10 November 2012
The Sound of Music," Stunning!!!!!!
","The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like 'Do-Re-Mi', 'My Favorite Things' and 'Climb Every Mountain.' Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.",8,2,8,2 August 2012
Finding Neverland," Beautifully Written and Touching Performances
","'Findig Neverland' is such a beautiful story and is brought to the screen by wonderful actors and a talented crew. Johnny Depp is dazzling in his performance of the famous Sir James Matthew Barrie who brought us 'Peter Pan.' Depp just takes your breath away with his heartwarming personality, Scottish accent and handsome looks. Kate Winslet as the lovely widow, Sylvia Llwellyn Davies, is one of grace and dignity that makes her character such a strong presence, but she is so dainty and sweet as well. The film is one that will touch your heart forever and you will fall in love with this charming and beloved little tale on the origin of one of the most well known plays of the early 20th century.",9,2,2,5 August 2012
John Wick," One of the best action films of the last decade
","Did anyone expect this 2014 action thriller to be a success? The film took audiences and critics by storm with its exciting and tense action sequences, a strong leading performance by 'The Matrix' star Keanu Reeves as well as a talented supporting cast, a simple yet memorable plot and masterful direction.Keanu Reeves does what he does best in this smashing success: speak little dialogue and kick ass by shooting and killing the bad guys. Playing a former hit-man who is thrown back into the game after young punks kill his beloved puppy dog and steal his car, Reeves is on top of his game. The actor brings his own A-game to the part as he plays the title character as brooding, mysterious and intelligent all rolled into a lethal combination. Reeves' John Wick is a man on a mission and is prepared with a deadly arsenal of weaponry to dispatch his enemies. The film also boasts a talented supporting cast particularly from Michael Nyqvist as Russian mob boss, Viggo, Ian McShane as Wick's former boss, Winston (the actor will reprise his role in the sequel) and Willem Dafoe as Wick's old friend and ally, Marcus. The actors all bring their unique flavors from Nyqvist being a quietly sinister villain who will take down Reeves's John Wick at any cost, McShane brings a worldly wisdom and silent ruthlessness to keep his prize assassin alive and Dafoe brings his snarky quips and loyal friendship to Marcus who is unwilling to kill his old friend which of course leads to trouble. You can never predict what action some of the characters will take or where their true loyalties lie, but it is thrilling to watch and wait for. The actions sequences are relentless and fast-paced without resorting to shaky cam tactics. Guns fire, blood flies, fisticuffs ensue, the colors are dark and vibrant and the motions are all frenetic. The stunts are well choreographed as the actors move through fight scenes with almost snake-like slickness while the camera angles are wide enough for us to take in the action and relish all the excitement.",8,2,5,28 January 2017
Se7en," Dark, Twisted and Terrifying
","Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset.The chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is electric as their characters' personalities clash perfectly. With Pitt playing the hot-headed rookie with Freeman as the seasoned veteran, Mills and Somerset are initially at odds with each other as Somerset disapproves of Mills's quick temper. However the duo realizes that they both must solve the riddle behind the film's killing spree. But their efforts come at a high cost at the film's close when the epic twist is revealed (which I will not reveal here).The murder scenes are grisly and unsettling which should not be viewed by the squeamish. Director David Fincher does spare us the horrible 'Lust' murder in the film; the details are vaguely described by a witness/participant. And the film's climatic death is portrayed only by the reaction of Morgan Freeman's Somerset as he discovers the truth and valiantly tries to stop the film's final brutal act.If you are able to handle this chilling tale, be prepared to check behind you.",8,1,2,22 September 2013
Memento," A Stroke of Genius
","I always enjoy a great mind boggling film;'Memento' is one of the best ever. Christopher Nolan incorporates a sophisticated plot that you never know where you're going throughout the movie unless you pay close attention to the events that occur in the film. What grabs my attention is the mystery of how the plot unfolds surrounding Leonard's explanation of how he came to murder Teddy, but is what he saying really the truth? The answer is that we don't know since there is no reliable narrator to verify our suspicions or tell us what really happened. The reason is because LEONARD IS THE NARRATOR and he wants to believe that his actions are just and that his story about how his wife died and he got his 'condition' is the truth. But that is for the viewer to decide as he or she actually watches the film.",9,0,2,26 July 2012
Zootopia," One of Disney's Best in Recent Years
","Disney hit it out of the park with this comedy mystery about a optimistic young bunny who achieves her dream of being a cop in the title city. She eventually teams up with a con artist fox to solve the city's greatest crime wave to surprising results. The film contains stellar vocal performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, the idealistic bunny cop, Jason Bateman as the duplicitous but charming fox, Nick Wilde, Idris Elba as Judy's boss and a memorable J.K. Simmons in the small role of Mayor Lionheart. The film's narrative alternates between dramatic, comedic and some gripping action sequences. The undeniable best component of 'Zootopia' is the undeniable chemistry of its lead characters in Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde's unusual partnership. Initially the two are always at odds with Judy's 'by the book' attitude and Nick's trickster ways, but through their trials and tribulations the two begin to connect due to difficult moments from their pasts. Its' the proverbial animal buddy cop film.A great movie that is perfect for any age group.",9,2,5,4 July 2016
Mississippi Burning," An Important Film about Racial Tension, Political Views and Humanity
","Films that deal with civil rights issues can be a touchy subject and Alan Parker's 1988 film about true events was a firestorm for controversy. The film's dark subject matter about violence towards the African-American community in 1963 Mississippi remains an important part of shaped the eventual progress to equality for all races. The film tells the tale of two federal agents (Gene Hackman as Rupert Anderson and Willem Dafoe as Alan Ward) sent to the Deep South to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers (two African- American men and one Caucasian man). What the men find is the roots of corruption run deep in the town as the local lawmen and KKK members attempt to scare Anderson and Ward off, but their reserve steels the agents against the hate they constantly endure.As the leads, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the voices of reason among the judgmental and horrible characters in the small town their characters are investigating. Hackman plays the loose cannon officer who will bend the rules to get results while Dafoe is the by-the-books and ethical man, but later converts to Hackman's tactics after tensions boil to a breaking point between Anderson and Ward. The actors' chemistry is palpable as they play off each other in tandem from verbal sparring to their eventual physical confrontation, but without losing a mutual respect for how the other handles the investigation.The narrative is loosely inspired by the actual disappearance and murders of three civil rights workers (as depicted in the film's opening scene). However the movie delves into fiction for the majority of its run-time which does hurt the accuracy of the story. The inaccuracies however do not take away from the gripping power of the story as the movie is more focused on the inherent racism in the South during the 1960s. The movie's subject matter lent to controversy about the violence depicted against the black community, but the film scored Oscar nominations despite the criticism (however star Gene Hackman grew wary about films with such violence which caused him to withdraw from participating in 'Silence of the Lambs' after he had bought the rights).Do not miss this film, it'll open your mind on what it was like back in an era of civil unrest.",7,1,2,20 January 2017
12 Angry Men," A Tale of Justice and Truth
","One of the best known courtroom dramas since 'To Kill a Mockingbird' starring the great Henry Fonda in a tale of justice and the search for truth. A young boy has been accused of murder of his abusive father and now it's up to 12 men to decide if the boy will live or be sent to the electric chair. 11 men believe the defendant is guilty, but one lone juror (played stoically by Fonda) is convinced that the boy is innocent of the murder. Also starring Lee J. Cobb as the antagonistic and angry Juror #3 who harbors personal hatreds, John Fiedler as the meek Juror #2. Jack Klugman as Juror #5 who was raised in the slums, Martin Balsam as the Foreman of the jury and many more make up this panel of unique personalities. The film is packed with tension, anger and mostly importantly a tale of morals and its importance on human judgment. A truly wonderful film by famed director Sidney Lumet with a memorable cast.",10,1,1,10 November 2012
The English Patient," Exquisite Cinematography, Well Acted, but Overly Sentimental and Unnecessarily Long
","Winner of 9 Oscars and in my honest opinion one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. This should not take away from the fact that the film does beautiful locations with some stellar acting by its all star cast all under the keen directorial eye of Anthony Minghella.Told mostly through flashbacks, the film based on the bestselling novel tells the tragic tale of a mysterious Hungarian Count and his love affair with a married Englishwoman in World War II Africa. The 'patient' of the title is the Count telling his tale to the French Canadian nurse who is caring for him after a terrible accident that horrifically burned him, and also a Canadian Army Officer who is investigating the Count as part of an Intelligence operation. The film boasts an all star cast giving some career-best performances. Playng the title 'English Patient' (in his 2nd Oscar nominated role) is the wonderfully talented Ralph Fiennes as Count Almasy, a man supposedly of Hungarian nobility but whose past is so mysterious that we never learn who Almasy really is or where he came from. Fiennes is charming, brooding at times and eloquent in the role and makes the mystery surrounding his character even more compelling despite the unanswered questions about his past. Fiennes does display a formidable chemistry with costar Kristin Scott- Thomas who plays the married woman who is the object of his affections along with some minutely interesting (yet sadly wasted for all the flashbacks) scenes with fellow actors Juliette Binoche who plays his nurse and Willem Dafoe as the officer who is looking into Almasy's background. Juliette Binoche won the film's only acting Oscar for her work as French- Canadian nurse Hanna who cares for the injured Count. The actress is subtle, soft-spoken and articulate mixed with naivety towards the dangers of the world she is living after a brutal international conflict. Hanna is still intelligent as she cares for those around her such as her patient, Officer David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who is looking into her patient's past but trusts him to protect them from harm, and particularly in her relationship with Kip, a British-Indian officer stationed near the villa where Hanna and her patient are sequestered. We don't learn about Hanna's background prior to the war and its aftermath, but what we see from Binoche's portrayal Hanna is the center of the present-day narrative as she connects with those around her.Rounding out the other two key roles are Willem Dafoe as David Caravvagio, the officer seeking out Almasy, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as Katharine Cifton, the woman whom Almasy loved. As Caravvagio, Dafoe is a smaller character than than those of Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche and Kristin Scott-Thomas (despite receiving third billing), but the character has a connection that does matter to the narrative. Fiennes's Almasy was reputed to be a spy for the Axis Powers (which we and David never learn the actual truth) and his actions lead to a horrific consequence for Caravvagio; Caravaggio is tortured and loses some digits in one of the most harrowing scenes of the film (just hearing actor Willem Dafoe's screams and barely seeing the torture unfold made me have to cover my eyes and almost scream out myself). The tension is palpable between Caravvagio and Almasy in the present as Dafoe portrays a quiet desire for revenge for the wrong inflicted on him, but also a developing sympathy for the injured shell of a man before him in addition to the protective and caring nature that David displays towards young Hanna (it is clear that he probably harbored romantic feelings for Hanna) as she hides in the villa with her patient. Actress Kristin Scott-Thomas embodies the typical proper Englishwoman as Katharine Clifton; obedient, soft-spoken, well dressed and kemped but an intelligent woman. Katharine begins the film as a loyal wife to her husband (Colin Firth) who it seems would never be an adulteress, but when she begins to spend more time with Count Almasy, Katharine starts to question where her heart truly lies. She attempts to live both ways, but must make a choice when she fears that her husband will discover her affair with Almasy. The ultimate decision she makes ends up with a steep price for both her and her lover by the film's end.The locations are stunning throughout the film as the narrative juxtaposes from war-torn Africa to the ravaged countryside of Italy in the present. The sets are confined for the Italian locales as we are isolated with the small ragtag group of Hanna, Count Almasy, David Caravaggio and Kip with his fellow officers who patrol the perimeter to protect the other three. Contrasting the isolation is the vast scope of the African deserts and crowded villages where we see many peoples from soldiers, townsfolk, some of the central and minor characters but also so much empty space once we are traveling the desert near the end of the flashback narrative. The vastness again evokes an isolating feeling.The film's run-time is egregiously long and plodding which is the most irritating factor of the film other than the schmaltzy romance. Sitting through nearly three hours of a love story is excruciating even with the great cinematography and good acting. This boredom might evoke memories of a classic sitcom episode where a TV character openly expressed her dismay at sitting through multiple viewings of this film. I can relate because I get so bored that I have to keep myself busy to keep from falling asleep.A stunning masterpiece of filmmaking despite its minor flaws.",6,1,2,2 February 2017
The Notebook," Sweet Story
","'The Notebook' is a lovely, sweet film based on the novel of the same name written by Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have a touching chemistry throughout this film that it brings tears to your eyes. Romance is not really my cup of tea, but I watched this with some friends once and did manage to cry a little. The story takes a while to get going, but once it's all set then it is worth following. The romance is tacked on for the majority of the picture, but the truth at the end of the film makes the moment sweet and touching. This movie is definitely one that any romance fan will want to see again and again. If you want a movie that can make your boyfriend cry, then check out 'The Notebook.'",5,1,2,7 August 2012
Public Enemies," Intense and Thrilling
","Johnny Depp brings a gangster-charming quality to his performance as famous (or should I say infamous)gangster John Dillinger in this dramatization of the criminal's life as 'Public Enemy # 1.' Though not everything is historically accurate, this film is still an interesting story on the last few months in the life of Chicago's most infamous resident since the days of Capone. Alongside Depp is 'Batman' star Christian Bale as FBI Agent Melvin Purvis who spent years chasing after Dillinger through the Midwest of the United States. In her American film debut is Marion Cotillard as the lovely Billie Freschett, the main squeeze of Dillinger before his death. The film really sets you into the era of the 1930s when crime was rampant and the most infamous criminals were loose in the streets of Chicago. If you want a good crime thrill, then check out 'Public Enemies'",6,0,0,10 September 2012
The Other Boleyn Girl," Semi interesting, but mostly disappointing
","The story of Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn is well known throughout British history, but the story of Anne's sister, Mary is not. I will not give away anything from the movie because there really is not anything to tell. The story is fascinating as Mary tells what happens in the events surrounding Henry and Anne, but there is nothing too shocking that history hasn't told us about them. The acting is average with Natalie Portman (Best Actress winner at the 2011 Oscars for 'Black Swan') as Anne, Scarlett Johannsen as Mary and Eric Bana as King Henry VIII. Scarlett has her moments during this drama and so does Portman, but Bana's talent is lacking as the king who executed two of his wives (Katharine Howard was the second to lose her head). The best part is Johannsen as Mary and that is all.",6,0,2,4 August 2012
Us," What if the mirror could look back?
","Following his Academy Award win for the superb 'Get Out', Jordan Peele returned to horror with his sophomore feature. However if you were hoping for the same psychological horror of his debut, well it gets gorier this time however there is still psychological terror to found. This does not take away from the excellent story that Peele has crafted this time.Following a normal young African-American family: timid Adelaide (the wonderful Lupita N'yongo), goofy husband Gabe (Winston Duke being both hilarious and serious when the time comes), technology-loving Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the troubled Jason (Evan Alex who is quite unsettling), who venture to their summer home for a vacation. However Adelaide struggles with a traumatic experience from her childhood where she might have found her double in a hall of mirrors. One evening the family spots ominous figures on their lawn at 11:11pm (a prominent plot point) which unfortunately turns out to be their doubles (played by all four actors; only N'yongo speaks, but with a chilling grating voice). Will they make it or not? No spoiler here.The cast is brilliant as they each must inhabit both their average Joe characters and their silent (except for Nyongo's Red) counterparts who make their intentions clear to toy with the family and then kill them all. Lupita N'yongo is obviously the most standout as her counterpart is the only one who can speak English and that voice is haunting to the core as Red almost clicks as her voice cuts off momentarily before she finishes her sentences. The explanation comes at the film's climax once Adelaide goes to confront her double to save Jason after Red nabs him, but that's why you must see the film to know why.While the film's narrative is quite compelling and straightforward, most critics have voiced their displeasure with the ending sequence of the film. I can agree that Red's monologue to Adelaide is long-winded and preachy; probably due to Peele taking advantage of being the sole writer. While others bemoan the final twists of the film I actually found myself surprised at who was actually who and the implication of the final shots were haunting for its real world implication.",9,1,3,6 April 2019
Finding Nemo," One of Pixar's greatest animated features
","Pixar has been on a consistent roll of success since their first animated feature 'Toy Story'. With their beloved oceanic tale of a clown-fish father looking for his kidnapped son, Pixar struck gold with their audiences all over the globe. The animation juggernaut is well known for creating relatable characters and the fishy residents of Sydney, Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef are no different. Many parents can relate to the worrisome nature of clown-fish Marlin, a father who has grown far too overprotective of his son (the titular Nemo) after a tragedy takes away his family except for his lone son, and children can relate to Nemo wanting to rebel and care for himself, but is stifled by Marlin's constant hovering, as well as Nemo's fear when he first arrives in the tank at the dentist's office. And then there can those of us who are forgetful can see ourselves in the lovably space-case Dory, but Dory also is loyal, cheerful and kindhearted despite her lapses in memory.The voice casting in the film is pitch perfect. Forming the film's familial bond are comedic-dramatic actor Albert Brooks as the high-strung Marlin, hilariously overzealous while maintaining a serious tone in appropriate scenes, and young actor Alexander Gould brings a wonderful naivety yet youthful boldness to Nemo, maturing well through the film as he goes from an impulsive child to a smarter and brave kid who will pull his weight. The film's first set of comedic relief is the hilariously diverse tank gang who reside in an Austrailian dentist's fish tank where Nemo ends up and needs to escape from. With memorable characters like the bubble-obsessed yellow tang Bubbles (voiced by 'NewRadio' alumni Stephen Root), French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced with a spot-on faux accent by the late Joe Ranft), the motherly and tank gang watchdog starfish Peach (voice of Allison Janney of 'Juno' and the sitcom 'Mom' fame), kindhearted and prone to random bloating flair-ups blow-fish Bloat (voiced by Brad Garrett), neurotic royal gamma Gurgle (voiced to perfection by Austin Pendleton) and the ditzy but sweet Deb (voived by another 'NewsRadio' alumni Vicki Lewis) who thinks her reflection in the tank's glass is her twin sister. Leading the ragtag group that Nemo finds himself surrounded by is the grizzled and father figure-like butterfly fish Gill (voiced perfectly by Willem Dafoe, whose iconic low vocal tones are utilized to perfection), the tank leader who is more than determined to escape the confines of the office and glass prison. However the film's scene-stealing, or should it be said movie-stealing, character is the lovably forgetful Dory voiced to comedic brilliance by talk show host and comedienne Ellen DeGeneres. Dory is initially a massive pain in the neck for Marlin as her memory lapses test the clown-fish's patience, but her devoted and helpful nature soon grow on the stingy Marlin. The film's comic relief from the drama of the situation that Marlin finds himself in, Dory is always an optimist who sees the bright side of a problem. Her funniest moment would arguably be Dory's whale-talking after she and Marlin have disembarked the sea turtle driven EAC (East Australian Current). DeGeneres goes hilariously over the top as she makes various oddball sounds that sometimes sound like whale intonations but other times are just random guttural or bizarre shouts that will split sides and force tears of laughter.Lush animations based on actual sketches of the Great Barrier Reef and its oceanic specimens as well the surrounding Sydney neighborhood are breathtaking and put us right in the environments the characters live in. A wonderful family film that will make you laugh, cry and hug your relatives even tighter.",10,1,2,13 February 2017
The Natural," A Sports Classic
","Robert Redford shines in this classic tale of baseball mixed with attempted murder, betrayal, testing of faith and survival. Redford plays Roy Hobbs who aspires to be a Major League player after discovering he has a great pitching talent at a young age. Roy's dreams are ended when a mysterious woman (Barbara Hershey) shoots him in a murder attempt and then she commits suicide. Years later, Roy takes up his dreams again and heads to the Minor League team, the New York Knights who are the worst team in their league. Eventually Roy is faced with a repeat of his past when another mysterious woman (Kim Basinger) enters the picture. I normally don't like sports movies, but 'The Natural' is a huge exception. Robert Redford is one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint in this film. He has the charm and strength that Roy has, but he plays on Roy's weaknesses so well that he evokes the sympathy that he gets at the opening of the film. If you are into sports, 'The Natural' is just the one for you.",9,0,1,7 August 2012
Ed Wood," Typical Burton Oddity
","Edward D. Wood, Jr., best known for 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' was hailed as the worst director in Hollywood history. Yet, Tim Burton manages to compose a dark humored comical tale based on the life and career of this man. Johnny Depp brings his natural odd sense of humor to his performance as the title role. Depp's Ed Wood is composed of the director's odd taste in film direction and his harbored transvestism, but is well acted and brings out laughs at certain points in the film. Martin Landau's supporting role as the famed horror star Bela Lugosi is so brilliant highlighted by the fading stardom that hit Lugosi in his latter years in a changing film world (Landau won the 1994 Oscar for Supporting Actor in the role). Truly a film for any Burton fan and those familiar with Wood's films.",7,1,1,9 November 2012
L.A. Confidential," A Masterful Mystery Adventure
","James Ellroy's best-selling mystery has now been brought to the big screen and is one of the finest mysteries in cinematic history. The story follows three 1950s detectives in the legendary Los Angeles Police Department so completely different from one another; first is Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey, 2 time Academy Award winner), the technical adviser on 'Badge of Honor' and a Narcotics Officer, but accepts bribes from 'Hush-Hush Magazine' writer Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito). Next is Officer Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe in his first US film), a troubled man with a vendetta against wife-beaters due to a traumatizing event from his past where his mother was beaten to death by White's drunken father. Lastly is the young and ambitious Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce also in his US debut), a young man following in the footsteps of his late father whose dedication to justice clouds his vision to what is about to unravel. The film also stars Kim Basinger (in an Oscar winning role)and James Cromwell. After a nighttime massacre claims one of the department's own, the three men are drawn together into the mystery involving murder, greed, prostitution and drugs. 'L.A. Confidential' is my all time favorite police film drama with its complicated plot line, complex characters, the intense cast and the cast's performances to bring the mystery close to the light, but the twists are numerous and the ultimate conclusion will startle the viewer.",8,0,1,25 July 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," A Fun Romp to End the 'Thor Series
","Ah the true 'Thor' film that audiences had hungered for. While the prior two films were good in their factors, director Taika Waititi really tapped into Marvel's trademark humor and themes for this third outing of the Norse God of Thunder. Drawing from two storylines (the 'Ragnarok' story arc and 'Planet Hulk'), the viewer follows Thor, his mischievous brother Loki, Valkyrie and Bruce Banner/Hulk as they must join forces to combat the wicked goddess of death, Hela, who happens to Thor and Loki's sister, before she destroys Asgard and the rest of the world.The cast really expands their connection as alliances are forged and at times broken while the protagonists must come together in the end to defeat Hela. 1. Chris Hemsworth really changes his portrayal of Thor from his introduction to the MCU in 2011 . Thor has seen much collateral and carnage from his brother's reign of terror and brief banishment in the first film and 'The Avengers', battling the evil dwarf Malekith in 'Thor: the Dark World' and the battle against the robotic villain Ultron in the 2nd Avengers outing. However facing off against his evil sister forces Thor to trust his scheming half-brother to save their people despite Loki's usual double-crossing. Hemsworth even sheds his long locks in the film and dons a new short haircut (courtesy of Stan Lee himself). Thor even finds himself learning to bond with the moody Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) though the two have never gotten along much. 2. Tom Hiddleston brings his usual lovable charisma to the scheming Loki who has hardly changed his ways since we last saw in 2013. Loki faked his death in 'The Dark World' in order to oust his aging adopted father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) from the throne. However when Thor returns and Odin warns both sons that their sister is coming upon Odin's passing, Loki temporarily puts aside his dislike for Thor and helps Thor try to combat Hela but this truce wasn't meant to last. Hiddleston quickly digs into his bag of tricks as Loki ingratiates himself with the enemy when Thor is captured by Valkyrie and sold to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum in his usual awkward glory) to save his own hide. The God of Mischief's most hilarious moment is his relishing in Thor's thrashing by Hulk in the arena; a callback to Loki's own humiliation in 'The Avengers' when Hulk tossed him around like a ragdoll. Despite his backstabbing ways, Loki does come through for his brother when leading all the former workers of the Grandmaster's planet to Asgard in order to take down Hela and her undead army. 3. Tessa Thompson joins the ragtag bunch as Valkyrie, a former warrior of the same name, who makes her living as a scavenger due to bitterness at losing to Hela many moons before the film's events. While the character isn't as fleshed out as the other heroes, Thompson brings a somewhat gritty attitude, but tough persona that shows her ability to fight her battles without being rescued by the male heroes. While initially distrustful of Thor and Loki, Valkyrie's sense of duty does pull out in the film's midpoint as she heads back to Asgard with Thor and Hulk to avenge her long-ago fallen comrades. 4. The lovely and talented Cate Blanchett brings all her skills to her first true villain role as Hela. Imbuing the goddess with a swift cruelty, Blanchett lets her inner bad girl out as she struts around the set like a queen who has already won. Hela quickly establishes her power when she destroys Thor's hammer and sends her brothers packing. Her justice for decenters is equally cruel, having the foolish Skurge (Karl Urban) serve as her executioner. Even nastier is Thor losing his eye to her during their duel to the death; talk about serious family drama.The film's humor is sharp as ever especially in callbacks to earlier Marvel films such as the 'Avengers' films. Loki and Hulk have some of the funniest jabs to throw at the title hero like Hulk's fire comparison or Loki's disdain of being used as a battering ram in the 'Get Help' plan. The visuals are impressive with thunder blasts, the fiery Surtur and his underworld plus destruction near the end of the film and the new worlds like the Grandmaster's planet. The story is well crafted and gripping as we watch the characters band together and help build the groundwork for 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity Wars'.",8,1,4,13 December 2017
The Prestige," Nolan Strikes Again
","'Are you watching closely?' opens this film about magic, rivalry, betrayal, love and tragedy. I'm not really into movies about magic, but 'The Prestige' to me is really more of a drama about the rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) than it is about magic itself. At the film's start, Borden is on trial for the death of his former friend and rival, Angier who drowned in a water tank upon completing a trick. How did these two become rivals? The first flashback of the film tells the viewer that Borden and Angier were once partners in the business along with Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo) but one tragic night Julia drowns during a performance when she cannot escape her rope bindings. Angier places the blame squarely on Borden and swears to destroy his former friend's life.Without giving too much more away, the film's tension escalates dramatically as both Jackman and Bale's characters descend further into the treacherous rabbit hole of secrets, lies and betrayal. This leads the viewer to wonder who else will fall victim to the all-consuming obsession of Jackman's Angier in his endless pursuit to ruin Borden.In the leading roles of Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale couldn't be more different. Jackman is brash, arrogant and narcissistic as Angier while Bale is soft-spoken, more reserved and secretive as Borden. The actors play off each other brilliantly as the magicians wage war for the best in their profession; an unending cat and mouse game that pulls the viewer further into the depths of their heated rivalry. Since we are given the film from both their perspectives, it is almost impossible to know which character to trust for the truth. Among the film's supporting performances are a heart-wrenching Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife, Sarah, who becomes the final innocent victim in the dangerous web her husband is entangled in, Scarlett Johannson as the duplicitous Olivia Wenscombe, Angier's assistant turned traitor by Borden when Angier dispatches her to learn his rival's secrets, Michael Caine as John Cutter, Angier's ingenuier (one who designs the illusions for a magic show) who warns Jackman's obsessive Angier that his pursuit will only end badly, Andy Serkis (most famous for his motion-capture performances as Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings' series) as Alley, (fictional) assistant to famed scientist, Nikola Tesla and in a mesmerizing cameo as the famed electrical pioneering scientist is the distinguished David Bowie who holds nothing back in his portrayal of Tesla; even adopting a convincing Eastern European accent to cover his native British accent. The narrative is gripping, full of twists and turns like a magic show, but it never ceases to pull the rug away with the exposure of what is real and what is illusion. We are never certain what really motivates Angier and Borden even when they give their own reasons to other characters (example: Angier tells Olivia that he wants to ruin Borden for damaging his new illusion; not in revenge for Julia's death early in the film). The ultimate climax contains the film's best shocking moments as the web is finally unraveled, but there are still questions left that we'll never get the answer to. But the question is: do we really want to know or do we want to be fooled?",10,0,1,2 August 2012
Sleepy Hollow," Hardly Worthy of an R Rating
","Tim Burton takes on Washington Irving's classic ghost story in this 1999 adaption with Johnny Depp in the lead and Christina Ricci as the love interest. The film tells of Constable Ichabod Crane who travels to the quaint village of Sleepy Hollow to solve the rash of murders by the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken who is unseen for most of the film except for two flashbacks and the finale). The film is quite spooky for the majority of the film, but hardly a rated R movie. The only moments when that rating plays in is when the victims are decapitated on-screen. Johnny's performance is one that emasculates him at times in the movie, but he amuses me too. Miss Ricci is a sweet, but mysterious presence in her scenes throughout the film as we uncover the truth behind the mystery of the Horseman. This film is worth a viewing if you aren't too squeamish.",7,0,0,2 August 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Grand Western
","Normally I'm not a Western fan, but this film is an exception. The tale of Butch Cassidy and his gang is a well-know story of the days of yester- year. Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular characters are a real treat to watch on-screen in their first team-up. The humor in the film makes you almost forget that these two men are 'fierce' thieves. This film is a ride through the history of Cassidy and Sundance's criminal career packed with comedy, drama and two great stars who only did two films together, but made the most of their time. If you're a Western fan then check this film out and be prepared for a good time.",10,1,2,30 July 2012
BlacKkKlansman," Relevant, timely and Spike Lee's best to date
","With movements like #BlackLivesMatter and of course the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1970s, this Spike Lee film couldn't have arrived at a better time in modern history. Taking the true story of Ron Stallworth, the sole African-American cop in the Colorado Springs PD in the early 1970s who through a clever ruse infiltrated the KKK, we are treated to an engaging character-driven film and the memorable dialogue we expect from Mr. Lee's body of work.In the lead role, we get to see the talents of John David Washington (son of Oscar winner Denzel) who brings a wonderful grounded feel to Ron. He is a determined and committed cop who through non-violent means risks his life to undermine the world's most lethal racist group. Yes the move is foolish when we first learn of it with Ron's other colleagues, but Washington's charisma and drive make us cheer him along and hope he succeeds with his bizarre plan. The young actor also develops an excellent chemistry with his co-stars, Laura Harrier and Adam Driver (who both play crucial roles within the narrative), which drives the emotional weight of the operation and why it must not be derailed (although we have several close calls). Maybe we shall see an awards season nod for Washington's brave performance.The key competent to making Stallworth's plan function is that he must have a Caucasian coworker on the force pose as him in person (as he is posing as a white man on the phone). That person turns out to be Adam Driver's Phillip 'Flip' Zimmerman, a Jewish officer on the Colorado Springs PD (another group despised by the KKK). Initially hesitant to encourage or even participate due to the danger involved, Driver's Zimmerman nevertheless remains loyal to his fellow officer and takes on the role of being the fake Ron. The charisma we have seen from the 'Star Wars' actor in past roles is kept low-key in this joint as we must uncomfortably hear him utter racist epithets and carry this ruse onward though near the film's climax we fear for Flip as he is nearly unmasked as a fraud. Honorable mentions for Laura Harrier as the fiery Patrice, a fierce supporter of the Black Power movement and head of the African-American Student Union. The actress is spunky and sassy, but remains guarded and distrusting of the police (much like anti-police brutality groups of now) because of her race and treatment based on said factor. However Patrice is a strong role model for standing up for her beliefs and will protect her cause, but in non-violence like MLK Jr.'s teachings. And the other mention goes to a game-changing turn from Topher Grace as former Grand Dragon (the head of the KKK) David Duke. He is menacing in a subtle fashion without any overacting or having to utter much hate speech. His commanding of the KKK is calculating, using intimidation and fear and if needed violence (which he never see him order personally in the film). If you're looking for the right political drama, this is the one for you. Be warned that it isn't for the easily offended.",8,10,21,27 August 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Work of Genius
","I've always been a fan of Johnny Depp, but I never expected to hear him sing. This movie is a truly defining break in Johnny's career in taking on a musical role. This movie blew me away from the moment I started watching it at home after renting it from the library. Johnny's performance made me feel sympathy for what the character of Sweeney Todd had gone through. This is one of the most impressive musicals I have seen since I first saw 'West Side Story' two years prior to this film's release. If you are a fan of Stephen Sondheim then you should definitely check out this film. But I caution for viewers to wait till the age of 16 for this film contains bloody violence which might be offensive.",9,1,2,27 July 2012
Shutter Island," A Thrilling, Suspenseful and Mystifying Tale
","One probably wouldn't associate Martin Scorsese with a psychological thriller, but this film was deftly handled by the master director. The film's premise is relatively simple: two United States Marshals are summoned to a remote mental institution to find an escaped patient. However nothing is as it seems at Ashcliffe (the name of the hospital) once the Marshals begin their investigation and fear their sanity is fading away. There are many twists and turns as the film delves into the tortured psyche of anti-hero, Edward 'Teddy' Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio). The climax is truly dramatic and brings the film's action full circle, but I will not reveal the surprise.Leonardo DiCaprio aptly portrays the former alcoholic Teddy Daniels, a man whose dark past continuously haunts him throughout the film; particularly the tragic death of his wife (Michelle Williams) which is kept secret for the majority of the film's run-time until the end of the film. DiCaprio brings out the vulnerability needed for the part, but also has a strong reserve in his actions. DiCaprio's chemistry with co-star, Mark Ruffalo who plays Daniels's partner Chuck Aule, provides the profound revelations that drive the narrative forward. Both actors play off each other in the fashion of a cat and mouse game as their pasts remain obscure until Teddy eventually tells some secrets to Chuck that spell the former's downfall. The film's supporting cast of Michelle Williams as DiCaprio's wife, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley and Max von Sydow as the asylum head, all add mounting suspense as their motives. Williams in particular plays a deceased character and remains a haunting presence as she is the driving force behind DiCaprio's Teddy's fractured mind; telling him to avenge her death. Kingsley and von Sydow stay subtle in their roles as psychiatrists; their motives remaining murky until the final act of the film. If you have a taste for mind games, give this a viewing cause you'll want to see it again.",10,0,2,1 August 2012
Forrest Gump," Sweet, Tear-jerking and Memorable
","'Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you might get.' This rings so true from this story of perseverance, survival and love. 'Forrest Gump' is such a beloved classic drama from the 1990s starring Tom Hanks as the title character (he won the Best Actor Oscar that year for this film), a simple man from Alabama who experienced many life-changing events from the Vietnam War in which he served to the end of his beloved's life from an unknown virus (she is played by Robin Wright(she no longer has Penn attached these days)). This film touches the heart of any viewer as he or she watches how the world changes in the eyes of this simple country man with an IQ of 70. This is an ingenious story that will make you want to watch this over and over again.",8,2,3,30 July 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," It All Ends Here
","The final film in the original 'Bourne' trilogy packs the last punch that you've been waiting for since 'The Bourne Identity'. Jason Bourne will finally learn who he truly was before he became Bourne.Matt Damon, Joan Allen and Julia Stiles all return in fine form as Bourne, Pam Landy and Nicky Parsons respectively. Damon is subdued as well as he makes his way to Washington, D.C. to finally unlock the mystery of his identity. Displaying bad-ass fighting skills, brooding charisma and his endless quest for the truth it belongs to Damon's super spy. Joan Allen' Pam Landy is now a full-fledged good guy, still seeking to help Bourne learn his actual name and handle the rogue assassin in a peaceful manner. Her moxie is prominent as Pam has to contend with the new CIA director, Noah Vosen, and his quest to eliminate Jason Bourne once and for all; she refuses to stand aside and let Vosen kill the only known link to Treadstone (and now Blackbriar). Julia Stiles' Nicky is finally showcased as she joins the globetrotting Bourne on his quest and she proves herself a valuable ally and subsequently a threat to the hush-hush nature of Treadstone, Blackbriar and the CIA. Playing Noah Vosen is the commanding David Straithairn who brings a quick to action quality that is contrast to the methodical predecessors before him. Vosen's regime is more dedicated to the 'shoot first, ask questions later' motto as he and his team work speedily to eliminate anyone who could help Jason Bourne on his mission. This proves to be the downfall of Vosen by the film's end because of Jason Bourne's methodical prowess and Pam Landy's equally stealthy tactics; using her position of being a member of the CIA to get information that Bourne needs and passing it to him.A thrilling conclusion to the trilogy that begged the question 'Who is Jason Bourne?' and giving us the answer in this heart-pounding finale.",9,3,3,21 August 2016
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal's Career Best
","Lou Bloom will do anything to get a job, when he becomes a nightcrawler he'll do anything to get a story. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a career best performance as Lou, a sociopathic and anti- social former petty thief who develops a blood-lust for the gruesome stories caught on the news after he witnesses an accident and watches a nightcrawler (Bill Paxton in usual snarky fashion) film the event. His chemistry with news director, Nina (a brilliantly ruthless Rene Russo, wife of the film's director, Dan Gilroy) is one of twisted opportunistic convenience as Lou provides Nina with his grim footage and uses this to his compete advantage to manipulate Nina for his own gain. Directed and written by Dan Gilroy in his first solo feature (he had previously co-written 'The Bourne Legacy' with his brother, Tony Gilroy who was that film's director), he puts the viewer into the dark, dangerous underbelly of Los Angeles with Lou as he prowls the dimly lit streets of the City of Angels, in tow is his reluctant assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed). From the dimly lit streets that encircle L.A. to the darkness of the valley and hills to the darkened high estates.

Bohemian Rhapsody," A biopic that would make its front-man proud
","After the drama surrounding the departure of original lead Sacha Baron Cohen being replaced by Rami Malek to the 2017 holiday firing of original director Bryan Singer being replaced by Dexter Fletcher (however DGA rules allowed Singer credit), we all wondered if this film would ever make it to screens. However after all this on-set debacles, the remaining members of the production delivered a terrific final product.Chronicling the formation of Queen in 1970 to their dynamic and legendary 1985 Live Aid performance, there is no shortage of ups and downs within the narrative. There are quarrels between the band-mates and personal dilemmas for iconic front-man, Freddie Mercury, as he struggles to find his personal identity and run his band. While the film isn't entirely accurate with details of Mercury's strifes, the writers still treat the late musician with respect and care that made Freddie so beloved by his fans, friends and loved ones.Before getting to the performance of lead Rami Malek, credit must first go to the supporting players who are equally important to making the film's emotional core work. From Gwilym Lee as Queen guitarist Brian May (who produced the feature along with drummer Roger Taylor) who helped write the majority of Queen's biggest hits, Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor who resents when Freddie keeps showing up late or upset when his contributions get cut but ultimately cares about the men of the band, Joe Mazello as John Deacon who is the other reserved member of the group and then there's Lucy Boynton as Freddie's long-time friend and confidante Mary Austin. Boynton does harness the compassionate side of Mary as she copes with the initial hurt of Freddie's sexuality, but embraced him regardless which led to their long-lasting friendship. However Boynton's performance is still not quite up to accuracy par as she tends to be slightly over-dramatic and sometimes comes off as a jilted girlfriend rather than someone who figured out her friend's secret and chose not to be judgmental. Still a valuable role for the British actress and one to be proud of.Now to the man of the feature: Rami Malek as the legendary Freddie Mercury. From relative obscurity to landing the coveted role of Elliot Alderson on TV's 'Mr. Robot', Malek struck the jackpot with the role of Queen's legendary front-man after the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen. Immediately making an impression as we only see glimpses of the actor in costume until we go back to the night he met his future band-mates. Malek attaches to Mercury's shyness as he approaches Brian, Roger and John but his charisma ultimately shines through as he wins the attention of the three musicians. As the film goes on, the filmmakers begin to touch on the conflict of Freddie's sexual identity especially with the world's attitude towards homosexuality in the 1970s and 1980s. While not always accurate, the writers never pass judgment and allow Malek to subtly embrace the true nature of Freddie's private life. Thanks to the charisma of Malek, we still love Freddie even when he does cause tension with his band or his family. While the actor doesn't get to display his vocal chops often, Malek captures the stage presence and essence that made Queen's live concerts so beloved and legendary.The music is of course the crux of the feature. Viewers can't help but want to join in the singing (yours truly sure did) as Mercury's powerful vocals radiate through the screen. Even though he died in 1991, using the front-man's vocals helps make it seem that Freddie never left us. This also lends to massive feels as the performance sequences do such justice to the band's famous concerts and would've made Freddie Mercury proud.",9,2,4,7 November 2018
The Bourne Identity," An Exciting Action Film
","What if you had lost your memory and learned the CIA is out to terminate you because you know too much? That's the question Matt Damon's super-spy Jason Bourne wants to know and it could cost him his life. In the starring role, Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the charming and lethal secret agent on the hunt to find out who he is. Mastering different martial arts styles and weapons training in addition to several foreign languages, Damon is a force when he takes the screen as Bourne. The film's action is endless as Bourne is chased around Europe by assassins of the secret he is out to discover. From car chases in snowy Germany to hiding out in the lovely European countryside and ending finally in the City of Lights (Paris, France). The film's fight scene are just engrossing as Bourne gains the upper hand each time due to his special combat skills; he rarely uses a weapon unless it's needed to finish the job and incapacitate his opponent.The story-line is solid though it heavily deviates from author Robert Ludlum's novel. However the premise is intact as the film covers Jason Bourne's start on the path to find out who he is.",10,12,13,7 July 2016
The Revenant," Masterful, but Not for the Faint of Heart
","Academy Award winning director Alejandro Inarittu delivered a powerful new film with his vision on the tale of frontiersman, Hugh Glass, and his harrowing survival. The man who survived a savage mauling by a wild grizzly bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders, but managed to crawl to civilization and formulated revenge against two of his former comrades. In the pivotal role of Glass is a primarily mute Leonardo DiCaprio who finally took home his overdue Academy Award for Best Actor. The transformations that DiCaprio undergoes is fiercely harsh as the film spins its tale; going from a fur trapper into a man hellbent on avenging the wrongs done to him. The mauling scene is the most excruciating moment to watch as DiCaprio is being tossed around and torn apart (five hours of convincing makeup) like a rag doll. Those who doubt the power of the performance have either not seen the film or did and just weren't convinced based on their observations.Pulling an excellent sinister performance as fellow explorer Fitzgerald is Tom Hardy. He plays a man who is unconcerned of the well-being of others except his own survival. Though historically the whole expedition agrees to leave Glass to die, in the film the filmmakers place the blame for the decision on Hardy's Fitzgerald as to play up the drama. We do anxiously await for Fitzgerald to get what is coming to him, but we do find him a fascinating character thanks to Hardy's charisma.The filming locations make the viewer feel the isolation of the story's players. The incidents all took place in the wilds of South Dakota which was 'no man's land' back in the 1820s. Nothing but snow and ice surround the determined Hugh Glass as he travels to Fort Kiowa, braving the brutal winter temperatures. It's a terrifying thought to how lost one could get if you don't know the way.",9,0,1,17 July 2016
American Psycho," An Interesting Look into the Dark Side of Yuppie Culture
","Based on the controversial bestselling novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this terrifying film remains a constantly debated masterpiece of early 21st century cinema. A notable first for the film's success being directed by a woman and secondly for the intense and insane performance by Christian Bale as the titular psycho, it is sometimes difficult to remember why the film has a bit of a cult following.There is so much to say about the bravado performance of Christian Bale in the pivotal role of Patrick Bateman, an arrogant and unstable Wall Street broker, but also difficult to describe the insanity that ensues. While A- list star Leonardo DiCaprio was the first choice for the part, the actor passed on the dark subject matter and the previously fired (the filmmakers weren't convinced that the little known Christian was right for the part) Bale was called back to take over the role he had lost out on. Channeling charisma equivalent to acting superstar Tom Cruise (Bale and other crew members stated in interviews that he did model his look for Bateman on the A-list star) while masking a wicked secret, Bale keeps himself restrained as much as possible until the madness suddenly erupts like a volcano. Take for instance the infamous ax murder to the song 'Hip to Be Square' by Huey Lewis and the News, where Bale is as calm and friendly as can be until he unleashes his hatred for Jared Leto's Paul Allen in a gleefully maniacal rage and hacks the character to death. The madness only escalates as Bale's Bateman falls even further into insanity, but is he really a homicidal maniac or is he a delusional madman?The film boasts a stellar supporting cast of players who all play unique parts within the narrative. Aforementioned future Oscar winner Jared Leto is Paul Allen, a fellow broker and the first victim of Bateman's wickedness to harm his fellow man, Samantha Mathis as an ill-fated friend of Bateman's, Willem Dafoe as a FBI man who is looking into the fate of Leto's Paul Allen, Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's compassionate secretary who finds out what a monster Bateman might be and future Oscar winning actress Reese Witherspoon is Bateman's clueless and wealth-obsessed fiancé. Under the careful direction of Mary Harron, the film maintains an ambiguity that is needed for the narrative. We see everything through Patrick Bateman's eyes, which provides us with an unreliable narrator. Given that we do see his heinous crimes as he commits them, we are inclined to believe that Patrick has been telling us the truth, but when the film's ending hits we the audience are thrown for a loop. Was everything real, did the murders actually or was it the confessions of a mentally unstable lunatic? The question is left unanswered and lingering in our minds after the credits roll. The movie does eliminate some of the book's more horrific elements like the implication of cannibalism and some of the on-screen violence is also toned down, but still maintains terror and gruesome content without being too nauseating. There is also some disturbing scenes of sexual content mixed with violence which is deeply unsettling. This is not a film for the sensitive viewers. Don't watch if you have a weak stomach or dislike a black comedy horror picture.",7,0,0,7 February 2017
The Shining," Heeere's Johnny!!
","Jack Nicholson takes on horror in this adaption of Stephen King's 1977 novel 'The Shining' directed by Stanley Kubrick. Nicholson plays recovering alcoholic writer Jack Torrance who travels with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall,) and son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), to a Colorado hotel for the winter. While there strange events start occurring and terror soon erupts. The film is a typical Kubrick one with weird elements and a quirky cast. This one is not one of my favorite King films with the a pretty mediocre cast. Nicholson is chilling at times, but spends more time with booze. Duvall is a weak female lead and some call her whiny and the kid doesn't do much at all.",6,0,2,1 August 2012
American Beauty," Provocative, Powerful and Beautiful
","One of the most obscure dramas I have ever seen, but 'American Beauty' is a powerful film that puts our lives into perspective. This film tells the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, winner of the 1999 Best Actor Oscar) who feels that his life has been a sham for the last several years and resolves to turn his mediocre life around after developing an infatuation with his daughter (Thora Birch)'s best friend (Mena Suvari). The acting in the film is beyond compare to any other drama that runs on the same lines. Playing Carolyn Burnham, Spacey's cinematic wife, is Annette Benning, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, performing as a woman worn down by her failure to keep her business afloat with a family that is breaking apart at the seems.Spacey's performance, which garnered him his second Oscar, is a real tour de force; a powerful, slightly comedic and serious acting combination of unmatched talent. The film ended up bringing tears to my eyes by the climax where I could sense there was unease in the air, but did not expect the tragic ending that came. A pure thrilling drama, 'American Beauty' wills the viewer to 'look closer.'",7,0,1,10 September 2012
Edward Scissorhands," Deep, Sensitive, but Sweet Tale
","I could relate to Edward so closely except of the scissor hands of course, but we are both outsiders in a judgmental and hypocritical society. Tim Burton's film tells the tale of an elderly inventor (Vincent Price in his final role) who was set on creating the perfect man (Johnny Depp in his Burton film), but the Inventor soon died of a heart attack; leaving his creation with scissors for hands. Later, a local Avon saleswoman (Dianne Wiest)comes upon the isolated young man and takes him home to leave with her husband, son and daughter (Winonna Ryder). This film is one of Burton's most sensitive and beautiful story about a misunderstood man in a world that does not support differences. Depp's performance as the title character is one of powerful emotion, pure talent and genius. Any Burton fan would be lost if he or she has not seen this wonderful movie.",8,0,0,25 August 2012
Spider-Man," An Entertaining, Superb and Well Executed Superhero Movie
","Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies, but when Sam Raimi released his first 'Spider Man' outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and action-packed film about Marvel Comic's famous web-slinging superhero. We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him, but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an at-times contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. Stepping into the web-slinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming, Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit, Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emerald-clad nemesis, the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered, the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crime-fighting legend in harmonious tandem.On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego, Norman Osbourne, is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company, Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son, Harry, but also shows early signs of the soon-to-be shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona (the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a power-enhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania). Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect, Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible, utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin, without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous super-villain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts (the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements). A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest, Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Peter's best friend< Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy, Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben (who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well) and in a scene- stealing role as hot-headed and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spider-like abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and ass-kicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's web-slinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's ill-advised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones.A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze.",10,7,10,21 January 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Magnum Opus for its Director and Grand Fun
","When this Wes Anderson film debuted in 2014, I was only vaguely familiar with the eccentric filmmaker that is Wes Anderson and was curious at this new release. After the movie was available to rent, I immediately went to the library and got my rental. Not knowing what to expect I was braced to may be not like the movie (I had only seen 'The Royal Tennebaums' at the time), but was laughing myself silly within ten to twenty minutes of the run-time. Wes Anderson managed to blend elements of drama and comedy into the prefect recipe for fun in this delightful romp throughout the film.The film's premise is quite simple: an accomplished writer recounts his trip to the film's titular hotel back in his youth and is subsequently told the tale of how the hotel's current owner came to acquire the hotel. Interspersed with flashbacks we are thrown to a comedic and suspenseful narrative of wrongful accusations of murder, a stolen painting, prison escape, chases and a touching bond between opposite personalities.As expected, director Wes Anderson collects a vast array of colorful actors and actresses to portray the delightfully oddball players of his cinematic world. Outside of normal collaborators in minor roles, the film is bolstered by the dynamically offbeat performance of Ralph Fiennes as the bizarrely eccentric Monsieur Gustav H, the owner of the Grand Budapest in the 1932 flashbacks. Fiennes does bring his usual stoicism to the role, but in a hilarious twist piles on a dignified yet humorously profane comedic persona that is beyond enchanting. There's no shortage of quotable dialogue from M. Gustav as he delivers eloquent poetry, spouts scathing quips or has his off-putting bouts of inserting profanity into his monologues.Aiding Fiennes' wacky concierge is the naive yet eternally loyal Zero, played to near perfection by newcomer Tony Revolori. Revolori brings a youthful zazz to the character as Zero must quickly learn to adapt to his surroundings and the situations he is placed in, but there is even a world weariness to the young man as we later learn of his difficult past prior to arriving in Zubrowka Province at the start of WWII. The chemistry between Fiennes as Gustav and Revolori is so touching as the men become almost like a father and son by the story's end; 'We're brothers' as Zero states after helping Gustav escape prison and reminding the bewildered concierge why he (Zero) has remained a faithful employee and friend. Bonus to director Anderson for casting Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham as the elder Zero in the 1968 time-line; bringing the wisdom needed to tell the writer the story with gravitas.The film boasts a stellar supporting cast in players like Saoirse Ronan as pastry chef and Zero's loyal and brave girlfriend, Agatha, Tilda Swinton as elderly wealthy widow Madame D (sadly we get little time to see Swinton deliver the goods in her performance but she leaves her mark), Jeff Goldblum as ill-fated lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, Edward Norton as a Nazi-inspired officer who really isn't a horrible guy but only doing his job, and as the film's memorable baddies are Adrien Brody as Madame D's scheming son, Dmitri, and as his muscle is a mostly silent Willem Dafoe as the sinister, sadistic psychopathic Jopling. It's up to the latter two actors to be as villainous as needed without delving into caricatures which both actors do with finesse. Dafoe in particular delivers the chills as he looms in the shadows and menaces unsuspecting targets with little dialogue, somber glares and violent tactics to accomplish means to an end. This is used to perfect effect during the museum chase when Jeff Goldblum's Kovacs tries to elude Dafoe's Jopling; Anderson utilizes the isolation of each exhibit room, sound of footsteps and shadows to build the tension in the scene until the shocking outcome (hint: it doesn't end well for one of them).Director Wes Anderson decides to use a bright color palette for the setting of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' to bring out the whimsy and comedic tones. We are presented with light shades of purple, white snow and various light and bright shades of pink particularly the pink exterior of the film's titular building and then we see the reds, purples and golds of the interior to bring the world to life. There are few dark colors like grays, black and dark blue hues for the villains, the internment camp, the Nazi-style uniforms of the soldiers and the pre-dawn sky.A visual treat, excellent acting and a delightful story that will appeal to any Wes Anderson fan.",10,2,4,5 March 2017
Gone Girl," A Fincher Masterpiece
","David Fincher has outdone himself with his cinematic adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel. With a screenplay by the author herself, Fincher leads the viewer down a rabbit-hole of a marriage gone way south. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike portray Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy couple living in rural Missouri. However when Amy vanishes without a trace to her whereabouts, police and residents deduce that Nick has done away with Amy, but the truth is far stranger than elaborate fiction. Affleck is in top form as Nick, a man who had it all: a beautiful home, a bar run by his smart mouth sister (Carrie Coon) and the ultimate trophy wife, but when evidence points to him having possibly murdered Amy the viewer begins to despise him as his dirty little secrets begin to surface. As the manipulative and scheming Amy, Rosamund Pike gives a bravado performance that has netted her an Oscar nod for Best Actress. She is the seemingly perfect wife, but as her web unravels we learn there is more to Amy than a wealthy woman with a gorgeous facade. Under the direction of Fincher, the atmosphere is dark and brooding, full of foreboding as we step into the mess of Amy and Nick's five year marriage. With a sparse melancholy score, the mood stays dark and mysterious as Amy's demeanor. Flynn's screenplay is full of surprising twists and turns, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat.",10,11,21,17 February 2015
The Lion King," A decent remake, but won't surpass the 1994 original
","Jon Favreau has once again worked a technical marvel with this updated rendition of Disney's Oscar winning feature from the mid-90s. Although it's updated in the visuals, the story is still the same one that a majority of the audience has grown up with from childhood.The casting is fairly top-notch with the likes of award winning singer-actor Donald Glover as the older Simba (far more believable than Matthew Broderick in 1994), comedian John Oliver as eternal punching-bag Zazu (who is quite braver than his counterpart, but still hilarious with straighter humor than Rowan Atkinson's slapstick-like routine which makes the character Oliver's own), Florence Kasumba as a more sinister Shenzi who joys in terrorizing Nala, the beloved return of the magnificent James Earl Jones as Mufasa (and once again my childhood got to endure that trauma that makes me sob like a little kid) and JD McCrary and Shahidi Wright Joseph as young Simba and Nala respectively.However not all the casting fits quite as well, but this is not to say the actors are awful or are utterly poor in their performances. They just don't deliver quite as much as many of their costars. As the big bad, Chiwetel Ejofor's vocals sound more like an impression of Idris Elba as Shere Khan in 2016's 'The Jungle Book' which is a shame. The man is a great actor, but he mostly lacked the gravitas that was brought to the role by Jeremy Irons in 1994 (especially when he is opposite James Earl Jones). One major highlight is that Ejofor gets the menace of Scar correct and is quite vicious with his actions and is so self-serving he doesn't care what happens to others.In the role of comedic relief with the always hilarious Timon and Phumba, I feel we got a downgrade from the hilarity that was Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella who had an Abbott-Costello chemistry as the duo. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner feel more like two loud-mouthed buddies who try to replicate some of the beats from the original film. To Eichner's credit, he does capture Timon's arrogant attitude on-point more than Lane's smarmier meerkat and his 'Be Our Guest' parody is a gut-buster (though I miss that 'Luau!' hula, but this worked on so many levels). Rogen was the ideal choice for Phumba in concept, but he is clearly the smarter one as opposed to his original counterpart who is dimmer but is what made the humor work between Lane and Sabella; having two characters act alike isn't really that interesting a dynamic.As for the badass Nala, we really didn't need Beyoncé in the role. While yes she can sing (although plugging her own song in wasn't needed or asked for by most) her vocals lacked what Moira Kelly was able to balance with the same character. Moira Kelly was more stubborn and sharp-tongued (while singing was done by Sally Dworsky who was excellent for the Oscar winning 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?') compared to Beyoncé' who seems content to live the 'Hakuna Matata' life. Beyoncé's Nala gets huge credit for rallying the lionesses in the final battle and taking on Shenzi in a girl-on-girl fight that was a nice twist.The visuals are obviously one of the greatest parts of the film. Styled in the same photo-realism that won 'The Jungle Book' an Oscar for Visual Effects, this seems like an homage to how the Disney animators got inspiration for the original film's designs (the '90s team went to Africa and sketched the savannah and wildlife). However this technique takes away much of the expressive features that the original animation was able to imbue (like Andreas Deja incorporating Jeremy Irons' facial expressions and features into Scar). It's wonderful to see realistic animals though I suppose.One final note goes to the wonderful score by original composer Hans Zimmer who took home an Oscar for the original film and the songs by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice (who also took home an Oscar for Best Song). From that opening chant by Lebo M and the chorus to the glorious triumphant 'King of Pride Rock' at the climax, I felt the tears welling in my eyes and wept; bringing those happy childhood memories back and fresh. Even Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen singing 'Hakuna Matata' was a blast (their singing was on par) and having Donald Glover just own the end of the song elevated it to coolness. Sadly the song that fell the shortest was 'Be Prepared' which is basically the greatest villain song ever written of the Mouse House canon. Chiwetel Ejofor doesn't sell it like Jeremy Irons' throaty and foppish sly slickness. It's more like a talk-sing monologue that takes less than a minute which is no way to treat the darkest song of the film. The child actors during 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' really brought the bounciness and youthfulness required with John Oliver adding a straight-man spice.",6,1,6,19 July 2019
Call Me by Your Name," 'And I'll Call You by Mine'
","Not since the Oscar winning 'Brokeback Mountain' have I seen such a beautifully acted, written and directed LGBTQ+ drama. Perhaps this all lies within the wonderful source material from author Andre Acimen with its screenplay adapted by James Ivory (who scored an Oscar for his work) and the top quality direction of Luca Guadagnino (himself a member of the LGBTQ community, lending authenticity and understanding).The film's true beauty really lies within the performances of its leading men: Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Chalamet, who was only 20 at the time of shooting, makes a remarkable semi-debut in his role as Elio, the youth trying to understand his sexual identity in 1987 Italy. The young actor brings such a beautiful naivety and youthful confusion that echoes the prose of Acimen's novel, in addition to Chalamet's actual age and visage. Occasionally voicing his thoughts aloud as in the novel, we get into Elio's head and can feel his confusion and attempts to come to terms with who he is. From the opening scene where Elio's displeasure for Oliver is shown to the heartbreaking closing shot of a shaking, teary-eyed Elio in front of the fire, Chalamet more than proved he is a star to watch out for and we want to see the proposed follow-up. Coming in as an opposite personality to the repressed Elio is the smiling, socially flamboyant Oliver, wonderfully portrayed by Armie Hammer. Having portrayed plenty of characters comfortable in their own skin, Hammer brings out Oliver's charming personality that wins over Chalamet's Elio by being subtle and coy. From his dismissive-like 'Later!' to that sensual and heart-melting 'call me by your name and I'll call you by mine' and eventually that saddening phone call at the climax, we fall in love with Hammer's Oliver as much as Elio does.Thanks to instructions from the director, the actors spent time together to develop their bond as on-screen friends/lovers. This direction paid off as the chemistry leaps off the screen and makes you long for Oliver and Elio to stay together for the entire film. The banter, often spouted by Hammer with genuine and cute reactions from Chalamet, will put a smile on your face and make you laugh and sometimes cry. A notable shout-out to Michael Stuhlbarg in the role of Elio's professor father. The actor deftly handles the discussion scene between father and son with nuance and genuine care and concern.",9,11,20,15 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What a film for this space opera saga!
","Currently being hailed by critics as the best 'Star Wars' film since 1980's 'The Empire Strikes Back', Rian Johnson's latest film really brings the goods for the midpoint of the 'Star Wars' saga.Following Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, General Organa, Kylo Ren after the events of Episode 7, the viewer watches as the battle royale comes ever closer to fruition. While Finn and Poe try to help Leia with the Resistance as they take on the First Order, Rey has found the exiled Luke Skywalker to convince him to help his twin and fellow fighters but easier said than done as Luke has become so disillusioned with the Rebellion. Events get even stranger when Rey begins to bond telepathically with Kylo Ren, could the new heroine turn to the Dark Side or will she succeed?The cast of characters become even more fleshed out with their goals and purposes being realized within the oncoming battle. More depth is given to why Kylo Ren is determined to destroy his former Jedi master and turn Rey's allegiances providing the film's most gripping plot point. The cast shows massive growth in their talents to shed light on the players of the fight between good and evil; Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley being tremendous standouts as we wait to see if Driver's Kylo can win Ridley's Rey over to evil. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac continue to shine as well in the roles of Finn and Poe, constantly building up their friendship from 'The Force Awakens' while allowing Kelly Tran's Rose to become part of their comradeship. The late Carrie Fisher returns one last time to play General Leia Organa, but she is used sparingly as Poe and Finn take more command of the Resistance's army. However the influence of the Princess/General remains strong even with her limited screen-time. And making his long-awaited return to the franchise he helped start is Mark Hamill as the legendary Luke Skywalker. Gone is the fresh-faced heroic boy of the original trilogy as Luke's traumatic experience with his nephew has shaped much of Luke's lack of faith in the fight against the First Order. Rey tries her best to gain the Jedi Master's trust, to no avail for a time but when her power astounds Luke he is forced to take on a new apprentice. Yet his distrust of everything in the past once again clouds Luke's sense of duty, forcing Rey to abandon him and go back. However in the end, the heroic Jedi we once knew does come back for a climatic showdown for the ages.Utilizing the series' staple of visual effects and epic battles, the action unfolds the minute the title crawl is over as we watch the Rebels try to take down the First Order's commanding ships. With bombing explosions that are far more exciting than Michael Bay's, fighter on fighter ships taking on each, cannons, lightsaber combat galore and more there is no shortage of excitement.",9,1,13,14 December 2017
Prisoners," How Far Would You Go?
","Never has a film of this caliber shaken me and begged me to ask the question, 'if my child was taken, how far am I willing to go?' In Denis Villeneuve's gripping and powerful drama about the abduction of two little girls and the extreme measures one father takes to find his daughter, the film rings in emotions of panic, fear, sadness, horror and shock all wrapped into two and a half hours of tension. Twists and turns drive the action of the story to its dramatic and shocking conclusion.The casting of the film is beyond brilliant. Hugh Jackman delivers a shocking and powerful performance as Keller Dover, father to one of the missing girls, who is unwilling to sit idly by and wait for the police to find the children. He takes the law swiftly into his own hands by horrifically tortures the young man (Paul Dano) he believes has taken the children; the torture scenes led me to turn away at numerous points of the film. Watching Jackman's performance hits a chord deep inside himself as a parent in real life in addition to the fictional portrayal of the desperate father who will kill to have his daughter back. Even as a viewer, his talent in the role and the intensity it requires tugged at my heartstrings through the painful moments of the impact of the kidnapping to the horror of his actions against Alex Jones (Paul Dano), the tension the events cause in his marriage to his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and seeing him push away anyone who tries to help him (Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), Franklin and Nancy Birch, parents of the other kidnapped child (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis)). An Oscar-worthy performance here.Playing opposite Jackman in the desperate search is Detective Loki, superbly played by Jake Gyllenhaal, an officer who has never left a case unsolved. But when he delves into the abduction of these two children, Loki is more than prepared to do everything in his power as a law enforcement officer to bring them home. The conflict between Jackman and Gyllenhaal pulls the viewer back and forth as time grows shorter and the search more desperate, providing insight into the difference between the by-the-book Detective Loki and loose cannon Keller Dover. Only when the final hours are ticking away do we see Gyllenhaal finally crack and break his own rules in order to cement his reputation of efficiency. If you dare to answer the above question of 'how far would I go to get my child back?' PRISONERS will still make you question your own motives.",10,2,7,21 September 2013
Logan," Brutally Triumphant Send-off to a Beloved Mutant Hero
","At long last the Wolverine film we have awaited was delivered to us this spring with James Mangold's second time as director for 'Logan'. The film delivers as much violence as it can muster in this action packed drama while giving us an honest glimpse into a much more aged Logan than we have seen in the past.In 2029 most mutants have gone extinct and those who remain are in hiding from the human population. This is where we find Logan, now a chauffeur driver, retired from his glory days as a hero and with a chronic addiction to alcohol. He is also caring for a suffering Professor X when a runaway mutant girl named Laura enters the aging heroes' lives, commanding their protection despite Logan's bitterness and resentment in the dying world around him.Hugh Jackman returns in one of his most dynamic performances to date as the mutant hero he has portrayed for seventeen years. Whereas in days past we have become accustomed to the robust and powerful Wolverine, in this futuristic film we are presented with a world-weary and embittered Logan, a man who has given up and is resigned to his impending fate. When little Laura enters Logan's life, at first the grizzled mutant is resentful of the young girl and refuses to do much for her as Professor X bonds with Laura. However as the film goes on, Logan begins to see how alike he and the young child are and he begins to risk his own life for her. Jackman brings his usual bravado to the role as it is now the final time the Australian thespian is to play the famed clawed hero and his costar chemistry is undeniable from his father-son style relationship with Patrick Stewart as Xavier and at first a hesitant and resentful to a father-like protector to newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura.Also appearing for the final time in his acclaimed role as Charles Xavier is the legendary Patrick Stewart. The English thespian is given a chance to shine alongside Jackman's Logan as the shell of his former self compared to earlier X-Men films. This Charles Xavier has become a delirious and frightened shell of the former teacher of mutant students, but there are still glimpses of his trademark wisdom midst the unhappy exterior. Xavier is the one who immediately takes the terrified and mute Laura under his wing while Logan continues to act disgruntled and resentful of the powerful little girl. However when Charles can no longer continue with the duo on their journey to take Laura to her companions, it is Logan's task to protect the little girl from harm while remembering his former teacher's wisdom.A shout-out to little Dafne Keen in her feature debut as young Laura. The young actress is mute for the majority of the film's run-time, emitting only grunts and mutters. When the child does eventually speak, she speaks in an accent that is easily understood though her dialogue is a bit stilted in delivery but this is forgivable as Keen is a first-timer in the acting game.'Logan' finally does amp up the violence that had been missing in the past. There is no shortage of gory moments and brutal battle scenes that might make the squeamish viewers a little nauseous, but for the action lovers there won't be an issue. The run-time could have been shortened by twenty minutes or so. The story is taut and pretty well executed with tense moments galore while it does drag from time to time.For all you 'X-Men' fans, go and see this last Wolverine outing because you are gonna see something special in its own right.",8,2,6,22 March 2017
Pride & Prejudice," Pure Austen
","I have read the original novel before and seen the 1940 version starring Sir Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, but this adaption is simply fabulous. Keira Knightly as the free-spirited and independent Elizabeth Bennett is a real treat to see (especially for men). Elizabeth embodies the kind of woman what many girls long to be like in the Victorian era; free to choose her future and go wherever the wind takes her. Miss Knightly's co-star is a grand foil to her independent character. He is the typical gentleman of the time; a man who is uninterested in free-thinking young women and disdains all of society, but seems to mask a need for affection/love. A British literature fan will fall in love with this story and feel free upon the finale of this film.",8,0,5,30 July 2012
The Fly," A Remake Done Right
","David Cronenberg is the master of body horror for a reason and mainly it's because of this terrifying remake of the 1958 science-fiction film of the same name. Bolstered by a memorable performance by an exceptional Jeff Goldblum as ill- fated scientist Seth Brundle. Goldblum brings out Brundle's ego perfectly as he boasts of his intention to create his transportation device. Even his descent into paranoia and madness is captured perfectly after the accident starts to infuse him into the 'Brundle-fly'. We loathe his arrogance and selfishness as Brundle isolates his former lover and other friends out of life, but we sympathize with the horrible descent Brundle undergoes throughout the film. Playing the yin to Goldblum's yang is a well cast Geena Davis as Veronica Quaife. Davis brings a innocence and naivety to the reporter who loves the troubled scientist. However Veronica is no slouch and asserts herself when Brundle's possessiveness of her begins to suffocate her social life and work. She remains sympathetic the whole run-time and is the film's reluctant hero at the tragic climax of the narrative. This is one strong woman even if she has to do the unthinkable. The film amps up the gore effects to marvelous fashion. Turning its lead actor into a shell of a man and eventually into a horrifying fly monster that rivals the original actual fly transformation. Dr. Brundle's transformation into a monster demonstrates his alienation from the rest of humanity even before he becomes the Brundle-fly. There's little to wonder about why the makeup team won the Oscar for Best Makeup.",8,1,2,2 September 2016
From Hell," A Ripper Theorist's Dream
","'From Hell' is one of the strangest films I have ever seen in this present age. Some blood and gore is absent during the film's violent murder scenes as seen through the visions of Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline. Johnny's performance is quite interesting with him playing an opium- addicted London detective on the case of the infamous Jack the Ripper. Heather Graham as Mary Kelly (a real-life Ripper victim)is a fine foil to Depp's addled Abberline, but the chemistry that develops could take a hike; it's a tacky angle to turn the two character's motives on their heads. The film lacks some real mystery to the Ripper's identity by the finale of the picture since the directors eventually give away who is involved in the case. Nonetheless, this film is a decent horror film with some interesting portrayals of the victims of the Ripper's infamous rampage.",6,1,1,30 July 2012
Les Misérables," Magical, Heart-breaking and Powerful
","Do you hear the people sing? I certainly did in this fantastic theatrical adaption of the beloved musical, Les Miserables. The story of an ex-convict (Hugh Jackman in a powerful performance) trying to escape his past by breaking parole, but with an obsessed lawman (Russell Crowe, menacing, but excellent performance)on his trail to capture him. To round out the spectacular cast is the performance of Anne Hathaway as the unfortunate Fantaine, who dreamed of a better life but was stolen from her. The rest of the cast includes Amanda Seyfried as Fantaine's daughter, Cosette who is raised by Jackman after her mother's death, Eddie Redmayne as young student Marius who falls in love with Cosette and new-comer Samantha Barks as the faithful, loyal Eponine. The singing is beyond compare of any musical film of the decade. Hathaway's tearful rendition of the famous 'I Dreamed a Dream' is so heart-breaking as we watch her descend into her private hell. Barks's performance of the sorrowful ballad 'On My Own' rivals any past performance as she walks down the rainy streets of Paris on the eve of the student revolution. The greatest addition to this list of classic is the recently Oscar-nominated 'Suddenly' written for Hugh Jackman by the musical's original composer. Jackman's beautiful tenor voice sings this song to the young Cosette (Isabelle Allen as a child) as he takes her away to safety, promising he will always protect her. If you have not yet seen this masterpiece, then to arms and go forth.",7,3,5,17 January 2013
Titanic," Breathtaking, Classic, Unforgettable
","James Cameron's timeless tale of forbidden love and the tragic sinking of the colossal Titanic is a beloved classic in its own right. The story this movie tells always tugs at my heart each time I see it. The emphasis of the terrible fate of the Titanic is heightened by the tragic love story that backs up the short time-line of the glorious ship as it heads towards its fate. The cast is fabulous, magnificent and really breathes life into their characters to make them realistic. Leonardo DiCaprio as the care- free, young and handsome Jack Dawson is the embodiment of who we all wish to be like in life whereas Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater embodies where we lie in life if we don't attempt to break free and try and live a new life or experience a different world. The beauty of how real the film is adds to the majesty of the film's grandeur to the details of the ship the crew built and the characters that died or survived the disaster inhabit the structure. Anyone who loves an epic should check out this fantastic tale of love, tragedy and survival.",8,3,5,30 July 2012
Psycho," Best Horror Film Ever!!!
","I remember sitting down to watch 'Psycho' on Turner Classic Movies about four years ago when my mom recommended I watch it. Sitting and enjoying my lunch I watched the action unfold in this compelling and terrifying tale directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock. I fell in love with the film at first sight and have been a devout Hitchcock fan ever. The film is a masterpiece complete with suspense, terror and a fantastic tale of a lonely young man living in the big creepy house behind the motel. The cast is phenomenal and all-star with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the lonely young man (he is quite cute), Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, a woman who stole $40,000 from a rich client, Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's sister and John Gavin as Sam Loomis, Marion's lover. Any horror fan should see this film or they cannot be deemed real horror genre fans.",10,0,0,29 July 2012
Joker," Shocking, downbeat and shockingly profound
","The cinematic event of the fall season finally arrived and boy were our collective minds blown! Who would have thought that a dark comic feature from the director of the 'Hangover' trilogy could be as popular as it currently is? Well friends, Todd Philips delivered a solid origin story for Batman's greatest nemesis and separated it from the DCEU fare with its own little universe.I won't delve too much into the plot as it would spoil this masterpiece of dark cinema. The basic concept follows a down-on-his-luck man who after a series of unfortunate circumstances finally snaps and the outcome is horrifying to watch unfold.After such performances by Caesare Romero, Jack Nicholson, the deliciously insane vocals of Mark Hamill and the post-humous Oscar winning performance of Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' we were all wondering what acclaimed actor Joaquin Phoenix would bring to the iconic Joker. There was some doubt over how he would top the late Heath Ledger, but if you ask me: we got the most human portrayal of this iconic villain yet. Arthur Fleck is a tormented sign-twirling salesman who is eking out a meager existence to provide for himself and his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), but when he finally has become fed up his mind cracks. His journey is a slow descent into madness that is actually heartbreaking to watch as he is a man who really has no support network to rely on and is relentlessly made the butt of the joke by his peers, Known for his intensity, Joaquin Phoenix deftly approached the character as a man who longs for a connection to the world around him and to be accepted as the person he is, but the cruel real world practically spits on him and laughs at his attempts. Phoenix broods and oozes an inner ticking time bomb that when it explodes he goes full throttle without becoming a cartoon caricature, but 'that's it! I won't take this anymore and here's what you get for how you treated me!' I condone Arthur's actions as they are violent and should not ever be replicated in reality, but in a bizarre way we do sympathize with him since we are always in his troubled perspective.The standout supporting cast include Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's ailing mother who holds some dark secrets that help lead to Arthur's downfall to insanity, and the great Robert De Niro as condescending TV show host Murray Franklin. First, Frances Conroy is so understated as Penny but she is a terrific foil to the more clearly unstable Joaquin Phoenix. She is caring towards him, but she has a Mrs. Bates quality to her as she relies on Arthur as her caregiver and little boy. Watching her and Phoenix's scenes is both strangely touching, but also unsettling as it is slowly unraveling as the catalyst for the film's climatic reveals about her true self. Now to Robert De Niro, where has this kind of talent been with him these past few years?! After sub-par junk like 'Dirty Grandpa', we get a return of the De Niro from his earlier career especially the 1980s. The character of Murray Franklin and his interaction with Arthur Fleck near the close of the film echoes the largely forgotten 'The King of Comedy' which had a direct influence on this film's story. While in the Scorsese film, De Niro was the struggling comedian and the late Jerry Lewis was the snide TV host, here the roles are switched as De Niro gets to be Jerry Lewis while Joaquin Phoenix plays the struggling artist in question. The film plays with the wholesome image of De Niro throughout the majority of the film since we, like Arthur, only see Murray on TV until the third act of the film where our troubled anti-hero meets his idol. When we see the moment that helps Arthur's mind snap, we become angry at how the audience and Murray treat Arthur like a sideshow and only invite him on as a joke. The dialogue between the veteran actor and Phoenix is revealing as we watch Arthur take down Murray and the public's perception of him while De Niro attempts to hold his disturbed guest in check. However we still see his true colors as he tries vainly to humiliate Arthur on national television, but at this point in time it is futile as the persona Arthur has since adopted could care less than Arthur's more human side did. De Niro may have to let the spotlight be on Phoenix, but he never wastes a line as he verbally spars with the harsh-tongued lunatic opposite him.Todd Philips and co-writer Joel Silver deftly tackled this origin story by not just adapting one of the numerous tales that the Clown Prince of Crime has told over the decades in comics and films. Here we get almost an amalgamation of different inspirations such as the infamous 'The Killing Joke' where one bad day can push certain men and women to insanity and the aforementioned Martin Scorsese drama-comedy 'The King of Comedy' mixed with a few elements from 'Taxi Driver'. Given that Scorsese was once in talks for the project, it makes sense that his influence would be felt. This is one of the greatest strengths of the narrative as the ambiance feels like being in an early Scorsese film with the coloring to the haunting musical score and particularly Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. The character is similar to how Robert De Niro behaves in 'Taxi Driver' especially in the behavior towards his peers like Zazie Beets who is practically a stand-in for Cybil Shepard in the latter film. Though in Arthur's case, his interaction with Zazie Beets' character doesn't really copy what happens with De Niro and Shepard in 'Taxi Driver' since we find out the real truth near the climax of 'Joker'.There is shocking moments of violence in the film, but I doubt we will have a repeat of what happened in Aurora, Colorado. However, I strongly encourage anyone who sees this film to remember this is a fictional film, but there are people who suffer from mental illness like Arthur Fleck and have done awful acts like him in the real world. Please DO NOT replicate this violence and cost innocent families and individuals their lives. If you are suffering from mental illness, remember there is help and it can provide some comfort.I want all to be well and be safe.",10,2,6,22 October 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Innovative, Slight Humor and Enjoyable
","This movie garnered Jack Nicholson's first Oscar win and is one of his greatest role in his cinematic career. Nicholson's performance as the rebellious Randle Patrick/R.P. MacMurphy is one made up of comedic and dramatic elements. The film is a thrilling drama about mental patients under the iron fist of the cold-hearted, stoic Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher who garnered the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year as well). This film also marked a high point for a young Michael Douglas as a producer in the early days of his film career as well as the feature film debut of Brad Douriff as Billy Bibbit, a young stuttering, suicidal patient (Douriff later appeared in 1980's 'Child's Play' opposite Chris Sarandon and also played Sheriff Brackett in 2007's 'Halloween'). 'Cuckoo's Nest' is a fun film loaded with drama mixed with comedy and tragedy. Nicholson's performance will amuse the viewer as well as possibly irritate at points with his antics, but he is a joy to watch in this movie. An Oscar winner and much worth a viewing.",10,0,1,31 July 2012
Whiplash," J.K. Simmons' finest hour
","How far would you push yourself in order to be the best at something? Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is willing to isolate himself from his loved ones and the rest of the world in order to be the finest drummer at Shafer Conservatory of Music. When he is hand-picked by the highly respected Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), Andrew has no idea how far Fletcher is willing to push him to get the results he wants. Teller as Andrew is an insecure, awkward college determined to do his best. He is inept at talking to the cute girl who runs the movie theater concession stand till he begins to gain confidence after joining Shafer's jazz orchestra. His drive to be the best drummer since Buddy Rich causes him to become an increasingly isolated individual who cuts off all who love him to meet Fletcher' demands and attempt to gain his approval. However there is no real character development by the writer-director or Teller as an actor, Teller stays primarily stagnant until the final ten to fifteen minutes of the film where Andrew has his grandiose drum solo.The cream of the film truly belongs to J.K. Simmons's unbalanced, cruel and profane Fletcher. Simmons is usually the more fatherly or counselor-type in most of his film and TV appearances, but that is appropriately missing from this film. Cussing out at anyone he pleases and working his students to exhaustion, Fletcher is never placated with what Andrew or anyone else gives him. Garnering his first Oscar nomination, Simmons will bring home the gold for certain. The music is primarily jazz which is appropriate for the band, practice and café scenes of the film, but is unnecessary for the rest of the film. Cinematography spends most of its time up above the cast members except for more intimate dialogue. The script is pretty solid, but could've done without the girlfriend for Teller's character as she has only ten minutes of screen-time.",8,1,4,17 February 2015
Scream 2," Adequate Sequel
","I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.",7,2,2,26 July 2012
It Chapter Two," A decent conclusion, but lacking the magic of the first half
","After two years of waiting we finally got the concluding chapter of Andy Muschietti's remake of the Stephen King novel 'IT'. While mostly executed well like its first half, the magic wasn't quite captured for the ending of our beloved Loser's Club and their defeat of the titular entity. I shall try to avoid major spoilers for those who wish to read the novel or watch the movie.Brief summary of the plot (easy to get from the trailers): 27 years after defeating the entity known as IT, the adult Losers must return to Derry when IT comes back seeking new victims and revenge on the adults Losers.For our adult cast, Muschietti assembled a top-notch cast including James McAvoy as Bill Denborough, Jessica Chastain as Beverly Marsh, Bill Hader as Richie Tozer, Jay Ryan as Ben Hanscom, Isaiah Mustafa as Mike Hanlon, and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. Bill Hader is easily the standout as Richie, the foul-mouthed comedian of the batch which is perfect for the Saturday Night Live alumni. Hader is able to balance the dark humor with his dramatic chops that he acquired from 'The Skeleton Twins' and his Emmy winning role on HBO's 'Barry' and his facial gymnastics are silly, but purposeful. His comedic chemistry with James Ransone is touching and funny at the same time especially when the climax arrives and you feel for Richie.Returning as our scary clown is the ever creepy Bill Skarsgard in a much more toned-down (for the most part) Pennywise. While more cartoonishly creepy like his predecessor, Tim Curry, in the first chapter (which annoyed me a bit), Skarsgard is able to be in his element in the second part. The actor goes much more manipulative in this movie to get his victims (particularly in one sequence under some bleachers) which is a welcome change to spouting some of Tim Curry's original dialogue. The only downside is the climax for the Swedish actor, but it's more the fault of the visual effects team and writing. However it doesn't quite diminish the step-up for the performance.While the first chapter employed practical effects with some CGI, the team unfortunately went overboard with the CGI here. Thankfully Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise and the excellent Javier Botet get the majority of the practical work (considering Botet is the alternate Doug Jones for creepy monsters like Mama). I was laughing at the CGI particularly for one of Pennywise's young victims as the CGI jaw is so in your face and blatant which isn't the only ridiculous moment as you will see in the climactic showdown.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman returns to pen the script after his first directorial debut earlier in the summer with the third 'Annabelle' movie. However you can tell that his writing isn't as strong as the first film specifically with the so-so chemistry between the adult Losers. As pointed out earlier, the strongest bond of the group is Richie and Eddie while the triangle between Beverly, Bill and Ben is ignored a little more than the novel and rushed through. Having a longer runtime (almost 3 hours long) also packed in too much material that could've been trimmed out of the script (not really blaming Dauberman for that as that is more on Muschietti and the editor). Don't let this detract you though and try to enjoy the remaining time with our characters.Do give this film a chance particularly if you enjoyed the first movie and the novel, but lower your expectations to a reasonable level. It's always a challenge to follow a successful first half, but it's not a terrible film just not great.",7,1,2,20 September 2019
Jaws," Shark Attack
","Preparing for a day at the beach? Well don't go in the water. 'Jaws' the ultimate shark film has been the most frightening film since its 1975 release to audiences. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint on the hunt for a killer great white who killed and devoured a young woman and little boy. The film is suspenseful with a spooky score by John Williams to match (if you hear the music get out of the water). Many viewers are so frightened by the film that they develop the misconception that all sharks are killers and will eat them. That is true in only 100 cases where great whites do kill humans (this is actual scientific data), but this is not entirely true. There's no need to fear sharks all the time. Anyway, Steven Spielberg shows off a spectacular film that will make you fearful of going into the water.",9,1,4,3 August 2012
Dark Shadows," Hilariously Entertaining
","If anyone can take the original 1960s-1970s Gothic soap opera and turn it into a comical parody, it can only be Tim Burton. This film and its original series tells the story of aristocratic playboy Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp in the film, the late Jonathan Frid in the original series) who was cursed to be a vampire by his jealous former lover, Angelique who is a witch (Eva Green in the film, Lara Parker in the series). After being buried alive for 200 years, he is awakened by construction workers and he heads back to his former home Collinwood. Upon arrival he meets his dysfunctional descendants; Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), Elizabeth's brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his son David. Also there are David and Carolyn's governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcoate)and Elizabeth's psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham-Carter). This film is a mixture of dark humor and an interesting characters. Depp as Barnabas is a mix of his odd humor, comedy and cheesy vampire appearance, but he generates plenty of laughs throughout. Michelle is a welcome matronly figure with a dark secret that she has to hide from everyone in Collinsport. Heathcoate as the troubled governess is a welcome among the mix of odd characters, but she is not what she appears to be on the exterior. If you appreciate a good laugh then see 'Dark Shadows.'",2,2,5,2 August 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Finally an Original Kong Movie
","After all the remakes of the 1933 film, someone finally came along and made an original film about the king of giant apes. This Kong is even larger than before, but still intimidating and fierce as ever. He wants to defend his home and survive as the final survivor of his species.As usual with government agencies in action films with giant monsters, they want to take a new species captive and study the specimen. Send out the ragtag group of explorers who are dispatched to track down the giant ape who knocks down their helicopter and traps the survivors of the crash on the titular island. Now it's up to the group of survivors to brave the elements of Skull Island and elude the massive Kong.Leading the ragtag bunch are Samuel L. Jackson as military lieutenant Packard and Tom Hiddleston as tracking expert, James Conrad. Hiddleston portrays a disillusioned former military expert in his field who is willing to take on the job of finding Kong in order to make money. However as the film goes on, Conrad soon realizes what Kong's capture or demise will mean and switches sides to help keep the gargantuan ape safe from Packard's dark plots. In the role of Packard, Sam Jackson is the film's weaker link as he is more of a caricature of himself but wearing military camos. None of the actor's lines really stick out except for uttering a former line of his from another film classic that Jackson was involved in.The supporting cast is impeccable from Brie Larson as level-headed antiwar photographer Mason Weaver who butts heads with Hiddleston's Conrad, '24: Legacy''s Corey Hawkins as nerdy consultant Houston Brooks, Jing Tian (from 'The Great Wall') as a scientist in the search party (sadly she isn't fleshed out much), John Goodman as Randall, the government man who got the group to the island and as the film's comic relief is John C. Reilly as a stranded WWII pilot who warns the group of what their actions might cause.The film's visuals are quite astounding particularly with the massive height of the titular ape. After having only a 25 foot tall Kong in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 'King Kong', Universal decided to go with an impressive height of 100 feet for this Kong. Actor Tobey Kebbel (who also has a role on-camera as a solider eventually killed by the giant ape)brings the giant ape to life via motion-capture and does an impressive feat. Lots of explosions are imminent throughout the film as helicopters are swatted away and blow up and explosives are set off. Still better handled than most Michael Bay action sequences of late.Go see this film if you want an original Kong film and try to hit the IMAX if you can (I didn't go for IMAX to save time).",8,1,4,22 March 2017
The Lion King," A Disney Masterpiece from its '90s peak
","While compared at times to 'Bambi' due to the similarities in its central story, 'The Lion King' is so much more than a modern retelling of Disney's 1942 film. Ushering in the full blown revamped Disney brand, this Academy Award winning film is also one of the most mature from Disney's high point period. Focusing on the life of young lion cub and future king, Simba, we follow the naive cub as his life is uprooted in a terrible tragedy and forces him to run away, but years later return and fight for his rightful place.Disney assembles one of their greatest voice casts to portray the vast arrays of characters from the African savanna. James Earl Jones brings his distinctly deep voice to the wise king of Pride Rock, Mufasa, while English thespian Jeremy Irons voices his wicked brother, Scar, the film's central villain and most foppish bad guy in the Disney cannon. Child star Johnathan Taylor Thomas voices the young Simba to youthful perfection while Matthew Broderick voices the adult Simba (as I've grown up, Broderick's vocal performance is mismatched for Simba's adulthood when Simba finally grows up and takes responsibility for his past). Comedic talents Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin voice two of Scar's hyena lackeys, Shenzi and Banzai, with a mostly maniacal laughing performance from veteran voice actor, Jim Cummings, as third hyena lackey, Ed. And stealing the film's comedic spotlight are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon, the meerkat, and Phumba, the warthog. The duo are the characters who taught us all that 'Hakuna Matata' means 'no worries' and made us laugh with their constant bickering and hilarious exchanges and actions.Following in Disney's tradition for using live reference models, the animation team traveled to Kenya to sketch the landscape of the savanna. The company also had live animals from lions, meerkats, warthogs and various birds brought into the studio by zookeepers in addition to seeing the wildlife in action in their native habitat. Complimenting the amazing visuals is the Oscar winning score by Hans Zimmer and Oscar winning songwriting team of Elton John and Tim Rice. Zimmer's instrumental score paints the dramatic picture in musical tones, but does express joy at the film's happiest moments, while Sir Elton and Tim Rice add the dramatic and comedic lyrics to compliment Zimmer's lush orchestral score.",10,1,1,13 February 2017
Inception," Another Triumph
","Christopher Nolan has done it again! Another terrific mind-bending film! 'Inception' is a thrill ride with moments of reality v. dreams, question of motives and the very concept of how dreams work. The cast is superb in bringing their characters to life and showing us a diverse group of personalities and their motivations. The action sequences are tremendous in bringing out the 'reality' of the dreamworlds the characters enter and emphasize the danger that comes with what they are doing. Dreams/sleep has always fascinated mankind for centuries, but we have never been able to understand this phenomena. But here's a film that attempts to explain what dreams are and how they are created.",9,1,4,26 July 2012
Murder on the Orient Express," A Decent Remake of a Classic Mystery
","Before everyone gets annoyed about this film being an unnecessary remake, consider how long it has been since the acclaimed Sidney Lumet feature film. The modern master of Shakespearean films, Kenneth Branagh, decides to step behind the camera and also don the famous mustache (though more unconventional) of Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, in this slightly updated take on the classic whodunit thriller.A brief overview of the plot: Detective Hercules Poirot boards the famous Orient Express for a much holiday from crime. However this is not meant to be as one of the passengers is brutally slain in the middle of the night and each of the other twelve passengers is a suspect as each harbors a dark secret and motive for murder.The script for the film is basically the same as its source material. This film does put a little more emphasis on following its detective around than on development of the primary players in the mystery which does detract from the story at times. However the core answer to the mystery is the same as in the conclusion of the novel where Poirot presents his theories on the crime and the solution becomes clear.As the famous literary detective, Branagh provides his own unique take on the character. He does capture Poirot's brilliant arrogance that help make his sleuthing skills renowned. Adopting a more believable French accent than his predecessor, Albert Finney, Branagh does mind his pronunciations though his natural British accent is slightly audible but doesn't take over and derail his faux French. The acclaimed actor-director does tend to focus a little too much on his character during intervals of the main mystery, but has the gravitas to lead the charge and bring the story full circle.Branagh and his casting directors do a decent job of filling the shoes of the 1974 film's illustrious cast of characters. Only two characters are changed from the original novel and prior film as the elegant Penelope Cruz plays the role of the missionary (Ingrid Bergman previously played the same role with a different name, but was German like the novel) as a Hispanic woman to match Cruz's own heritage (a not unwelcome change as it doesn't take away from the part she plays) and the talented Leslie Odom, Jr. plays the role of Colonel Arbuthnot, a doctor in this case instead of a straight-forward solider as Sean Connery in the original film, and provides some diversity as he is African-American. The likes of Dame Judi Dench (Princess Dragmonoff), Olivia Colman (Fraulein Schmidt), Daisy Ridley (Mary), Willem Dafoe (Cyrus Hardman), Josh Gad (Hector McQueen) and the gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer (Mrs. Hubbard) also grace the cast with their unique talents, but none quite get the development they really deserve but all work with what little is given to them and craft their characters into enigmas that cannot be trusted. And lastly is the 'poor' victim, Ratchet' played by an ever sleazy Johnny Depp; finally a diverse role for the actor during 2017 after 'Dead Men Tell No Tales'. The actor develops believable mannerisms that give cause to also distrust Depp as Ratchet, yet Depp doesn't turn into a cartoonish figure. He remains aloof and mysterious and with his demise, a figure who gave all but Poirot and his friend, Boc, reason to off him.Behind the camera, Kenneth Branagh displays his usual keen eye for crafting an atmosphere that puts the viewer in the story with the characters. With a fully built train model, complete with claustrophobic corridors, we are as trapped as the passengers of the Orient Express. The director's decision to also film on 65mm film (like fellow British filmmaker Christopher Nolan) lends to the 1930s setting of the film, giving an old-fashioned feel to the film's aura.Give this one a chance and you might enjoy even if you might know the story already.",7,2,7,11 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Far different from its origins
","You think you know Sherlock Holmes? Think again! Guy Ritchie has taken the classic, beloved British detective and has given him a makeover with great success. I didn't know what to think of this new take on Sherlock Holmes, but when I saw it, I was quite impressed at the degree and lengths the director and cast went to make this reboot far different from the original films from the '30s and '40s. Robert Downey, Jr. (known for Iron Man) stars as the famed detective and brings his brand of dry, sarcastic humor to the character that makes him seem dislike-able, but who really has a soft spot inside. Jude Law as a much thinner and younger Dr. John Watson is a perfect catalyst for the wise- cracking and irritating (in Watson's opinion anyway) Holmes. The two set the film in motion and do an excellent job carrying the plot and film itself with help from fellow actors Mark Strong as the villainous Lord Blackwood and Rachel McAdams (The Notebook)as the sly, but beautiful Irene Adler. This film is a thrill ride with twists and turns at every corner and one of Holmes' toughest cases till the sequel 'Game of Shadows' came out last holiday season and is now available on DVD and BluRay.",8,0,1,29 July 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Michael Keaton at his best!
","I didn't know what to expect from Birdman when i went to see it the first time, but once I sat down and the film started I was absorbed. The story was bizarre from the start as the viewer is shown the fragile state of mind of Riggan Thomson as he prepares to put on his first Broadway play, but is haunted by his former superhero alter ego, the titular Birdman. As Thomson, Michael Keaton portrays a icily calm demeanor that is about to crack if pushed too far, also displaying the weakness of a man who is trying to relive his glory days. Keaton keeps the emotions to well contained minimum without going over the top and does not overact.His long suffering daughter, Sam, is expertly handled by the mature talents of Emma Stone. Playing the part of a former drug addict and teenager is not the easiest task, but Stone is fully capable of both. Her pasty complexion and wide gray eyes convey the appearance of a girl haunted by her own issues, but also her father's obsessive behavior to reclaim recognition. The interactions she has with both Keaton and later Edward Norton (as Mike Shiner) convey an adult wisdom flawed by her teenage exterior and poor past choices. A career best performance so far for Miss Stone with more to come. Amounting a third Academy Award nomination for his performance as self-absorbed narcissistic Method actor Mike Shiner, Edward Norton again proves his knack for being versatile and good at his craft. His jerk-off behavior both endears him to the audience and also repulses the viewer as he mistreats his girlfriend (a brilliant Naomi Watts as Lesley), upstages and is often at odds with Keaton's Riggan which make for the finest scenes in the film between Keaton and Norton and a reflection into his mind and soul with Emma Stone's Sam provide the viewer with insight of a man who behaves immaturely and is insecure in his own confidence. Cinematography is exquisite and near flawless as it was edited into a single take. The effect provides a Broadway play-like atmosphere that fits the film's action. It is also difficult to follow at times as light and shadow often blur the frame. Music is mainly percussive, played on a drum-set with an occasional string harmony that is almost angelic and bombastic.An indie film for the ages!",8,2,10,17 February 2015
Platoon," The Best Vietnam War Film Ever Made
","Oliver Stone brought his first-hand experience as a Vietnam veteran behind the camera in what is arguably his magnum opus. Crafting a gripping and haunting film that brought out the nightmares of the horrors of war, Stone rightfully won his first Oscar for Best Director as well as Best Picture. Telling the tale of a ragtag platoon of soldiers from the perspective of newbie infantryman Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) about the atrocities of the war and how it affects each of the core players; the film's major players are all based upon people known by Oliver Stone during his service.The pivotal role of Chris Taylor was based on the director himself; a college drop-out eager to serve his country, but soon realizing how horrifying war really is and thus must become a stronger man and no longer a frightened boy among men. Charlie Sheen is perfectly cast as Taylor and is able to be sympathetic despite his naivety. The character of Chris Taylor is silent for the majority of the film except for his voice-overs and rare exchanges with his comrades. Sheen boldly develops his character deftly from the fresh-faced novice frightened by what he sees, moments perfectly captured in the night watch scene and the village raid, to a hardened young man who is no longer afraid to act in a brutal fashion as evidenced in Taylor's final encounter with Tom Berenger's brutal Sergeant Barnes at the end of the film. Providing the film's greatest internal conflict is the constant power struggle within the unit between Tom Berenger's arrogant and brutal Barnes (Berenger scored a nomination for Best Actor) and Willem Dafoe's peaceful, tactful Sergeant Elias (Dafoe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor). The differences between the men show the display of how war affects the once able-bodied souls who go to serve; Barnes representing a hardened, violent and quick-to-act soldier unafraid to turn on his own, particularly in the horrible moment where he ambushes Elias, while Elias represents the passive face of what is to come with war, but this does not mean the sergeant won't strive to serve and protect his unit. Caught in the middle of the sergeants' warring spar is Sheen's Taylor. As Taylor states at the film's end, 'Still fighting for what Rhah called 'the possession of my soul'', this thought echoes Chris's own turmoil for how he must choose to act: forceful and cruel like Barnes or with discipline and heart like Elias. As the film's events steer to the dark actions the group takes, the rage boils deeper within Barnes and Elias until it reaches a fever pitch and the two men fist-fight which eventually leads to Elias's iconic death scene. The outcome can only turn out one way by the time Elias is heartbreakingly slain before the platoon's and viewer's eyes: someone must pay.This isn't the easiest film to watch, but the topic of the war in Vietnam is important and not forgotten. Keep tissues nearby and prepare to be enraptured with this magnetic gem.",9,3,4,3 January 2017
Scream," Savior of the '90s Horror Genre
","By the 1990s horror had grown stagnant due to the numerous sequels that were preceding films like 'Friday the 13th', 'Halloween' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' But when Kevin Williamson wrote the script for 'Scream' it was destined to be a winner. 'Scream' is one of the scariest 1990s films I have seen in my teen years since I was only three when it came to the big screen. The genius of the film is that the device known as a telephone/cell phone can used against us in sinister ways which makes us fearful of our safety in our community. I was impressed with the performance of the cast and of course Wes Craven's creativity in the manner of the film's deaths and look.",10,3,3,26 July 2012
1408," The Haunted Hotel and the Skeptic
","Leave it to Stephen King to write a short story about another haunted hotel. This time instead of Jack Torrance, we have paranormal writer Mike Enslin, a complete non-believer in the supernatural until he steps foot into the allegedly haunted Dolphin Hotel. Chaos soon unleashes itself on the writer when he dares to stay in the haunted room 1408 and Mike is soon made a believer in otherworldly phenomena. Playing the key role of Mike Enslin is Chicago actor John Cusack. Cusack brings his trademark dry wit to the paranormal writer, but also is able to bring out the character's insecurities. Convincingly portraying a broken man who is at odds with those around him after a terrible tragedy prior to the film's events. His past mistakes come back to haunt him as he begins to be tormented by 1408's sinister atmosphere. Cusack keeps the overacting down until he finally lets loose in the film's grand finale as Mike Enslin sets out to end the curse of 1408 even at his own expense.The movie's plot is relatively generic in the 'haunted house' genre. There's the hotel manager (a subdued Samuel L. Jackson) who warns the skeptic of the haunted spot's danger zone to which the protagonist ignores the warning. Room 1408's haunting is pretty simple as it messes with the setting around Cusack's Enslin from unexplained noises to placing Enslin in some unknown setting or tormenting him psychologically with his past traumas. Ultimately in true Stephen King fashion, the hero is overcome by the evil force around them and consumed with stopping the horror from claiming more.Not a perfect film, but there are enough scary moments to entertain the viewer.",6,0,1,9 July 2016
The Woman in Black," Best Horror Film to Date
","Most critics in the US did dismiss this film as a clichéd horror film with a typical plot:someone loses a loved one and becomes depressed, the spooky village with the creepy house that no one goes to and a vengeful spirit is wreaking havoc. I for one think that 'The Woman in Black' is one of the finest horror films released in the 21st century. The film was packed with surprising scary moments where you would feel secure, but then something spooky pops out or something scary happens and you fly out of your seat. Also a huge perk of the film is the fact that this is Daniel Radcliffe's first take on a real adult role (he recently turned 23). He stated in an interview for the film that he wants to move as far from Harry as he can and be known for also taking on roles that represent him at his current age.",5,2,5,26 July 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Pure Thrills
","One of the iconic characters in horror is brought to us in this terrifying thriller and brought Sir Anthony Hopkins the 1991 Best Actor Oscar. Jodie Foster (who also won an Oscar) stars as naive FBI agent Clarice Starling on her first big assignment to capture the psychopathic serial murderer known as Buffalo Bill. To assist her in the case, Starling is sent to see the infamous cannibalistic psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins in a chilling performance), but she is warned that Lecter is adept at playing mind games with others and she mustn't tell him personal details. As Clarice comes closer and closer to the killer's true identity, she is thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse with both Buffalo Bill and the sly Dr. Lecter. What truly sets this film apart from other horror/thrillers is the performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, a man who is clearly homicidal but not in an over-the-top fashion. Lecter is presented as calm, cool, collected but still frightening in the sense of the fact we know he is dangerous and has killed people, yet we are drawn to him like Clarice and we are fascinated by his intelligence. This is a clever device to present us as the viewers with a killer who terrifies us mentally rather than being a raving maniac like Freddy or Jason.",10,1,2,17 January 2013
Mother!," One Insane Mind Trip
","From the creative mind of 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Black Swan', Darren Arronofsky returns after a three year hiatus to bring audiences this psychological mind-bending film that has proved immensely divisive. However don't let the controversy surrounding the film give a false impression, this Arronofsky piece is probably his most unique offering yet.To briefly explain the plot without giving too many spoilers, a married couple (Oscar winners Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem) are renovating a large country estate when two mysterious strangers (Oscar nominees Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) arrive at their home and bizarre occurrences begin to unfold. The film eventually descends into a torrid fever dream until its heart-stopping climax.Director Darren Arronofsky knows how to assemble a prestigious cast and this film is no exception: 1. Jennifer Lawrence really delivers a mature performance that may not quite rival her work in 2010's 'Winter's Bone', but her descent into paranoia is actually believable as she slowly starts to unravel as the amount of strangers in her home chips away at her normally solid façade. However the actress's chemistry with costar Javier Bardem seems a little less solid as the two characters seem too detached at certain times. There are tender moments where the actors' chemistry does appear more genuine, but the age difference to me was unsettling (given Bardem is near 50 while Lawrence is in her mid 20s); there is even an in-joke from co-star Michelle Pfeiffer's character about Lawrence's character being Bardem's daughter not his wife. Lawrence's climatic breakdown at the film's finale is probably the most adrenaline-rushing and heartbreaking farewell the actress has ever given as she has finally decided to end her torment despite her want for happiness throughout the narrative. 2. Javier Bardem as Lawrence's husband makes for an enigmatic figure as we never really get to know much about him. The actor imbues some tenderness into his relationship with Lawrence (already mentioned the overall flatness of their chemistry), but also masks a sinister demeanor behind the friendly-looking face; a trademark for the actor in other roles like 'No Country for Old Men'. We don't learn much about Bardem's character due to his secretive nature, but the film's first half hints that there is a dark purpose behind him and his actions especially when it comes to Jennifer Lawrence's Mother accusing her husband of being selfish and only caring about his own needs and desires as opposed to her; though he tries to tell her he does care about her. Does he really is up to the viewer's interpretation. 3. In what are basically cameo roles, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer as a mysterious couple are the catalysts for the ensuing chaos of the film's second and third acts. All we learn is that Harris plays a doctor and Pfeiffer is his pretty yet strangely aloof spouse and meet their sparring sons (an event that has a profound impact during the film's intense second act and a main drive for the start of Lawrence's Mother's deteriorating mental state). The genders each form a bizarre chemistry as we see Bardem and Harris bonding while Pfeiffer and Lawrence are wary of each other and a mild antagonism bubbles, but doesn't quite explode. There is might be a strange symbolism in Harris and Pfeiffer's characters that connects them to our two leads, but there is never a clear answer as the couple disappears halfway through the film and are never seen or mentioned again.Retaining the director's traditional dark atmosphere, Arronofsky does include numerous daytime scenes to evoke an unsettling serenity that eventually dissolves into nighttime chaos. The first half of the film is like many Arronofsky films where the basic action and characters are introduced, but unlike some of the director's prior dark films this is one that turns almost into an MTV fever dream in its third act. Is there an occult message when masses of fanatics turn up at the home of Lawrence and Bardem or is there a message of the difference between isolation and socialization? There is never a clear answer as the film veers from unsteady tranquility into a maddening nightmare that can only lead to tragedy (a common theme in Arronofsky's other works). While the camera-work is impressive as expected from Arronofsky, the biggest flaw is his use of shaky cam during one intense scene early in the film between three characters; the shaky cam only stops when the fight finally ends, your head will definitely spend several minutes spinning before you can settle back. Even in the film's third act, the visuals become overwhelming and intense as the action transitions deeper and deeper into a waking nightmare before there is a moment of respite.A film not for the faint of heart or a novice of the Darren Arronofsky filmography, take caution when viewing 'mother!'. You won't comprehend the story at first, there will be numerous questions to ponder.",6,1,4,21 September 2017
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Whimsical and Fun
","Wes Anderson brings his unique eccentricity to this Roald Dahl tale of a gentlemanly fox who decides to pull one final heist on local farmers. The director chooses to the colorful medium of stop-motion animation which was an animation trademark for director Tim Burton, but this is pure Anderson.Dripped in a rich color palette of traditional fall colors like orange, yellow, brown and red, the atmosphere sets itself apart from other Wes Anderson worlds. The director is known for picking a specific color scheme to illustrate his films and here the fall colors set the time of year and fit with the characters of the Fox family and their associates. As usual, Anderson assembles an all star cast of actors to bring his characters to life like frequent collaborators Bill Murray as the grouchy Badger and Jason Schwartzman as Ash Fox, son of the title Mr. Fox, while also bringing in well-established actors like George Clooney as the mischievous and suave title character, Meryl Streep as the clever and loyal wife of Clooney's Mr. Fox as well as a minor appearance from Willem Dafoe as the voice of the scheming and devious Rat (too fitting a character for the actor known for playing villains). Every player in the film brings the comradeship needed between them while also being believable as a family unit or adversaries. The film takes a unique approach to language as director Wes Anderson tosses out traditional cursing and swaps in the word'cuss' whenever a character has to swear. At times it is evident what word the actor might actually have said and other times it's purely entertaining without replacing a certain curse word. This idea keeps the material family-friendly for any younger viewers, but provides an adult joke for all the grown-ups.",7,0,0,6 February 2017
The Sixth Sense," Terrifying and Tragic
","This tragic tale of spirits and psychology weaves together in an overall decent film starring 'Die Hard' star Bruce Willis in the role of child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who is shot by a psychotic ex-patient. He recovers soon after and heads back to work on a case involving a little boy who 'sees dead people' (the boy is played by a young Haley Joel Osment). As the terror increases, Dr. Crowe soon realizes that nothing in his world is as it seems. The director manages to incorporate several terrifying twists such as the film's dramatic climax when Willis' character discovers the truth. However much of the film is cliché with the spirits that pop up to terrify Osment's character and his mother throughout the film. The truly fabulous moments in the film are the opening and closing scenes of the film where the viewer gets the background and the tragic conclusion of this story. In all, it's a decent terror ride for audience members at least 12 and up.",8,0,0,1 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Return to Form
","After three horrendous 'Star Wars' prequels, it was unclear if J.J. Abrams would be able to deliver a worthy new entry to this cash cow saga. Thankfully the director delivered a well constructed seventh entry into the 'Star Wars' canon. New characters along with some familiar faces in a brand- new story tying to the franchise's roots, but with twists. The fresh faces added to the canon of 'Star Wars' characters are destined to be as memorable as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Leia Organa. Such as Daisy Ridley as the impulsive, but courageous Rey set as our new hero of the 'Star Wars' universe. Then there's the bold former storm trooper Finn played by John Boyega, a character whose origins are shrouded in mystery. Dashing pilot Poe Dameron as portrayed by Oscar Issac who is a minor player in this installment, but hopefully will be expanded upon in the sequels. Or the adorable droid BB-8 who gives R2-D2 a run for his money as the coolest droid ever.There's the welcome return of lovable rogue pilot Han Solo in all his iconic glory. Accompanied by faithful Wookie, Chewbacca, Harrison Ford delivers his lines with classic flair. Also in a reprising role is actress Carrie Fisher as the Rebel leader (Princess) Leia Organa. She immediately bonds with feisty young Rey as she senses the greatness in the young woman equal to her own past of fighting for the Rebel Alliance.The narrative of the film is fairly straightforward in 'Star Wars' fashion of the fight between the Rebel Alliance and the new evil organization known as the First Order. Little is known of this new threat to the galactic universe, but that is what the sequels will be for; expanding on the first entry's lingering questions. If you aren't convinced that the First Order can't as devious as the Empire from the original trilogy, you haven't seen this film. See this film quickly, 'Star Wars' has finally returned to its A-game and is exciting as it was back when the first film was released in 1977.",9,1,21,15 July 2016
Rear Window," A Clever Thriller
","Hitchcock brings back one of his favorite stars back for another thrill ride, but you gotta watch it from your rear window. That happens to be the title of this film. James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, a photographer on leave with a broken leg from an assignment. Jeffries has grown bored in his small apartment and soon starts to watch his neighbors through a photographic lens. One day he notices that the wife of one of his neighbors, Thorwald (Raymond Burr of 'Perry Mason', is missing. With the aid of his lovely girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), and his caretaker, Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeffries sets out to discover Mrs. Thorwald's fate. The most fascinating aspects of the film is that all the camera shots are from the point of view of Stewart as he is trapped in the apartment. A true creative film, there is no moment of disappointment in the movie.",9,1,3,3 August 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Last of the Great Horror Films
","'One, two Freddy's coming for you' he surely is in this terrifying tale directed by famed horror director Wes Craven. Teenagers having nightmares isn't too uncommon due to trauma or just a rough night's sleep, but when a group of teens dream about a serial killer...then you have a problem. Heading the group of frightened teens is the courageous Nancy Thompson (played powerfully by Heather Langenkamp). Starring in a supporting role as Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz which propelled him to stardom, was a young Johnny Depp. In the terrifying role as the murderous Freddy Krueger was Robert Englund who later starred in several other horror films such as 'Urban Legend.' The scariest moments in the film are the deaths of Tina Grey (Amanda Wyss), Nancy's best friend, and Glen (Depp himself in his most notable scene of the film). The rest of the film is more composed of cheap scares as Englund's Krueger stalks the teens one by one and kills them in gruesome fashions. But the film is still the last of the great horror classics before the horror genre went down (until 'Scream' in 1996).",7,1,1,9 November 2012
Looper," My Favorite JGL Film Ever
","'Time travel has not yet been invented. But in 30 years it will have been.' With these lines spoken through voice-over by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, we take a thrilling journey to 2044 Kansas where we met Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a 'looper' whose job is eliminate people from the future so they can erase their existence. One clause of the 'looper' contract is that each looper must eliminate his future self (known as your 'loop') in order to end his contract with the organization. The most part of this clause is to NEVER let your loop run. When Joe's loop (Bruce Willis) escapes his clutches, Joe's life is now in jeopardy for his bosses will stop at nothing to get Joe and his loop back. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the self-absorbent, selfish Joe is one of remarkable talent. The first real flawed character that the young actor has ever played is riveting to watch as his attitude changes throughout the film from a selfish snob to a soon humbled young man after encountering the brave, strong-willed Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son. Levitt's achievement to play a killer who learns what his life really means and what it has done to him excels all past roles the youthful actor has taken. Simply spectacular.",7,0,5,10 November 2012
Annihilation," Thought-Provoking, Tense and Provactive
","From Alex Garland, director and writer of 2015's 'Ex Machina', comes the on-screen treatment of Jeff Vandermeer's bestselling science-fiction novel. Natalie Portman stars as a biologist who decides to enter the mysterious 'Shimmer', a colorful invisible wall cloaking a dark and possibly dangerous secret, to find out what has caused the sudden illness of her militant husband (Oscar Isaac). Director Alex Garland has crafted a strong female lead in Alicia Vikander's Ava in his debut feature and even with adapting a screenplay the director manages to keep his female characters strong and the film's casting helps. With Oscar winner Natalie Portman (alleged whitewashing rumors aside) as leading heroine, Lena, the actress provides both a naivety but also fierce courage to the intelligent biologist. Lena knows so little about her husband despite how much she says she loves him, but her drive for knowledge leads her to inspect the mystery of the Shimmer after her husband goes comatose. Portman does not allow her character to become a whimpering mess when faced with extreme peril within the Shimmer; she fires her weapon to help protect her comrades, uses logic to try and assuage their fears but is willing to admit there is much they don't understand and in the end her relentless nature helps keep her alive. The talented supporting female players help round out the core players and clashing personalities to Portman's Lena. Character actress Jennifer Jason Leigh plays psychologist Dr. Ventress, a mysterious/secretive woman who is unwilling to tell her comrades the truth of why the group is actually going into the Shimmer. Her secretiveness ultimately leads to the demise of several characters and Ventress is unremorseful for what her actions and lies have done to others as long as she benefits and try to succeed in solving the mystery. Gina Rodriguez as Anya is one of the more damaged members of the group as she quickly succumbs to paranoia within the artificial environment despite the best efforts of Lena and fellow member Josie (Tessa Thompson) to calm her. Her bond with the soft-spoken Cass Shepherd (Tuva Notovny) seems to be the only happiness Anya knows in her life. Tuva Novotny has the smallest amount of screen-time of the female players, but shows her worldliness in such a small amount of time. Cass knows that she probably won't return home and makes vague remarks to Lena throughout the film, but provides the most human element of her companions till her time does run out. And then there's Tessa Thompson as the troubled Josie, a kind and soft-spoken soul like Cass but has endured more pain than the others. Josie like Cass also knows her time will run out before the mission is over, but she has made peace with the idea and when her moment comes she calmly accepts her fate. The film's visuals are primarily subtle, but haunting and stunning. The Shimmer is simply a mesh of light colors like pink, green and white and glows or shimmers (like the name implies) but its influence is felt throughout the environment by the viewer and characters. Motion-capture is even used for the hybrid creatures such as a monstrous crocodile that tries to dispatch our heroines. The narrative is overall straightforward, but comes with some twists and turns particularly by the final act. The mystery of why our heroines are in the Shimmer appears to be answered, but the answer isn't so simple as the teams' own mental states come into question as they trek further into the Shimmer. Even the reveal of what happened to Oscar Isaac's Kane is not what we thought actually happened and we share in Lena's anguish at the truth. However the film's greatest mystery comes with the final shot of the actor's eyes and makes you wonder if the Shimmer is still alive and influencing our survivors.",8,2,5,27 February 2018
Born on the Fourth of July," A Haunting and amazing biopic that will touch your heart
","Oliver Stone followed up his Oscar winning epic, 'Platoon', with this gripping tale based on a true story about a Vietnam veteran and his struggle to return to a normal life following his time in Vietnam.Based on Ron Kovic's memoir of the same name, the film follows the initially idealistic Kovic as he goes off to war a naive and determined young solider who is injured in the line of duty and becomes a paraplegic. When Ron returns home, the brave young man is soon ridiculed and spat on by the local population for daring to serve in a war that the United States had grown to despise as so many young soldiers lost their lives and unrest grows with war protesters and local law enforcement butting heads in a divided country.Playing the real-life figure of Ron Kovic is a beyond phenomenal Tom Cruise. Fresh off successes like 'Top Gun' and 'The Color of Money', the normally pretty boy actor took on the difficult role of a man who must grow from a naive youth to a disillusioned veteran who has become disheartened by his paraplegic status and how the Vietnam War has torn apart the country he had fought so hard to protect. Cruise is never afraid to portray the pain of Kovic after he is injured in a firefight of bullets and left paralyzed from the waist down or when Kovic's mother (Caroline Kava) starts trying to spout religion in the disillusioned Ron's face upon his return. The actor displays an anguish that just tears at the heart as Ron realizes how altered his life will becomes after he learns he can't ever walk again or do other functions without assistance which only increase the depression the young man feels as he must try to move on. Cruise displays believable chemistry with actress Kyra Sedgwick who plays Ron's old flame, Donna, who is against the war from the start and tries to convince Ron to stay away and when Ron returns, Donna recruits Ron to join the anti-war movement in New York. The other most notable co-star chemistry between Cruise and another actor besides Sedgwick is when Kovic spends time in Villa Duce where he meets fellow paraplegic, Charlie played by 'Platoon' veteran Willem Dafoe. At first both Ron and Charlie are so similar due to both their disabilities and service for their country, but as time wears on and Ron's anger about his treatment due to his service grows he and Charlie start to become polar opposite personalities; Charlie being content to accept what has happened in contrast to Ron's disillusionment. When it comes to a scuffle between the actors, the tension is palpable as contrasting ideals battle for the win, ending up with Dafoe's Charlie being unseated and defeated while Cruise's Kovic ends back to civilization. Personally approved of by the film's subject himself, Ron Kovic (who rewarded star Tom Cruise with his (Kovic's) Bronze Star), the film never loses its serious tone despite some lighthearted early scenes and some humor thrown in while Ron is in Villa Duce. Director Oliver Stone, being a Vietnam veteran himself, shows sympathy for his subject's plight but portrays Kovic as a flawed human being who makes an error in judgment and deal with the consequences while trying to improve himself. Ron ultimately achieves a form of redemption when he becomes (and remains so) an anti-war activist, standing up for what he now believes is right for America. A worthy follow-up in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy, this film is worth the time",10,1,2,12 February 2017
The Social Network," A Modern for the Modern Age
","In 2004, the world of social media skyrocketed when an enterprising Harvard student emerged with a little site called 'The Facebook.' Shortly after, the 'The' was dropped to create the one word social site that is now forever ingrained into popular culture.David Fincher once again returns to the drama genre after the well received 'Curious Case of Benjamin Button' in 2008 with this true story drama that documented how Mark Zuckerberg and his company became the leading social media site in a time when YouTube was also coming to fruition. With a script by Aaron Sorkin (who would bag a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for this feature) and based off Ben Mezrich's book, the film tells primarily in flashbacks how Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) went from potentially developing a dating site for three fellow students to eventually creating his iconic company despite soon facing personal issues with former friends and then a lawsuit by the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) and former (and now again) co-founder Eduard Savrin (Andrew Garfield, pre-Peter Parker/Spidey).The youthful cast that Fincher enlists is truly one of his finest ensembles in the director's career. In particular is of course Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, who goes from ambitious Harvard business student to the youngest billionaire in history (lest we allow Kylie Jenner to take that mantle). While the real-life subject was't entirely impressed with the film's depiction of him, it cannot be denied that Eisenberg nails the youthful arrogance of the boy wonder as he continuously back-stabs his friends and colleagues to achieve his own ends (though this irritated the real Zuckerberg). There is also a calm charm to Eisenberg as he silently calculates his next moves while also quipping with a sharp barb should he not care to hear or respond to another's remark; this is most evident in the present-day time narrative as Zuckerberg faces the accusations of the Winklevosses and his former friend, Eduard Savrin. The film's supporting cast are the equal hearts of the narrative since they are the catalysts for the dramatic narrative: In the role that put his name on Hollywood's call-list and A-list is the dual performance of Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, wealthy students who attended Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg. The Winklevi (as they are dubbed by Zuckerberg in a snide comment to one of the lawyers) initially proposed creating a dating/social site with Mark, but when Zuckerberg eventually decided to create Facebook the twins become vindictive and attempt to sue the latter for stealing their idea. While actor Josh Pence provides the physical body for Tyler Winklevoss, it's Armie Hammer who provides the voice and also physically portrays Cameron. The then-unknown actor makes an impression from our first view of the twins as their lavish indulgence as members of the rowing team shows their superiority complex to when an incensed Cameron declares that the duo should go after Mark once Facebook begins to become popular. While his twin sees no point in trying to combat their rival, he eventually relents upon a poor rowing performance.Andrew Garfield as Facebook's co-founder and primary investor in his friend's dream is arguably the young actor's finest hour. As Savrin, Garfield is the socially confident member of the founders and wants to build interest for the site while Zuckerberg seeks to mostly expand quickly to irritate the Winklevi and raise his own profile. While Savrin initially tries to be slightly hands-off and be the business mind and drum up investments for Facebook, his relationship with Mark immediately takes blows as Mark continues to make his own choices without consulting his friend and business partner. Upon learning what Mark does behind his back, Savrin gives him a choice: let Savrin make the decisions on finances and PR or he walks away. When Zuckerberg decides to have Savrin bought out, the latter's feelings become hurt and jaded so he makes the choice to go for his share of the now-popular company. During Savrin's testimony at the hearing, we can see he is trying not to harbor resentment towards Mark and only wants his fair share of credit for Facebook's success despite Mark's snobbish attitude and disinterest in the proceedings. In real-life the outcome has been happier as Savrin has again become part of the phenomena that is Facebook and has his share of credit.While the run-time is a bit tedious and could've fit a ninety minute or slightly less shorter length, this move should've eliminated crucial time to fleshing out Sorkin's witty and engaging script and development for how we ended up with such an obsession with social media.",9,1,2,19 July 2018
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne Returns with a Vengeance
","With a new director at the helm in Paul Greengrass and the return of star Matt Damon, this second film in the Jason Bourne series amps up the tension from frame one and never lets go. Damon remains in fine form as the amnesiac super spy; building on his character arc even more as Bourne starts having memories come back from his checkered past. We begin to learn more about the events that lead to the happenings of the first movie; who Bourne had been after when he was attacked and left for dead, more information about Project Treadstone and its operations and why they are so keen on Bourne being eliminated. Damon's chemistry with his costars remains captivating as he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and deals with grief when his lover, Marie, is killed in the film's opening act.Joining the game is an excellent Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, the new head of the task force that must capture Bourne at all costs. Allen does a top notch job playing Pam as neutral as possible even though she is adversarial at first to Damon's Bourne because she thinks he is killing her operatives, but her sympathetic side surfaces when she learns who is actually behind the deed and decides to aid Bourne's search for truth. Joining Allen but playing the real villain-like role is Brian Cox as Treadstone head Ward Abbott who will stop at nothing to rid the CIA of Jason Bourne in order to protect himself. Cox plays the role with a smooth gravitas that is not overdone or outright malevolent, but more subdued and calculated. And at last in the network of players is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; Stiles appeared briefly in 'Bourne Identity' as a minor character. Nicky is finally expanded upon and given a larger role to play as she holds one key to Jason Bourne's past. She stays mostly on the sidelines throughout the film, but becomes central by the climax.The film's narrative like its predecessor deviates from the source material it was based on. Killing off Bourne's love interest, Marie, in the first 30 minutes of the film is the biggest change that stands out. Marie remains alive in the novels upon which the trilogy is based (Bourne marries her and has a family by the 'Bourne Ultimatum'), but her death in the film is meant to add an extra personal touch for Bourne to return and go after Treadstone. The action remains tense and thrilling as Bourne fights his way to Washington, D.C. from all over Europe. This film is even better than the first, but in a class of its own.",9,3,4,21 August 2016
The Great Gatsby," A new Gatsby, but still a classic-Go See
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic tale is brought back to life for a new generation of moviegoers. Leonardo DiCaprio is suave, charming and marvelous as the title character. Having played flawed characters in the past such as Howard Hughes (The Aviator, Academy Award nomination), Teddy Daniels (Shutter Island)and Dom Cobb (Inception), DiCaprio brings his own unique style to the mysterious Gatsby that surely should garner him the Oscar he has been denied twice. Tobey Maguire of 'Spider Man' fame takes the mantel of Nick Carraway, the narrator of the tale. Maguire's performance is done with care as he approaches the role with a haunted feel as he relates the story of how he came to know Gatsby in a sanitarium approximately seven years after the events of the novel. A clever device though by the filmmakers.The film is shot marvelously as it opens with a shot of Maguire as he looks out the sanitarium window and soon melts into the story's main locale of Long Island, NY. The weaving of the memories and the present time mesh well as Maguire's narration (following the novel's original dialogue with few changes in portions) carries the viewer from each point. Another clever device are the images of the novel's words appear in silhouette as Maguire writes and speaks. If you really enjoy the classic novel, go see this film and be mesmerized!",5,2,10,9 May 2013
Sully," Doing the Right Thing
","Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come together in this powerful true story about the 'Miracle on the Hudson' and it truly is a miraculous movie. From Eastwood's deft camera-work to the subtle acting and music and the limited use of special effects all in an amazing tale of heroic endeavor in midair.Tom Hanks is perfectly in the titular role of Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Hanks aptly portrays the wisdom of Sullenberger's 40+ years of piloting experience with ever breaking his calm demeanor. Maintaining his position on the course of action he undertook on the fateful day of January 15, 2009, Sully ultimately proved his actions were justified in saving 155 passengers. This is a tour de force performance by the legendary Oscar winner and his chemistry with fellow actor Aaron Eckhart (as First Officer Jeff Skilles) is spot-on.The narrative is straightforward in telling of Captain Sully's heroic maneuver after a bird strike destroyed his plane's engines. The investigation of the crash portion of the film is really condensed (due to time constraint obviously) in order to keep the film's run-time short. What is kept in the film is still golden material and does not dumb down the amazing feat that Captain Sully achieved. Truly one of Clint Eastwood's best films to date.",8,0,1,17 September 2016
The Simpsons Movie," Classic Simpsons Humor
","I've been a Simpsons fan for the last 5 years or so, but it was a shocker that Matt Groening and his crew would release a movie on 'The Simpsons.' But the movie was a pretty hilarious ride as Homer causes numerous problems (per usual) along the way throughout the picture. Some of the jokes are pretty funny, but most are typical considering its basis; a cartoon. The characters are the same with a few additions, but no one who was entered into the series after the film was released and there are at two least guest performers (Green Day in the opening scenes and then Tom Hanks around the middle of the movie). The movie is not disappointing per say, but it is loaded with the show's natural humor and jokes. However, the film is still hilariously entertaining and a good movie for the family (11 and up though).",7,0,1,9 August 2012
