The Blair Witch Project," They couldn't have died too soon for me.
","I was extremely disappointed in this film.  It spends the majority of its time showing three rejects from MTV's The Real World screaming at each other over whose fault it is that they are lost in the woods.  There is a minimum of plot, and the ending refers to a line from the beginning of the film that many viewers have forgotten by the conclusion, through all the whining and fighting.  Some of the B&W shots are indeed chilling, but with a pair of scissors this 100-minute film could easily be turned into a scarier and more interesting half-hour television episode.",1,0,3,2 August 1999
