Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It fulfilled my expectations
","I can't really defend Jar Jar all that much. I don't really find him that character that annoying or offensive. He has a couple of moments that make me chuckle, but for the most part he's not funny unless your five. His character is a very self conscious attempt to pander to that kind of audience and it just fails. Furthermore, Jar Jar isn't important to the story. Many of the other characters in the story give Jar Jar annoyed looks and go about their business to more interesting parts of the story; I do the same as a member of the audience.I LOVE those more interesting parts of the story! First of all, Liam Neeson is my favorite actor and it's a treat to see him play a Jedi. It's perfect casting. I also enjoyed the fact that Qui-gin Jinn seemed to have some grey areas; he was definitely a good guy but there was something ambiguous about him that I appreciated.The main thing about this movie is that I got to see many of the things that were mentioned in the other three movies. The Senate. Anakin and Obi-wan meeting for the first time. R2 and 3PO meeting for the first time. Anakin as a child. Jedi knights in their prime, fighting the bad guys. It may not be exactly what I've been picturing in my head since I found out that there was a backstory. For the most part I don't really care. I wasn't expecting the second coming. I was expecting a new Star Wars movie. That's exactly what I got. And in spite of Jar Jar, I love it just as much as I do the first three movies. There's no doubt that I would probably be more into it if I were twelve. But it's nice to forget that I'm not for two hours.",9,7,10,5 August 2006
Hot Fuzz," meh
","Hot Fuzz was a nice diversion, but here's the thing: it just wasn't funny. I could tell where the jokes were. I said to myself hey, that was a joke and I should have laughed. But I didn't. To be fair, there were a few mild chuckles, but no out and out belly laughs. I expected more from the creators of Shaun of the Dead. SotD was funny and sometimes subtle and clever. Hot Fuzz was neither subtle or clever. I suppose this wouldn't really matter if the movie had been funny. I think that part of the problem is that the movies Hot Fuzz makes fun of already have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks. Bad Boys II and Point Break are already parodies to a certain extent, so what's the point of making a parody of them?",5,2,4,28 September 2007
Crash," I felt something too!
","I had the feeling while watching Crash that the filmmakers were attempting to make an 'Airplane' style parody of both Spike Lee and Robert Altman movies. Except that they didn't let the cast in on the joke.Crash lost me from the moment the first character you see speaks. Because sometimes, people CRASH into each other, just to feel something. Get it? They CRASH into each other. Just like the title of the movie! It's about as subtle as a jackhammer on concrete. This movie's idea of cleverness was to have a rapper give s speech in which he says rap music was created by whitey to keep the black man down. I might have been willing to go along with it all if any of the characters behaved in ways that were believable. Instead, they just represented various aspects of race, class and prejudice. The whole thing felt like an after school special. Tell me a story, don't get on your soapbox and preach. If I want a sermon I'll go to church.",1,7,16,6 August 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," I would like my money back, Mr. del Toro
","It was beautiful on a technical level. But I thought the story stunk. You have the Spanish civil war story and the little girl in Wonderland story. They never really mesh, except for when the wicked stepfather shows up in the labyrinth at the end. And do I really need to see a giant frog barf up what looks like a corn muffin with raisins, or a guy sew his own cheek together? If the filmmakers would have spent less time on unnecessary gore and more time on telling a coherent story, they might have had something. What story there was move forward at a snail's pace. So if you're curious to see what the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe would be like if it dropped acid and spoke Spanish, then this is the movie for you. This movie seems to be getting a of acclaim, but I just don't get it. To me it was just a big boring surreal mess.",3,11,27,17 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," pears, young love, and the clone wars
","I was watching this movie with some friends a while ago. During the dinner scene on Naboo, one of my friends coined a phrase that we now use for when something really stinks: floating the pear. I don't mind much of the love story in this movie, but that scene really floats the pear. Not only is it just stupid scene, but I find it somewhat wrong that the infinite power of the universe is being used to be cutesy. But while it may not be a great romance for the ages, the love story works well enough for me to buy into the story, so I'm not going to complain too much. After all, there are more interesting things going on.Such as all the scenes on Kamino. We sort of know that it's not much of a mystery, but it's still pretty neat to see the birth of the stormtroopers. It goes without saying that the Obi-wan/Jango Fett fight was awesome. Speaking of Obi-wan, my favorite scene in the movie is the conversation between him and Count Dooku. Not only is it nice to get some background on certain characters, but it's also kind of awesome to see Dooku attempt to seduce Obi-wan to the dark side.SUCH AS THE CLONE WARS!!!!!!!Seriously, you get to see the beginning of the Clone Wars. Isn't that kind of awesome? Sure, it would have been nice if they started this conflict in the Phantom Menace. But you can't have everything. It's a half hour adrenaline rush from the moment Anakin and Padme are lead into the arena. Then it's all Jedi versus droids! Jango Fett going out with all guns blazing against Mace Windu! Jedis and clones versus droids! The screaming match between Anakin and Obi-wan on the gunship! The lightsaber fights! That amazing scene at the end when you see fields of clone troops while the Imperial march blasts in the soundtrack! Isn't all of this cool stuff worth sitting through a handful of dopey love scenes?",9,0,1,8 August 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Dear Bourne Ultimatum,
","I'm not finished watching you yet. But so far, the story is compelling and the action scenes are exciting.Having said that, I wish you would have gotten a tripod. Or at least someone could have set the camera down on a table or a desk. You're a big budget Hollywood action movie with a movie star in the lead; surely you can afford a tripod or a table?Is it some notion of indy authenticity that led you to have much of you filmed with a hand held camera? Does the hand held camera enhance the excitement of the action scenes? When I watch you, I feel like a cat following the light from a laser pointer. I'm sometimes unsure of where I should be looking in a scene. I feel dizzy. I'll keep watching you, but after you I think it's best that we only be friends.",7,0,0,12 December 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Did anyone else find this movie disturbing?
","I thought that this movie was trying way too hard to be weird and quirky; but I kept watching. It was a pleasant enough diversion on a rainy Sunday morning.Then came the ending. The ending was offensive and repugnant on so many levels. The ending totally killed anything positive that the movie had going for it.A ten year old dressed like a stripper who dances to Superfreak with dance moves taught to her by her pervert grandfather. Oh yeah, and it supposed to contain some sort of message about following your heart's desire even when others are against you. But wait! It also brings the family together! But there's more! Let's not forget the pedophile in the audience cheering for Olive!Are you freaking kidding me???!!! All of this is supposed to be funny and/or inspirational???!!! Give me a break. I'm not usually one to say such a thing about a movie, but what kind of sick people came up with this pile of poo?",2,2,5,16 April 2007
Spider-Man," unique among big summer blockbusters
","I knew nothing about Spiderman before this movie, except that he spun a web at any size. When I first saw the movie, I was a little taken aback: I didn't know that it was a goofy character piece. I was expecting just another fun silly summer movie. I'm pleased that I got far more than I expected.The action scenes and the fights with the Green Goblin were, for me, the least interesting parts of the movie. The most interesting parts were when the characters were just talking to each other, and the emotional drama that came from these scenes. During the final conflict, I found myself wanting more such scenes as opposed to more action sequences. Don't get me wrong; the action scenes in Spiderman are fantastic. They're just not as interesting as the drama of the characters' inner lives. Much of the time in these movies, such scenes are often just bridges in between action scenes. I was quite pleased to get so much more with Spiderman.",9,0,1,1 August 2006
No Country for Old Men," Seriously?
","You may want to take this review with a grain of salt. I don't really like the Coen Brothers much. But I wanted to see what all the hype was about with this movie. SInce IMDb does not permit the use of profanity in user comments, I will substitute the word kitten where I might otherwise curse.Are you kittens kidding me? This piece of kitten is the best movie of the year? Long long stretches where people just walk from one place to another with nothing happening and no one saying anything? BORING. I watched a good deal of the movie with my finger pressed down on the fast forward button. And that motherkittening ending? Then I woke up? What the kitten is that bullkitten???!!!I'm only giving this a 3 because the performances were pretty good. But that doesn't matter if you story sucks kittens.",3,1,6,12 March 2008
The Da Vinci Code," don't bother cracking the code
","This movie defies what is known about physics: it both sucks and blows! I don't ask much from movies as far as logic goes. I'm usually happy to go along with 'movie logic.' The Da Vinci Code tested the limits of this. If you pull at one dangling strand of the plot, it all starts to unravel. The plot and the conspiracy just doesn't make any sense. Furthermore, the movie is incredibly boring for something that's supposed to be a thriller. It feels as if both cast and crew were sleepwalking through the whole thing. However, I did have fun looking at the cast and thinking about all of the movies they've done that were better than this pile of poo.Lastly, it was depressing to see Amelie play 'The Girl' in a big budget Hollywood movie. She spent a lot of time running away from bad guys behind Tom Hanks. Actresses often complain about the lack of good female roles. It was sad to see Audrey Tatou, who arguably has played one of the most interesting female characters in recent cinema, reduced to being a prop.",2,1,2,2 September 2006
There Will Be Blood," I just don't get it
","It was pretty good for the most part. Then it fell apart in the last half hour or so. The ending had me scratching my head, wondering what the point was. I felt that it was operating on a metaphorical and thematic level that eluded me.It also would have helped if Daniel Plainview had any redeeming qualities. Think of a lot of other anti-heroes or antogonists in movie history: Jake LaMotta, Darth Vader, Travis Bickle, Gollum, Tony Montana, or even Bill the Butcher. Each of these characters had some sort of positive quality that you can relate too. Daniel Plainview's character arc is just a slow steady descent into a black hole. I understand that not every movie can be sunshine and roses, but I just can't revel in this kind of nihilism. There has to at least a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel.",6,15,33,8 January 2008
Munich," my thoughts on Munich
","There are a number of things that I love about Munich, and one or two things that I find disappointing. Let's start with the good stuff first.You could tell Spielberg was passionate about this story. it shows through in every frame. It's rare to find this sort of dedication in Hollywood today. I for one am glad that Spielberg chooses to tell challenging stories that he cares deeply about rather than resting on his laurels.I love Eric Bana's performance in his movie. There is one point where the character of Louis says I could be anybody, you could as well. Or something like that. Avner literally has to be anybody if he is to carry out his mission. Anybosy aside from who he actually is of course. That this facade takes so long to crack is one of the most interesting things about Avner.My interpretation of the ending is that Spielberg feels that Isreal should unite Jews, when in the end scene it divides Avner and Efraim. I think that the movie is bitter about this but has hope for that things will be different in the future. I don't think it was an accident that Munich was released during Hannukah.Now for the stuff I didn't like. I hated the sex scene. I understand the point it was trying to make. But I would that Avner's demons would be his own acts of violence, and not the Munich massacre. I also didn't like the scene in which Avner storms the Isreali consulate and screams at them to leave his family alone. We've scene this kind of scene in dozens of cheesy thrillers, and just for a moment this scene reduces Munich to that level.But those are relatively minor quibbles. Munich remains not only a stirring and passionate political tale, but also a masterpiece of suspense.",9,1,1,27 August 2006
300," Thes! Es! Sparta!!!!!!!!!!
","The story of the battle of Thermopylae sounds fascinating. It's a shame that the makers of 300 were more interested in blood and testosterone than in storytelling. For a movie that's partially about the power of a narrative and how certain tales endure over the time, this movie falls frustratingly short on these things. I wish they would have made this movie as a serious historical epic ala Gladiator, rather than something that plays as if it's the wet dream of a 15 year old boy who spends too much time indoors reading comic books and playing video games.Every single line of dialog in the movie is spoken wit the same tone and urgency as William Wallace's cry of 'Freedom!' at the end of Braveheart. Honor, fighting for a free Sparta, duty, never surrender, etc. When the fighting did commence, most of the battle scenes were filmed in slow motion. It was the kind of slow motion wherein the camera would focus on one particular part of the battle, and then whip over to another part of the battle which was also shown in slow motion. It's not dramatic, it doesn't draw out the tension of the scene, it's just really annoying. After a while I started watching the battle scenes with my finger firmly pressed down on the fast forward button. The slow motion got so annoying that I actually yelled at my TV at one point: 'Throw the damn spear already!' I was grateful when the movie was over.",2,2,3,20 August 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," don't call me junior
","I remember being so excited when this movie came out. My parents thought that the first two Indiana Jones movies were too violent for me so I never got to see them in the theater. But at 14 I was finally deemed old enough for Dr. Jones.At 14 I also remember, shall we say, youthful naivete about movie conventions. When Indy went over the cliff near the end, I thought that he was actually dead. Had I first seen this movie as an adult, I no doubt would have said to myself that he'd be climbing back up any moment.Last Crusade loses a little bit of its luster as an adult viewer. Although the interplay between Ford and Connery is often very funny, I'm not sure that the character or the story called for the added depth of the whole Spielberg estranged father thing. It feels a bit tacked on, as if Spielberg wanted it there just because that's his thing. It doesn't necessarily detract from the story, but I'm not sure if it needed to be there. Indiana Jones movies aren't really about depth of character. This is more of an observation than a criticism though. Last Crusade is still a wild and fun ride.",9,0,0,3 September 2006
