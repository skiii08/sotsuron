The Avengers," A true landmark in both the history of the superhero genre and film in general
","Back in 2008, before Nick Fury told Tony Stark that he wanted to talk about the 'Avengers Initiative' during the post-credits scene in 'Iron Man', no one had ever expected that Marvel Studios would be able to do a film adaptation of 'The Avengers'. Nothing like it had ever been done before... and yet, they made it work. They took their time, establishing its heroes in solo films in order for them to become endearing characters. And then, they came together for a superhero epic unlike any other at the time... Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers'.Whedon, known for his snappy dialogue and credibility in geek culture, gives this film so much in terms of humor and epic character moments that feel like they came straight out of the comics. It may be a large cast but Whedon gives each member of the main team (yes, even Hawkeye) enough to do within the context of the story. They work off each other extremely well, which results in some truly epic and in some cases hilarious moments (e.g. when Hulk completely decimates Loki).Now sure, admittedly the plot for this film is pretty darn basic; a bad guy tries to take over the world and the Avengers team up to stop him. It really isn't much more than that. And yet in this case, that's not that big of an issue. 'The Avengers' still stands as one of the most important films in the superhero genre. Not only was it a film that very much lived up to the hype that came from all of the build-up in previous films but it was pretty much the one that truly established Marvel Studios as the kings of the superhero genre.",10,0,3,12 September 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Nowadays it's forgotten but it's still worth checking out
","It's understandable why some might forget that the 2008 'reboot' of the 'Hulk' franchise is actually an MCU film, the second of Phase 1. First off, it was released the same year as 'Iron Man' and obviously didn't do as well as that film. But the main reason why the film isn't remembered much nowadays is because the film admittedly lacks much of a connection with the franchise now that Mark Ruffalo has taken over the role of Bruce Banner AKA 'The Hulk'. However, Edward Norton was a pretty good Banner prior to that. And whereas Ang Lee's 'Hulk' film was a bit too melodramatic, dark, and slow-paced, this film benefits from being more action-focused and a much lighter atmosphere. Sure that comes at the cost of the script (Norton and director Louis Leterrier were forced to cut a good chunk of scenes out (where's that director's cut?) under pressure not to be like the 2003 'Hulk') but with solid action sequences and an excellent lead performance, I do feel that 'The Incredible Hulk' is still a solid entry in the superhero genre. At the very least, I do prefer it over the 2003 'Hulk' film which, disclaimer, actually isn't 'that bad'.",8,1,2,7 July 2016
Iron Man 3," Perhaps the most under-appreciated film in the entire MCU
","Well, we all know the big deal behind 'Iron Man 3'. Fresh off 'The Avengers', the third installment of the 'Iron Man' trilogy helped kick off Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a big way, becoming the second MCU film to gross over one billion.However, it ended up attracting some major controversy due to its big bait-and-switch. Originally, we were led to believe that Ben Kingsley's character was the infamous terrorist 'The Mandarin'. However, as it turns out, he's nothing more than just a drunken British actor named Trevor Slattery while his employer, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), serves as the true villain of the film.This reveal attracted some major flak from comic fans for being a major deviation from the comics. And yet, I'd argue it actually worked from a story perspective. First of all, it's probably for the best that they didn't go the route of the comics and just have 'The Mandarin' because of the character's racist portrayal in the comics. Plus, Killian's villainous plot is steeped in modern day sensibilities regarding terrorism, making him one of the most layered villains in the MCU's library of generally maligned villains... and therefore, one of the franchise's best. The rest of the film is another enjoyable outing in the MCU with great action sequences and hilarious dialogue courtesy of director Shane Black. In a time when many argued the MCU limited the creative control of their directors, 'Iron Man 3' is one of the most unique entries in the genre (e.g. set at Christmas, a Shane Black trademark). It doesn't have much of the main hero in his suit but it allows for Tony Stark to utilize his other talents, proving that the suit does not make the man. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. gives one of the best performances he's ever done in the role of Tony Stark. In short, 'Iron Man 3' is definitely an underrated entry in the MCU. Simply put, the twist worked, people.",9,2,4,17 April 2017
Star Trek," A new 'Trek' for a new generation
","Long-time 'Trek' fans... hate the J.J. era 'Trek' films. But as for me, the J.J. films are very special to me. Prior to 2009, I knew jack about the 'Trek' franchise but was interested in seeing the new film once I heard that it got exceptional reviews. I watched it, loved it, I learned that my dad was a 'Trek' fan and upon numerous re-viewings, it became one of my all-time favorite films. Yes it pulled the controversial move of establishing an alternate universe and yes, the action-heavy tone is something that 'Trek' purists can't stand... but it all works. Thanks to J.J. Abrams' fantastic direction, the film establishes a terrific fast-paced and light- hearted atmosphere. And as for the whole 'alternate universe' thing, it allows the filmmakers to tell new stories with the franchise's classic characters without having to adhere to the series' canon. Even better is the film's outstanding ensemble cast. Simply put, the film makes sure to establish why every member of the crew is a valuable asset to the USS Enterprise. And it's all buoyed by fantastic performances from the two leads, Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk (my personal favorite Kirk) and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Heck, they even got the legendary Leonard Nimoy to return as older Spock, which is quite frankly one of the best 'cameos' of all- time. All of this comes together for an epic sci-fi masterpiece that is quite easily my favorite 'Trek' film.",10,1,3,7 July 2016
Iron Man 2," Simply put... not as bad as the internet puts it out to be.
","This film certainly must have been an anticipated one following the huge success of the first 'Iron Man'. And yet this is now commonly viewed as one of the weakest MCU films. Is it? Yeah kind of but it certainly isn't 'terrible'. Sure the film does suffer from a lack of focus and perhaps it tries a bit too hard to set up 'The Avengers' but it is still a pretty entertaining film throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is once again excellent as Tony Stark, even when the film makes Tony just a bit too damn arrogant. Admittedly the main villain, Whiplash, is a bit of a let-down, especially considering that he's played by Mickey Rourke, but Sam Rockwell makes up for it (for the most part) as the secondary villain, Justin Hammer. The action sequences are once again excellent, especially the finale, and the film once again maintains the MCU's trademark tone and atmosphere. In short, 'Iron Man 2' certainly isn't perfect and by no means 'better' than the first film. However, I will admit that when I first saw it, I actually did think it was better because I actually wasn't too big on the first film when I first saw it. Nowadays things have obviously changed but I still love 'Iron Man 2'. Good solid fun.",8,1,2,7 July 2016
The Hunger Games," Proved that 'The Hunger Games' could stand toe-to-toe with 'Harry Potter'
","I'll admit I laugh at the fact that every single 'Hunger Games' film released to date, when viewed on the IMDb mobile app, leads off with a negative user review. So to serve as a means of contrast with these negative reviews, here's a positive review of the first 'Hunger Games', directed by Gary Ross.Now I'll fully admit that this film did end up getting out-shined by its far superior sequel, 'Catching Fire'. But that doesn't mean that this film is as bad as some have put it out to be. Through Gary Ross' solid direction, the film does its job of establishing the universe of Panem and its characters and overall both the story and characters are well-written, especially when compared to other 'Young Adult' franchises like 'Twilight' and 'Divergent'. It also helps that the film has a terrific ensemble cast highlighted of course by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, who pretty much carries the film by herself, even in a film that also features names like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and Elizabeth Banks. A lot of criticism towards this film mainly revolves around the fast editing and shaky cam, primarily during the Games themselves. Personally it didn't really bother me but I understand where others are coming from. That was definitely one thing that the sequels did improve on. But even with that in mind, 'The Hunger Games' was a solid start to one of the few 'good' film franchises based off of a Young Adult oriented book series.",9,1,4,14 November 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," If loving this film is wrong, then I don't want to be right.
","I guess you can say that I'm committing Star Trek blasphemy by liking this film so much... so be it. This film is a highly underrated entry in the 'Star Trek' franchise, as it ended up being the catalyst for the severe backlash towards this film expressed by Trek purists that have always affected the J.J. era Trek films. Why? Because it had 'the nerve' to re-use the classic 'Trek' baddie, Khan Noonien Singh. And it worked! Sure there are some scenes that are lifted from 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' but the filmmakers do manage to spin new takes on them that are benefited by the strength of the new era 'Trek' cast. And contrary to popular belief, the film actually isn't a complete 'rehash' of 'Wrath of Khan'. I mean if the film was about Khan trying to acquire a special missile that could give life to dead planets and destroy all life on a living planet... then maybe I'd be more susceptible to pull the 'ripoff' card. But that's not the case here whatsoever. J.J.'s direction is once again superb, the cast is fantastic, and the film maintains the previous film's great action-packed pace and light-hearted tone. Trek purists say that this isn't the way to go for 'Star Trek'. But as for me, this is very much my kind of 'Star Trek'.",10,2,7,7 July 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," It's easy to see why this is commonly regarded as one of the most popular MCU films to date.
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a film that needs no introduction. What directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who, might I add, were originally known for their work on comedies before they were hired to direct this) managed to accomplish with this film is quite impressive. Simply put, they managed to give us one of the most tightly-scripted outings of the MCU with a story that pays homage to classic 70's spy thrillers while also addressing Captain America's jump from the simpler days of World War II to the morally grey ordeals of the modern world. And it's all tied to one of the MCU's greatest twists that takes the franchise in a completely new direction. The action sequences are incredible and Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson, and Samuel L. Jackson shine in arguably their greatest turns as Cap, Black Widow, and Nick Fury, respectively.Now with that said, admittedly I wouldn't call this one my absolute favorite MCU film to date. Still, I very much appreciate this film for everything that it did for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For one thing, it helped revitalize the franchise after the admittedly rocky year that it had in 2013 as evident from the polarizing 'Iron Man 3' and the not-so-popular 'Thor: The Dark World'. Plus, its iconic twist allowed Marvel Studios' first TV series, 'Agents of SHIELD', to finally find its groove after a rocky start. Thus, it may not be my #1 favorite, but it's certainly in the Top 5.",10,0,0,20 November 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Probably the most underrated of MCU's Phase 1
","As Screen Junkies noted in their Honest Trailer for 'The Avengers', Captain America was 'no one's favorite hero'. However, I'd argue that his first MCU film, 'Captain America: The First Avenger' is one of the best of Phase 1 up there with the first 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers'. After the disastrous adaptation of the character in 1990 that was never released in theaters, this film does a fantastic job in telling the origin story of Captain America. Chris Evans, in his second major Marvel role, very much shines in the role of Cap, immediately establishing himself as a humble and likable superhero. But he's also backed by one of the best 'ensembles' to ever grace an MCU film; Hayley Atwell as Cap's love interest Peggy Carter, who of course would end up starring in her own TV series a few years later, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips, Sebastian Stan as Cap's loyal pal Bucky Barnes, and of course Hugo Weaving as one of the best MCU villains to date as the Red Skull.This is very much an old-school summer blockbuster with the modern tricks. The period design is excellent, showcasing director Joe Johnston's talents for period pieces, and I won't lie; the ending in which Cap 'sacrifices himself' by crashing the plane into the arctic, unaware he would only end up getting revived decades later, is quite emotional. 4 words... 'I had a date'And that's why 'First Avenger' is one of my favorite MCU films. It's well-directed, terrifically acted all around, and I'd argue it succeeds in making its main protagonist one of the best characters in the MCU to date.",10,1,3,12 September 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," How Marvel Studios' biggest gamble turned out to be one of its most beloved outings.
","When Marvel Studios first announced that they would be making a film based on the Guardians of the Galaxy, most people reacted the same way that the character Korath does in the film when told about Peter Quill's nickname of Star-lord... 'Who?' Yes, the Guardians of the Galaxy were such an obscure group back then that I bet even some hardcore comic book fans were unfamiliar with them at the time. But nowadays, EVERYONE knows who the Guardians are and that's thanks to writer/director James Gunn's phenomenal efforts in crafting a super fun entry in the superhero genre.'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most lavish visuals, and they are paired with some solid action sequences. And like any great MCU film, the screenplay is full of great bits of humorous dialogue, some of which even push the boundaries for a family-friendly MCU film released under the Disney banner (e.g. the Jackson Pollack joke; need I say more?). But amidst all of that, the film also boasts plenty of heart. You will become emotionally attached to a group of 'outlaws' that consist of a dance-loving human scavenger, a green-skinned alien assassin, a violence-happy warrior who doesn't understand metaphors all that well, a talking raccoon with a short temper, and a good-natured tree creature who can only say three words. So thanks to this, along with some great emotional poignancy, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1' proved that Marvel Studios was more than capable of producing high-quality feature films based around lesser-known characters.",10,1,2,27 February 2018
Beauty and the Beast," A charming new take on a beloved classic.
","Well, most of the user reviews that I've seen on here for this film are mixed-to-negative so I decided to give it a positive review for a change of pace.Let me be clear; this isn't going to replace the original film. The original 'Beauty and the Beast' is still very much the masterpiece that made it the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. Clearly, there were a lot of expectations towards this new film because of that prestigious pedigree. And, clearly, it was one of the riskiest ventures of Disney's recent run of live-action remakes. And because this film is probably the closest to its original out of all the Disney remakes so far, the term 'unnecessary' is being thrown around a lot. Maybe it is, but that doesn't really bother me in the slightest.Yes, this film has almost the exact same plot as its predecessor, but at the same time, there are some minor touches here and there that at least help it to differentiate itself from the original. At the very least, it's not a 100% carbon copy of what we saw before. Plus, the film is undeniably well-made with gorgeous visuals and an equally gorgeous production design. The classic songs are handled excellently in live-action, the new songs are great additions, and the film's impressively stacked ensemble cast is fantastic.In short, I know that there are people out there who aren't too big on the remakes. That's fine; no one's forcing you to watch them. But, at the same time, these new films are not negatively impacting their original sources to the high levels that those who oppose them claim they are. At worst, they'd just end up being a mediocre remake that just makes their original counterpart even better by comparison. And yet, that hasn't been the case with most of the recent Disney remakes. They don't replace their original sources; they just serve as a nice little complement to them. This new take on 'Beauty and the Beast' is no exception. So, with that in mind, ignore all the negativity surrounding this film (particularly the completely overblown backlash towards a new aspect of the film that is so subtle, you probably wouldn't have noticed it if everyone hadn't made such a big deal about it) and just enjoy a heartwarming new take on one of Disney's most beloved stories.",10,8,20,22 March 2017
Thor," Marvel's first big 'risk' project turned out well in their favor
","This was arguably Marvel Studios' first big 'risk' project. There was a major possibility that this film could've ended up being an extremely cheesy and laughable affair. And yet that's not what happened. Under the direction of Kenneth Branagh, known for his many adaptations of Shakespeare plays, the film does carry a solid atmosphere with strong Shakespearean themes which help keep the film from being too campy. Chris Hemsworth shines in the role of Thor as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother (and the film's main villain) Loki, though the latter would truly start to stand-out in future MCU films. Some may take issue with the film primarily taking place on Earth but I think it works out pretty well. We see Thor struggle to adapt to human life while also becoming more of a noble hero, which is a pretty great arc for the character. And as for the film's use of humor, I actually think it worked pretty well too, at least when it came to how Thor goes about while on Earth (e.g. 'This drink. I like it... Another!! (*smashes glass*)). It may not be the absolute best of the MCU but I still think very fondly of this film and it once again proved that Marvel could make quality films centered around 'B-level' characters.",8,1,3,8 July 2016
Iron Man," The amazing beginning of a Cinematic Universe
","In 2008, the term 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' was unknown. Nowadays, the MCU is the biggest franchise in the film industry and rightfully so as Marvel Studios has consistently delivered quality superhero films time and time again. Many of which have featured characters that no one ever expected to become superhero icons. First off was 'Iron Man', directed by Jon Favreau. The MCU has definitely come a long way since then but this still stands as one of the franchise's finest efforts. Robert Downey Jr., in what would become his career comeback role, is perfectly cast as Tony Stark AKA 'Iron Man' and is backed by an excellent supporting cast. And the film gives him an excellent origin story that is actually fairly contained compared to future films in the franchise. And of course, it all ends with the first of what would become a trademark of the franchise; the post-credit scene. In this case, it's Samuel L. Jackson talking to Tony about the 'Avengers Initiative'. And that's how the MCU all got started.",10,0,1,7 July 2016
Thor: The Dark World," It may be one of the weaker MCU films but it's still enjoyable
","I've always argued that there's yet to be a 'bad' MCU film. Have there been weak ones? Sure! But, at the very least, the weakest entries still have things about them that make them worthwhile. 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the prime examples of this. However, it still has just enough in it to make it an enjoyable enough minor outing in the MCU.In some ways, this film actually improves upon its predecessor. More time is spent in the Nine Realms than on Earth and the visual effects and action sequences are both improved upon. Plus, any scene between Thor and Loki is a major highlight.However, as far as what happens in it, it doesn't really contribute much to the overall lore of the MCU aside from a few twist reveals. Also, it, unfortunately, has the weakest villain in the entire MCU in the form of Malekith. Christopher Eccleston is sadly wasted in the role, restricted by makeup and an elvish language. Despite what it may seem, he proves to be a lackluster threat for Thor and company to deal with. Clearly, the increased screen time of fan-favorite Loki affected Malekith's role in the story.Like 'Iron Man 2', this is clearly one of the MCU films that was most affected by the infamous creative committee, and in some cases, it does show. But 'terrible'? Absolutely not. I will say, though, that this one doesn't really warrant as many re-watches as some of the other MCU films.",8,1,2,17 April 2017
