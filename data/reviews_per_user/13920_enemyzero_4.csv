Marie Antoinette," Nothing happens in this entire movie.
","Nothing happens in this entire movie. I had really high hopes for this, but half way through it I was trying to slice my wrists with the DVD remote. This movie dragged on for two hours and 3 minutes with only about 20 minutes of story. There was absolutely no character development, at all. If the characters did change at all it was only to fit a certain scene with absolutely no explanation as to why. When I put this movie in I had hoped for some twisted story of the French revolution and a royal b!tch losing her head. Instead my eyes were assaulted by some sh!t that was so stupid and over done only some teen age girl who just watched back to back marathons of 'My Super Sweet Sixteen' and 'Laguna Beach' would find it the least bit interesting.E-Rokk http://heystupid.wordpress.com/",Null,2,3,25 February 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Begins With A Bang
","This movie is damn good, but doubt it will ever reach the iconic status of Burton's first batman. Batman Returns was a decent film, but i didn't really like what Burton did with the Penguin, everybody has their own opinion on this, and i have found this is actually the most debated of the four previous Batman's. Batman forever, what can you say about this film. Val Kilmer is such a good actor, but was just a bad choice for a Batman film, I believe this is also the first film in which the bat suit had nipples. The Batmobile was really dumb in this, Burton lost control of the series and Schumacher decided he was going to try and return Batman to its 60's campiness, yet through all this it still had the two best villains behind Jack's Joker. Not only were Twoface and the Riddler great characters to use, but the casting was perfect. Which brings me to Batman and Robin. Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, and Alicia Silverstone should all be taken out and burned alive for this disgrace. Between bad casting, bad writing, and a horrible, warped version of Gotham, you end up with more of a bad acid trip and black lights than a Batman flick. Don't get me wrong, i like Clooney, and he does some really good films, but he just couldn't nail Batman. I think he was fine as Bruce Wayne, not as good as Michael Keaton, but still pretty good.At the end of my review, all i can say is i seriously hope that in the next Batman movie they don't ruin the Joker.",8,0,2,30 October 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," This movie gives me high hopes for Will Farrell.
","This movie gives me high hopes for Will Farrell. Especially after watching Talladega Nights and worrying that maybe it was just the rest of the cast in Anchorman and Old School that made them funny. While I would never say this movie was a comedy, in fact the moviegoer has the same feeling as the main character wondering if it is a comedy or a tragedy, either way I thought it was great. Farrell's performance was executed wonderfully, the characters were all very strong, and the entire film was filled with little details that if you paid attention to them made the whole experience better. Definitely one I recommend you check out.http://heystupid.wordpress.com",9,0,0,25 February 2008
Fantastic Four," Just Fantastic
","I would like to start out by saying, I went in to this movie with the biggest doubts I have ever had, not only because of the horrible movie released in 1994, but because lately Marvels movies have been slipping. I hated Daredevil, Electra and Hulk, I hated Hulk more than anything on Earth.Any way, within the first ten minutes my doubts were destroyed. This movie was more than 'Fantastic'. The casting in this movie was very well done, most of the CGI was great, and the inside jokes that were made between the characters helped to make this more of a movie for comic book fans than just another action movie for 'the normals'. The relationship between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm was almost right out of the pages of the comic, and the interaction between Reed Richards and Sue Storm was well developed as well.I felt Doom could have stood to be a little more intimidating, but Julian McMahon still did a terrific job. My other gripes are that the CGI used for Reed Richards seemed rushed and looked way to fake. Everything else in this movie looked so good that if you opened your mind to the realm of comic books it was believable, yet Reed's arm, especially in the scene where he reaches under the door, just looks dumb. My other complaint was that it was nothing more than an origin story. Both Spiderman and X-Men had character origins, but they fit in so much more, but this movie was all origin with a small fight at the end. Honestly, it seemed that they still had some fleshing out to do and may drag the origin into the second film.At any rate, this film was very good and joins Spiderman X- Men and the Punisher in the plus column of Marvel films for me.",7,3,6,30 October 2005
