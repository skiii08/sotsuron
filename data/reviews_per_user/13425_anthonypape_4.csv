The Avengers," I knew it couldn't live up to the rating
","I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.",6,16,33,2 June 2013
Prometheus," Much better than some would have you believe..
","Like many people, I had seen the trailers for this movie and also knew it was by Ridley Scott who was responsible for the original Alien movie and that it was loosely a prequel. Naturally I had high expectations, but after visiting this site and seeing so many recent negative reviews, that changed and I was set up for a disappointing movie. Despite this, a part of me held some hope that surely the movie couldn't be as bad as many have reviewed - this is after all a Ridley Scott sci-fi film, and one can usually expect a degree of quality. I'll get straight to the point - this was in no way a disappointing or poor movie. I'm not sure why so many on here say otherwise - perhaps because a strongly negative review can be more dramatic or grab your attention? or perhaps they were expecting something along the lines of some of the other Alien movies (ie: fully formed aliens on the loose and big battles between them and marines or whoever else).While Prometheus can't help but be a prequel of sorts, it should not be viewed with an expectation of the same kind of action sequences in the Alien movies, even though there is plenty of action to keep the viewer happy, some of which is just as violent and gory as anything seen in those other films. Prometheus then, is not like Aliens or the films that followed. It is very much closer to the original Alien and the whole feel and style of the film is similar as you'd expect from Ridley. I don't think any genuine sci-fi fan would be disappointed with this movie - there is the right combination of action and intelligent story writing - some of the sub-stories are quite deep, particularly involving the android character. OK, so this movie is not perfect.. the actions of some of the crew (most of them actually) can be quite foolish and gung-ho considering they are on an alien world with all the potential risks involved - but who knows? perhaps IQs take a serious dip in the future, or reliance on virtual experiences has made the human race so complacent with regards to danger? There is always an answer to most flaws you could pick - I'm sure Ridley could explain far better and knew what he was doing. The bottom line is, if you've seen the trailer and like what you saw or think this could be your kind of film then go watch it yourself and form your own opinion. Don't be put off by the negative reviews - this truly is a very interesting, enjoyable film, much more than just another dumb aliens vs the humans free for all.",8,3,6,18 November 2012
Cloud Atlas," An over-hyped and simply not enjoyable ride
","Like many I guess I'd seen the trailers and the actors involved with this movie and concluded it was worth a look despite some mixed reviews. These days its a given that a big budget film is going to look good and this is no exception - the sets are authentic and any cgi blends in very well. That isn't the problem with Cloud Atlas.. neither is the acting which considering the multiple characters being played by any one actor and heavy make up involved is perfectly fine. What ultimately detracts from what is a great 'looking' film then, is the crucial thing that makes a film - the story. Without giving any plot details away, the story is actually a series of stories in different times throughout the ages which are somehow linked to each other.. The trouble is some of these stories are, to be blunt, a bit dull or simply average and the big message the film is trying to get across is typically vague spiritual nonsense. To be honest, as visually impressive and unique in style that it is, the film is simply not very satisfying to watch. As some others have summed up well, its a case of 'the emperor's new clothes' Lot of people seeing something that isn't there.",4,3,6,4 July 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Could have been so much better..
","The trouble with this movie is that it feels like it was originally intended as a straight ahead horror movie(albeit with dumb clich√©d characters), but at some point the makers decided to change it to a spoof style. Either that, or they have done a very poor job of making a spoof movie. Even the trailer doesn't make it clear the style this movie really is, which is sure to leave viewers disappointed when they discover what it actually is. Its really not clear, until quite well into the film, when the first 'spoof' moment occurs, instantly leaving you thinking 'what the..? oh great, its one of those oh so funny spoof movies..' Whatever they've done, it doesn't work - there's no consistency in the style here, and when the 'spoof' moments occur they feel out of place, like an afterthought, added on later. Its a shame, because underneath this mishmash of styles is actually a very good story with an original twist on the horror genre. This could have been genuinely scary and clever like the Saw series (which BTW, there are echo's of here at points) but instead in ventures into silly territory. What a shame..",5,0,2,5 July 2013
