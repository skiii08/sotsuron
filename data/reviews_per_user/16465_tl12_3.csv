The King's Speech," The King's (and my) Speech
","As a stutterer myself I have to say that I was mesmerized by the film. Some of the hateful reviews I have seen are reminiscent of the ignorant children and adults that have taunted me.The development of stuttering is accurately betrayed. I can not speak to the speech therapy techniques as I have never been involved with the one shown.As a movie, without regard to stuttering, it was thoughtful, engaging and captivating. I like action moves but those who rate this film low because there is just talking, frighten me. If we can no longer talk as a people and be engaged by non-violent media, we are in as much danger as we were in WWII.",10,0,0,15 May 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Why is there no dubbed version
","I gave this film a 6 because I have to have someone read the subtitles for me. There is some kind of incredible snobbery about not having a dubbed version of this (or any other foreign language movie). Those who believe that way do so because they believe it will destroy the artistic integrity of a movie to provide a dubbed version. They also have been blessed with good eyesight so they can read the subtitles. As for the millions of people with poor eyesight, such as myself, we just don't count to them.I made the error of asking about a dubbed version of this film on Amazon and got killed with hateful responses. Why can't those with a disability enjoy the film as well? No one is asking the non-seeing impaired to watch the dubbed version.",Null,0,4,13 September 2011
X-Men: First Class," Nope, not unless you rewrite history
","Was WWII started by Canada? It probably was in this What?-Men series. Many old graphic novels have gone through a 'reboot' but none that I know of totally abandoned the original story with such absolute disrespect.This a a total abandonment of the original X-Men story/ies. At the least it could have been an alternate world X-Men story. Unfortunately it seems Marvel has failed to see the wisdom in the DC Batman reboot that still kept the roots of the original story and updated it with two of the best graphic novel movie adaptations that have been made.I do not care about the people in this story because I do not know them and there is not enough background to get me to care about these unknown or totally changed characters. Does this make me a HATER as earlier posters have said. NO, rather it makes me a lover of fully fleshed out characters. If you want to make a story about brand new characters then don't try to sucker a loyal audience that knows the X-Men and their history and try to pawn it off as the 'ORIGINAL' X-men. We have more intelligence than that and more love for the real story.By the way did you know that Superman originally came from Scranton, PA and Spiderman got his ability because he sat in some spider droppings? Watch for these movies next in the Orwellian world that rewrites the history of all things.",3,2,5,12 September 2011
