Minority Report," REALLY....BAD!!!
","I am 13 and I love romantic all the way to thriller,shoot em' up,blow him up kind of movies. Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Cruise in his movies like:Mission Impossible,Top Gun. But, this movie was praised too much from the box office and critics.It was NOT that great of a movie and it was not uplifting at all. You kinda' leave the movie with a gross feeling.It is worth renting and seeing once,But I don't think I'd EVER buy it or even watch it again.",1,4,8,17 October 2002
Men in Black II," Ughh!!!!
","I just waisted exactly 88 minutes of my life watching a way...STUPID movie, and just waisted my money, when I could have saved it for something that would benefit me not somethin' you  have to be tortured by.I loved Men IN Black 1 but I HATED Men In Black 2! I would not waist my time or money to watch it EVER, EVER again!",1,2,4,17 October 2002
