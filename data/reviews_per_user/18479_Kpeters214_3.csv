Casablanca," A movie that can not be remade today.
","Conflicted hero; beautiful woman; ultimate 'bad guys' (made worse by History's lessons); cast of colorful supporting characters; memorable dialogue lines; redemption of human condition.Absolutely the best film ever made.And would be unable to be remade today. Warner Bros attempted to remake it with 'Passage to Marseilles' (even used many of same cast), but by then the USA was 3+ years into WW2, and reality had brought to homes the true horror of the War to too many families.",10,1,2,26 January 2020
Interstellar," Good SciFi thoughtful
","While overall this movie is thought provoking about survival of the human race, from a technical standpoint this movie is about 1/2 hour too long, and the music soundtrack is overbearing at times and makes spoken dialogue difficult to understand.",8,0,1,25 August 2019
Pearl Harbor," Historically Inaccurate or Hysterically Romantic
","This movie is a cross between 'Tora Tora Tora' and 'From Here to Eternity', both of which are much better movies than this movie. Don't waste your time with it.",3,2,6,10 August 2019
