Casablanca," A great Classic
","I usually don't like to see very old movies like this onebecause generally they don't live to their hype, but this is notthe case, in fact I'm so sorry that I waited so long to discoverthis masterpiece. I especially find it amazing that  it was madein the middle of WWII and was not propagandistic ( well it nighthave been a little but nit much) It truly deserves",10,1,1,17 January 2000
The 13th Warrior," Good Viking Movie
","I think this movie has a good story; it truly feels like you aretransported to an ancient time, with all of th northmenmythology. I specially like the civilized arab who transforms himself andat the end admires the vikings. Its kinda hard to believe that there where caveman living in the10th century and that they were futuristic armor for the timeperiod but after all its fiction and I really liked it, thatswhat",8,0,0,16 January 2000
The Usual Suspects," Deserves to be in top 10
","I think this movie is excellent, it's one of my 10 favorite movies of all time. I will not spoil anything but, the ending caught me by complete surprise.And made me think, ahh it was so obvious but I've never would've guessed right. A very clever movie. 10/10",10,0,1,5 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Best movie of 1998
","This movie is an instant classic. I loved it, it shows WWII in a very real way. It doesn't mention the atrocities of Hitler because they are already showed in so many movies, instead it show the atrocities of war. The first minutes of the movie are the most stunning that I've ever seen specially because its based on real events. This movie show the soldiers of both bands ( allies and germans ) as human beings , this is refreshing because most war movies pictures one side as pure evil. and the other side as the good guys, Specially WWII movies but this movie shows that not all german soldiers were jew-hating Hitler-loving killing machines with no soul.  I liked Shakespeare in Love but I think this movie should've won the oscar. It has everything you want in a movie, good acting, good story and good special effects. The main characters are well-developed and you feel you know them. If you ever cry at movies you will cry.I would recommend it to anyone except children",10,0,1,10 August 1999
Rules of Engagement," Good acting- Bad Plot
","I think that this movie had many things that could've made for a Great movie: Great actors, good theme (A US military Blunder). But then goes for an unexpected twist they try to justify a massacre, this is bull****, Situations like this happen very often by other countries (including mine) and the US is the first to demand Justice to be made to the victims. Here they try to justify the Marines by saying that their life ( the life of marines) is more valuable than dozens of foreigners.  I think this movie would not be liked by anyone who is not an army-loving US Citizen",6,0,1,19 December 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Perfect movie
","I am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the best movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the determination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his escape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks and Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is bad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw I see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are, but that's the point.",10,1,3,5 March 1999
The Truman Show," One of the top 10 movies ever
","I was surprised when I saw this movie, I didn't know Jim Carrey could be such a great actor. I think the movie is the only one that has a shot of beating SPR at the oscars. By seeing all the comments written here you can see that this is a movie that makes you think, and it was a mix of a really artistic movie with a blokbuster movie. I give it a 10",10,0,0,5 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the trilogy
","I like this one because it has the best plot of the three. I specially like that since its the second of a trilogy it has a dark ending. This movie develops the relationships between the characters very well. And like all SW movies it has great Special Effects, that is amazing after almost 2 decades. The introduction of well known characters (Bobba Fett and Yoda) and many other things that are already mentioned in many comments make this one a must-see for anyone who hasn't seen it",10,0,0,10 August 1999
