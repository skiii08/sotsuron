Ford v Ferrari," 'Look out there. Out there is the perfect lap. You see it?'
","With a gripping story, interesting characters, AAA acting, pitch perfect sound design and some of the most visceral racing action put to screen, FORD V FERRARI is an incredibly well oiled machine!",9,1,1,23 November 2019
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman is a sheer joy.
","Although lacking a little in excitement, this war drama is has impeccable direction, hugely engaging dialogue and cements Gary Oldman as one of the greatest actors working today. His performance as Winston Chuchill is nothing short of outstanding and well worth the ticket price alone!",8,1,5,14 January 2018
Captain Marvel," 'You're not from around here.'
","Criminally underdeveloped characters, hugely incoherent first act and its biggest problem...? Captain Marvel herself. This has all the trademark Marvel touches.. its energetic, fun and rammed with plenty of humour... however none of which comes from it's lead actress, who seems to lack any kind of emotion or personality. CAPTAIN MARVEL feels very much like a placeholder until END GAME and is the perfect example of a rather average film.",6,6,9,12 March 2019
Us," 'If you wanna get crazy, we can get crazy!'
","Powerful performances by all, atmospheric, strong direction and beautiful to look at but where this film falls down is in its story. There are far too many unexplained threads and its left feeling like an over ambitious draft with countless ideas but without any real answers...",5,0,1,31 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A dark comedy against an absorbing drama.
","If I can compliment a film with at least 5 adjectives, more than likely it's etched in my membrane, there to be championed to as many folks as possible who are willing to listen.Any film worth remembering provokes a mixture of emotions out of you; laughs, cries, interest, shock, awe. And any film that has a strong or unique story with equally unique characters, should resonate with you in a way that's either self-reflective or empathetic or ideally both.Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's latest offering is such a film. Ever since the red band trailer dropped some months ago, I was already psyched. Three Billboards managed the impressive feat of having a range of responses from me, from nervous laughter to unexpectedly crying to consistent intrigue. I was mesmerised by the bold, profane and at times delicate script as we're given a host of characters that are either unruly or difficult but remained sympathetic and captivating all the same.We see Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) driving down Drinkwater road one afternoon and she spots three unused billboards that hasn't been used in many years (a fine little detail we see is one of the billboards says 'worth stopping for'). She sits fidgeting for a bit, contemplating on what they could be used for. She heads down to the Ebbing advertising company ran by Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) to negotiate the terms on how to advertise and how much it is to advertise the billboards. She intends to use them for at least a year and for what she intends the billboards to say, Red is quickly sympathetic to her cause by saying 'you must be Angela Hayes' mother'.Angela Hayes is the recently slain daughter of Mildred. Some 7 months prior she was kidnapped, raped and burnt beyond recognition with no new developments on the case. Unsatisfied with this motion, the billboards say the following; RAPED WHILE DYING, STILL NO ARRESTS, HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?. From then on in She wages a one-woman war against the local police department by calling them for them seeming incompetence of their service. This doesn't sit well with the rest of the community as Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is much revered by everyone.Something noticeable throughout Mcdonagh's work is with all the cynicism and venom characters spew at one another, we have the vulnerability and depravity revealed in sometimes small doses but they never feel forced. It's not a mechanic used to force us to care about people, it's welcome in that they deal with their tragedy or luck with humour that's brash and twisted that enables them to push through their dilemma.The townsfolk of Ebbing had me caring for just about everyone, including the ones opposing against Mildred. There's no clear-cut villain here (other than the scumbag or scumbags who tortured and murdered Angela). We're shown how vengeance, rage and glee can evolve into something rather dis-compassionate. How sometimes dialling back and seeing the future of your rightful cause for inflicting your sense of justice can further down the line turn into you something dangerous and inaccessible for infamous reasons.Veteran talent like Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges and Abbie Cornish all shine here but Sam Rockwell's turn as the dimwitted, inconsiderate but disarmingly endearing Dixon is a plum role that deserves Best Supporting Actor recognition.
The showcase here is by far McDormand's volcanic, bad ass Mildred. She exhibits such humanity, drive and sardonic wit that her means of venting out and search for closure invites a whirlwind of frustration and anxiety amongst everyone around her. She's working on peak power, one that undoubtedly will score her an Oscar nomination. It's extraordinary work.Mildred is the strongest, most empowering character I've seen in a long time. Her arc serves to address how we all just need to step back and contemplate on why we feed the fire with fire. Even the smaller characters are well rounded enough in how they propose alternatives and insight to the more flawed characters. Mcdonagh never misses an opportunity to show us fire or red or some kind of tension. We're asked to recognise the potential of our anger and offset it with something more serene and responsible, a morality tale that asks us to be constructive, not destructive.This film is grim, twisted, devastating, unpredictable, inspiring, bold and of course funny. I'm sore I didn't see this in 2017 as it would've toppled Dunkirk as my fave of that year. Alas, it's 2018 and even though it's the first film I've seen this year, I'm positive nothing this year will dethrone Three Billboards as my fave of the year.Striking, wicked and brilliantly acted, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has raw power that's balanced with clever wit which makes for a rewarding and unpredictable experience.",9,3,5,14 January 2018
Justice League," Is this Just Amazing? JustNICE or JustCrap?
","This right here is the 5th movie in the DC extended universe and by now you'd think they'd gotten pretty good at making them, especially with the same fella directing over half of them? Well Not really.The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion. The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet, he must collect some infinity stones artifacts to help him start the end of time (or something like that).If a story really is a movies backbone then Justice league is disabled.Characters are most certainly Justice Leagues strong point and as a huge fan of these comic book heroes it was exciting to watch Bruce, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg and Superman all meet up and interactive with each other. The chemistry between the main crew is fantastic and I personally would have loved to have seen more moments like this.Affleck, Gadot and Cavill (even with his weird CGI top lip) play their roles excellently and the newbies Ezra Miller (The Flash). Jason Momoa (Aquaman) & Ray Fisher (Cyborg) all do a fine job of bringing their characters to life. Ezra Miller adds a lot of humour to proceedings, even if some jokes fall a little flat) and Jason Momoa portrayal of Aquaman goes swimmingly. The only character I'm not a fan of is Ray Fisher's Cyborg. This isn't his fault, in fact his acting is quite possibly the most impressive of all, however his character is very generic and feels very much like a knock off Iron-man.One of the films biggest issues is it's runtime. A studio imposed time restraint of 2 hours would have been a huge crucifix on Zack Snyder and then his replacement Joss Whedon considering just how much they had to cram into this film. Not only did it have to deal with the repercussions of Batman v Superman but also introduce many new characters and bring with it a powerful new threat. The movie jumps from one scene to the next and the audience is at real risk of getting dizzy. Its all very messy and cumbersome, some scenes could be stand-alone youtube videos with little to connect them to the following scenes The final chapter could have been shot for any other DC movie and then just bolted to the end.Then we come to the films main villain One of THE worst villains I have ever seen. Steppenwolf (I had to google his name as I couldn't for the life of me remember) is entirely CGI and has no real presence. Muttering words like 'no protectors here, this world will fall..blaah blah blah' is as shallow and uninspiring as they come. Apparently as a dedicated comic book reader his motivations would be a more clear but to me I had no idea what his problem was and this just highlights how little I cared about the main story.The action in the film is decent enough and there are some stand out moments that made the nerd in me cry in delight, however so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds and almost video game like character moments pulled me out of the moment more often than I'd have liked.Justice League feels like a cake that was made without all its ingredients and not left in the oven long enough. DC should have taken more time to establish its characters first before throwing them all into the same pot. Overall it was much better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road. A handful of nerd porn moments elevated this film out of the shitter and the chemistry between the characters was a joy to watch. It is a flawed piece of entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues but I had fun",6,1,3,21 November 2017
Aladdin," 'If you don't have anything, you have to act like you own everything.'
","With insanely catchy songs, incredible sets and costumes and some very strong performances (most notably Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine who is fantastic!) ALADDIN is one jump ahead when it comes to live-action remakes. It's not quite a whole new world but its damn good fun!!!",9,0,3,27 May 2019
Black Panther," Get your claws into this!
","Firstly I've got to hand it to Marvel. They have not only created one of the most impressive shared universes ever established in cinema history but they consistently keep bringing quality movies to the masses year after year. Not all have been earth shattering masterpieces but almost all have been of above average quality and always entertaining. Without beating around the bush, Black Panther is yet another great addition to this shared Marvel universe and has just enough character and style of its own to make it stand out from the others. The element of Black Panther I absolutely loved was the overarching story and the motivations behind all the characters. Never have I been more closely connected with each and every character in a Marvel film as I did in this one. To fully understand why they were doing what they were doing and what was driving them. Refreshingly even the main villain had a genuine reason for his actions and at times even made me question why I was so against him and routing for the other guys. This mash-up of motives and emotions really set Black panther apart from the rest. Not only that but the acting is of some of the highest quality there is. Stand out performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. This guy just demanded your attention and completely owned every scene he was in. He balanced the dislike you felt for him perfectly and I found myself flitting from hatred to understanding numerous times throughout, by far one of my favourite villains in a Marvel film in a long time. Chadwick Boseman returns as the main protagonist after we first met him in 2016's Captain America Civil War and I was excited to see him again, although his performance didn't blow me away and he seemed to lack that special something that I get from the other MCU players. Now I mentioned I loved the story and the message it brings with it however I did feel the plot itself was quite predictable and clichÃ©, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect to happen, happens. As great as the special effects are and as fun as some of the character scenes are, nothing is very memorable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the entire film that made me sit forward in my seat or really get my pulse going. To put it in context, I got that tingly excitement within the run time of the latest infinity war trailer, but not once through the 2h 14min runtime of Black Panther. As mentioned in a few other Marvel origin stories, the lack of emotion from me as a viewer is possibly linked to the fact we already know T'Challa (Black Panther) will appear in the next movie and is likely to get a number of sequels of his own... No amount of death fake outs will have that emotional tug on me the creators are so desperately trying to make me feel. This is perhaps something impossible to avoid when you have a universe such as this but it undoubtedly takes away any kind of worry you may have for the main superhero. One element the movie excels in is in its special effects. The majority of the film takes place in the fiction city of Wakanda and its mighty impressive, with its own unique mash-up of a technically advanced civilisation that still holds onto its ancient culture. The costumes, makeup, and excellent original soundtrack is something to behold. So as the plot plays out rather passively with little in the shape of memorable moments, Black Panther does bring with it a wonderful message of a world coming together and touches on a number of things that are quite prominent in today's current political climate. Marvel should be applauded for bringing together such a rich and diverse cast and creating a wonderfully unique world within its ever expanding universe. It expertly manages to establish the soul of T'Challa, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, and sets him up perfectly going into Avengers Infinity War.",7,2,17,15 February 2018
Her," What a film!
","This is an incredibly intimate exploration into the human consciences and the emotional journey of the mind. HER is so well acted and directed you quickly begin to feel as if you're one of the many spiritual and spiralling connections within the films narrative. Its unique, beautifully written and quietly extraordinary.",9,0,0,28 June 2019
