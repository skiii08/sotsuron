Requiem for a Dream," A complete waste of time disguised as 'art'
","Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap 'Pi', Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to 'A Clockwork Orange' are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.Basically, rather like some other inexplicably popular movies, such as 'Boogie Nights', this movie is akin to being stuck in a room full of crackheads for two hours, and we're supposed to find it not only interesting, but tragic. Sorry, but no go. I care not one whit for any of the characters in this movie, and wish they'd all just go away.For me, this is the filmic equivalent of one of those books you get so mad at, that you just want to throw it across the room.",1,58,110,2 September 2001
