Alien 3," Good sci-fi movie
","Warning: possible spoilerAlien3 is a good movie, but could have been much better!I can´t understand why so many scenes were deleted.  I strongly support the idea of releasing a special edition of this movie. If Fox did it with Cameron´s Aliens, why not with Alien3, considering that  the missing scenes will improve a lot the movie adding more action and suspense that a lot people missed from the predecesors.As for the continuity between Aliens and Alien3, I also complained when I first saw Alien3 about how the heck a facehugger went into the ship in the conclusion of Aliens, and also how the facehugger does Ripley and the dog in the sequel. Well, the only possible answer is that the Queen in Aliens, took two eggs and left then inside the ship. It is the only way.To support this, I say that through all the series the aliens have showed that they are VERY intelligent, so the Queen in Aliens sure thought, 'If you kill me, you won't kill the species, I´ll leave you a little present', and left the eggs in the Sulaco before nailing Bishop! Otherwise to this explanation...there is no explanation.So, Alien3 is not a bad movie, it is dark, has suspense, manages very well the Ripley character and the no-escape situation with the alien around, and like all good sci-fi films, it shows us in a convincing way a possible and controversial future of humanity.Anyway, the story deserved a better treatment, hope someday we can view the complete movie, as it was intended to be. 7 out of 10.",7,0,3,16 April 2000
Gravity," Visual and Technical Masterpiece
","At last, Hollywood gives us a very good space movie, since a long time ago. I won't extend on the movie visuals, which almost every other review describe, I'll just say they are excellent and the changes of perspective that the cinematographer do (from the outside of the suit to the inside, from the astronaut view) are amazing, nothing short of masterful. The first long sequence at the beginning is also a technical marvel.Sandra Bullock delivers and carries the movie all by herself.My problems with the movie, hence, 2 stars less, are more because I'm a space program lover, of USA and Russia, and know a lot about it. I know that a mission specialist (Bullock's character) does not receive any training on flying spaceships (let alone a Soyuz craft), that almost killed the story for me. And the physics, when Kowalsky releases himself from Stone, his relative velocity is zero, so Stone just had to pull him normally and he would not be lost in space. I know this two points are in the movie for the drama, but for me, it keeps it from being a total masterpiece. Cuaron's other sci-fi flick, Children of Men, it's a masterpiece and still his best movie.Nevertheless, I'm glad there's still people with the vision to do a movie like this, innovative and fresh, like in Hollywood glory days. Surely, Gravity stands apart from all the garbage films and forgettable summer blockbusters with mediocre and uncreative writing out there, a movie that has its name in history firmly assured.

Star Trek," Not bad, not excellent, but happy to see Star Trek again in theaters
","OK, I understand some bad reviews, but the fault's of this movie are not more than the good things (contais spoilers):THE GREAT<ul><li>Star Trek again in theaters</li></ul><ul><li>FX, at last we have outer space CGI that look real, the spaceships, planets and cities look REAL, not just...well, CGI.</li></ul><ul><li>The cast is great, I really believed I was watching Kirk, Spock and Bones...Bones is the best, with his expressions and complain talk. Kirk is Kirk but younger, and Spock is Spock, less experienced more emotional. Those who complain of Spock being a loverboy must have forgotten TOS episodes like The Enterprise Incident, This Side of Paradise or Amok Time. It looks weird with whom he is a loverboy, but this is an alternate timeline, something common in Trek.</li></ul><ul><li>With the alternate timeline the writers and producers avoided cannon, it was just impossible to establish a new Star Trek with 40 something years of cannon, hundreds of TV episodes and books and 10 movies. An intelligent choice.</li></ul>THE GOOD<ul><li>The main story is entertaining, it was fun to see the character's origin. I have no problem with Vulcan and Romulan destroyed (to Boldly Go...remember?).</li></ul><ul><li>There's some mild humor, people in the theater really laughed some times, humor is very welcomed as long is not like Tbe Voyage Home (an overrated movie) or The Final Frontier, humor will always be a healthy choice in the right doses.</li></ul>THE NOT SO GOOD<ul><li>Eric Bana's villain is good but there's lack of exposition for his character, the real motivation is revealed at the 2/3'rds of the movie, and is just revenge, something not very new for a Trek villain...I'm sure writers could have come with something wackier and more vision.</li></ul><ul><li>This lack of exposition is also true for Scotty. An outsider is just chief of engineering just as he comes aboard? I did'nt buy that</li></ul><ul><li>The music: I found it uninteresting, not worthy of Trek. Even the music of bad Trek movies as Star Trek V is much more impressive. I missed the lush and beauty of previous Trek scores: The Motion Picture, The Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock.</li></ul><ul><li>I would have appreciated a little more depth, Trek depth, some small learning and trippy coolness, but I got more punch and action than brains.</li></ul><ul><li>THE BAD</li></ul>That shaky camera in action sequences...it was too much, if the CGI is great, why ruin it? A little of that I would not mind, but the editors exaggerated.Anyway, my overall experience was of some joy and definetively I was very glad to see Star Trek again and see the franchise reborn. I'm sure there will be sequels, lets hope producers will add some things lacking here and keep the vitality this movie has.",7,3,8,9 May 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Soulless. Star Wars fans brace for impact, it will be hard.
","For the record, I did like the 2009 movie, was not perfect but fun anyway and a good refresh. But now...why? Why a bunch of guys are destroying Sci-Fi most precious jewels? This guy, Damon Lindelof destroyed Alien with a really bad story and script in Prometheus. Now using all mediocrity and laziness available, he and two other writers do a complete rehash of Wrath of Khan that it feels like a shameless remake, but without brains, without mystique, without pacing. Explosions, chasing, explosions, chasing, no real sense of suspense, just go for the ride and shut your brains...I indeed felt sometimes I was watching a Bond film in space, as another reviewer suggested.It would have been so much better, if they wanted to rehash some old Trek story, to take the episode 'Where No Man has gone before', from the 60s, and make Commander Gary Mitchell a powerful villain, like in that episode, which is so very classic and excellent Sci-Fi. I was almost convinced that this was the case, but no, Lindelof and company did not have the intelligence nor creativity, they had to bring back a story and character from the most successful Star Trek movie, just to be sure. Chickens, that's what they are, Abrams and his creative team !At first, I had no problem with the Khan character, I even liked it how he was brought back, and the film was performing decently (except for the Klingon subplot, pointless and unnecessary)...but then everything begins to fall in the third act. Khan and Kirk as sidekicks? Even though it was brief, it felt out of place, even embarrassing; then we have exactly the same story from the original Wrath of Khan with reversal of roles and change of setting, and then, a boring James Bond Spock chasing the bad guy, fighting at the top of a vehicle...boring, boring, boring.Acting is decent. Pike is good; Khan is good but the actor underused; Spock and Kirk are good, more tribute than imitation. My main problem is with the story and script and the overuse of chasing, explosion, chasing, explosion, chasing, explosion...this is not what Star Trek is about.Is this Star Trek or Star Wars?...It literally is THE END when almost the same people are now in charge of both franchises that were so different in approach and style. Star Wars fans brace for impact, it will be hard. (and again, that guy Lindelof destroyed Alien, I'm pretty sure the man is not very appreciated in the sci-fi fan community).The End is: The Alien universe, Star Trek and soon Star Wars are now part of the same by-product of the senseless, brutal and mediocre money machine, it's so shameless that it's the same people in charge. All the same movies, with different faces.How sad.",5,29,49,25 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not bad, but...
","Episode II is NOT a bad film, but its not great either. It could have been great, but some aspects of it, degrade it:<ul><li>The story is good, but it lacks 'feeling', the feeling that, Star Wars, ESB and Return of the Jedi have, you care more for the story and characters, in these new Star Wars films you simply give a damn.</li></ul><ul><li>The casting for the Anakin character was not the best, the actor Hayden Christensen performs his acting like he is in a N'Sync or Westlife video! He even looks like a member of those terrible groups. I still cannot see with the bad acting he did, that his Anakin character and Darth Vader are the same person.</li></ul><ul><li>The excesive computarized FX, in some parts they are very good, but in much others they simply don`t look real. Compare the beginning of Star Wars or the Return of the Jedi, the star destroyers and the planets LOOK real, like you are looking through a window in space, that`s one of the reasons because those movies were much more successful than the new ones. The FX in this last movies simply look as what they really are: computer generated scenes, nothing more, the viewer knows it and because that, the magic is gone.</li></ul>Lets hope that for episode 3, Lucas ends the saga with greatness, something that Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones don´t have.",Null,0,0,2 February 2003
Man of Steel," Not the garbage nor the masterpiece some say
","Avoid reviews that tell this is the 'best (superhero) movie ever made' or the 'best movie of the year'; likewise, avoid reviews that say this movie is garbage and the worst ever. Neither one nor the other.Some of the 10 star reviews seem written by movie studio workers or teenagers, many who do not know the rich history of cinema, they exaggerate the movie qualities; in this age of technology, instant communications and unlimited information from a pocket device, for most people the more CGI and fast action, the better the movie. The Internet and Information technology age has decreased the attention span of people, believe me, there are papers from scientific researchers about it, even a book.My template is the best Superman movies to date: Superman: The Movie (1978), Superman II (1980) and Superman II: Richard Donner's Cut (2006). Man of Steel is a remake of these three movies as Superman Returns is a homage to the same three.We have essentially the same story: starting on a dying Krypton, Jor-El and the elders send General Zod and his henchmen to oblivion in the Phantom Zone, Krypton is destroyed and Kal-El is sent to Earth. He arrives and is raised by his terrestrial parents, struggles as he discovers his powers, then General Zod is free from the Phantom Zone, and arrives to Earth to conquer, terminate most humans, rule and have his vengeance killing Kal-El.Many aspects of this story are enhanced further on Man of Steel, which is good, the problem is in the execution. First we have Krypton, a fascinating world, but...but, we have Jor-El flying a giant bird (Avatar, Lord of the Rings anyone?) and swimming and diving. It feels totally out of character. Richard Donner's Superman vision, handles Krypton with much economy, but there's a hint of mystery, coolness and 'tripiness', all those scenes are absolute and masterful science fiction. Then, Kal-El arrives to Kansas, which in Man of Steel is in constant flashbacks throughout all the movie, which gets tiresome. It would have been so much better to tell a chronologically straightforward story, which would have allow more discovery from the audience and character development. When General Zod arrives we are in alien invasion territory, not bad, but not outstanding; mediocre films like Skyline, Battlefield Los Angeles (a shame because its FX were great) or Battleship have degraded this sub genre. Then we have lots of action, very well done, but I felt sometimes I was watching a Dragonball Z movie and is so much action and so fast, that your emotions are detached and you almost do not care.Good points were Superman treated as an alien enemy from the military, Jonathan Kent's sacrifice (but again, showed in a flashback when the movie is well advanced, so it does not have the emotional impact it should) and when Zod arrives to Earth and Superman is revealed to the world.Bad points, some hard to miss plot holes, excess of action and destruction (how much of Metropolis population were killed? Superman did not care?) and the epilogue when Clark Kent arrives at the Daily Planet, his disguise is not believable: Miss Lane (which finds out easily who Superman is), a bunch of classmates from the old days, hence at least half Smallville, already know he is Superman. How can you work a sequel with that tiny detail, suspension of disbelief? Not for me.About the music, the same standard byproduct of many many Hollywood movies of the 21st century, nothing to write more about, just that I hear the same music score in almost all high profile action/adventure films. Boring. I remind that John Williams score in the first two Superman movies is a masterpiece.Making some defense, for some critics there is huge moral problem when Superman wastes Zod, according to them, Superman does not kill. Well, he did kill Zod in Superman II, so what's the problem?Man of Steel is just another summer blockbuster movie, not bad, not great and it certainly does not approach the greatness of Superman: The Movie and Superman II. It's a shame because it had the potential.",5,4,8,22 June 2013
Apocalypse Now," War is madness!
","I don´t know which version of the film I´ve seen, I have a VHS version that has the playmates scene, and does not has B52s bombing Kurtz´headquarters...anyway, all what this movie is about is that war is total madness. A crazy colonel that attacks a Vietcong town only to go surfing? I can buy that, and the playmates also! This film has its surreal moments, but it is just a way of showing how unreal reality (and war) can be. War can twist off anyone´s mind. A total masterpiece.",10,3,4,12 January 2002
Aliens," Very good sci-fi/action movie, but...
","Aliens is as good as it gets, lots of action but there is no real horror as in Alien. I can´t understand why so many people claim Aliens as a masterpiece (not to say 'the best all time movie'). First, a masterpiece has to be original and there is very little of 'original' in this sequel, Alien is the movie that introduces the horrible monster, the planet, the alien spaceship, the facehuggers, the horrible lifecycle of the xenomorph, EVERYTHING! Aliens is just a very entertaining movie (don´t misunderstand me, I really like it) but it just follows the real original idea of the first movie but now with a bunch of marines with the idea of kicking some aliens' butt. Now, lets be sincere, that plot is not 'brilliant', it is adolescent and good to sell lots of bucks, and sure it did. As for Aliens being the best sci-fi around...hmm, go and watch, 2001, Bladerunner, Brazil or Alien, in this last you can FEEL how lonely and dark space can really be. Horror and terror? See Alien alone in the dark. Nevertheless, Alien and Aliens complement very well, a must see both, but don´t be fooled, the 'real' thing is the first one.",8,0,0,2 September 1999
Prometheus," Priority One: Insure safe return of millions of $$$, all other considerations secondary. Story expendable.
","I know the reason why the Space Jockey / Engineer wants to return to Earth and destroy it: to wipe out all mindless Hollywood screenwriters.How they related something masterful and perfect as Alien with this nonsense? This is what happens when movies are not done primary for passion and love but only for winning lots of $$$, it is OK to win money, but at least earn it with something good, lots of Sci-fi folks were truly hoping for something much more than average in Prometheus. My buddy and I, both sci-fi and cinema lovers, were really upset when the movie was over.All the bad reviews you've read are correct ! Bad writing and bad characterization plagues the whole movie; a bunch of Eagle Boy Scouts lost in a dangerous jungle would behave much better than the 'scientists' portrayed here.Yes, in Alien there are also some poor character decisions, but they are made within the story, not to serve the script, and a bad one this is ! And the people in Alien were miners, not scientists, which behave totally off character in Prometheus.I love excellent Sci-fi that blows your mind, love the Alien universe, Ridley Scott is (was?) one of my favorite directors. Why did he allowed this?The music is almost bad. A surprise because the music in many of Scott's films is outstanding.Alien 3 is almost a masterpiece compared to this, really, no pun intended, at least it handles well the drama; Prometheus, no drama no suspense at all, you do not care about anyone or anything....And even Alien vs. Predator already has the Erik Von Daniken type of plot about ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials and also Wayland goes for the ride...been there, done that. Boring, boring, boring. Did someone in preproduction noticed this before saying yes to the script?The mythic Space Jockey is reduced to a mindless The Thing From Another World (yes folks, that classic from 1951) monster, a man in a suit is now replaced by CGI; at least back then it was groundbreaking, now, it is boring and lame.I feel totally betrayed by Scott and company, they have morphed in an evil cinematic Weyland-Yutani company that only cares about money. Story expendable.The Good: Michael Fassbender's android; though his motives within the story are not clear (again, bad writing).2 or 3 precious minutes with David, the android, doing housekeeping before waking up the crew. Very 2001, very cool.The FX and cinematography, of course.Somehow, the movie is not boring, but there is no drama you simply do not care. Just shut your brains and engagement and go for the ride.The bad: almost everything else.Prometheus, as it is, is a movie that should have never been made. Surely it is another mindless Hollywood Bantha fodder that, except for the visuals and cinematography, any unknown director could have made.",4,19,30,21 June 2012
