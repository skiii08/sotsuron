The Sound of Music," The Sights & Sounds of The Sound Of Music
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,'What BEst Picutre winner should I choose for a review?' Many to choose from of course The answer came to me Sunday,the day after Christmas 2010. NBC replayed this wonderful film and I watched it, since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews,Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the,now grown,child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s,The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid,it usually is the first 'Best Picture' Oscar winner that you ever see in your life. When you see it the first time,the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot,you know it's going to be something great.Like a lot kids,it was only natural I'd like songs like 'Do-Re-Mi','My Favorite Things,'So Long,Farewell' and 'The Lonely Goatherd'(or 'The Yodeling Song' as some call it) and more. I liked 'Edelweiss' and 'Climb Every Mountain' when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and 'Mary Poppins' and other movies,where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then. Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible,then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive,fair and loving and (of course) singing. Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship. That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert,chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music,as we know,was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories. That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even 45 years later.Lastly,because the people behind the scenes,as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves,made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie,well done! Ten stars,for all time.(END)",10,8,13,6 August 2015
12 Angry Men," 12 wonderful actors.
","(January,2006) I'll start by saying that if there's anyone who rates this film as 'hated it',they obviously don't know hard hitting / good drama when they see it. These 12 actors performances are so alive, vital and powerful, it's amazing to think this film didn't win Best Picture that year. Henry Fonda gives a simplistic yet very deep performance in the way his character says 'not guilty' but wisely does not say,'I know he's not'. that would've undermined the whole of his performance.Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as not just prejudiced like the other older male juror but just angry inside at everything. Especially when Fonda calls him a 'sadist'. John Fielder always great as the meek yet outspoken kind. Jack Warden as a guy who'd rather be at the ballgame than having his life interrupted for something he could care less about.E.G. Marshall gives a quiet yet strong performance as well. A man who is so 'sure and certain' about everything. Only to be proved wrong later. The rest are fantastic in their own ways as well.Since most of us here are familiar with the story, I wont go into it but I will say I really love how Henry Fonda finally breaks the last two hold-outs into voting 'not guilty' for the right reasons.10 stars because it is justifiably so. Anything less would be a crime.",10,12,18,17 January 2006
Grease," Why Grease Is Great and Why (Some) Hate
","You can probably already see my rating of 10 stars as you start to read this review. Knowing that, you may also know I'm not going to just put out paragraph after paragraph, praising it and telling you why I like it. I wont even go into the plot, we all know it. I'll be as brief as possible. Yes, I was 10 in 1978 and watched the ABC show, 'Welcome Back, Kotter' which featured Travolta. ..but, I had also sen him in the TV movie 'The Boy In The Plastic Bubble'. ('Saturday Night Fever' was too adult for me in '77-'78.) So, yes it was that he's the star and I already liked Olivia Newton-John too. 
 I used to watch the variety show 'Sha-Na-Na'. That's the group who were 'Johnny Casino & The Gamblers. Lastly, it was set in my mother & father's teen year , much like 'Happy Days' , so that's all I needed. At that age one's mind (usually) is pretty open to something like this and it appealed to me instantly. As I got older I came to understand or finally notice, the more adult elements Yes, one of them being those 'words' in the Greased Lightning song and also the more mature themes. All of this actually gels well in a film that's set in a time where these things weren't always (or maybe never) talked about in the home. This movie is a favorite because from start to end, the young players put all of their energies into the song and dance numbers., all of them put every bit of themselves into their roles and most of all, in case no one noticed, this movie has a perfect balance of comedy, music , wonderfully choreographed dancing and serious elements. Not 'too' serious or else you'd be watching a musical remake of 'Rebel Without A Cause'. For me it's just fun and enjoyable. That's all it is for me. Now, anyone out there who thinks that it was 'easy' to put a film like this together (and based from a stage play as well), knows nothing about movie making and in terms of dancing, how tough it is for a choreographer to get everyone's movements in synch together. As for 'bursting into song' , in a good musical, there has to be a justified reason for someone to start singing. They can' for example be talking one minute and then suddenly sing 'La Bamba' (or whatever), it has to make sense. Mainly, it's a faster way of telling the story. If Danny just stood there on the bleachers and talked bout his summer, that's not as interesting. The 'Summer Nights' song helps both Danny and Sandy tell the story, without overuse of dialog. As do all of the other other songs . The 'Born To Hand Jive' number at the school dance is nothing short of everyone giving their all. Especially Travolta and Newton John (and then the women who takes over from Sandy.) The whole dance number is electric. Sounds 70's you say? So what? This is a musical and YES entertainment and gee, t's supposed to be fun. Who cares if some musical liberties are taken? The closing song 'We Go Together' is almost as energetic and in the extras on my DVD, the choreographer stated how proud she was of that cast of young people, whose youthful enthusiasm and energy and dedication made that and all the other numbers what they should be. Entertaining. Yes all the actors are over 21 and into 30's, this was a common Hollywood practice at he time. Movie makers wanted to deal with those more professional that know 'time is money' and will be reliable. They also want people who have confidence in themselves and their abilities. Along with the fact people over 21 have more time to be on the set. For my money, they all did a great job acting like teen agers. About Sandy, everyone seems to forget hat Danny also was trying to change some too , by getting into athletics, which is a god way to learn that everything isn't all about him and what he wants. He was finally, just as willing to change for her and she was for him at the end. She made that choice herself because as the song Grease states 'conventionality belongs to yesterday'. She was what society 'then' said a girl should be, a 'good girl' but (sorry t say by the way) in the world of youth, it's tough to be an individual. Parents wanted (and still do) their kids to be what they say or their peers want them to be the near opposite. I reviewed Grease 2 sometime ago on here and it was easy to pinpoint what's wrong with that film. For the reviews I read here, they all seemed to be either based on their ONE and only one viewing of the movie or they're all hung up in the ending where Sandy changes her personality. (To put it lightly). How can you see a film that's good (based on the fact it did well and people continue to love it 40 years later) only 1 time and say 'this is lousy' (?) If musicals don;t appeal to you, OK that's fair but seen those who aren't into musicals can find something positive. If you cannot let yourself be entertained by a movie and forget all you know about the 'real world' and just lighten up,you can enjoy 'Grease'. If you're going to sit there and watch for 'goofs' , editing mistakes. something to hate about it from the start or even worse..... 'a lesson/message' , well ,you wont enjoy it. These are all the WRONG reasons to watch a movie. Especially a musical. Lastly, in regards to those saying seethe play. Well hey, not everyone can afford something like that and secondly, if anyone in 1978 or now, thought this would be 'like the play', they were crazy to think it would be in the first place. For me, last time, 'Grease' is a great movie just for all that it is and even at 50, none of it's appeal or my enjoyment of it has been or ever will be lost. It hs nothing to do with nostalgia or feeling younger again....I love the movie, period. 
I'm only sorry it took me this long to review it. (END)",10,7,9,8 August 2018
Cast Away," 'Cast Away' - The Story Of A Wayward, Marooned Man
","Believe it or not,until last night,I had never seen this movie. I'd seen snippett's of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn't seen it. I made one attempt about 2 years ago,checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged. Finally though,my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it. He's seen it several times.My overall impression after watching it was,'Wow,what an amazing story'. The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy. Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever.The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done,as were the scenes of Hanks' character surviving the angry seas. Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island. Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test.He finds food,makes shelter,works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival. All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket-watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane. Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he'll return to her someday soon.After 4 years pass,he's still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality. He's taken to painting a face on a soccer ball (with his own blood) and nameing it 'Wilson',as it says on the ball. 'Wilson' becomes his best friend.Finally (and quite amazingly) near the end of this,another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds. It's actually a credit to Hanks' acting when 'Wilson' falls overboard into the ocean and floats away,Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend.Upon being rescued and getting home,he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return. Se's remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him.His now ex-wife realizes she shouldn't have listened to her friends & family who said she should just 'let him go'. Which gives us a slightly 'hollywood' scene of her calling to him & chasing after him in the rain as he's driving off. They still love each-other but the damage is done.With the life he knew gone he's now at a complete loss as to what he's supposed to do with it now. The ending really doesn't provide a clear-cut answer but merely hints at it. I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is,'What would I do if all this happened to me'? I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging,moving even a bit suspenseful (if you've never seen it. The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch.

54," '54' : The Little Brother Of Boogie Nights.
","I want it understood first off,that I 'know' this is a good film. The story is good,the acting,the sets,the 70s era wardrobe & musicand the (mostly) factual story of the fall of New York City's Studio 54 disco club.I liked what saw,the thing of it is...some of it had already been done in 'Boogie Nights'. The two films do have similar set-ups. In both,a young misunderstood teen/20 something boy leaves home because of his parents negativity. This made it seem,unfortunately like a copy-cat film.In this one though,the young man who goes to work at Studio 54 sort of gets shoved aside for other inter-weaved story lines. SNL alum Mike Meyers was great as the club's owner and showed that he can be a fairly serious actor. Playing a man who can't see (in his drug induced haze)that his success is slipping away from him to the point of collapse.I'm not rating this 5 stars because there's substandard acting or bad production values here, it's just because in following on the heels of 'Boogie Nights',it could have used a different set up for the story.I feel that is what caused it's box-office return to be less than spectacular. In fact...the day I saw it,there was only one other person in the entire audience. (Possibly)if not for 'B.N.' ;this could have been a bigger and better film in the eyes of the public. It's still great though.(END)",7,2,4,17 November 2006
Amadeus," Amedeus : Directors Cut Completes The Story
","I have seen the original version of 'Amedeus' 6 times and no doubt, it is and always will be a deservedly crowned masterpiece and Best Picture. While I agree with that 100% , I've always had this feeling that there could or should have been more to it. Not because the original was cut by 20 minutes but because it seemed to have more focus on the absurdity of W. Amedues Mozart himself. Yes,he's the title character,but the point of view of the story is told by Salieri and it seems,aside from his aged version and the times we see his young self on screen,in the original his story of his disillusionment with God seems too quick. In this director's version,we find out more than we had before about this. Scenes of him quietly praying but at the same time crying out to God to help him have as great a gift as Mozart.Every failure and snub he receives in his life,from the arrival of the young genius culminates in his declaring God his enemy and burning the Holy Cross in the fireplace. The new scenes help build it to a better climax on that note. Along with this the expanded story of when Mozrt's wife secretly visits Salieri to show her husband's work to him,to gain a paid teaching post. This leads to the deleted section of Salieri telling her to 'come back in the evening' , for illicit purposes. Once she later arrives and removes her top garment exposing herself,for whatever reason,he decides to instead have her shown out the door. I'm assuming out of his own sense of decency,he decided not to go through with it. It's Mozart he wants to punish ,not her. Even though he has. Lastly,there's also the funny scenes with Mozart trying to instruct a nervous young girl while her family and dogs make constant noise. It's something that causes him to storm out and feel indignant at having to put up with something like this. It adds only a little to the overall story. With the film expanded to 3 hours,again,I feel I saw a much more complete storyline,with both Salieri & Mozrt represented equally on screen. ....but whether in it's original form or this version,there's no way I'd ever rate 'Amedeus' less than 10 stars. That'd be like telling Mozart his music has 'too many notes',so...well,there it is. {END}",10,3,4,16 April 2011
1917," *1917* - (Review Number 1,679) . Title : 'In These Last 5 Hours'
","L left my home around 12 pm today , to head ti the theater where this was playing. I'd been wanting to see it since it was released but was always sidetracked by something going on in my life.I arrived there before 1:00 and the movie started at 1:02.I'm sure as most here may have felt before it began ... I had NO idea what to expect or what I was going to see. I've seen many a war movie in my life ,
from the black and white era to Saving Private Ryan and Fury in 2014. .....but (and I am not exaggerating) , this film has captured exactly every feeling, emotion, action of those made to fight in the truly nightmarish and holocaust like places that are the front lines and battlefields.They have also fully captured the look of everything a military set up and used in this , World War 1 and future wars. The look is sad, scary,somber and in some cases as dark as war truly is. (Not speaking from any experience but I know this movie does not lie). The cinematography, yes, does pull that off perfectly , in my opinion.As some already know the story is , two British soldiers are chosen to get a message to another regiment many miles across 'no man's land' ( where if the enemy spots you , you are likely to get shot and killed). The reason is, the Germans have retreated but it may be a trick. So they have to get there to warn them and find the brother of the younger soldier.From the start, the bulk of the first half is filmed in 'real time'. following every move of these 2. Without giving anything away, there's a slight pause of darkness, then the real time pursuit continues. I was astounded at how steadily and perfectly the camera (cameras?) followed along.Lastly, in an early morning scene in a village, the true look of war/night time battle is (once again) shown by (I can only call it astounding) visuals and cinematography. Usually a few hours after a film, I've forgotten most of what I've seen. In this case ....even if I never watched this film again (and I will) there is no way I will ever forget any of this.Much like those who survives wars , they never forget either. World War 1 , for a long time after 1930's 'All Quiet On The Western Front' , was very forgotten and thought by younger generations as 'not a serious war'. This movie , like Western Front, shows that is not the case. At 3:01 , my odyssey was over.It was was just as violent and horrific as World War 2 or any war since then. I will not make any Oscar predictions here. Except to say , I'd be very pleased to see it placed among the the top pictures of the past.Please , go see this ...I put no spoilers in here because ,feel , it is not boring and it's certainly something you will ever forget. Not everyone will feel the same but well, I can only recommend.",10,2,4,7 February 2020
Clash of the Titans," Thanks To Those Who Invented Discount Theatres
","At 13,I saw the 1981 'Clash Of The Titans' the very same month of my birthday. I knew nothing at that time about Greek mythology but I knew enough of what was transpiring in the movie,that I could get engrossed in it.The effects and visuals then captivated my still young imagination. I definitely like the owl too. I never forgot the film.Too bad I can't give that kind of praise to this re-make. A better term is a de-construction. I'll give two stars to the movie for it's action but only because ,really, that's what this version is all about.It's about the fighting,the special effects and even more so....an excuse to trash-talk the original on screen.Hey guys , sorry that in 1981 the special effects weren't like they are today. There's a great difference between special effects for Star Wars and for that movie. They had what they had then , anything better was over 12 years away.The joke about 'leaving the owl there' was amusing,only because I knew they wouldn't use it in the modern version. After that though,there seemed to be too much focus on tongue in cheek or wise guy humor.It's almost like saying,'Hey audience,don't let yourself get emotionally involved in this....heck,we're not!' That's one of the chief problems with not only remakes but with a lot of movies today.Personally,I'm really sick of Hollywood taking the movies and TV shows I grew up with and loved and turning them into a sarcastic,cynical joke.It's all about getting you into the seats,especially the younger audience. Few young people know about the 1981 version and most never will.I do know there are young people out there who 'do' want a good story,who 'do' care about the Greek writings that inspired this and movies like it in the first place. Aw, but what the heck....'Them young people don't care about learnin' anything!' The movie also has no real emotion,no real characters that you can sympathise with,cheer for or for that matter try to understand. Since they're all thinly written.Andromeda comes the closest in that category and in fact,hers is the only really good acting in the movie.Literally,It's no wonder this all wraps up in just over 90 minutes,there's no good amount of acting,dialouge or story enough here to make it worth one's time or money (or brain exertion).When is Hollywood going to stop depending on the special effects to carry a movie? To stop relying on the action for the same reason? That's why I'm glad I waited for the cheap theatre. When I first heard about it,I knew this wouldn't be anything like 1981's movie but at the very least I expected them to take it to a higher level of entertainment and maybe even make another 'Lord Of The Rings' , in terms of story and writing............not lower it down into the depths of Hades.

The Artist," The Artistry of 'The Artist'.
","The first actual silent movie I ever saw,was 'Seventh Heaven'. It was on TV one day when I was 11,in 1979. I saw this before I even had seen a silent comedy and despite my age,I didn't turn the channel. Instead,I watched it all.When I got around to the comedies,I liked them also,mainly because I can look into a time long before my own.. So with 'The Artist,I get to do that as well but in a modern film. This movie is a must and great up to date way for those unfamiliar,Sure,all the actors are from this era but they have done such a convincing portrayal here,it's almost as if they actually entered a time machine and made a movie in the 21st century. The filming style is of that era,I can only guess they located the same kind of film somehow,the fashions are perfect and the storyline plays just like one of the 'real' movies of that time.The scene on the multi-level staircase,reminds me of how they filmed some scenes in 'Metropolis'. I believe many a silent classic is honored here,including the comedies. The sound moments are,in a sense,like when Al Jolson made 'The Jazz Singer'. Mostly silent but some sound moments thrown in. Those moments here are done in a brilliant and creative way. The storyline is right out of early Hollywood....ala 'A Star Is Born'. He's a long time success,she's a newcomer and later,their places are reversed on the Hollywood ladder of fame. He absolutely refuses to do 'talkies' and (like most then) thought they were a gimmick and wouldn't last. She,being younger,is all too happy to comply. John Goodman's role is very funny as the put upon studio head who can't get Valentin to see that the silent era is over and must make a change or be shoved aside to history.I wont go any further if you have yet to see it,if you have you know the rest. The ending is a very clever and fun one as well. This picture deserves every bit of praise it's been given. 10 stars for the artistry of 'The Artist'.",10,2,3,13 March 2012
Rocky," Rocky Knocked Out The Competition
","At the 1977 Oscars (for the films of 1976),there were really great movies up for Best Picture. 'Network','All The President's Men','Taxi Driver' and the lesser known 'Bound For Glory'. The story of Rocky is much like a story many people deal with everyday. Trying not just to make something of ourselves in this life ...... but to become something better and more meaningful than we already are or that we may not be at that time. I feel this was the reason it won the top Award at the Oscars. The top 3 that I mentioned were movies showing what was wrong in our country,which is always important ground to cover and all 3 are brilliant and classics. (I've never seen Bound For Glory,so I can't comment.) Anyone of them could have taken the prize but the Academy simply went a different way. At least (again) that's how I see it. I have nothing negative to say about Rocky as a movie,it's simplistically wonderful and the climax is unforgettable.I only have trouble with the DVD's overloaded with far too many 'extras'. Don;t get me wrong , I like extras,like deleted scenes. ...but why not take these deleted scenes and put them back in the movie and onto the DVD itself? Also,if I recall correctly,the fight used to be a lot longer and seems to be edited to be shorter and quicker. Why? To cater to those with short attention spans?I did some detective work online to see about a scene where Rocky talks to a priest before the fight and found that this occoured in Rocky 2,not this one. Anyhow,10 stars for 'Rocky' for the great little film that won over the Academy and the nation. If I rated the DVD features that come with this,it'd be a 9. (END)",10,1,2,24 March 2011
Detroit Rock City," 'That 70s Movie' or ( 'Rock Bottom')
","It could be easily said that it's just an ironic coincidence that this film appeared just a year after 'That 70s Show' made it's debut. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if they watched the show and took notes. When I went to see this movie,it had already been out for weeks and had less than wonderful raves but still I just 'had' to check it out (and i'm not even that big of a KISS fan,my brother is but even he opted out.)I honestly felt,as i watched this,like I'd paid full price for an extended episode of '70's Show'. The lead boy might as well have been Eric Forman and the others could be Michael Kelso,Casey Kelso & Steven Hyde. The bible thumping mother who bands together with other protesting parents against the impending KISS concert,is to me a female version of Red Forman.Just like parents and clergy back in the late 70s,adults thought that the four letters in the groups name stood for 'knights in satans service' and that their whole thing with the make up was part of an evil kin of worship. The lead teen's mother discovers his tickets to the show and burns them! Now he and his friends have to jump through hoops to get into the show. These two factors make up the whole of the story.Some things are funny,like having to deal with a younger boy in Ace make up,while the song 'Popcorn' by Hot Butter plays over the scene. When they go into a strip club and one of them tries to win money for tickets by stripping himself.The battle between parental guidance and teen rebellion should have been played more for laughs,than in the semi-serious fashion it was. Although many families did go through this back then,for a comedy,overall,it interferes with the humor and the fun.To sum it up in quick fashion.there were a few things I liked here;what few funny moments there were;the music;the nostalgia. Otherwise,the rock bottom idea of (allegedly) copying a TV show & the other detracting factors I've mentioned,make the film something I might only watch again,if I really was in the mood to see it once more.

Die Hard," 2 Hours Away From Our Own Real Lives
","Before the detractors of movie violence get the wrong idea,I'm not rating this film 10 stars in support of killing or guns or things like that. The rating is that for escapist entertainment,venting one's frustrations for the things that happen in the world,which we cannot do as much as we'd like about....this movie is absolutely great! This film owes a lot to movies like the 'Dirty Harry' series and 'Bullitt' with Steve McQueen. They are the true grand-daddies of the genre!A movie like Die Hard is meant to be the like the most dangerous of rides at an amusement park. Thrilling,unexpected,dangerous etc. This is not meant to be 'real' because this is an action film,not a documentary on terrorism or police work. For non-stop action and just releasing pent up feelings of helplessness. I say more power to films like this. Only a very uneducated person would honestly believe that one person could knock out thugs like those in this movie (educated though they are).Not your kind of movie? Then it's simple find something that appeals to you. As far as the sequels go,#2 is just as action packed and suspenseful,#3 is still good but it does have the feeling of 'been there before' but it does it's job and so does Bruce Willis. They only way to avoid getting tired of them,is to not watch them a lot. Then it seems fresh. (END)",10,6,7,13 April 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," When This Talkie 'Talked',Everyone Listened.
","Along with this version,I am also going to be reviewing the 1979 remake because I feel both should be talked about.Well,while I'm sure anything I can add here,will not be anything that hasn't been said already,I'll do my best. In the early days of 'talkies',the first motion pictures with sound,a lot of film-makers chose the musical (like 1929's 'Braodway Melody'.) They also did comedy,to which a lot of silent comics lost their gravy train. Silent actors too.'All Quiet On The Western Front' is not just a great war movie,it's also a great 'anit-war' movie and for the time a daring and bold choice. So great are the scenes of the young men in the classroom upon graduation day,being given a speech by their mentor. A speech about school being over and their 'duty' beginning,in terms of joining the German military andfighting against the French 'for their Kaiser',then ruler of Germany in 1916.They all go out and join up and one way or another,the war destroys them. Physically or mentally they are either killed in battle or lose their mind and can no longer be the people they once were. The over all message I came away with,is not just the usual 'war is insanity',I also find the message that one's duty begins with a duty to one's own self and not what others feel it to be.Had this movie been attempted after the 'censorship reign' in Hollywood,it most likely would not have been allowed. This movie won Best Picture of 1930 for all the reasons a film should win. A great subject,great story,great acting and a great,first rate drama in the new era of talking pictures.

WALL·E," Wall-E : Extrordinar-E!
","Well I can see there's enough reviews here to cover what the movie is all about and I'm sure more than enough people have seen it.I see there's 'exactly' 300 'hated it' reviews here. I'm no longer surprised by those kind of reviews,for every movie someone likes,there's someone who doesn't. The thing that gets me though,is that they are the ones that call us stupid,simple minded or pretentious for liking a movie that they do not. One even says that he 'can't believe that people actually like this'. Well,newsflash for you nay-sayers,yes we really 'do' like this movie.I found it rather insulting that someone said an IQ of a child would be needed to find the movie touching,sentimental or entertaining in any way. So,that makes that person a not only a critic but a judge of human nature as well? Speak for yourselves. I'm 42 and I found this movie not only a feast for the eyes but an animated example of emotional and compelling storytelling. Maybe some of you are so used to computer generated animation,you tend to take it for granted or as 'been there-done that' and the overall effort escapes you.I'm also very familiar with the film tactic of 'long stretches of silence' to enhance dramatic effect. Nearly the 1st ten minutes of 'The Good,The Bad & The Ugly' is void of any dialog. It did enhance the drama here and I liked that there wasn't a lot of dialog. The actions of WALL-E & EVE said it better than any lines written.I found it to be a pretty hefty storyline for young viewers to see a lone robot,in a devastated world,not only finding & feeling love but how that love helps in the salvation of the planet by his accidental flight to the space station where the human population now resides.It was pointed out,in another review that it was all too 'heavy-handed' and overbearing. Gee,It must be me but I don't believe that the subject matter should be the stuff of comedy & animated slapstick like 'The Emporers New Groove'.The earth we see Wall-E in,can very much be our future if things don't change in our current society. Not just the ecological disaster area the world became but also,should any survive and we actually go into space,generations later will never know about the kind of world we once lived in. The people being all overweight and lazy,is a metaphor for how little we seem to care right now about not only our planet but our own lives. That's why the ending is very important also,it may sound like something on a T-Shirt,but it really is up to all of us,to avoid laying the earth to waste. I liked the simpler animation at the end,showing the earth being renewed while Peter Gabriel sings his great song 'Down To Earth'.Lastly,another person stated that this film should be as forgotten as 'Hello Dolly' (which is used in the film.) 'Hello,Dolly' is an Oscar winning classic in musicals,just like the Oscar winning 'Wall-E' will certainly be a classic in animated films. Ten Stars : E-asily! (END)",10,3,6,9 October 2010
Jurassic Park," Jurrasic Park - Wide Eyed at Age 25
","I usually shy away from reviewing movies on here that have a large quantity of reviews. It's sort of like repeating what everyone else has already said,but..I'll do my best.In early 1994,a few months after this had been out,I decided to finally see what all the fuss was about. I normally don't 'go with the crowd' on things,including movies. Curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did.I already knew that during the course of this film I'd see dinosaurs on the loose and attacking. What I did not know or expect was the amazingly real looking beasts that emerged on-screen!It speaks volumes for a movie and special effects when at age 25,my jaw literally dropped and my eyes got wide when the dinosaurs appeared! Computer effects are the 'norm' now but in 1993/1994 it was just the most incredible thing Iever had seen on the big screen in special effects. Topping the spaceship coming over the mountain in 'Close Encounters' in 1977.As for the rest,I was actually jumping when the dinosaurs roared,jumped out and (ugh) ate somebody! (I had to close my eyes on that last one.In agreeing with most people here,it's fantastic! As for it's sequels,I don't care much for sequels and most likely wont watch them. I like to leave well enough alone. This one stands alone and well enough on it's own! (END)",10,3,3,17 March 2015
The Simpsons Movie," Fast, Funny,Touching And Worth The D'Oh!
","I'm writing this review literally minutes after seeing The Simpsons Movie and all I have to say is bravo!!! The movie,thankfully,did not stray far from the series that Simpsons fans know and love. The animation is of course a higher scale and is perfect for a big screen effort and triumph,such as this one. Don't wait for it to be on video! The effects are more spectacular on a large movie screen.Okay,that's enough of sounding like Martin. To put it in simple form Homer once again,ignores the words & warnings of Marge by polluting Springfield lake with a mini-silo of Spider Pig's refuse all for the sake of getting to a doughnut shop before it closes.His actions effect not just his family but the whole town as well and even the govt. gets in on it by taking drastic action against Springfield by closing them off from the world. The Simpsons are all fingered for the blame and the family escapes the town and heads to Alaska.Side story lines in include Lisa's infatuation with a new Irish boy in town who's also concerned about the environment and causes she shares.Bart being humiliated by his own father who dares him to skateboard into town without his clothes. (A hilarious skateboard ride through town by the way.) Finally,thanks to Homer pinning the blame on Bart to the police,Bart's had enough and wishes Flanders were his dad and starts spending time with him.The upshot is how can Homer redeem himself,save his family and the town of Springfield,now that he has screwed up 1,000,000 times worse than he ever did on TV? See the movie,I have and despite not being even 90 minutes long,it's worth the $7 + price of admission. (I saw it at 2pm,so it was a matinée).Every joke and gag works,the touching moments actually are and don't feel like the same exact ones from the show. There's no big message here except the obvious one about the environment,which is important but your not clubbed over the head with it.The Simpsons sure have come a long way since 'Bart Gets an 'F',that's for certain.10 stars easy,you have to be slower than Homer to not want to see this!

The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard Of Oz : From The Books To Today
","*This review is dedicated to my parents ,who were born in the 1930s.*I'll start by saying that many here say ,read the books ,they're better. Well, sure they are. I've read the 14 books by Frank L. Baum and they're classic American literature and simply fun to read as well.Frank L. Baum ,was a man with an imagination ,in a time and place in America ,when men weren't supposed to (or sometimes not allowed to) have one ,after they grew up. (For better insight into Mr. Baum and his books ,watch John Ritter's portrayal in the NBC, 1990 film ,'The Dreamer of Oz.'The 1st filmed version was in 1925 but was laced with both personal & racial stereotypes. As well as being a bit uneven. Nearly 15 years after that version ,came the film that really ,is the first live action movie made for young people. (Kids were not exactly a priority in the early days of movie making.) Now ,over the years ,many have complained that despite the positive message ,the humor and the happy songs sung in the film...it's very dark in many places. If you stop and think about it ...doesn't that sound like many of the movies ,for kids, made during the last 30+ years? The film's also accused of being 'heavy-handed' in it's attempt to make it's point. The 1930s 'were' a very gloomy time and this being a first attempt at this kind of movie ,it couldn't possibly have come across any other way. The people who went and saw this film in '39 ,not only saw the future of movies (unknowingly) but a reflection of their own era. Dorothy & family live on a farm in Kansas ,in the Depression and are threatened by a powerful woman with money ,who feels she can bully and threaten them because she has more than they do. In that situation (and given that no one takes her seriously because she's a kid) Dorothy ,maybe like many in that time, wishes she could be someplace better and that place must be on the other side of rainbow. This isn't just something little children or kids could think. Adults can feel this way as well. What adult wouldn't want to escape the sometimes heavy responsibilities & problems of life ,that they didn't have to deal with as a kid?Sure ,Dorothy finds problems when she gets to Oz. What kind of movie would it be if there weren't any? It'd be one giant tea party with music. In learning the lesson of 'there's no place like home' and that in seeking one ,'she should look no further than her own backyard' ,Dorothy has to see that no matter where you go, no place is perfect or without its problems....even Munchkinland. The witch is a severe problem. Scarecrow , Tin Man , Cowardly Lion and even the Wizard ,all have problems too. Dorothy's in a beautiful land but wants to leave it ,which is another problem. She got what she thought she wanted but realized ,she didn't. She wanted to be home with her family. With all the 'dark' things she goes through ,she does what most of us would do ,she fights for it! With help from her new friends in Oz. When she melts the witch, intended or not ,it was her passing the last test ,to get herself home.A test as well from Glinda ,because she knew why Dorothy had landed in Oz and she helped her see the reality of where it was she truly belonged. Could she have told Dorothy this ,yes ,but would she listen ,anymore than she'd have believed shoes could get her home instantly? All of the things many love The Wizard Of Oz for ,are either things we experience in our lives or that we wish we could do.This movie isn't just for little children or kids ,it's for everyone,of any age. I've watched it on CBS as a kid ,on video and DVD and in 1998 ,I got the pleasure of seeing it in a special 're-release' to movie theaters ,on the big screen. .... And The Wizard Of Oz , is for anyone who simply likes a good movie ,like I do. That and manymore reasons are why I rate it 10 stars. Aside from the lesson ,the real reason to watch the movie ,is to enjoy yourself. Nothing more or less than that. The characters,the story ,the songs ,the scenery and going from black & white to color in a blink ...all a part of telling the world's simplest story of how there's no place like home. ...and home can be a house or even the real world we live in ,where we take the bad with the good. That's something that's as true today as it was over 75 years ago. {END]",10,5,7,1 September 2015
