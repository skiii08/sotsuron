Insidious: Chapter 2," Great way to connect to the original movie
",I really like how the story very nicely jumps to its core without having to build too long. This is absolutely a great choice to take since the original movie did quite different than other horrors by leaving the audience with a great conflict potential. So in this movie it felt very tense all along this movie knowing that one of the characters is a menace in disguise. The acting overall is still just about the same job as did the original movie. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson did just okay in their performances. It's very clear that the movie relies more on the jump-scares and less on good acting. But still I think this movie is better than the original since it flew right to its core and the overall suspense mood.,6,1,2,19 June 2015
Moneyball," A good dramatization of the sport story
","The adaptation of the sport story is good. The acting is good, worthy of a class A list of actors like Pitt and Hill. Seymour-Hoffman also did a great job, despite the short in-frame time.I like the coloring choice for this movie. It helps to maintain the sowed-down and rather dark mood, despite having many shots done about daytime activities.The pace is built well, quite a fast one for a relatively long story. It helps to convey fittingly a story of an entire season into one movie. The acting of the supporting roles of the athletes are also quite good.",7,1,1,20 June 2014
Angels & Demons," Still a good Dan Brown styled thriller, yet it lacks weight on the major theme
","Again as with Da Vinci Code, the story looked like it's taken straight from the Dan Brown novel considering Langdon is always explaining things much like a walking encyclopedia. The thriller aspect improved in this movie compared to Da Vinci Code as it feels that the suspense is kept at almost all the duration of the movie by using the fast paced story flow and the many speeding car and running people scenes. Although this means less action part compared to Da Vinci Code, this also means that the story is being brought to its originally designed genre of thriller. Yet it's quite regrettable that the subject of the main theme, the Illuminati, feels lacking in comparison of Da Vinci Code's main plot. Tom Hanks' role as the intelligent yet faithless scholar is a straight continuance from his role in Da Vinci Code. Ewan McGregor can play the character with the hidden agenda very well; his character will turn out very nice especially to those previously oblivious to the story through the book. Stellan Skarsgaard also bring out nice color to this movie.",7,1,2,22 September 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A lot less action, still a nice continuance to the story
","Continuing right after the last scene of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), Katniss finds herself now among the rebels in District 13, or at least what's left of it on the surface. Plutarch and the rebels take her to meet The rebellion leader President Coin who asks her to be the rebellion's symbol, The Mockingjay, to incite the remaining districts to unite in rising up against the Capitol. Still in shock that nobody tells her or Peeta about the whole op and also remorseful from losing Peeta, Katniss eventually agrees after being shown the destruction of her home in District 12, but she demands the rescue of Peeta, Annie and Joanna. They then try to shoot propaganda videos to air to all of Panem, but to not wholeheartedly by from Katniss. Meanwhile, The Capitol already airs it's own propaganda with Peeta in it. After Haymitch's suggestion, the rebels send Katnis, Gale and a camera crew to the torn District 8. The crew get Katniss's emotion in the hospital and the rebel fighters' spirit for seeing her. But The Capitol gets word of Katnis being there and sends bombers on her and the hospital. Using her modified arrows from Beetee, Katniss shoots down the bombers, and is then overwhelmed by emotions when seeing the hospital's burning remnants. The footage, with Katniss' unscripted tag-line 'If we burn, you burn with us!', translates into a great fire in the hearts of the Districts, inciting sabotages all around. The Capitol reacted with another Peeta video, this time holding a white rose and addressing Katniss personally to stop the rebellion. As Katniss suggested, they revisit District 12 for another video to show to Peeta. This time, Katniss sing an unscripted song 'Necklace of Rope/Hope' that becomes the anthem of the rebellion. Some rebels in District 5 blow off the power plant dam, disabling power to The Capitol. In response, Peeta is aired live for another propaganda. But Beetee manages to hack the system and mix the song footage in it. Peeta is caught on air as seeing it and soon shouts out a warning that Capitol bombers are heading to 13. After safely securing everybody in the bunker, President Coin decides to wait out the attacks since apparently The Capitol forces doesn't know about the upgraded situation of the underground District 13. After the attacks, the rebels ask Katniss to make a response video stating that she, District 13 and the rebellion is still alive. But she breaks down after seeing the heap of white roses, Snow's sign that he's going to kill Peeta soon. A rescue attempt is then set up, with Gale volunteering for it. The team's hovercraft flies past The Capitol's disabled guns while power there hasn't been restored. But suddenly power is restored, and the rebels lost radio communications to the rescue team. Katniss then quickly asks to air herself to speak to Snow, in order to buy time for the rescue team. But even after some talk, Snow reveals he knows about the rescue team and then cuts the connection. After some time, The team returns safely with Peeta, Annie and Joanna. But Gale says he couldn't get why the active guns didn't shoot at them. Katniss goes to see Peeta, but he suddenly tries to kill her. It turns out that Peeta is brainwashed by The Capitol to kill Katniss.The story nicely captures and focuses more on the emotional and propagandistic side of the saga's chapter. I think it's proved that the decision to split the final book the saga into two movies is actually the smart move to do. Although I should say that the movie becomes really lacking in the action side, especially in comparison with it's predecessors, at least the movie kept itself as a significant part of the entire saga.That said, I also want emphasize on the fact that this movie lacks very much on the action side. This becomes even more visible when we compare it to the previous two movies of the novel trilogy's adaptation. There's only practically the District 8 hospital bombing scene which has enough to taste as an adequate action sequence. Yet even that only consists of a short duration, and there's only one scene where Katniss really shoots with her bow. However, the movie does realize this as a consequence of splitting the book into two movies. The producers really tries to capitalize on the other aspect of the book's 'calm before the storm' part. The emotional content, the psychological warfare and propaganda feels rightly as the movie's main and center ingredient. Although I must also note that in the span of two hours, the video and counter video storyline has the risk of becoming boring very soon. Yet again, the producers make the content of the Katniss videos very intriguing in this adaptation.Moreover, the the ending's twist proves to be a nice link to the second part as it ensures the curiosity of viewers, especially those like me who haven't read the books yet.The acting side is quite a nice overall. It can live up to the acting quality of the precious films. Although I must admit that for me Jennifer Lawrence's performance isn't that much intriguing as what she did in the first movie. Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hofman and Woody Harrelson nicely give their performance a good notch to live up to the saga, connecting the story nicely amidst all those dying characters.Overall for me The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) is a 7 out of 10 score movie. An entertainment it surely is, and a good adaptation of the continuance of the story. Yet I should also warn you that some people may feel this movie a bit different than the previous Hunger Games movies due to the lack of action in it.",7,5,21,24 November 2014
Vertigo," Great plot, as always from Hitchcock's works
","The story opens up strongly, introducing one key element to the whole plot. The plot itself unravels very nicely giving out the details bit by bit. I really like the main twist, although I kind of regret its positioning that kind of spoils quite about everything. The end twist tried to compensate for it but it's way much more predictable after the main twist spoils it all. Though personally I like Rear Window better than this movie, I think Vertigo can still make it to the great movies list because this movie serves a tale that is more focused on the psychological side of the mystery thriller. The acting side is nice in overall. It's always nice to see James Stewart's performance. Kim Novak can really give Stewart the balancing performance.",7,1,3,18 September 2014
Howl's Moving Castle," Entertaining but not as much as other Studio Ghibli's works
","The movie opens slowly with intriguing first scene. It brings the viewers to another fantasy world definitive of Studio Ghibli. But this time the world setting gets to feel more victorian, steampunk and technological besides being magical. The story floats in and out of contrasting conflicts, another signature of Japanese anime aimed at various age groups. Yet I don't like how the movie keeps changing Sophie's age back and forth without any clear explanation. The story also ends quite abruptly with the background conflict of the war just ceasing out unclear. The voice acting on the Japanese version is a standard Japanese work with less dramatic voice acting yet with more quirky voice timbres.",4,1,3,12 September 2014
The Monuments Men," Not That Good For That Good A Cast
","The Monuments Men tell us the story of World War II Allied side constructing a team of artists scholars, and scientists, mostly American, who have been drafted into the military. Their job is to secure the pieces of works of art of occupied European countries and to find the missing pieces. The concept is good, focusing on one of the other sides of the war, in this case the reality of German Nazis seizing works of art from the war zones. But the story is quite ordinary, a pretty straightforward of team assembly, team goes to the field, team does what their task is. It doesn't really contain a twist or something to keep audiences on their seat. For me personally, the movie is not recommendable to go see in the cinema. Steady story build-up with a rather slow pace doesn't really maximize the potential of the cast of actors and actresses. And for a movie tagged as Action on IMDb, it doesn't have enough action in it. Yet the movie has a good main cast of great, yet somewhat aging LOL, actors and actresses.George Clooney, Matt Damon and John Goodman is being busy with back to back filming after 'Gravity', 'Behind The Candelabra' and 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Though it is kinda strange to see Bill Murray in a significant role after quite a long time, especially as a soldier. Cate Blanchett is just plain simple in this movie.Well, at least one good thing of the movie is we get to see Omaha beach of Normandy's condition after the hell of D-Day landing in 'Saving Private Ryan'. The film has many spots for jokes. It has nice insertions of mild verbal jokes. It even fill in funny moments of clumsy soldiers in a firefight with a teenage sniper. And Matt Damon doing the dud landmine is just awkwardly stupid after 3 movies of Bourne Trilogy, LOL. The film's musics reminiscent of classic old school 1970s-ish war movies. This can be somewhat good and familiar to the older generations, yet it is strange and a bit weird for us the generations of the millennial birth. For me, it's a 5 out 10 movie score.",5,2,3,24 February 2014
Requiem for a Dream," A serious movie about a dosed out generation
","The story is not that great. Sure it comes from a rarely used basic premise of addicts and junkies, but the story unfolds so very predictably. The thing that makes it special is the execution, of how all the technical stuff bind together to create a hallucinating movie experience. Moreover, I watched this movie right after I spent the night before in lacking sleep. It took me some minutes to clear things up and get back on stuff. The technical stuff and I mean all of them, the fast- forward style, the coloration selection, all the messed up camera angles, the irritating and ever-present music scoring, and of course, the gruesome scenes of the consequences make this movie strong in conveying the message of how messed up the life of a junkie is and will be even more. I praise the acting performance by the four main cast. It's clear then how Leto, Connelly and Wayans can gain the trust of some of the big production names to cast them on later works. But I especially salute Ellen Burstyn for her performance that is able to portray the most physically irritating changes of what will happen to a junkie's body. Yet again I give this movie a 6 out of 10 score because in my opinion it is not very suitable for an entertainment. It does help to convey the message of never touch addictive substance for good.",6,0,1,8 July 2014
3:10 to Yuma," Nice post 2000 western
","I rarely look at western movies with high regard since to me there's quite nothing else there is western setting to tell a story from. But this movie proves that we can insert nice drama into the action, even into the age old western base plot of outlaws and lawmen. Although there's simply a huge plot gap whether how did Wade get to be so stupid as in escaping twice already but ending up to recaptured again and again, is quite a flaw for me about this movie. But the ending gives this movie the nice touch it needed to give itself an edge to differentiate it from other westerns. It's very neat to see that finally Wade changed as a character in the end, even that means sacrificing his own gang. The acting overall is good. Russell Crowe is strong as usual in giving life to this type of role he played. Christian Bale did very well in acting up the westerner, yawning up his mouth almost all the entire time. Logan Lerman succeeded in his role and get the attention he needed as a young actor. Having Ben Foster and Kevin Durand nicely completes the whole dangerous aura and mood of the movie.",7,1,2,10 February 2015
The Sound of Music," Worthy of a classic status
","This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness.",7,0,2,22 September 2015
The Equalizer," Nice acting but a bit confused on the character build up
","McCall looks like a normal man who works at a home DIY supply store. Helping coworkers and leading a routine life, he does also have peculiar habits of bringing supplies of his own even when dining at his frequent diner. There he meets Teri, a girl hooked onto some nasty men. Standing idle when seeing Teri being picked up forcefully, McCall takes action after one night he finds her beaten up badly. McCall quickly dispatches five Russian mobsters when a deal for Teri, whose real name is Alina, goes sour, The mafia boss in Moscow sends in Teddy his ex Spetznas henchman to track the killer. Meanwhile, McCall lies low after the incident, but it turns out that his own sense of justice is rekindled, secretly exacting vengeance toughly and often violently those who he encounters while being wronged. His actions soon lead him to focus on disrupting the New York branch of the Russian mafia's operation. Teddy finally catches up to him. After escaping several of Teddy's attempts on his life, McCall contacts his old colleagues in the CIA for info on Teddy. It turns out that McCall was an elite black ops operative who faked his own death in exchange for a quiet life. With his new info, McCall plans to take out the Russian mafia kingpin, Pushkin. But Teddy finds McCall's 'weakness', those he cares about. He then takes McCall's coworkers as hostages to reel him in. McCall tactically dispatches Teddy and his men, without having any conventional weapon. He then finishes his plan on Pushkin, making it to look like an accident. After that McCall receives many e-mails asking for help on similar cases.The story kind of opens weakly, focusing on the mystery of the main character's background and building on the peculiar things he does. This approach kind of loses its relevance when out of a sudden McCall launches on his slow motion weakness analysis scene. If not for the promotion as a action movie and the TV series background, not many viewers will get the connection between McCall and his ability here. Also, the slow motion analysis thing is nothing new as we can have a better and more entertaining version in Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes movies. They are more detailed with all those commentaries on them.Again, having the main character's background not developed adequately feels quite strange to those who watch this movie without knowing beforehand the movie's background as based on a TV series. This feels strange because the movie has so many places to put hints and minor details that could subtly point McCall's background out. Well at least the story unravels itself very much predictably. That means there's nothing unpredictable with this movie, no surprising plot twist nor a grand finale. There's even a poorly done story deviation on the sequence of Teddy's brush with the Irish, which doesn't really contribute anything to the greater picture. Yet the story nicely depicts a black ops supposedly uncanny resourcefulness in using mostly everyday items for combat or even medical purposes. The action bits are quite sufficient for my expectations. You can't really expect aging stars as Denzel Washington to have action scenes with a lot of heavy motions here and there. Antoine Fuqua compensates this by using closer takes on the action scenes, particularly on the fighting parts. There is also not much running or any other classic action moves such as duck-and-roll. The acting feels nice in overall. Denzel Washington really can act out any kind of character you throw him. His calm composure really depicts what we expect from an experienced elite black ops guy, especially if we compare his role here to his other more talkative roles such as in Training Day or The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. Marton Csokas is very much at home with this kind of role as his similar role in xXx alongside Vin Diesel was his first big break. Chloe-Grace Moretz second performance this year makes this movie better. Here she shows that she can take on the varied nature of characters.My final word for The Equalizer is that this movie deserves just a mere 6 out of 10 score. A recommendation is quite a so-so decision. Honestly it's quite entertaining as a movie, but all the predictability of the story and the not-so-solid character building has left some damage to the overall presentation.",6,1,4,3 October 2014
The Longest Yard," A nice remake of the crazy original
","I watched the original Mean Machine before I saw this, and I think the screenplay did quite a great job in recreating the game in the different game environment. The story rolls out very predictably as it goes out as almost an exact copy of the original. At first the only thing kept me watching was the curiosity of who's going to play what character. But as the movie progresses, it's nice to see some variations here and there beside the whole game being changed from the football that the rest of the world know to the football Americans know. It's great that this movie has more humor compared to the original Mean Machine. I like how the movie twists the death of one of the characters into something more touching compared to the original. Also the last scene where Crewe is aimed at is a very nice touch that set this movie apart nicely from the original. It's nice to see many faces, especially those hard faces of action actors, making the merrier out of this movie. And it's great that the can handle jokes too. Sandler performed nice here, although it's quite strange to see that he can take on those violence and not get injured.",6,0,0,19 August 2014
Skyfall," A great way of telling a Bond story
","The movie serves us a story that goes very personal to the James Bond character. You can see that the villain, although well played, still lacks the menacing character. In one sense the movie serves us a warning that in this interconnected world rises a new kind of threat, one that can be done from anywhere in the world with just a laptop and an internet connection. But still what allures people to watch this movie is really the more personal conflicts of the characters; both James Bond of having to return from his 'death', and having have to retreat to his childhood home, and also M of having to face the ghost from her past. One thing to add, the movie serves great nostalgic references to the older movies in the franchise. The acting overall still feels great. Daniel Craig's James Bond portrayal is for me the best so far in comparison to the other Bonds. Judi Dench did great in her farewell M role. Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe filled the Bond girl slots nicely. Ralph Fiennes seems underutilized here, but I think the next movie will extend his role more.",8,2,5,7 November 2015
50 First Dates," A unique yet touching concept
",The story serves a really rare medical condition as the base of a quirky yet very touching romantic story. To be able to make someone fall in love with you again every single day is a herculean effort if we really think about it. Presenting this concept in a comedy really brings it to a very fun level. I really like the early parts where Henry would do over ad over his mistakes with newer and newer ways. The practical jokes are very much entertaining. I really like how Lucy bludgeons Ula in helping Henry. All the side ingredients also fared well. The things with Alexa and Doug comes in well and funny to the end. The acting job is a very goo overall. Adam Sandler manages to be still funny amidst the story that is more focused on the romantic and touching side. Drew Barrymore acted out great as the girl who gets her memory wiped out clean every single morning. Having additional big names such as Sean Astin and Dan Aykroyd sure didn't hurt this movie.,7,2,2,6 May 2015
Catch Me If You Can," Great job by Spielberg both technically and story-telling wise
","The movie opens up very very uniquely. Using the old show as a frame, it takes the audience's already owned recognition of DiCaprio to start telling the story chronologically. I really like how the movie immerses the audience in Frank's story. The movie moves forward nicely from event to event to depict the milestones in Frank's check forgery career. Also the cinematography at times indulges the audience with great moving shots. The acting work in overall is a great work. Having the cast comprise of an ensemble is a good thing to balance DiCaprio's acting in the scenes and also grab attention for them. Leo DiCaprio, despite his older age, managed to grab the youthful energy as an adolescent here. Tom Hanks did also well in portraying the relentlessness of the agent.",7,1,3,27 November 2015
The Hangover," Not a strong comedy, but it has some nice ingredients
","Well the story sure presents something fresh at the time this movie was released. The story combines the classic element in comedy, mischief, and adding in the newer ingredient of the retarded friend in the character Alan to offset the whole situation. I must say that the comedies are really not that funny. Despite the movie being very much unpredictable, I only find some of the jokes kick in and made laughs. The ones in the police station and the ones with Mike Tyson are really the ones that made me laugh hard. But the movie is still quite a good comedy in overall. Having Bradley Cooper act in a quite crazy of a comedy here is surely a nice touch. It really adds to the acting overall, which is slightly above the standard for me. Zach Galifianakis nicely plays the retard, having most of the comedies originate from. Ed Helms balances the three main characters as the one who tries to sober the other two. Justin Bartha nicely played out his part on the opening part that it feels like his character really is an integral part of the movie, which he really isn't.",6,0,0,3 February 2015
Child 44," Too bad the story is not so tightly knot
","The story as a whole falls far from the category of being a good movie story. The movie has a good opening and character development. The story also has good twists and turns, and also all those predictable and suspicious moments of opportune revenges among colleagues. Yet the story part where it has the movie's own title, the one about the child murders, instead only has a little and less meaningful part to the movie as a whole. It's only used as a bridging part to set Leo's life story in continuance. Also the story doesn't really close or solve all those plot holes left at the movie's end. The acting overall feels nicely suiting to the described time period and location. Although the bad part is that all the cast really over used accentuation on their dialog that they sounded mumbling almost all the time, even including Tom Hardy's performance. But Tom Hardy really grasps his character well and his performance is nicely gripping. Noomi Rapace nicely worked out her role and so did the antagonist in Joel Kinnaman. Gary Oldman nicely completes the angles for the story's continuance.",6,3,6,27 July 2015
United 93," The movie gives me the shivers of memory
","The story somewhat relates to me. I remember I was a first year high school student back then watching the local news TV at night when the station suddenly cuts to a Breaking News section showing live footage from CNN, and only a few moments after that I saw the second plane rammed into the WTC's Tower 2. A few minutes later the news and pictures of the United 93 wreck site also appeared. Paul Greengrass sure did wrote a very fine story that really gives me the shivers. It especially does so on the second part when the movie focuses more on inside the plane. The majority of the first part got the artistry very nice. The transition between scenes and dialogs kept the intense and confused mood very tight. But it all wears its appeal until the more thrilling second part jumps in. The acting overall is quite a decent job, although I think it's Paul Greengrass' genius directing job which did the movie a great deal.",7,0,0,14 March 2015
Casablanca," A nice story with a great background on it
","The story is one of a simple romance, nothing really special about it. But the the background upon which the romance is built is nicely set. It's set on a world war II environment, while it may not be the only one, yet it may well be one of the first to do so. Also it offers a different look at the war environment, which through Morocco's Casablanca buffer state. which offer the condition where Nazi officials and resistance members can face one another without necessarily fearing an immediate shootout. Bogart acted out just as the other actors of the time period, using fake and forced out accent in his speech. On the other hand, Bergman tried to act naturally and quite succeeded, especially with the help of her softer European accent.",7,0,1,8 July 2014
If I Stay," Stronger drama aspect for the teen/young adults
","The movie tells about a young girl Mia Hall. The movie goes alternating back and forth between the stories of her past and the present story of her family's car accident. The past stories elaborate on her relationship with Adam; how they first met, going through differences between them, break ups and reconciliations, and the conflict between them when Mia chose to go to Julliard while Adam decides to continue on with his band. The present story is a day when Mia is waiting for a response letter after her admittance audition on a snowy day. Her parents notice her anxiety and ask her to go on a ride. The innocent joy ride turns out to be a disaster when a car from the opposite direction swerves and ran straight head on to the family's car. Mia wakes up on the side of the road as the paramedics tend to her family andher. Being out of her body and having no one responding to her, she stayed with her body to the hospital. There she soon learns that her parents are killed instantly and that her brother survives the crash but is sustaining heavy injuries. She also learns that being conscious outside of her body and hanging on a thread between life and death, she has to make the decision whether to keep on fighting to go back to her body and continue on with her changed life, or to just let go. Through some flash backs of her own as she sees many people close to her come and visit her at the hospital, and ultimately seeing Adam relenting and deciding to go with her to New York after he tells her that she got into Julliard, Mia finally sees the white light and returns to her body and wakes up.Being based on a teen/young adult novel, the movie is bold enough to introduce a newer kind of story flow style, the alternating back and forth style, to the teen and young adult audience. I said so because movies aimed especially at this market, particularly in recent years' releases, have never used such a style. This is good because it kind of demands the viewers to be more intellectual in enjoying how the story is being told. This movie opens kind of slowly before the main conflict settles in. But it already started with the back and forth style even before the main conflict takes place. Like all recent teen/young adult movie, the ingredient mix of a teen couple romance and some degree of fantasy works well for the story. Unlike the others of its kind, the drama side is very strong in this movie. The fantasy side seems like it's only there to give this story some depth to it. For me that's quite good so that the current teen generation that's been growing up with all the Harry Potters and Twilights and even Hunger Games can learn to appreciate the drama side of a story.Chloe-Grace Moretz' acting quality sure does increases since the last I saw her in Kick-Ass 2. She can really handle the close up scenes nicely, depicting the right facial expressions. Jamie Blackley provided the nice balance for the story, although he doesn't quite really balance Moretz' performance. It's quite funny to see Mireille Enos as a good mother here after the last time I saw her in Sabotage.A 7 out of 10 score is from me without hesitation for If I Stay (2014). It's a good drama entertainment and a teen movie altogether. A recommendation is a sure nod from me.",7,0,2,9 September 2014
John Wick," All for a dog
","Enter the world of mob hit men, John Wick was the greatest the Russian mob ever had as a hired asset, dubbed not as the Boogeyman, but as the one they call to kill the Boogeyman. John then retires after finding a girl and marrying. Recently losing his wife to an illness, John receives her final gift, a dog he named Daisy, so that he can continue on loving something. One day, Iosef, the Russia mob's crown prince who don't know the mob's history, attacked John, killing Daisy and taking John's '69 Boss Mustang, after John previously denied his offer to buy the car. The Russian mob kingpin Viggo, Iosef's father, tried to negotiate with John, only for john to hang up the phone on him. John easily snuff out the hit men Victor sends at him. Viggo hires Marcus, John's old friend to kill John. Meanwhile John goes to stay at the Continental hotel, which is actually a neutral place where hit men don't kill each other. He meets old acquaintances there; Perkins and Winston, who informs him of Iosef's location. John storms the place, killing many henchmen, but Iosef slips away. When John returns to the Continental, Marcus has a clean shot opportunity at him, but he shoots a warning shot as Perkins storms into the room. John neutralizes her, extracts some info and leaves her to another 'hotel guest'. John goes and burns Viggo's money stash but then he gets caught. As Viggo leaves John for his two henchmen to kill, Marcus snipes one of them and John takes care of the other. He then storms at Viggo but he lets Viggo live after he tells him Iosef's location. John storms the place and quickly kills Iosef. Viggo doesn't stand still and has Perkins kill Marcus for not killing John when he had the chance. The Continental's 'management' goes to Marcus's place and execute Perkins for breaking the Continental's rule. They also inform John of Viggo's location. John storms the place, impeding Viggo's run. John and Viggo have a final fight where John intentionally lets himself get stabbed by Viggo only to lock his arm, retake the knife and jam it to Viggo's neck. John then gets another dog from a dog shelter.Okay, I admit the story feels like a lame choice for a movie. For me personally, it even gets to feel like a guilty pleasure. There's no real invention at the story; a hard boiled killer going out his retirement to exact revenge. There's really nothing new added to this movie. It's even so very predictable in how the story unravels itself. All the elements of a classic ninety-minute revenge action movie is there; the cause, the conflict, the hunt, and the target escaping once or twice before the final showdown.Yet I find that this movie really knows what other elements to maximize to compensate for the mediocre story. It nicely grasp the dramatization of the revenge cause as a sad story but also simultaneously as funny. I really like the screenplay and dialog emphasize this on the way Aurelio explains his story and Viggo's reaction early on. The dialog on that part is a superb piece that cracked my laugh. But then it gets back to serious as we see John stroking the dead Daisy's head.The action is also a strong point in this movie, possibly even it's strongest point. Unlike typical action movies, this movie doesn't offer realistic tactical firefights as the most of the shootings happen in up and close point blank range. There's also less of beautifully choreographed martial arts trade of moves as the fights quickly turn into ground grappling moves which is the most realistic choice to go in the real world. Instead at times the character John Wick presents us with quite a combination of gun shooting and fighting, making him look like he's doing a hard and stylish action of 'gun dance'.The acting is just a decent overall work for me. Keanu Reeves did great in portraying the calm hit man exacting his revenge. Michael Nyqvist did quite well in portraying a balance of all the aspects of Viggo's character; the ruthlessness and also the cowardice. Having Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo also did the movie a great favor, although I think that they deserve even more significant parts.John Wick (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score for me. A recommendation is definitely a yes. Although without any unique thing to offer in the story department, this movie can sure make up for it at the action side, and making the early irony something fun to watch.",8,8,22,3 November 2014
Kung Fu Panda," Jack Black's influence all over
","Like all other animations this movie sure took its time in developing the critical characters. Although maybe for this movie one might feel that it takes too much time in developing those characters that it feels that the character development still happens just until the main conflict, which is quite sudden for animation movie story flow. The jokes are absolutely funny, not necessarily because of the jokes itself, but because of Jack Black's comedic aura. I've watched two versions of this movie, one with original Enlish dialog with Jack Black's voice and one with dialog dubbed into Indonesian. The Indonesian version didn't have the jokes to be cracking laughs due to the dubber lacking Black's comedic prowess. The voice acting overall is nicely almost entirely Jack Black's influence. And that's quite fair in my view since his mark is all over the movie.",6,0,0,16 July 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Very hilarious, very enjoyably entertaining
","The movie opens up very crazily funny. It still retains the signature man dressed as a woman role with the crazy voice from what we see in the Holy Grail from four years earlier. But compared to the Holy Grail, this movie builds its comedic moments far more better with beats which are easier to understand. This is in comparison with the Holy Grail's beats which mostly depend on instant laughter with shorter builds, being more practical even in the dialog part jokes. Life of Brian offers the jokes more intelligently built with enough build up time that makes the laughs even more logical and relate-able. I personally enjoy the stoning scene, the slogan spelling scene, and the mistaken messiah scenes. The acting is not really different from what the Holy Grail presented, just a bunch of crazy old English comedians having their funny way about things.",7,1,3,4 October 2014
The Big Lebowski," A great ride in a laid back mood
","The story is so nicely lightweight that the whole case is actually dismissible from the entire movie. All those crazy antics The Dude does, and the stupid practical jokes that his responses make is just hilarious. I really like the marmot gag and the ash spreading gag, they are very entertaining. The character building is also very strong. The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role. Having Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare really adds very nicely, while Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman complete the angles needed for the story.",7,4,5,30 January 2015
Unbreakable," Taking our childhood reading into a more serious nature
","The movie opens up cryptically with puzzle pieces about the story. It then develops slowly and shocks with the revelation of the main conflict. The mystery aura, which was held up in the background, appear to the surface and stays there even until at the ending. The sad overall aura is constantly kept all along the entire movie. All those flashes helps a bit in explaining the mystery of David's powers. There are quite strange scenes for me, though. For instance, David's moral value looks slightly contradicted at when he's bench pressing and when his son points a gun at him. The story gives a large room for a sequel, but that would make it into another superhero movie, which won't be able to compete amid the recent trend of superhero movies. Bruce Willis acted out the sad mood very nicely, it looks like what he did in Twelve Monkeys. Samuel L. Jackson acted out the calm nicely that the end twist, although very much predictable with all those abundance of hints, feels still nice when it comes.",6,0,1,8 October 2014
Fury," Great tank battles and tank crew story
","April 1945, Nazi Germany. Don Collier leads his tank Fury's crew Bible, Gordo, and Grady after an ambush wipes out the rest of their platoon, killing his assistant driver. At the base, Don, speaking German himself, takes the liberty to crudely interrogate a Nazi POW on the spot. A young soldier Norman Ellison is assigned to replace the fallen driver, to the reluctance of Fury's crew. When Fury and four others convoy at a forest's edge, Norman spots a kid in Nazi uniform with a gun but hesitates to shoot, and the lead tank gets hit. The soldiers manage to retaliate, and Don smacks Norman, stating the soldiers' deaths are Norman's fault for not shooting. The remaining tanks then go to rescue soldiers in a field. When a fight breaks out, again Norman doubts to shoot. As the Americans win, Don holds Norman forcing him to kill a Nazi POW. Norman confronts Don about it. Don states Norman endangers Fury's crew by not doing his job, whereas Don promised to keep them alive. The tanks go to secure a town. A battle breaks out. The crew fires incendiaries, burning alive two Nazis, which Norman shoots. Gordo tells him he should've let them burn. A civilian informs the soldiers of surrendering Nazis and they agree to it. An SS officer appears and Don orders a soldier to kill him, after confirming this officer hanged civilians refusing to fight for the Nazis. As the soldiers celebrate, Don and Norman see a girl and go there. Don asks the older woman there to prepare food and water, and gives Norman a chance to be alone with the younger woman Emma. The rest of Fury's crew arrive, disappointed they weren't invited. They then go for the next mission. Artillery barrages the town, killing Emma. Don then takes the tanks to secure a crossroads from an advancing unknown number of Nazis. On their way, a superior Tiger tank kills off one of them. The remaining three tries to maneuver at it as their guns can't pierce its armor. The Tiger manages to kill the other two but Fury manages to shoot at its rear, it's only weak point. Fury reaches the crossroads but is immobilized as it triggers a land mine. As the crew fix the tracks, Don sends Norman as a lookout. Norman rushes back to Fury, informing the crew of hundreds of Nazis heading their way. The other men wants to flee but as Don refuses to do so, they eventually rejoin him for one last battle. They prepare guns and ammo and pass time talking. The Nazis come closing in, assuming the tank's busted. The crew opens fire, killing many. Norman runs out of ammo and the crew fights on to retrieve exterior mounted guns and ammo. One by one the crew is killed. Don is eventually shot several times by a sniper and he retreats inside Fury. Norman tells Don that he's scared and wants to surrender. Don tells him to escape through the bottom hatch. As Norman does so, Don is killed by the German grenades. A Nazi soldier crouches and finds Norman under the tank but he didn't say a word. As the morning comes, advancing US troops find Norman and retrieve him, stating he is a hero.The story pits the moral contradictions in a war in such high extremes. Moreover, it shows that in such a situation of kill or be killed, often times there won't be enough time to choose, let alone to think. Failure to act can result in getting killed, or getting someone else killed. And after going through such hardships, having escaped and evaded death at times, one will surely find it hard to hold on his principles. One might even find it hard to stay sane.The movie's vast reference to the Holy Bible somehow looks like it's trying to be such an ironic thing. It has gone well beyond the classic paradox of 'Thou shalt not kill' versus a soldier's duty of kill or be killed. The references are there, subtly and also distinctively, at the grand theme of reaffirming a soldier's cause to fight, and therefore to kill, by saying that it's the will of God, which builds on the said classic paradox. Thereference include the many scripture quotes, the direct nick-naming of Bible for Boyd Swan character, and also the ultimate reaffirming of the last shot's bird's eye angle.The action is really nice, especially as there are less high profile movies focused on World War II tank crew. After having only The beast (1988) as a significant movie on tanks for quite a while, and that's not even entirely a war film, it's very nice to see great tank battle here in Fury. What's great about the action, particularly is the two tank battle sequences. They don't feature massive tank-on-tank all out shelling, but the real war situations where tanks are used mainly to cover for infantry movements.For me the acting is a great job. The big names in the cast list really knows how to make the contrast of actions within the screenplay come out. Brad Pitt did a great job on being strict and harsh, and added in the nice accent play. Logan Lerman nicely depicts the fears, doubts and hesitations a newbie soldier has in the face of war atrocities, adequately balancing Brad Pitt's acting. Shia Lebouf really developed his acting and got out of his Sam Witwicky character nicely, playing his soldier role well. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal not only complete the real tank crew structure but they also provide contrasting characters that give the crew ensemble great potential for internal conflicts.Fury (2014) is indeed a movie worthy of an 8 out of 10 score for me and a quick nod at recommendations. An entertainment it surely is, and a great new breath of fresh air for the focus on tank crews.",8,2,6,28 October 2014
Akira," A strong classic SciFi plot, but the technicalities don't really impress me
","The movie presents one of the classic plot line of Modern SciFi, the emergence and rise of a superhuman power. It also develops like all the rest of its sub genre, having the powers develop into something wild, uncontrollable by the wielder, and then wreak havoc on an epic scale. Looking at the release time frame, I think it's possible that this movie actually influences many of the sub genre movies. Thus the plot line may be considered one of the classics. But I really don't see wealth of enjoyment in looking at the technicalities. Despite the world setting is carefully built, it doesn't really seem to be explored so much in the movie. The movie's coloration choice of having few contrasting colors makes it boring if only the the story is not that strong. The emotions depicted are also quite hyperbolic as characters show disgruntled faces all too often. The vice acting is as usual the standard Japanese hyperbolic where characters shout overly at all things.",5,5,9,5 February 2015
Citizen Kane," It's not that bad, but it sure is not any good
","Okay, this movie is one of those that makes feel stupid for not being in the unison voice of liking it, and at the same time wondering how the heck can this movie land a top spot of great movie lists. The technicalities do support it's status as one of the greats, pioneering those never before seen shots or sequences like the first and last shots, the use of peculiar angles of the cameras, decent effort at age make up, and the use of non linear back and forth story flow styling. But I do agree with those voices that say that the story is entire empty, it does not offer you anything. For me, it's better even the one in The Wolf of Wall Street of even The Great Gatsby, for extreme comparisons. I now have a suspicion that this movie's story is the one to blame as a subliminal campaign that downgrade the moral of the American people due to focusing on the notion that it's okay to get divorced twice as long as you're rich or the sort.",4,1,3,14 September 2014
The Maze Runner," Not a solid movie as a whole
","A kid wakes up memory-less to some boys, all similarly memory-less, in The Glade, a clearing surrounded by walls of a maze. He remembers his name Thomas as he learns about The Glade; every morning the maze door opens to different sections changing each week, and closes every evening, monsters called Grievers roam the maze at night killing anyone inside, their sting makes the victim go kind of berserk, it's been three years since the first boy came here, every day 'runners' explore the maze looking for an exit to no avail. When a runner is stung by a Griever and sent to die in the maze, The leader Alby goes into the maze retracing the path. Alby returns wounded, carried by the lead runner Minho, just as the door closes. Thomas runs to them, helping to hide Alby from Grievers. He and Minho trick and squash a Griever. The next morning the 'box' elevator shocks everyone, sending a girl with a note 'She's the last one EVER'. Newt, the second in command, decides to punish Thomas for going into the maze but makes him a runner for the next morning. Thomas and Minho retrieve a device from the Grievr carcass. They then match the device to the maze map pattern. The girl Teresa wakes up and talks to Thomas, giving two syringes which Thomas figures out as Alby's cure. Thomas goes to his punishment when the night comes. The next morning, Thomas and Minho reenter the maze, finding new paths with the device. As they go back, the door doesn't close and Grievers attack that night. After that, Thomas uses a Griever tail to sting himself, discovering after Alby wakes up that it helps return some memory back. Injected with the last syringe, Thomas wakes up knowing he and Teresa were part of the people who put them all in there. Gally, the third in command, decides to offer Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers. But the Gladers are divided; some support Gally while the others want follow Thomas out of there. Thomas' group retrace the new path and Teresa enters the code from the map while the Griievers attack. They escaped and found labs with dead scientists. A video explains what happens; the Gladers were test subjects for brain activity to find a cure for the Flare, a virus attacking the brain, happening after the apocalyptic disaster years ago. But the final scene reveals that there are still more than meets the eye.The story plot looks like an attempt to even more dramatize the novel's original plot. It changes the novel's story quite significantly, opting out some details and thus inevitably changing the nature of some of the significant characters and their roles in the story. In the movie, the story changes from one that has great emphasize to the individual characters and their relationships, to one that only thinks about the characters getting out of the maze.Having only one female in the significant character roster, the movie tries to insert a significant dose of action sequences. This enables it to be recognized as an action genre, and also adding up the ingredients to attract the male young adult viewers, the demography less targeted by most movie releases. It will surely be a great move if only the action sequences are that good. Instead, within the all running actions we only see the characters run, merely run, without any real variation in their moves. The slightest variation comes when the Griever attacks come in. And even those scenes only present the boys to be clueless in what they're doing.The mystery aura is quite well kept for about half of the duration. It's done using the medium paced flow and all those 'I only know this' dialog lines. It's still looked maintained for the rest of the duration, but as the focus slightly yet surely shift to the more action oriented sequences, with faster paced story flow, the mystery feels reduced of it's significance.The acting is just a decent overall performance. Having no senior names on the cast sure takes it's toll in the mentoring of the young talents. Dylan O'Brien does his first lead role In a big-budget movie doesn't really disappoint. It's just that the whole movie doesn't seem to have a solid bound over everything it offers. Kaya Scodelario fails to make her only female character in the story to stand out although she did quite okay. Will Poulter used his experience to be confident, yet sometimes over-acted, on his role here.My say s that The Maze Runner (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 from me. A recommendation is just a so-so option from me. This movie is quite an entertainment, yet it falls a little bit short of adequate satisfactory.",6,1,2,24 September 2014
Coraline," A serious presentation in an animation
","The movie may look like it's solely aimed at kids audience with it being animated and the story base is centered on an adolescent girl, but it sure hides a very serious presentation of the story developments. Despite having so much fantasy themed developments here and there but the movie nicely incorporates significant mood and tonal changes in the mix that really charged things up as one watches this movie. The characters nicely developed in their own unique final product that adds so much nuances to the movie and enriching the story as a whole. The overall coloration really supports the whole story, and also the contrasted coloration choice in the 'other' world. I really like how the movie presented moments that might resemble horror movies' jump scares. The voice acting is nicely well. Dakota Fanning did enough in giving life to her role. Teri Hatcher really did well in livening the two opposite characters she voiced.",7,0,0,28 August 2015
Zootopia," Disney masterpiece as usual
","I like how the movie did well in creating the world in overall that the contradictions and conflicts of the main character fits right in and gets identified easily and quickly by the audience. The building for each character is nicely thoughtful. Not just the main characters, but the whole array of side characters got to have great distinctive traits that easily sets them apart even if the movie has only one species portrayed. The conflict resolution should really be a predictable one for seasoned movie goers. But the movie did it that well that the audience enjoy the flow and forgot their awareness about the predictability of the conflict.",7,2,9,9 April 2016
12 Monkeys," Great story elements plus a quirky title
","The story elements are indeed a mix of unique ingredients of viral apocalypse, time travel, and pure insanity. This makes the story quite unique and succeeded in lighting up my curiosity, despite having an old aged sound effects and a minimum amount of visual effects to enjoy. It's nice to sometimes see a time travel movie where the time travel is done not just once or twice, just like in this one. This movie incorporates a nice story flow that tells the story different bits at a time that will only be clear at the ending part. And when it clears out, it's a full circle. I love to see how Brad Pitt gets totally into character in this movie. Bruce Willis also did okay with his part, although many would agree with me that he lost his action side here.",6,0,2,12 July 2014
Mississippi Burning," Great stirring movie on a strong subject
","The movie opens strongly although the sequence is a bit too long in duration hence making it feel a bit too slow. Then the main characters are introduced straightly with clear hints on their characteristics and values right on their first scene. The rest of the movie runs quite slow until about two thirds of the duration, then it goes faster in pace with shorter duration on scenes and sequences. The finale is a predictable inevitability yet it serves greatly in how things turn out to be. The compromise between the two main characters sure makes the unpredictability looks better. The acting is very nice in overall. Gene Hackman sure knows how to handle a hard character like this one. He even can build enough level of ambiguity at the starting points. Willem Dafoe sure can also handle his calm character well. His calm speaking manner is kind of his signature thing of his acting, although that will work even far more better if only he plays the antagonist.",7,1,1,2 October 2014
Rang De Basanti," None of the 2-hour-45minute is wasted in this strong movie
","The story opens up very strongly with those kinds of scenes. It continues on to build up its story in a softer tone and quite literally from scratch. It's a surprise for me this movie actually presents two separate conflicts altogether. What's great about this is that the movie has all its significant characters developed deep enough to mean something in the eyes of the viewers. This is very much true that when the second conflict arrives, it doesn't really need much more duration in building up its content's suspense. What I appreciate even more is that unlike other Indian movies this movie sure uses its duration to the maximum point, reducing the duration of the songs up to minimum. Most of the songs even contain some heavy detail scenes, forcing the viewers, especially those on digital media, not to skip the songs. It's also nice that this movie contains a little bit of assorting genres such as a little bit of action, thriller, and of course romance beside all the heavy drama. The acting side is quite a standard Indian piece, but it can hold as it has a great execution of a great story.",8,2,5,18 September 2014
The Impossible," Great job on the effects and story dramatization
","The movie opens up with the terribly horrifying sound effect, promising some sort of suspense thriller. The story then builds upon the characters and their time there for a while. The center theme of the tsunami comes quite unexpectedly in this movie, just like the real thing did. It's especially so if you're not counting the days and nights since the first time marker at the start of the movie. The effects really nicely grasped what the tsunami did. The makeup on the wounds are also quite exceptional that the close up shots of the wounds make me twitch my eye brows a bit. Yet the real thing is that if you think Thailand was the worst hit place, you should really see Aceh back then. Aceh now have a tsunami memorial monument, a tanker that got carried so far into the land. Naomi Watts really showed that her experience made her into a great actress, especially in acting out the pains. It's just quite strange that she didn't put in any extra weight on her to better depict a mother with three kids. Ewan McGregor really proved his class here; that he was able to act the heart touching story scene.",7,0,0,28 September 2014
The English Patient," A good entertainment based on a nice romance
","This movie is another romance with the background of World War II. But instead of being caged up in a single location, the story sets back and forth nicely between the past in Northern African desert, and the present story perspective of Italy. Though based on a not so exemplary premise of unfaithfulness the romance stirs up well enough, with the help of the alternating story flow. The mood is very nicely kept to a minimum tension. Despite being based on World War II, and having many opportunities which can have the mood rise up, the movie manages to keep out to a minimum by imploring anti-climaxes here and there. On the acting side, this movie presents us with one of the great works by Ralph Fiennes. Juliet Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth also bring out high quality acting on their respective parts. This is truly a nice entertainment worth a watch for me.",7,0,0,12 July 2014
The Notebook," Really enjoyed this romance movie
","The story weaves on while leaving breadcrumbs here and there, weaving back and forth between the old couple with the notebook, and the young couple's improbable love. The movie depicts one of so many Utopian conditions which broken hearted lovers would really prefer over their own sad endings. I really like Ryan Gosling's acting here. He can really maintain the calm character overall yet able to let go bursts of emotions. Rachel McAdams' performance provided the movie with the character in conflict well enough. But for me, I prefer that the character Allie can be played by other actresses who have more beautiful face than her. What's mentionable is that Gena Rowlands and James Garner, playing the older versions, can give acting performances which can balance what Gosling and McAdams have done and retained their characters. I like how this movie is even completed nicely even more with performance by Joan Allen, James Marsden, Sam Shepard, and Kevin Connolly",8,1,2,31 August 2014
The Babadook," Less jump-scares but similarly scary
","Amelia lives only with her son Samuel, who's still afraid of monsters under the bed or in the closet. She proves him repeatedly there's nothing to be afraid of. But he keeps on making a big thing of his fear. This adds to her's own stress from the loss of her husband. One day Amelia tells Sam he can choose a book to rad as bedtime story. He chooses a book Mister Babadook, which scared Sam so much. Amelia takes look at the pages. It says the Babadook will come to a kid demanding him to let it in, then asks the same to the kid's mother, and then it'll leave its disguise and haunt them. The last pages are empty. Amelia then hides the book from Sam. But Sam gets terrified about The Babadook more and more in the next few days, so Amelia tears the Babadook's images from the book and tosses them all in the garbage.After that Samuel starts to blame The Babadook for his mischiefs. Amelia feels he's only making it up until she starts to feel weird things. One day the front door is knocked. There's nobody when Amelia opens it. The knocking continues. When Amelia opens the door again, she finds the book with the torn pages glued back on. Also the empty pages are filled with images of the Babadook shadowing the mother killing her son. Amelia then burns the book but she gets more paranoid and stressed as weirder things happen that makes Amelia afraid to sleep. She then stays up all night for two nights in a row. But as Samuel asks for her motherly care, Amelia has episodes of sudden anger outbursts with her voice changing at times. The second night, she catches Sam calling their old Parkinsonian neighbor Mrs. Roach. Amelia dismisses her, but continues her rage by killing their dog and then chasing after Samuel. She catches up to him but he knocks her out by throwing something hard at her. Amelia wakes up tied with Sam refusing to leave her. Her episodes make her choke Sam as he gets near to hug her. But her inner self wins as Sam strokes her cheek. She then vomits something black and Sam says that she's free. But then Sam tells her she can't make the Babadook go away, and Sam is dragged away by an invisible force. She confronts the force arguing that it's trespassing her house. The Babadook manifests itself as a shadow but then runs away to the basement as Amelia doesn't run from it. Things then seem to go back to normal. Amelia and Sam prepares Sam's seventh birthday party, which was never celebrated due to it's the same day as Sam's father's death who died in an accident taking Amelia to hospital on her delivery day. Amelia collects worms and maggots and bring them to feed something in the basement.For a horror, the story nicely puts a balance in the mix between the horror, drama and thriller aspects. Basing the ghost/monster character on a children's book is also a nice step in serving a fresh take on the horror scene. It also serves nicely in blending in with the family drama aspect where there is the dilemma situation of whether to believe the kid's statements or not. There's also the question of whether to escalate the means in educating the child or not.Not locking the Babadook to a certain narrower definition definitely increases the mystery of the ghost character and distances the movie from it's basic premise of children's imagined fear. In a way, one can view this movie as the horror opposite of the children friendly animation Monsters, Inc (2001) which starts from the same basic premise.Being a drama-horror-thriller, this movie doesn't focus the scares on the all-so-common sudden shocks or also known as jump-scares. Instead the movie forces the viewers to build up anticipation by abundantly presenting depictions of dark rooms and thrilling sound effects. Unfortunately, the other common horror ingredients like lights going on and off, possessions, shrieks and hallucinations all piles up as the movie nears its ending. At that time the horror can retain its scary element only by keeping the Babadook a mystery to the viewers, even after the main characters confront it.The acting is surprisingly good in overall. Honestly I was expecting kind of lower acting quality due to there are only Australian talents less known to me. But Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman can really grab the fact that the story only focus at both of their characters and played their roles convincingly. They can give real enough expressions covering the dramatic sides, the thriller anticipations and the horror scares.For me The Babadook well deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a yes for me due to it being a fresh new take on the horror scene, with less jump-scares but the similar weight of being scary.",7,3,8,1 November 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," Really a great acting work, away from each actor's respective usual characters
","As its story the movie points out a historic event that was the crucial stage for the Catholic Church in England. The movie nicely plays on the character relationship, building enough depth for each character, and nicely shifting the focus to and from Anne and Mary. What's makes it very interesting for me is the level of acting I find in this movie, which a great work in overall. The two main female roles played by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were outside of their own usual characters. Natalie Portman is a frequent at the roles of the protagonist who often gets the sympathy of the audience. In this movie she really succeeded in shedding her usual image and transformed into the ruthless Anne Boleyn this movie envisioned. Scarlett Johansson on the other hand is used to the more challenging role, particularly action roles. But here she really grasped the emotions and mannerisms of a girl being tossed into the politics of the aristocrats. I also enjoy Eric Bana and Jim Sturgess' convincing performance, and was pleased to see the seeds of even greater actors in the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne.",7,0,0,2 May 2015
Little Boy," Very heartwarming and touching rich story
","At the time of World War II, James, a father of two from a small fishing town gets conscripted to fight the Japanese in the Pacific front after having his oldest son Landon denied enlisting in the Army for being flat footed. The younger little boy Pepper seems to be having symptoms of dwarfism and thus gets bullied by bigger kids, including Freedy, the son of Dr. Fox. Pepper is very close to James, who often takes him to see movies and shows of the magician Ben Eagle. In their town lives an old man of Japanese descent Hashimoto. People around town hates Hashimoto and considers him part of the enemy. Pepper's mother Emma gets news that James is being captured as a prisoner of war. One day Pepper gets selected as a volunteer to do Ben Eagle's trick of supposedly move a bottle telepathically. Landon and Pepper acts even further and vandalized Hashimoto's house, sending Landon to jail. Pepper gets sent to the local church where he meets Fr. Oliver who sees his innocence and gives Pepper a list of the works of mercy from Matthew 25:34-46, plus an addition of making friends with Hashimoto. Pepper goes to Hashimoto reluctantly. Hashimoto meets Fr. Oliver and gets explained about the priest's intentions. Pepper goes to see Landon in jail and strikes out 'Visit the imprisoned' off the list. Soon Fr. Oliver goes on an assignment and Pepperis left without anyone to help him with his list.One day Hashimoto helped Pepper escape from bullies. Feeling that he need to better his friendship with Hashimoto, Pepper visits him again and this time Hashimoto offers to help him on the list. With Hashimoto's help Pepper quickly strikes off 'Visit the sick', 'Shelter the homeless', and 'Clothe the naked'. One day Dr. Fox comes by the house offering sympathy and even helps Landon out of jail. Pepper complains to Hashimoto about being small. Hashimoto teaches Pepper to be brave and stand up for himself. For 'Feed the hungry', Emma tells Pepper to invite a friend to eat, to which Pepper invites Hashimoto. But Landon gets angry and kicks him out. Sam, a local who lost his son at Pearl Harbor threatens Hashimoto to leave town. Landon catches up with Hashimoto and Pepper. He yells at Pepper and Pepper challenge his brother about having a faith that can move mountains. Landon stands Pepper up facing the mountain behind the town. As Pepper practices his faith, an earthquake takes place. This makes Pepper believe more in his faith's power and day after day practices on his father's picture and the door to bring him home. A letter comes informing Pepper that for his father to return, the war must first end.Hashimoto tells Pepper where to point out but he also teaches him to do what makes sense to Pepper. Instead Pepper practices his faith pointing out to where the sun touches the water every after noon with the town watching. One day, the war ended after the bomb code-named 'Little Boy' destroyed Hiroshima. But James hasn't come home yet. One night Sam and Landon vandalized Hashimoto's house, and Sam beats Hashimoto up. Landon stays put and gets sent to jail again. Hashimoto survives the ordeal and drops charges, freeing Landon. Emma receives news that James has been killed. The army tell Emma that James is buried in the Pgillipines but Emma holds a funeral ceremony anyway. Hashimoto strengthen Pepper that James' love is contained in the list. But One day an army officer comes and tell Emma that there was a mistake on James' name due to his dog tags got switched to another person, and that James is actually still alive. The family reunite at a hospital.The story is very nice indeed. It's greatly a complete story; it tells us about the real animosity targeted at Japanese descent American during the World War II, but at another angle it also teaches about a kid's innocence and faith at it's fullest. The undertones are also strong; pitting faith against reason, and also giving example about faithfulness. It's not necessarily a Christian movie yet it's filled with great Christian values, without having to be instructional. I like what the movie did repeatedly when it depicts Pepper's faith. The little boy's faith may start in the wrong way from believing in Ben Eagle's powers. But the movie shows that in faith it's not really how you have the faith that matters, but instead how you persevere and persist in practicing your faith and also accept that in the end it all comes back to the will of God. Also, the movie gets balanced enough by having the samurai values put in. But here, the movie wisely chooses the samurai value that doesn't contradict the Biblical value being emphasized. The value Hashimoto taught Pepper can also be seen in the Bible in the example of how David faces Goliath.The acting overall is also a great job. Despite lacking a big name talents aside from the supporting roles by Kevin James and Tom Wilkinson, the movie can really rely on the niceties of its story and how the screenplay and directing job did to amaze. Jakob Salvati did a great job in acting his parts despite his age. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa delivered a very nice performance, carrying his menacing looks from his previous antagonist roles added with a depiction of a sense of wisdom from the East. Emily Watson, David Henrie and Michael Rapaport all provided the necessary angles for Pepper's family.A score of 8 out of 10 is from me for Little Boy (2015), along with a definite recommendation to go see in the movies. Besides being very much heart-warming and touching, this movie can really be a definite family entertainment.",8,1,2,10 August 2015
Ted," Funny, with a lot of maturity warning
","The story opens up like it was meant for kids. This opening kind of takes place for almost twenty minutes or so, pretty long for a movie designated specifically for adult maturity. And then it strikes back at you, especially if you haven't been noticing the transformation montage video, in which the bear turns from a boy bear to a schmuck. The jokes are crazy and most are with very bad sexual intent. But hey sure are very funny and enjoyable. The acting overall is slightly above standards. Mark Wahlberg shows that he can handle crazy comedies beside his usual action roles. Seth MacFarlane's voice to his own writing is just a pure laughable crazy comedy. Mila Kunis adds nicely to the conflict angle. Having Sam Jones is a nice touch to the target age group's nostalgic link.",6,0,0,30 January 2015
The Secret in Their Eyes," Great technicalities supporting a solid story
","The story rolls out in a heavy dose of drama fashion despite the heavy mystery and crime content in it. It tells the story of complicated characters that shocks the viewers at the movie's ending. The technicalities really work great in supporting the story. The heavy dose of close up shots really help to get the viewers to know the characters better. The stadium sequence is just a great sequence of scenes with the illusion of being 'uncut'. One thing that is weird for me is the romance part that is not really balanced. It's quite funny to see all those non suggestive conversations turn into the train scene. The acting sure does help greatly, all the actors can really work their magic with their facial expressions to make the close ups more alive.",7,1,2,5 September 2014
Point Break," Half-baked in overall
","Extreme poly-athlete Johnny Utah and his friend Jeff attempts a stunt traversing a steep ridge peak line, ending it by leaping onto a lone stone column. Jeff over speeds his bike and falls. Seven years later Utah is a FBI Agent candidate. He attends a briefing about a skyscraper heist where the criminals parachute down their escape. Another heist happens where the criminals unload Dollar bills mid-air over Mexico then simply disappear. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who at the same time attempt to complete the Ozaki 8; a teaching of doing eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They already cleared three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah gets sent undercover to France under a field agent Pappas. They reach the place and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave. But as he goes in there's already another surfer in the wave, leaving Utah with unstable wave. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the other surfer Bodhi and his team Roach, Chowder, and Grommet. They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl Samsara. The next day Utah finds the men in an abandoned Paris train station after he overhears them about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he's in the circle. They travel to the Alps for the next ordeal, wingsuit flying through the cliffs. The four succeed in their attempt then have some time together with Samsara. The next day they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding through steep wall of snow. They reach their spot but Utah decides to extend his line so the others follow him. But Chowder slips and falls to his death. Utah gets depressed about it. After a party Samsara explains about her and Bodhi. Next they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates some explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. But Bodhi escapes as Utah can't stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi's sponsor's assets so Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them but it turns out to be Samsara. Utah finds the next ordeal location, solo rock climbing with no safety besides a waterfall. he finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet cramps and falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi but he leaps down the waterfall, completing the last ordeal. But Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal as he bailed out on the wave. 17 months later Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. But ultimately Utah lets Bodhi go and attempt it. The wave engulfs Bodhi and Utah comes back home.I admit I haven't seen the original Keanu Reeves movie. But I already found significant differences just by looking at the synopsis on IMDb. This movie sure packs quite a promise with the new repackaging of adding in an assortment of other extremes sports besides surfing into the mix. What's quite interesting is that the movie's made up teachings of Ozaki 8 managed to steer some interest. Some people, including me, done searches about it on the internet, believing that it was something real but unpopular yet. I say that the story writer did a good thing in this aspect.Yet the movie didn't really capitalize well on this, or should I say didn't even anticipate it. There's no official landing page about the movie anywhere on the internet that those searches should easily link to. The Ozaki 8 would've been one cool thing to interest people into watching this movie instead of relying on the movie being a remake from the 1991 version.The stunts, yes the stunts can also have an appeal. Yet the movie really failed to package this into great rides for the audience. Although there's more extreme sports depicted in this movie, those action sequences didn't really pack any punch, especially if we compare it to similar movies like, say, Vin Diesel's xXx. The stunts here only show the same stuff as what we'd see in cable TV, while like in xXx, there's the contingent thing happening, changing how the sequence carries on and forcing the athlete to improvise. Moreover, there's little cinematography treats offered on those sequences.The acting overall really shouldn't be of much talk as it's just standard level. Luke Bracey didn't really give enough depth for his character even though he's the main protagonist. Edgar Ramirez on the other hand quite managed to portray Bodhi's mysterious and calm nature.Teresa Palmer and Ray Winstone are only in the movie to get some attention to it.A mere 5 out of 10 score is from me for Point Break (2015). A recommendation is a definite no due to the movie being very much half- baked movie.",5,2,5,12 December 2015
Creed," A great up to date addition to the saga
","Mary Anne Creed adopts his husband's son from another woman, Adonis Johnson. Years later Adonis yearns to follow his father's footsteps, fighting small arenas and quitting his job. He goes to his father's old training camp Delphi Gym, challenging the fighters there for his car until he gets defeated by a pro boxer Dan Wheeler. He moves to Philadelphia, tracking Rocky Balboa. He asks Rocky to train him. Adonis asks who won Rocky and Apollo's third unofficial fight, which only few people know. Adonis sees news about the undefeated boxing champion Ricky Conlan who is about to fight Wheeler. But it gets cancelled due to Conlan punching Wheeler. Adonis meets his neighbor Bianca. Later Adonis visits Rocky's old gym at Mick's but he doesn't get any attention. Adonis and Bianca get closer. After visiting Paulie and Adrien's graves, Rocky decides to train Adonis, taking him into his house. Soon the manager at Mick's, Pete, proposes a fight between Adonis and his son Leo. Rocky takes Adonis to Front St. Gym so they can train at different gyms than the opponent. On the fight, Adonis takes hard hits but he can knock Leo out in the third round. news spread about Adonis's lineage. Conlan's trainer meets Rocky and Adonis, proposing a fight between the fighters, to which they agree. But as they continue training, Rocky collapses. He has Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. Adonis eventually finds out about this and demands Rocky to go on chemotherapy. Rocky refuses, saying that it didn't help Adrien when it hit her. Adonis gets into a fight as he dislikes people calling him 'Baby Creed'. Rocky bails him out. Rocky eventually takes therapy as he and Adonis make a deal that he will undergo therapy and Adonis will continue training. Adonis gains more local support as he continues training. Adonis, Rocky and their team fly to Liverpool for the fight. On the press conference Adonis and Conlan almost get into a fight due to Conlan calling him a fake Creed.Before the fight Adonis receives Mary Anne's gift, trunks with Apollo Creed's original colors of the stars and stripes. As the fight commences, Conlan easily owns the first round, cutting above Adonis' right eye. Later Adnis retaliates, cutting Conlan's left cheek bone. They both trade hits through the rounds. AT round 11 Conlan knocks Adonis down, but he gets up again. As the round finishes the doctor examines Adonis shut out left eye, but his team aids him secretly. Round 12 sees brutal hits trading and Adonis knocks Conlan down but he also gets up again. Conlan wins the fight with a split decision but Conlan acknowledges Adonis Creed. As Adonis gets interviewed, he admits Rocky as a family and states he understands what his father did.The movie sets a great new development to the whole Rocky saga. I am part of those people who as a child grew up watching re-runs of Rocky i through IV on TV. They do it quite often when I was a little kid so those movies stayed with me. They were some of the movies which helped me learn enjoy the more dramatic movies.The story in this movie feels so unique. It succeeded in merging the feels gotten from the old Rocky saga and the more contemporary feel of modern pop cinema. All the movie's aspects are comprised of these two aspects. You can see reminisces of the first Rocky movie from the remakes of some of the iconic shots like the gray sweatshirt running scene, the student-mentor conflict between Adonis and Rocky just like Rocky and Mick had, and most of all are the blunt references here and there to the old saga materials like the message on Adonis' training shirt.But the director Ryan Coogler did a great job in keeping the movie relatable to the contemporary generation by having the same feel on the non-sports drama like what Fruitvale Station had. The drama with Bianca feels adequately intimate and close without having to be sexually suggestive. Seeing that Sylvester Stallone gave a go ahead on this movie, I think it'll be a great start for the saga's new focus, all done without leaving the character Rocky behind. Further I think it'll great if the sequels for this can also revive the other old beaten characters like Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago; and even get in sync with the current situation in the real boxing world where we have also many renowned Latin American boxers.I also like how the movie adds something great to the saga technically as there are two long uncut scenes shot amazingly in close-up ranges. One of them is even a great full two rounds of boxing.The acting overall is adequately good. Michael B. Jordan did well in portraying the son who long for a father figure. Sylvester Stallone did great in adding a new stuff into the character Rocky as he faces illness. Tessa Thompson succeeded in elevating her role as not just the love interest. I think it'll be great if she can be Adonis' Adrien.I give Creed (2015) a score of 7 out of 10, and a recommendation surely. Especially for those who, like me, enjoyed the Rocky saga over the years, This movie nicely adds to all that without losing it's grip on the old stories and staying up to date contemporarily.",7,0,3,5 December 2015
The Great Dictator," quite a nice movie, yet then again it's a propaganda movie
","Even though at first Chaplin didn't aim this movie to be a propaganda movie, the best of the era's condition, The World War II, got the best of the production instead. This makes the story feels too much overstretched. The slapstick and silly comedic moments aimed to defame the then common enemy of the Allies, Adolf Hitler, feels too long and too much hyperbolic. I must say though that the comedies are being done nicely. They are funny and enjoyable. The parody covers all aspects that are important about the war. Those include the parody of the symbols used by the Axis, and the other charismatic characters other than Hitler. It's quite nice to see how Chaplin manages in a movie with dialog after so many he did in the silent era.",6,1,4,9 August 2014
The Others," A cliché pioneer of horror plots
","I personally am not a big fan of the horror genre. Yet it has come to my attention that at the time I write this review, one the popular horror plot is the twist where the main characters that the viewers assume as the ones being haunted, are truly the real haunters themselves. And Now, seeing this movie about fourteen years after its original release, I think now I have found the original movie that set the trend for such a plot. Of the small number of horror movies I've seen, I can appreciate the surprise that the plot brings, especially in the part where the twist comes in. In my opinion, the twist served n this movie has the surprise level comparable to the one I saw in The Skeleton Key, even in the original Shutter, that Thai movie. Nicole Kidman played an stable role, successfully portraying an insecure mother with the burden of a lost husband and photosensitive children. Yet I don't think this was the best performance from her.",6,1,3,11 August 2014
Dead Poets Society," Nice movie on defying conformity
","The movie digs deep about the very foundational idea of conforming whether to the general idea of well being, which may not be in line with one's own choice, or to live and let live the very desires that makes one feels very much alive. The premise is inserted well in the theme of artistic literature and the philosophical paradigm it comes with. There is less twists in the steady build up and flow of the story. But the dramatization is superb. It's able to grasp most, if not all, the essential issues concerning the period of the younger adulthood. The movie is then capped by a great sequence of finale events that question the idea of loyalty, not just to the friends beside you, but also to yourself and your belief. Robin Williams acted out good here, although I have to say that this is not his best performance. It's nice to see Ethan Hawke's earlier works in this movie. And it's quite a loss that most of the other actors of this class don't really make a long career.",7,0,0,29 July 2014
Just Go with It," It's getting to be a habit for Adam Sandler
","I like how the story really puts the background so very nicely for why Danny does what he does every Friday or Saturday night. From then, the story seems to flow so naturally because it already has a solid footing from its background. The jokes are of a mixed overall for me. Some of the jokes are very enjoyably hilarious while the rest are just plain and simple and lame. Having seen Blended (2014) before seeing this movie, I think that it's getting to be a habit for Adam Sandler to star or even produce a family themed movies such as this one, although not really family oriented, mind you. It's with Aniston in Hawaii here, and next it's with Barrymore in Africa. On the acting side, Adam Sandler did a very natural, right at home feel with his role here. He does kind of specialize in comedies like this one, especially in these recent years. Jennifer Aniston played her role just a bit above an okay performance, balancing just enough for the story to have a full angle. I like Nicole Kidman's part here because this proves that she can really play any genre you throw at her.",6,0,0,3 September 2014
About Time," A great movie about time travel that actually teaches something about it
","The story really makes good use of its long two-hour duration and actually teaches something about the thing which until now seems to be impossible, time travel. The two acts that the movie is divided into actually tell two different kind of focus, where at the first act Tim is actually hard at accepting things and always does his best to rewind time and mend things, even to the tiniest bit of detail. But on the second act, the thing with his father teaches Tim to let go of his control and accept life as is and enjoy it. This movie doesn't concern with all those complex and complicated physics or philosophy surrounding time travel, thus making the movie feels as the lightest among all other time travel movies. What makes me like this movie even more is the tiniest bit of biblical reference Tim's Dad said to Tim. This makes him a great and exemplary character for not following the footsteps of his male bloodlines that fell to the traps of money and other worldly obsessions. The acting overall feels good, especially as the movie makes its way onto the second act where we see Bill Nighy's acting really supports Domnhall Gleeson in making the screenplay to feel more alive. Rachel McAdams adds nicely to the movie, but I think Bill Nighy's acting really steals the spotlight at the second act.",8,4,6,11 January 2015
Insomnia," A nice new twist for a detective story
","I saw The Machinist before this movie and I think I found some similar stuff. It's nice to see a crime and mystery detective movie that's not so gloomy despite the obvious mood building aimed for it. The story depends largely on the twist since the main element reveals itself quite early at the mid section. The insomnia part is greatly incorporated into the story. The background on how it occurs is well explained on the minor details. The depiction is also so vivid, using all those weird focus photography and scene flashes and stuff. Yet the effects are so dominant on the way the main character thinks. Despite there's no real surprising plot twist, there's a decent twist on the ending that's quite worthy to look out for. I like how Hillary Swank can muster up a decent performance to balance Al Pacino's great name and performance here. It's quite regrettable for me that Robin Williams didn't get more in-frame duration sine he too can get a balancing performance facing Al Pacino.",7,0,1,21 August 2014
My Neighbor Totoro," The ultimate movie of children's imagination
","I really like how the movie managed to be so fascinating. It's timeless considering that what it shows doesn't really get confined into a certain time period. Children's imagination will still exist as there's still children, although provided that they are well brought up. It's a very nice movie to keep a copy of, just to show your kids how to have fun outdoors and let their imagination thrive, instead of playing with the electronic gadgets and get cooped up indoors like many kids do these days. The movie doesn't show any hostility, although it shows real kids' bickering. The characters are soothing to the mind of the audience, who may just got bored of having to face shady people in real life. I am lucky to get a copy with the Japanese original voice. The voice work really is an integral part of the mood building.",8,1,2,12 November 2015
500 Days of Summer," Weird story
","The story is really a weird one in my view. It tells of a man who looks carefree but at then gets defeated by his obsession to this girl who had told him from the very first moment that they're not serious. It gets even weirder as the man looks to be socially acceptable to have a girl; he has a fine taste of clothing style, a steady paying job, and of course the looks; yet he is still single before he met the girl. Furthermore, he seeks advice from his younger sister who seems more mature than him. I don't know if this setting is meant to be a comedy but I don't really feel the comedic point in it. The developments can nicely go very much unpredictable. Yet the unpredictability goes to the direction of weirdness instead of nice. The acting overall is really a mixed work. Joseph Gordon-Levitt sure did well here although I won't say this is as his finest acting work. On the other side Zoey Deschanel did her parts plainly weird. Maybe its her effort to get into character, but I think she really misunderstood her character and misrepresented her instead. Her acting involved much of empty stares as Tom Cruise's involved much grinning as Ethan Hunt.",6,0,0,2 October 2015
Juno," A great mix of the technical ingredients
","The movie presents us with a basic premise that sound somewhat common to the population in the western hemisphere, but it still sounds shocking for most of us here in the east. Nevertheless this kind of story startup point ignites viewers' curiosity of what will happen next. The movie nicely mix this with the dorky and goofy depiction of the focus characters, the really nice additions of comedy here and there, and some really nice twists and turns along the way. The movie nicely plays with the notion of viewer's anticipation of how it would wind up at times. I also really like how the soundtrack selection really completes the movie build up as its own taste. The songs really nail viewers' ears to the audio they are catchy in both lyrics and tunes. The acting overall is indeed worthy of an Oscar nomination at the least. Ellen Page nicely grasps her character and presents it, successfully deceiving viewers of her really age. Michael Cera is really comfortable with this kind of role so his performance doesn't seem that special. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney nicely adds up the crucial angle of the parents and Olivia Thirlby completes the whole set.",7,0,2,29 July 2015
L.A. Confidential," Nice plot weaving that eventually became some kind of a classic
","The story sure took its time in establishing the initial relationship between the three main characters. And seeing this movie now with knowledge of the cast's reputation beforehand just makes their performance here seem even nicer, except for Kim Basinger's which felt like just an okay acting. I really like how the story weave in and out through the perspective of the the three main characters alternately. And the eventual tie in to the entire story is very good. The revelation of the true traitor in this movie has now became somewhat a classic for the other cop movies where the true bad guy is already there all the time. the acting overall is a great one. I really like how Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce played their respective usual characters. James Cromwell and Danny DeVito did great also in balancing their performances.",7,0,2,12 June 2015
Concussion," Didn't really have the impact it aimed for
","Will Smith's portrayal of the character is quite nice although he overdo it at times. But as the movie tells of a sport related story, it doesn't really established the relation between the doctor and the sport itself. With most of the movie happening around the doctor, the sport itself lacked appearance and thus felt distant even though this movie is based on a true story. The romance thing feels really flat, as only that it is used to lengthen the movie's duration somehow. Further the spouse character doesn't really fit into the whole story that her appearance felt redundant. All the athletes portrayed are pictured convincing enough, although again, the movie seemed like it didn't do them the justice of depicting their better days.",6,2,4,9 April 2016
Midnight in Paris," So....it's a time travel movie after all
","It's weird for me that most of the story's ingredients didn't really interest me much. Despite with all those big names in the cast list I didn't really feel that it makes the story as a whole the more interesting. One thing that interested me the most is whether the whole thing is only Gil's imagination or what. And the movie did enough to show that it's actually a magical time travel movie after all. The thing is, just like many other Woody Allen movies, this one explored so many plot branches that becomes significant enough at the ending but this movie didn't give any of them justice in terms of solving them. This movie has many characters but they don't really develop much. The movie only relies on initial impressions of the characters much like they're monotonous in their life or experiences. The acting overall felt really decent. With all those bigger names in the cast list, it's strange that only Owen Wilson gets to do significant parts. That said, Owen's acting really is eclipsed by the potential that other cast members can have here but didn't do.",6,1,1,2 October 2015
Youth," Very beautiful visuals surrounding a tale of comedic ironies
","This movie is indeed a great example of how Italian sense of film-making can really be married with contemporary English and Hollywod cast, mixed together with the commonly found philosophical art house blend of ironic comedies. The story really puts a poetic reasoning to the subject matter of old age. The movie is filled with long talks, which look more like responded monologues. But of course any ironic setups won't be complete without actually putting in the opposite of the subject. This movie puts it good a dose of young talents with adequate significance where the irony really bites when it comes. The acting is indeed a great job. Michael Caine can really depict the depth of the character, without having to overly expressing. His acting feels very natural especially when we compared each of his scenes. Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz did very well to complete the angles and give nuances to the movie. Jane Fonda did well in stealing the scenes even with her short screen time.",6,5,11,24 October 2015
Milk," The acting was total, but that's just about it
","Well I got to say that it's quite hard to write this review, particularly considering that I watched this movie mainly in order to complete the IMDb Oscar list. I find the story to be just plain, especially because the movie didn't really dramatize the conflicts that the gay people had. Compared to other movies about civil rights movement, like the more recent Selma, this movie sure showed that it lacks the attention grabbing scenes, which most likely to be of violent nature. Instead the movie only emphasized on the frontal gay kissing here and there, often in close up ranges and lasting more than a couple of seconds. Well, in another light those scenes can be a test for straight people that if they don't feel anything after watching those scenes, then there should be something in their minds already. The acting overall is indeed a great work. Sean Penn and James Franco really went total in their parts. Josh Brolin also played a convincing part as the easily swayed and begrudging politician. Emille Hirsch and Allison Pill added very nicely to the movie as a whole.",5,1,6,16 October 2015
The Prestige," Great story of magic, rivalry and tricks
","The story literally blows away minds. It's nicely complex yet it spreads all the significant details right under our nose the whole time. Just as the Angier refuses to admit that Borden's trick is just a simple one, the movie nicely steers the audience into waiting to make a conclusion about the final deal about the secret of the prestige. The additional thing put by the magic tricks, the romance angles, Tesla and Edison, and the subplot with Borden's child is just great. But looking back to this movie, it feels strange that the movie reveals all the hidden secrets and resolves all questions at the end, which are not the typical of a Christopher Nolan movie. The acting overall is great. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale nicely put on the rivalry between their characters. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall nicely complete the additional romances and intrigues angle. Michael Caine completes the movie with his mentor role.",8,0,0,7 February 2015
The Hateful Eight," The eighth Tarantino movie still retains his signature
","In post civil war American frontier, the bounty hunter John Ruth rides a coach steered by OB Jackson to Red Rock in a blizzard, bringing in the fugitive Daisy Domergue to collect. On the way they meet another bounty hunter former Union Major Marquis Warren. Ruth lets him in though with some doubts for they've met once before. Warren lets him see his correspondence letter with Lincoln. Soon the coach finds another man hitching a ride in the blizzard, Chris Mannix, who claims to be the new Sheriff for Red Rock. Again Ruth gives a ride with caution. They reach Minnie's Haberdashery in the mountains to rest for the blizzard. Minnie wasn't there and a Mexican named Bob welcomes them. Inside Ruth finds earlier guests Joe Gage, Oswaldo Mobray who claims to be the area's hangman, and an old man. Warren, Mannix, OB, and Bob tend to the horses before going in. Warren questions Bob's employment at Minnie's. Inside, Mannix recognize the old man as a former Confederate General Smithers, and Warren does too as he was at opposite sides at the Battle of Chattanooga with the general. As their dialog heats up, Mobray suggests they stay on opposite corners of the room as northerners and southerners.Ruth suspects something's fishy, so he makes a clear warning to everybody, and collects the earlier guests' pistols. At dinner Mannix claims that Warren's Lincoln letter is fake, which disappoints Ruth. Bob starts playing Silent night on the piano, and Warren chats with Smithers. Warren reveals that he killed Smithers' son, and he puts a gun beside Smithers. This gets to Smithers and as he grabs the gun Warren shoots him dead. The others don't question the killing as it was self defense. But nobody else knew while Warren was revealing about Smithers' son, someone poisoned the coffee and Daisy saw it. Mannix is about to when OB and Ruth, after drinking the coffee, suddenly vomit blood and die. Ruth had time to warn Mannix about it. Daisy kills the dying Ruth, and Warren quickly control the situation. He rounds up the men as suspects, but dismisses Mannix as he almost drink the coffee himself. Warren reveals that he knows Minnie and her stew, that Minnie disliked Mexicans. Warren kills Bob then hell breaks lose as somebody in the basement opens fire, causing Mannix, Warren and Mobray getting shot.The movie flips back to the morning before at Minnie's. Four passengers in a coach reach Minnie's. They are Joe Gage, Oswaldo Mobray, Bob and their gang leader Jody Domingray, Daisy's brother. They dispatched everybody else except an old man in order to keep the place's pretended mood. Back to the story so far, Mannix and Warren survives with grave wounds, pointing guns at the gang. Daisy and Gage is uninjured, so is Jody in the basement, while Mobray is also gravely injured. Warren and Mannix threaten to kill Daisy to lure Jody out, and kill him as he does. Daisy negotiates a deal with Mannix, offering Mobray's and Bob's bounty. Mobray backs Daisy's talk up, but Warren shoots him dead. In the commotion Gage reaches for a hidden gun but Warren and Mannix get to him first. Warren shoots at Daisy but he's out of bullets. Mannix keeps Daisy talking but eventually doesn't buy it. But he faints and Daisy goes for Gage's loaded gun. Mannix wakes up and shoots Daisy, disarming her. Warren says that they shouldn't just kill her. Instead they must hang her in honor of John Ruth who saved Mannix.I got to say this December is surely a great month for it has some great movies worth the score 8 out of 10. The Hateful Eight (2015) surely deserves such a score. Story-wise it's an intriguing piece, very well done in the classic Tarantino style of storytelling. The story gets to be deeply character driven, offering seeds of mystery and suspicion all along the way. The twists and turns were laid out and positioned very well. The mood and pace did greatly in helping story to achieve critical mass.Since the beginning, Tarantino movies have always had their strong part in the dialog. They effectively steer the scene, deepening the character introduction, and ultimately helping the audience let down their guard and anticipation for the surprises and twists to have maximum effect. I like how Tarantino have always make his movies have certain levels of humor, even amid bloody scenes. But it's exceptionally funny in this movie as there are more laugh spots spread across the movie.Technically speaking, the movie displays great cinematography work. You can spot great timing direction that resulted in the long single shot at the very beginning. There are also classic camera angles and moving camera examples here and there, which are rarely found on westerns. The blood effects are really a signature of Quentin Tarantino movies. What's great to see here is that those blood work has been improved very well that they appear very grandiose. Maybe they look less realistic, but they sure look more artistic.The acting work in overall is a great work. Samuel L. Jackson is just an essential part in a Tarantino movie. It's like not having him in one makes the movie feels awkward. Kurt Russell did great in adding into the fray, contributing very well to the movie's starting first half. Jennifer Jason Leigh did well enough in her character's concealment of the plot twist. What's bad about the cast is that we tend to see many old faces that frequent Tarantino movies. We have additions like Channing Tatum here, but the main cast only has Russell and Jason-Leigh as the new faces.Nevertheless an 8 out of 10 score is rightfully deserving for this latest Quentin Tarantino movie. A recommendation goes out from me as I enjoyed this movie very much as I did Django, the Basterds, Kill Bill, and Pulp Fiction.",8,6,25,23 December 2015
Crash," Great acting overall in a striking story
","I saw Third Person (2013) before this one. Paul Haggis really is good in creating such intricate web of stories combined into one big story. But compared to Third Person (2013), the grand theme in this movie is much more serious and engaging. the movie also concludes nicely for all the characters, mainly turning their long established mindsets upside down and forcing them to acknowledge the reality of an unfair world by doing something that is paradoxical to their principles. The acting job in overall is a great job. With a list of first tier actors and actresses, this makes it even better. The greater thing is that there is equal share of focus and screen-time for each significant characters. For me, Ludicrous' performance is the one which shined out the most within the circumstances.",7,0,2,4 November 2014
Snatch," One of the most hilarious comedy as well as crazy crime movie I've ever seen
","The story opens up curiously then continued to an even more curious yet racially suggestive sequence that surprises the viewers and reveals the movie's true crazy nature. The rest of the three separate yet somewhat linked stories are built very nicely with all those crazy violence all around. What I really like about this movie is that there's virtually no moment that I wasn't laughing, or at least giggling, around the entire movie. The whole elements are really funny; the character and story backgrounds, the coincidences in the story development, the crazy dialog lines, and just about everything. The ending is also nice that it's quite unpredictable. Well, the action itself is quite predictable, but how the thing will unravel is not really so predictable. The acting is very nice here. I really like how Brad Pitt does his crazy accent. It's too bad that Jason Statham didn't get any action part in here.",8,0,3,27 September 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Nuclear deterrent in the hands of madmen
","The movie does depict a scary story of the old Cold War era fear of nuclear doomsday and the subsequent stalemate of the nuclear deterrence between the two superpowers. I really like how the movie shows the subtle but crazy scenes right after it builds up the suspense of imminent nuclear or retaliation threat. The phone dialog, or should I say monologue, between the two presidents are just a sheer twisted laughable scenes. Like most Kubrick movies, this movie also leaves the audience with quite an incomplete movie, having them wondering about the continuance of the story after the movie's abrupt ending. The acting is just nice because most of the actors can successfully depict the madness under stress of nuclear threat and also the crazy funny scenes.",6,1,5,4 September 2014
Begin Again," Nice songs in an artsy movie
","The movie tells of Dan, a once-was-someone music producer, and Gretta, a rising star musician's ex-girlfriend and partner; who meet at a local live music pub when Dan hears Gretta performs. Drunk, distasteful of the current popular music, and losing his job after a dispute at his label, Dan hasn't been a good example for his daughter Violet. After following her ex Dave to New York, Gretta is disappointed because he cheats on her. After their acquaintance at the pub, Dan asks the reluctant Gretta to do a recording. Yielding, Gretta follows Dan to do a low budget, indie recording of her songs in open air locations. She befriends Violet and gets closer to Dan. After seeing Dave won an award, Gretta sends him a song, which prompts him to contact her again. The recording done, Dan and Gretta pitches it to Dan's old label, which likes it very much. Dan gets his old job back but Gretta refuses the deal with the label. Gretta comes to a concert Dave invited her to, but she's once again disappointed when Dave sings her song to the crowd. She then goes to Dan and they release her album via the internet.The movie's story down plays two people's low points of their lives, yet it also cover their joint creative revival process. Begin Again (2013) is one of those movies that doesn't really focus on the story that much. Rather, it aims the focus to feel artsy without being kind of weird. It doesn't present a complicated story even though it introduces enough number of characters and relationships between them that enables such a complex story.The music is easy listening, with songs performed without lip sync. The songs' lyrics also feels not very heavy despite the themes and the use of some explicit words in them. The music feels nice because despite being light, it contains enough instrument sounds varied enough to feel like a band.The movie feels artsy by using the little bit darkened coloration all around and shooting the recording scenes on common yet unusual locations. It also very nice to have a real musician take an acting part here. Even more, it's nice to see an actress take on the songs herself, instead of using lip syncs like most musicals do.I also like how the movie stills plays when the end credits roll in even showing the ending part with it. It makes the movie feels like a news TV show. The costumes and make up are also nice to see, simple enough yet quite helpful in depicting the characters' personality.The acting department feels adequate enough. Kiera Knightley did well enough in portraying the betrayed ex-girlfriend with high potential talent. Mark Ruffalo did great in getting into his character. He gets the right body language improvised on the recording scenes. Having Adam Levine is nice for his voice on the songs, despite his acting is not that good. Hailee Steinfeld gives this movie a nicer touch; too bad that her character's conflict is really resolved. Having experienced names as Catherine Keener and Yasiin Bey, or a.k.a Mos Def, is also nice touches.My opinion is that Begin Again (2013) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. It's quite an entertainment from a movie perspective. But it offers more on the music side.",7,2,5,12 September 2014
The Book Thief," A good movie on the 'side' themes of war
","A drama set in World War II Germany, about a girl of a mother unwanted by the Nazis. Liesel was orphaned when her mother was forcefully taken away by the Nazis for being a communist. On the train journey to her new parents' house, she lost her brother due to the harsh weather. Her new parents were very nice, although her new mother Rosa was very strict.She was unlearned all her life, but then her new father Hans (Geoffrey Rush) begins to teach her to read and write. When the Nazis decided to purge Germany of the illness of foreign and radical ideas by burning books, Liesel starts her secret endeavor to learn more buy stealing books.Along the movie, Liesel built relationships with other characters such as Max, a Jew that her foster parents take in and hide due to Hans' life debt to Max's father, and Rudy, a boy from their neighborhood and school.Unlike other World War II movies, The Book Thief can present you a heavy drama with story build that feels slow enough. It shows us heavy demonstration of the culture that The third Reich tried to implant into the lives of Germans by portraying the children choir, the book burning, and the heavy display of Nazi party flag. Yet it lacks the gruesome violence that is typical of World War II movies.The narration was the monologue of the character of death, which personifies death well, wondering of what will the humans do and be 'haunted' by humans.A sidelined idea that was underdeveloped was the 'Jesse Owen wannabe' Rudy, that at one time scraped mud and dirt all over his body to be black just so he can be more like Jesse Owen, an African-American sprinter who was at that time the fastest man on earth.The ending parts of the movie is just an anti-climax. When the story was built well with a pace not so fast, The main supporting characters suddenly killed by an air-raid bomb on a time when the sirens failed to ring. Yet magically Liesel survives the the blast AND the rubble falling down on her entire family. She was then fostered by the family of the madame who let her to read more books.At least it's a good drama. I'd give it a 6.5 of 10. Just don't watch this if you're already sleepy. LOL",6,0,2,10 July 2014
Horrible Bosses," Quite unpredictable for the kind of premise it brings
","The opening hyperbolically introduces the main characters and their abusive bosses. Not long, the movie turns into the characters deciding to kill their bosses, and that's where the main conflict happens. I like the jokes in this movie because they're not particularly stupid jokes like Will Ferrell's signature, which are still funny but looks pitiful of you think of it. The jokes do base their builds on the characters' ignorance or unpreparedness, but they don't look stupid in the execution. The twists and turns in the story's development quite helped to keep this movie interesting besides laying the backgrounds on how the jokes can be logical. Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis really is funny here without have to be a laughing stock or self deprecating. Charlie Day helped the work of the two Jasons well enough. Having senior names such as Kevin Spacey do increases the notch of the acting overall. Jennifer Aniston did enough in her role here as the only significant female character. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell adds a nice spectrum to the movie's acting.",5,0,2,9 October 2014
Black Mass," Good, but seems to be missing something in the story tightness
","The movie is being told from the perspectives and narration of Kevin Weeks, John Martorano and Stephen Flemmi, who were the right hand men of the crime lord James (Jimmy) 'Whitey' Bulger. In 1975 Jimmy leads a South Boston's small time gang Winter Hill. He recruits Kevin Weeks as he takes him to brutalize Joey Angiulo, member of the competing Angiulo mafia from the North. Meanwhile, an FBI agent John Connolly, who grew up in Jimmy's neighborhood, comes back to Boston. He soon speaks to Jimmy's brother Billy, who's now a senator, to arrange a meeting with Jimmy. Connlly proposes an alliance between them to bring down the Angiulo. One night at Winter Hill's watering hole The Triple O's, one of Jimmy's guy raised his fist in his drunkenness to Jimmy. Jimmy soon takes care of it decisively. Connolly wins his superior's approval about the alliance with Jimmy. Jimmy only told Flemmi about it. Jimmy lost his son to an illness. This makes him more ruthless as he expands his crime activities.In 1981 Winter Hill's illegal activities are racking up a lot of cash, and the gang pays bribes to both the police and even the FBI. Jimmy gives out the address of the Angiulo headquarters to Connolly, making the FBI more lenient to Winter Hill. Jimmy also has a hand in the Miami company Jai Alai. He made the deals with John Callahan and Brian Halloran. Callahan says that the company's new owner Roger Wheeler is being nosy about the bookkeeping, and asks a favor from Jimmy. Flemmi asks Bryan about a hit on Wheeler but Jimmy tells Bryan to leave with some money. Soon Wheeler gets killed. The FBI gets annoyed about it and Bryan comes forward to ask for protection from the bureau. But Connolly dismisses Bryan and calms his fellow agents. He confronts Jimmy about Wheeler but Jimmy manages to get the name of the rat who sold his name out from Connoly, and soon Jimmy kills Bryan. As the FBI again panics about Bryan, they hit the jackpot and arrests the Angiulo head. In celebration Jimmy and his crew takes Connolly to Miami in spring of 1982. Flemmi kills Callahan there at Connolly's knowledge, supposedly strengthening the bond between Jimy and Connolly.In 1985 Jimmy and Billy lost their mother. Jimmy starts supplying arms to the IRA. In cold blood he kills Deborah, the daughter of Flemmi's girlfriend, who was ratting to the police. The district attorney in the FBI's Boston office gets replaced with Fred Wyshak, and Connolly gets a hard time to convince him about Jimmy. His fellow agents also discover that the intel supposedly from Jimmy are actually old ignored intel from other informants. The boat carrying the arms to Ireland gets intercepted due to the pilot being a snitch. Connolly's colleagues deny him the pilot's name but Jimmy soon finds the man and kills him. Connolly's colleague comes clean to the press and opens up publicly Jimmy as an FBI informant since 1975. In 1995 Jimmy left Boston and became a fugitive. He is captured in California in 2011.The story is decently written and shown enough balance for the main focus character Jimmy Bulger. Yet this balance only lasted for about one third of the whole movie, since Jimmy becomes a pure wolf in sheep's clothing until the ending. On the other perspective, most of the other characters also have little to none variation of their original introductory state. John Connolly seems very stupid that for years he doesn't realize he's been played by Jimmy. So does John Morris' indecisiveness which lasted for years. Only Stephen Flemmi's character has a little bit of humanity shown when he stood by as Deborah gets killed.The crime is the real attraction for this movie, pure cold blood executions to be exact. The movie makers were more than able to present us the camera tricks to show those convincing scenes with blood splattering all over and doing it at close distances. Don't expect to find anything like a shootout or the likes in this movie, though. If the movie makers stayed true to history or the book it was based on, apparently Jimmy Bulger is one who prefer silencing his targets 'persuasively'.The drama parts had good grounding at the first one third or so of the duration. It nicely balances Jimmy's personality by giving depiction of humanity in caring for his son. But after that, it looks like the drama went all gone as the movie prefer to emphasize more Jimmy's ruthlessness after his son's death. Furthermore, The movie isn't being clear about the Lindsey's whereabouts after her loss.The acting in overall is indeed a great job to see. Johnny Depp is truly one of the masters in deep character acting. His portrayal of Jimmy made me forget that he was also the confused Edward Scissorhands and the quirky Jack Sparrow. Add to this is the performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, who although had just a less significant part here, managed to add in a touch of authenticity into his speech's accenting. Having a cast of big names but small parts here turned out to be quite a nice move. Putting the less famous Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemmons alongside Depp keeps the focus to the relationship between Jimmy and Joel Edgerton's Connolly at significance. Still placing familiar faces like Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, Corey Stoll and even Juno Temple helped other scenes to gain attention.My say for Black Mass (2015) is a 6 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see it in the cinemas. It's adequately entertaining as we get to be presented with quite a gripping story based on true events.",6,3,4,3 October 2015
The Best Years of Our Lives," A great telling that even war victors don't get a happy live
","If I watched this movie before I watched Bicycle Thieves, maybe it would've ended up as just another post-war movie for me. But in combo of Bicycle Thieves, this movie tells the complete story from both sides of the war victors and losers; none get the happy live. War torn everything, even the lives of the victors. We see it first hand as how Homer struggles to regain himself after losing his hands. Fred also struggles as he has everything a decent man dreams of, but lacks any other skill that he has to bow himself down to the harsh reality of the available work. AL also struggles morally as he chooses to do the right thing. And as we see only Homer's and Frede's story closes out well, as Al's didn't really get a justified ending to his ordeal. The actors did a great job in bringing live to the scenes.",7,2,4,3 September 2016
Taxi Driver," A classic example of great acting without necessarily focused story.
","The movie goes on quite unclear about the main conflict that the main character has to settle. It seems like there is nothing that he is fighting for. This thing went on for almost the entire movie. The finale's result thus comes as a surprise. This lack of clarity and confusion also reflects in the scoring, changing back and forth between being romantic and being mysterious. I see the inspiration of some later works in this movie, which may include Al Pacino's Insomnia, The acting side, on the other hand, is very nice. We get to see Robert DeNiro's totality in plating his character here. Jodie Foster, despite her rather short duration time, manages to give her role a significant meaning. Albert Brooks and Harvey Keitel's presence bring more color to this movie.",6,3,5,3 October 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A worthy sequel indeed
","So the story starts with terrorists hijacking a SHIELD ship. Cap and Black Widow are sent in on it. Cap thinks their mission is strictly hostages, but Black Widow was ordered also to get some files. Back in SHIELD HQ, Nick Fury is denied access into the files from the ship. He then gets attacked by the Winter Soldier. Escaped the hit, Fury goes to Cap's place and warns him of a compromised SHIELD, and only they know. Fury then got shot while Cap failed to catch the shooter. At the hospital, Fury seems to be dead. SHIELD Director Pierce then summons Cap. Cap doesn't share Fury's info with Pierce, thus Pierce makes Cap a fugitive. Cap escapes and meet Black Widow. They try to figure out what's in the file and discover an abandoned old facility in New Jersey back from Cap's old war time. Turns out that Zola, a German scientist recruited after WWII by US government was also secretly a member of HYDRA, rogue Nazi splinter bent on a new world order. Zola died in 1972 but preserved his consciousness in the facility. He reveals HYDRA's plans, involving taking the three new SHIELD helicarriers. At the same time, a missile is launched to wipe them out. Escaped danger, Cap and Black Widow goes to Sam Wilson to hide, and Sam reveals Falcon project. The three 'kidnaps' a SHIELD official, and interrogates him on HYDRA's plans. Winter Soldier kills the official right after, and attacks Cap and friends. Black Widow got shot in the fight, and it's revealed that Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes. Cap and friends then got caught by SHIELD, but Hill set them free and then brings them to Fury, who actually faked his death. Cap and friends then get into SHIELD HQ and announce the HYDRA truth to everyone. After a firefight the HYDRA cabals manage to launch the helicarriers. Cap and Falcon fight their way into the helicarriers to insert a hack so Hill can control them. After Cap and Falcon succeeded controlling two of them, Winter Soldier comes and battles Cap on the third, breaking Falcon's suit. Cap and Winter Soldier then face each other there. Cap inserts the hack to the helicarrier's control but Winter Soldier shoots him. Hill gains control of all helicarrirers and Cap ordered her to destroy them, with him still inside. Black Widow sacrifices herself under Pierce's threat and Fury kills Pierce. The injured Cap tries to help Bucky Barnes regain his memories, but he attacks Cap. Bucky then regains his memories, but Cap has fall onto the river below them. Bucky then saves him and then disappears. Fury goes on with his faked death and goes to Europe to hunt down the remaining HYDRA members.The fight moves and choreography is way better than any other Marvel universe movies so far. Now not only Black Widow moves fluidly, but now Cap does too. In this installment, Cap does a lot more juggling moves with his shield and also acrobatic attacks, including somersault kicks. There's also the nice touch of Cap getting back in touch with the now ill Peggy Carter.From my standpoint of one who doesn't really follow the comics, the insertion of the Winter Soldier into the story, as a way of introducing a new main antagonist into a title which is already a franchise, is indeed quite smooth. The unsuspecting intro of Bucky Barnes from the memorabilia room start this well, though if you look at this scene individually it feels stupid and not quite logical. Why would Cap be strolling to a museum to look upon memories of himself, when prior to that he already said that internet helps him greatly in catching up?The next thing is that you see Winter Soldier blowing Fury's car with a shot mine. For me another non logical thing happened here. If Nick Fury can escape very easily from the Winter Soldier after having being inside of a car which was turn upside down, why is it so hard for him to escape the shooters with no superhuman abilities?The gimmick of having silly jokes in the middle of hot action is kept and inherited from the previous Marvel universe movies. This include the 'Air conditioning fully operational' reply by the car AI during the car chase scene. Yes, product placements in a movie is so common these days, but I think we see one too much black Chevrolets in this movie. Yet there is also a store placement of Apple Store in this movie, way to go Apple!! LOL.I say we don't have much to criticize about the cast, because they primarily continue on from the other movies. The acting is good, even though not in the range of any awards. The cast gets creative enough as to develop their own dialog, as Evans and Johansson do. On costumes, the idea of Cap getting a new uniform is quite nice, though he ditched it and goes back to his old colors. The music scoring is barely there, just enough to help build the mood of the scene. Overall for me this 7 out of 10 scoring movie is good, not because it presents something new, but because it can live up to its name and be the worthy sequel, as compared to the stupidity done in Iron Man 3's antagonist. A recommendation is a sure thing from me, of course.",7,1,2,1 April 2014
Capote," Great acting and nice story depiction
","The movie presents its story quite impressively, maintaining the balance of focus between the Truman Capote character and his masterpiece book In Cold Blood's making process. The earlier parts nicely emphasize on Truman as a character through his individual distinction. Although it's quite brief but it's quite constant repetition in subsequent parts made it very effective. The next parts nicely focus on the relationships Truman has, particularly with Perry in the writing of In Cold Blood. But I really like how the movie summarizes the story by depicting Truman's sad hypocrisy of denying to help Perry and Dick to find another lawyer yet at the same time lying to them saying he's trying his best. This movie really is one of the milestones of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting career. By simply changing his voice and adding some new little habits to his mannerism he was able to shed his old characters' persona of ruthless men.",7,0,0,25 January 2015
Lost in Translation," Great constant mood setting though all around it's flat story
","The movie did very well in depicting the familiar movie mood of a metropolitan city that doesn't sleep at night, yet it sends a lonesome but anxious mood. I saw a few movies using this kind of mood, but they mainly use it with a US city backdrop setting such as New York or Chicago. I like how this movie always comes back to this mood depiction even after all those scenes that indicated a climb in the mood. The coloration also helped much in bringing this mood at the fore. But all in all, the story feels very much flat. There's no real change in the characters or their relationships, particularly as they end the movie just the way as they started it. It made some characters felt like they're only there as mannequins to complete the story angles. The acting overall is good. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson did very well in portraying the anxieties their characters have. Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris, as I said, were only there as complimentary characters.",6,0,0,15 October 2015
Interstellar," A rare gem of the modern cinema.
","In the near future, climate change takes its toll, slowly but surely wiping out food crops. An ex NASA pilot Cooper and his daughter Murphy comes across a gravitational anomaly, which Murphy thought as a ghost. From one of the anomalies, they get a binary code of a location. They go there and find that it's a new NASA site. As one of NASA's best, Cooper is offered a place for the interstellar journey through a black hole in saving the human race by way of finding a new home, a new planet, for the whole species. He takes the position, despite Murphy's disagreement. He goes with Dr. Amanda Brand, Doyle, Romilly, and the robot TARS. And after fetching the Endurance module and the robot CASE, they go in through the black hole near Saturn to visit the three possible new worlds. Brand also experience the 'ghost' as Murphy did. The first world has a great time-slippage anomaly where an hour spent there equals roughly seven years on earth. Cooper and Brand argue about it, he wants to go there to finish the mission fast and go home to Murphy, while Brand rejects it due to the time slippage. They eventually go there, but immediately gets swept away by a gigantic tidal wave. Brand insists on fetching the data pack, thus taking more time, claiming Doyle's life, temporarily disrupting the lander craft. Seemingly unaffected, they ultimately return to Romilly, who have aged 23 years due to the time- slippage.Finding the first world a failure, they then go to the second world, Dr. Mann's world. They find Mann, literally waking him from death in cryo-stasis. Based on Mann's data, the team decides to continue and set up a pioneer colony site. But Mann, surrendering to his primal urges, betray the team in his effort to go back home, killing Romilly while doing so. Apparently, Mann's data was all lies. He manages to steal one lander and tries to board the Endurance module as the team gives chase. But Mann can't dock the lander well. He ends up blowing parts of the Endurance when he forces to dock. Cooper and Brand manages to reclaim the Endurance though through a risky stunt. Cooper programs CASE to steer the Endurance to the third world. But after Brand gets in the module, Cooper breaks away and sacrifices himself and TARS, after knowing that the life support can support only one person. Cooper only inside his space-suit and TARS with him, gets sucked into the Gargantua black hole. But strangely through the black hole Cooper arrives floating in a crude space-time continuum that's only limited to the back side of Murphy's room back in time. He finds out now he is the Murphy's 'ghost'. He continues on relaying the codes Murphy found in the past, and also the quantum data TARS collected. After all data is code-relayed, Cooper gets sucked out of the continuum. He gets picked up and brought to the space station orbiting Saturn, the human's new home made with Murphy's data. Cooper comes to and gets reunited with the now old Murphy.The story is just a great example of how a great and detailed epic can be told in the modern era. At almost three hours duration, it quite pushes the boundaries of the contemporary moviegoers' boredom tolerance level. But the movie is so great that it quite literally nailed me to the chair, forcing me to hold my bladder almost through the whole third act LOL. It makes the movie detailed on both the emotional and the scientific fiction content. Knowing it's another of Christopher Nolan's sci-fi, I anticipated the movie to be just like The Matrix (1999) and Inception (2010), which I have to watch more than twice to fully understand the grand story. But thankfully Sci-Fi is one of my favorite genres besides Action and Adventure. Thus watching Paycheck (2003), and other astronauts and time-travel movies really pays off.I really like how the movie really pays attention to making a realistic depiction of theoretical quantum physics ideas about black holes, gravitation, time slippage, and ultimately space-time continuum. And those depictions are really great works. Watching at IMAX 2D, I really enjoy the journey through the black hole, the giant tidal wave, and other scenic shots. The movie also takes great advantage of the consequences of the physics, especially the time slippage and space travels issues. The scene where Rom aged 23 years in a few hours, the time-to-time shots of Murphy growing old, the final reunification of Cooper and Murphy are great scenes that really touches the heart, though it sure needs a lot of understanding to discern them.The acting overall is one job. Matthew McConaughey did a great job in both depicting the remorseful father and the calm risk-taker ace pilot. Anne Hathaway did very good in giving balance to the story, although I don't think her role is any more significant than that balancing purposes. Jessica Chastain is also giving great emotional balance to the other angle of the story. Michael Caine's performance quite completes the story for a side villain. But actually Matt Damon really grabs the spot for the complementary villain.My final say is that Interstellar (2014) deserves it's place in the best movies list everywhere. An 8 out of 10 score is my rating for this movie. It's indeed a rare find of a gem among today's modern cinema.",8,1,7,23 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Strong scenes that keeps on pulling me to keep watching this movie
","From the really vivid opening of recruits shaving off their hair accompanied by the suggestive lyric of the soundtrack song, to the crazy accident in graduation eve, to the Vietnam streets and the last sniper battle, the movie present very strong depiction of what war, especially Vietnam war, does to all its combatants. The potentially dangerous creed instilled into the minds of the marines do forge them into becoming great weapons themselves, yet to some who can't endure it, it turns them crazy. The very ending is all too suggestive to the notion that nobody is immune to the effects war does to soldiers. The acting looks okay for a war movie, although for me, most of the cast play only a few expressions.",7,0,1,26 September 2014
American Sniper," Nicely realistic and fair depictions of a war hero
","Chris Kyle is a Navy SEAL sniper deployed in Iraq circa 2003. His main job is assisting house searches as an over-watch sniper. His duty lets him take decisive shots, quickly building his reputation a sniper legend. But those shots face him at split seconds to moral contradictions. Once he shot a child and his mother who carries a grenade toward a convoy. Feeling he hasn't done enough, he joins the ground search himself, finding an old man who talks about The Butcher, the Al Qaeda in Iraq's number two man. But as the soldiers return to the old man's house, The Butcher arrived earlier and teaches the man's family a lesson for talking to the Americans, killing the man. Chris and the soldiers are held back from helping due to The Butcher posted a skilled sniper, Mustafa, who covers his back.At another recon op in hunting The Butcher, Chris and his fellow SEALS are welcomed to a dinner by the man whose house's second floor is used as the recon post. But Chris finds that the man actually works for Zarqawi. The SEALS manage to neutralize the threats but The Butcher flees the scene. Back home after his third tour of duty, Chris gets more and more distanced with civilian life and fights with his wife about his will to redeploy. At his fourth tour, his team finds that engineers in Sadr City are being killed one by one from as far as 1000 yards away, strengthening the guess that it's Mustafa. The team inserts to position at a rooftop despite an imminent sandstorm. Another soldier gets sniped and Chris says he sees Mustafa. His fellows finds it hard to believe him as Mustafa may be at about 2000 yards away.Furthermore, the base tells them that the ground surrounding their location is now crawling with threats, a shot from them will bring them under attack. Chris strengthen his nerves and takes the shot. He succeeds in killing Mustafa, but threats soon hail shots at them as their backup still hasn't arrive. The SEALS made it out as the backup arrives in the sandstorm but Chris gets shot and retires after that. Back home, Chris struggles to connect with daily life. But a doctor introduces him to the veterans group to which he then provide support work, sometimes taking the men to shooting range and teaching them to shoot sniper rifles. But Chris loses his life when he tries to help a disturbed young marine.The story nicely encompass fair depictions of how war can affect harshly to someone even as skilled as Chris Kyle. We get to see that even a war hero, a sniper legend, gets stuck with the war syndrome. The movie serves the harsh truth of the threats the military face, and the severely blurred line between doing what's right and doing it right while countering those threats. And those threats are depicted fairly real, that an enemy deeming suicide bomb is just a standard plan of attack may even take notch even further by ordering women and children in on an assault with a grenade on their hands.The action feels nicely authentic. In general Eastwood greatly directs the action so that it doesn't seem hyperbolic, that the action moves fluidly natural. The actors get to act parts like how a body lumps down after being shot in the head, or how a body doesn't really jerk uncontrollably when it's barraged with full auto shots from close range. As someone experienced I first person shooter games, the sniper shots seemed real enough. Yet for me, there's discrepancy between the shots from the rifle's scope and how Chris uses his scope. The scope footage shows the cross-hairs following potential targets, which means Chris must be panning his rifle significantly far enough to show on when he's shown back peeping at the scope. But when it does go back to him, his posture doesn't really change.The acting is nice overall. Bradley Cooper again nicely shows he knew that the movie's focus will be almost entirely on his character. He did very well on those close up shots, portraying the right emotions and expression variations between the tour time and the home time. Sienna Miller completes the movie with her performance n the needed critical role of the spouse.For me American Sniper (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's a good entertainment that shows nice realistic military gun fights and is completed with the fair depiction of a post tour effect on a soldier.",7,21,48,11 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Survival of the fittest in the hyperbolic world
","The story nicely catches the competition within the fashion industry. It's really a 'dog eat dog' world where one either really loves being so hyperbolic about style and fashion, or forces him/herself to love it and sacrifices so much of his/her personal life. It sure does build on Andy's original character well on the start, and also showed that she's an adaptive person with high sense of initiative. But it kind of raised a philosophical question for me at the end. Can we really say that Andy has a strong will after going through all that and still able to say no and refuse that kind of life Miranda offered her? Or will she be even better if she refused it from the very start? The acting is decently nice overall. Anne Hathaway did quite okay yet she didn't really do well on sad expressions. Meryl Streep plated the ice cold calculated style guru very well, keeping the calm voice intonation almost all the way.",6,0,0,30 September 2014
Southpaw," Great acting work all over
","The movie is indeed very predictable and a true cliché in terms of the story. It feels like someone blends in the Rocky-Junior relationship drama from Rocky V and the comeback drama from Rocky III then added the wife's death as the linking trigger. Also the movie presents to many plots that it didn't do enough justice in closing, such as the side plots with the crew, with Hoppy, and even with Tick. Yet the movie still stands tough with its exquisite acting performance. Jake Gyllenhaal deserves most of the credit for this as he really nailed both parts of his role as the father and the fighter. Rachel McAdams, although only in the movie for about half an hour, made sure her presence felt significant and her absence influential. Oona Laurence is surprising as she can really balance both McAdams and Gyllenhaal's acting. Forest Whitaker's performance really completes the movie's awesome acting level in general.",7,0,2,29 August 2015
Ant-Man," Nice touch of heist movie flavor
","An expert safe-cracker Scott Lang just been released from jail determined to turn away from crime. But his history makes it hard to get a job, particularly with a threat of never getting to see his daughter Cassie again. He turns to his old crew who had a tip about a safe. They help Scott infiltrate the place and Scott easily cracks it, but it only contains an old suit. Scott gets curious and puts it on. He hits a switch, and shrinks to the size of an ant and hears someone talking to him. His friend Luis unknowingly flushes him out. Returning the suit to the house Scott gets arrested. Dr. Hank Pym meets him, suggesting him to follow instructions. He obeys and again dons the suit provided and escapes by shrinking. Back at the house Scott finds Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne. They ask him to be Ant-Man to stop Darren Cross replicating Pym's research and selling it as a weapon. First Scott must train with the suit, maneuvering in and out of shrink and controlling ants. Scott progresses slowly, making Hope questions Hank's decision and suggests instead she executes the mission, but Hank denies her. Hank reveals a secret about how Hope's mother died. This helps Hope gets easier on Scott, thus she helps him hone ant control. Last part of training has Scott retrieving Hank's technology from Howard Stark's warehouse, but it was given to The Avengers as their new base. Falcon catches Ant-Man breaching the perimeter. But Ant-Man defeats Falcon by shrinking into his suit and tampering the electronics. That night they find Cross sneaked into the house. He invites Pym to Pym Technologies tomorrow. Cross tells Hope, who's been Pym's mole in Cross' lab, that he's increasing security for tomorrow. Scott suggests an idea to bypass the security, but it needs extra men. They add Scott's old crew of Luis, Dave and Kurt. The next day, Luis infiltrates as a guard and de-pressurizes water mains where Ant-Man goes in. Cross reveals to Pym he managed to replicate Pym's research and selling it to HYDRA, and that he knows Scot's identity. Cross gets Ant-Man trapped inside a glass jar so Hope blows her cover and aims a gun to Cross. Scott throws an enlarging disk and escapes the jar, igniting a shootout which clips Pym on the chest. Cross flees but Ant-Man manages to damage his helicopter. But Cross manages to wear the Yellowjacket suit and fights Ant-Man. Ant-Man manages to swash the shrunk Yellowjacket but then the police arrests him. Yellowjacket goes to where Cassie lives but Scott manages to catch up. They fight in shrunk condition and Scott takes the risk of shrinking between the molecules to penetrate Yellowjacket's armor and tampers with the electronics. As Scott shrinks even more, he thinks of Cassie and inserts an enlarging disk into the regulator and goes back to size.It's good that Marvel had realized that with all the other studios following their formula of a shared universe, they need more than superheroes on movies to grab viewers. By that they did a decently good effort in adding another sub-genre to the individual movies, particularly the sub-genres which have a close relevance to the superheroes' abilities or backgrounds. We saw more of a spy movie back in Captain America The Winter Soldier, a Star Wars-like space epic in Guardians of the Galaxy, and now some splashes of a heist movie in Ant- Man (2015).The movie has the complete compulsory ingredients of a heist movie; a crew, an ace safe-cracker or conman, police interactions, double- crossing, successful and botched plans, and of course some jokes. Yes, as a heist movie Ant-Man is still a far comparison to other more focused ones. But still it's a decently nice effort to even incorporate those elements to attain the strong heist movie flavor in a superhero movie.The action scenes are consequently littered with CGI all over. But still the movie handled the action well enough to keep it a worthy addition into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One thing that's weird is that when the camera changes perspectives from shrunk to normal size and vice versa, the normal size view seldom offer any difference, making the transitions a little bit nagging.The movie also faces a latent spotlight on the finale conflict setup. It doesn't offer epic scale destruction and mayhem like what we saw at Battle of Greenwich in The Dark World, or Triskelion's destruction in The Winter Soldier, or the Xandarian skies in GotG, or even the falling Sokovia in Age of Ultron. This movie's final battle instead takes place in a little girl's bedroom. The sub-atomic sequence could really explored a little bit more, or at least they could add more screen time to it. It would show up like the time journey sequence in Interstellar or 2001 A Space Oddysey.The acting overall is just a little above standards. Paul Rudd's performance here surely isn't his best because his face doesn't really convey much emotion, and so did Evangeline Lily. Michael Douglas did well to liven his character as a mentor. Corey Stoll did well enough to make his villain character stand out, too bad there's little time in his character development.A score of 7 out of 10 is from me for Ant-Man (2015). A recommendation is a so-so. For me it's an okay addition to MCU, and it's good that the movie has a heist movie flavor. Yet I think it could be done even better.",7,0,6,21 July 2015
Fargo," Turns out not only Tarantino can make all the bloody stuff
","The story claimed to be based on factual true events; it makes it more interesting to see. The basic premise is a rare one, a lying husband decide to con his way to his father-in-law's money turns out of control and claiming many lives. The story and focus dramatization were developed well; it was able to emphasize the thriller aspect as well as at the same time presenting the quirkiness of the story in the characters. We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story. Macy and McDormand performed their roles well; they managed to keep me interested in seeing what's next for them. While the quirky pair of Buscemi and Stormare can bring a few laughs into the horrific tale told here.",7,0,0,24 July 2014
Nightcrawler," Intriguing movie of how a man can do anything at his job
","Lou is a determined and driven man looking for work. He talks smart, learns fast, and at everything, he's willing to do almost anything. One night he stumbles upon Joe Loder's crew of nightcrawlers, amateur news crew who rush to crime or accident scenes to get footage to sell to TV Stations. He immediately buys a camera and a police scanner and goes on hunting for footage. Lou doesn't hesitate to involve himself in the scene, breaking into homes and rearranging things if he feels the need arises. Soon he's able to pay an assistant Rick to read him directions so he can arrive faster than other crews, though Rick fumbles bad at his first time. Lous sells his footage to Nina from Channel 6. Even though her colleagues reject Lou'd work for looking like he barges in to homes uninvited , Nina still uses them. Some while later, Lou asks Nina on a date. She declines the offer, but eventually agrees to it as Lou threatens to stop selling her the footage if she declines. Loder meets Lou and offers him a position under him. Lou firmly rejects it. At the date, Lou tells Nina he wants to be more than professional acquaintances, to which Nina again refuses. But Lou reminds her that her Channel is the lowest rated in town, so she needs him as he wants her. Lou and Rick are beaten by Loder's crew at an incident, making Nina rejects Lou's footage on it. The angry Lou goes and tampers the brakes on Loder's van. Later, Loder gets into an accident because of it while Lou films him being taken to the hospital. A home invasion at a mansion gives Lou a big break. He and Rick arrives before the cops. Lou gets into the house filming all the graphic footage. He succeeds in pushing his big demands to Nina over the footage. But then detectives visit Lou and demand a copy of the video. Lou doesn't tell them that he saw two suspects fleeing the scene as he arrived at the mansion. Lou brings Rick to track the killers down. Rick demands a raise due to the dangerous nature of what they're doing now. Lou agrees to Rick's number but answers he could have gone for higher. They then find the killers at a restaurant and Lou reports the location to the cops and that one of them has a gun. Cops starts to come two by two and the killers starts shooting. After his friend got shot, a killer flees the restaurant. Lou and Rick join as cops give chase. Eventually the killer's car and a cop car crash. Lou close in with his camera, sees the killer, and tells Rick that the killer's dead. Rick comes in for a close up when suddenly the killer shoots three holes in his body. While Rick's dying, Lou reveals that Rick's beginning to trouble Lou as the business owner. Nina is amazed by the footage. The detectives confiscate the footage as it's evidence. They also question Lou, saying he may had withheld information about the killers. Lou dances his tongue without blinking, so the cops let him walk. Her colleagues approach Nina about the real story of the mansion, drug robbery considering there were packs of drug in the mansion. But Nina dismisses it, stating the the criminal violence angle is more appealing. Lou then manages to grow his business, now with three interns .The story is very nice that it has equally strong positive and negative depictions of the human nature amidst all those gruesome imagery. I like how the story shows that determination is one of the main keys of success. This is shown in how Lou can advance from being jobless to earning his first pay for his footage. Yes, the negative depictions are even more overwhelming. Lou's blatant drive of advancing his own interests, even by doing all and everything, is not exemplary at all.The movie nicely depicts how a resourceful man with the right entry point can end up a successful man in a harsh city such as Los Angeles. Or is it the otherwise, that in a city such as Los Angeles we often demanded to do everything even bad things to be successful? The movie also nicely grasps the possible outcomes that can happen in such cases of criminality. It limits itself challengingly in showing those graphic imagery.The acting work overall owes its good perspective to Jake Gyllenhaal. He did a very great job in depicting the Lou Bloom character. He really realized that the movie's mostly centered on Lou and how Lou deal with things his own way. He nicely balances that aspect of Lou's unmeasured blatancy with the constant great play of facial expressions. He did great on those serious faces, especially on those crucial parts with Rick, and those newbie smirks when Lou kind of begs for a job even as an intern. Rene Russo and Bill Paxton did quite nice in giving the much needed balancing angles for the story, For me Nightcrawler is worthy of a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a definite and quick yes from me. It's very intriguing as a movie that it leaves the viewers with contradicting senses of being irritated but also amazed by what Lou did.",7,1,2,3 December 2014
The Aviator," Magnificent acting by Leo DiCaprio
","The story really has to get a grip for itself because the movie seems not to be depicting a balanced portrayal of a person. But it may yet slip through as the person depicted lived more than fifty years ago. I see the movie a little too much in depicting Hughes' weaknesses, particularly his obsessive compulsive behavior and his paranoia of just about everything. But that in turn gave Leo his chance to elaborate on his acting. Thus the acting overall is indeed a great work in my eyes. Leo DiCaprio did very well in depicting the movie's version of Howard Hughes. I really like the way hoe Leo's acting seems to carry Hughes' weaknesses to other scenes, even on the ones in which Hughes is a strong person. Having John C. Reilly and an assortment of A-list talents really helped to balance the whole acting overall and took it to the greatness level it deserved.",7,0,0,27 June 2015
The Killing Fields," Suspenseful, shocking and touching as a thriller
","Te movie managed to be very much shocking and haunting with its horrifying images of the Pol Pot camps and killing fields. It's also very suspenseful and touching at how the expatriates try so hard, and remorse harder when they failed, to fake documents for Pran. Later the movie nicely changes too insert touching remarks as Sydney can't let go of his guilt for leaving Pran behind. I like how the movie tried to depict as similar as possible the environment of the location and time frame. GThe props and location settings are chosen well to give a good portrayal of the crisis era. The acting in overall feels nice. James Waterston handled his character's stubbornness well enough that it permeates into the whole movie. Haing S Ngor is the real jewel as the seemingly calm character he played as Pran can somehow emanate the aura of worry and his family and at the same time caring for his partner Sydney.",7,0,0,18 November 2015
21," Great technical subject with added twists
",The story is based on a book so it does feel very much grandiose. The movie nicely introduces the basics of the subject of blackjack card counting and showing good depiction of first hand practice. Yet the movie wisely refrains from showing the details of the introduced basics so as not to encourage the practice even more. The added twists nicely start at the exact half time of the movie. Those twists and turns escalated on an accelerated rate well enough until the movie hits us with the double hidden story flow that's revealed as the surprise ending at the finale. The acting overall is decently good. Jim Sturgess portrayed the semi nerd college student with almost perfect expressions. Kevin Spacey lives up to his reputation as one of the ultimate antagonists. Kate Bosworth nicely provided the love interest angle. Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapra also adds well enough to the team setting.,7,0,0,14 February 2015
The Revenant," A great gem for the eyes to see
","Hugh Glass is a military scout. With his Indian half-breed son Hawk, he serve in with John Fitzgerald, and Jim Bridger under Commander Andrew Henry, tasked to hunt animal pelts. They have to face both the Indians and the French. While hunting, Glass returns back to camp after hearing a commotion when the Indians attack. They flee to the river as the attack kills 33 men. Fitzgerald suggest a route but Glass suggest an opposite route. Henry listens to Glass and they rest for the night. At first light Glass goes ahead first as Hawk remains with the company. But Glass enters a Grizzly bear's domain and gets attacked viciously. He manages to kill the beast, but his throat is injured badly, making him unable to speak. The company finds him and carries him. Fitzgerald suggests to leave Glass as apparently they can't save him. Eventually Henry gives up, but he insists that Glass die naturally, promising money for three men who stay with Glass. Hawk and Bridger volunteer, and surprisingly so did Fitzgerald.But Fitzgerald gets impatient, offering Glass a quick death if he just blinks. Glass closes his eyes for some time, and when he opens them Fitzgerald considers it as blinking then tries to kill him. Hawk catches Fitzgerald and the two struggle, but eventually Fitzgerald kills Hawk. Bridger comes and Fitzgerald convince him to bury Glass alive in a shallow grave. He stops as Glass is neck deep. Glass crawls out of his grave, surviving on eating bits and pieces until he can stand again. Able to walk, Glass meets an Indian man carving meat from a dead beast. Glass begs for some and the man gives, but he faints after eating. The Indian is actually pursuing his daughter Powaqa's kidnappers. He helps Glass after he explains his ordeal. The man builds Glass a makeshift shelter when they face a blizzard. When Glass wakes up the man has gone. Glass finds a French trappers' camp, and waits until nightfall then readies to steal a horse. A French man brings an Indian girl and rapes her near Glass. He rescues the girl and they escape on a stolen horse, but Glass dropped the flask Bridger left him.The girl leaves Glass and The French pursuers catches up on him, so he runs off of a cliff, killing his horse. As another blizzard looms, Glass removes the horse's entrails and use the carcass as a cocoon. One of the French wanders into Henry's fort, bringing the Bridger's flask. Henry wonders if it's the missing Hawk, so they set out to find him. They instead find Glass himself. Henry rides back ahead but Fitzgerald had already gone with the company's money. Glass reveals the truth, asking supplies to hunt Fitzgerald. Henry goes with him. As Glass spots a camp's smoke in the wilderness, he and Henry check it out from opposite directions. But Henry meets Fitzgerald, who then kills him. Glass finds the body and uses it to lure Fitzgerald out. He succeeds and they fight a bloody melee. Glass finally has the upper hand and readies his killing blow. But he spots a band of Indians up the river and remembers the words of the previous Indian man that revenge is in God's hands, and he lets Fitzgerald floats on the current to them, who kills him.Another great movie this month, The Revenant (2015) is full of great work in acting, directing and effects. The story is like other revenge movies, although I don't think the movie was clear enough at it. There's a lot of unnecessary footage if we see it story-wise. There are quite a lot of other story elements which are not concluded in the end.But I must say again that the movie is a gem technical-wise. It's a beautiful sight to see. Inarritu was very kind in supplying us with another trick up his sleeve. Here you see a lot of mind bending close up shots of crazy stunts. They are enabled by the help of moving camera and impeccable timing execution that lets it require less editing.There are many moments where the movie builds up suspense with the camera closing up on the actors, pans away, rotates to view the surroundings, and suddenly we have them getting shot at point blank. The special effects are done well that the stunts achieved their intended effect. Many times I was left behind as I was wondering how did they rigged the stunt that just happened when suddenly the movie just shoves another crazy stunt in my face.The cinematography is great. Emmanuel Lubezki is really looking like he's aiming for another Oscar. Aside from the great job on the main story elements, there are also very pretty photography in this movie. Lubezki did a great job in capturing the spirit of the location to insert into the movie.The acting overall is just superb. Leonardo DiCaprio did great in handling the dominant focus his character has as the entire movie mostly centers on Glass. Tom Hardy managed to bend himself into yet another believable character, despite the original reasoning of his apathy to Glass' ordeal remains unclear. Domnhall Gleeson's star is clearly rising steadily, as he secured roles in three acclaimed movie this year so far; here, Star Wars Episode VII, and Ex Machina. Will Poulter nicely adds depth to the whole story, as with the native American cast.For me The Revenant (2015) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. It would have been more enjoyable for the ordinary people if there's less duration that only contains silence. I did enjoy the movie though, yet I don't think many other ordinary people will too.",7,8,19,24 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," A great work despite lacking suspense
","1957. Rudolph Abel is being followed as he retrieves a 'dead drop'. Back on his place, FBI agents soon storm in and arrest him. Insurance lawyer James Donovan is a skilled negotiator. He gets tasked to defend Abel despite it's been long since he handled a crime case. He accepts anyways. His family questions him about defending an enemy spy, but he insists on his professional code, even advising Abel not to tell anything to the government. Meanwhile, an Air Force lieutenant Francis Gary Powers and a few colleagues get handpicked by the CIA. A CIA agent Hoffman approaches Jim about Abel but he divulges nothing. Jim argues about the legality of the search at Abel's place as there's no warrant; but he meets a dead end. Abel is found guilty of espionage, but the judge holds the sentence for another day. Visited in jail, Abel tells Jim that he looks like his father's friend who stood even after severe beatings. Jim visited the judge with his view of for Abel's sentence; that the judge shouldn't sentence Abel to die so he can be exchanged if suddenly a US spy gets captured in Russia. The judge decides to put Abel incarcerated, to public disagreement.Gary gets explained about the poison should he get shot down, which he eventually does over Russia. Jim gets a letter from Leipzig supposedly from Abel's family, so he brings it to him. Abel says it's a Russian way to contact him. In Russia, Gary's trial concludes The CIA summons Jim saying he's entrusted to negotiate an exchange of Abel for Gary. He has to act on his own, with no official government support. As Jim arrives in Berlin, complications take place as a US student Frederic Pryor is captured in East Berlin. Hoffman, now Jim's handler, tells him the Russians may switch Powers with Pryor. Jim goes to the Russian embassy in East Berlin supposedly to meet Abel's family lawyer, Mr. Vogel. Instead he meets Ivan Schischkin. He tries everything at Jim; sweet-talking to smoothly threatening; to get Abel and delay Gary's release. But Jim doesn't flinch; he even asks for both Gary and Pryor for Abel, though Schischkin insisted that Pryor is under East German authority. Next Jim meets Vogel who brings the East Germans voice, which demands the US parlays with them about Pryor, acknowledging them as a sovereign state. Hoffman tells Jim to sideline Pryor. Jim and Schischkin agree on the exchange place in Glienicke Bridge. Vogel backs down, saying Jim's selling the same thing to two parties. As Jim hitches a ride in his car, Vogel tricks him into spending a night in an East German jail. Hoffman accidentally tells Jim that the East German attorney general wants to meet him. But when they meet there's no agreement as Jim insists on his proposal; Abel for both Gary and Pryor. Hoffman gets angry with this, but as they wait eventually confirmation come from other side that Jim gets his way, although the East Germans want to exchange in Checkpoint Charlie. As they wait on the bridge, Jim keeps asking about Checkpoint Charlie. When the Russians arrive and both parties confirm identities, Jim asks to halt the exchange as he realizes the East Germans stall to see if the Americans go through while forgetting Pryor. At last the East Germans arrive and Pryor gets secured, so the Gary and Abel gets exchanged. Jim goes home and his family sees his name credited for Gary's release.The story contains great potential. A lawyer fervently defends his client despite obvious bias weighing the case, turning into a story of how a civilian managed to negotiate two-for-one prisoner exchange; this movie has its two major acts brimming with things to focus more on. Unfortunately, for me this movie feels like it lacks something. As a story about spies, the movie's first act looks more like a courtroom flick. It tries making it up on the second act, showing great visuals of Berlin on the early Wall era. But still the movie lacks much in suspense, a feat any real spy movie should have.The technicals in this movie work great wonders. The sets and props look very convincing. I very much enjoy the Berlin Wall train view as great never-been-done visuals. The scoring is also great as it supports in creating great mood for its scenes. The sequence when Pryor gets arrested is also great since as far as I know this movie is the first to show the Berlin Wall as it's being erected. The U2 shooting scene is also a great work as Gary's perspective view from his chute looks very beautiful.The movie did great in building up its mood and depicting the common anxiety in the Cold War era, particularly with the side scenes. Still, the lack of suspense really undermines the good things in this movie, particularly since this is a Steven Spielberg movie, who did great job in building the suspense in movies like Saving Private Ryan and Munich. The movie could also give more screen time for the second act to emphasize more on the spy aspect of the story, instead of balancing the courtroom drama and the Berlin negotiations.Acting-wise, the movie is a great work. As the main focus, Tom Hanks nicely measured his performance to be believable and yet still portraying Jim's persistence on his terms of the negotiation. Mark Rylance did well in balancing the performance as in one frame with Hanks. Austin Stowell and Scott Shepherd added nicely to the story angles. Sebastian Koch also did adequately to the story.My view for Bridge of Spies (2015) is it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a so-so say from me since although it's a piece of great film work, still the movie lacks the suspense that the audience looks for in a spy movie.",7,2,7,17 October 2015
North by Northwest," Quite entertaining although not that solidly built
","The story's basic premise is quite nice, especially for the era of the 1960s. It has since seen many other movie productions using the similar basic premise of ordinary people being mistaken as spies. The screenplay development isn't really that good, though, considering there's too much talk compared to significant spies work or fugitive hunting or avoiding capture, which what the movie is perceived to be offering. The technical things rather annoy me, like there is a strange and imbalanced lighting all over the movie, and the user of too much backdrop for background video. Yes those are maybe tolerable for those era, but for the later times like such as now, they seem quite stupid. The acting is quite nice, the actors try their best not too overact the scenes, yet they still do in a greater part of the movie.",6,3,8,30 June 2014
Knowing," A nice thriller and sci-fi entertainment
","The story is just another an apocalypse narrative like any others. The variation in the story that aliens are protecting humans by selecting some kids and 'whispering' them signs and clues about the impending doom, and ultimately taking them someplace else to start over doesn't really make the story a unique one. The thriller side is quite nice. Combined with the strong sci-fi practice, this movie managed to keep me curious and stayed on to watch. Although I must say that I'm rather disappointed with the ending because the mysterious whisper people are revealed not as expected. The depiction of the alien race is quite nice. In some ways, it tries to connect our science, reports of alien sightings and experiences, myths, and religious faith into one depiction. The acting by Cage is just a so-so and is not a special thing. Byrne's performance though, is a nice one because she can grasp the emotions involved in the scenes, whether on the calm situations like most of her scenes, or the elevated situations like the one in the gas station.",6,1,3,21 July 2014
The Shining," The classic example of a murder horror
","The movie starts out slowly, as eventually all he other murders will gladly follow suit. But this movie's start up doesn't take very long. It soon takes the viewers to the lonesome world of the big hotel. The thriller sets in very nicely, building momentum for the barrage of horror moments. What I like about this horror is that Stanley Kubrick dared to use minimal amount of dark lit environment, compared to what almost all of the recent horrors are depending their scares upon. The repeated long shot on the corridors are very nice touches that help build curiosity. Those shots puts the object right on sight but with lacking clarity, sometimes prompting the viewers to slant their eyes to have better glimpse of what's being shown. The acting by Jack Nicholson deserves a legendary status indeed. His role gets into character very nicely that when it comes to the twist of the typed pages, even I was surprised, although I have been anticipating such a twist.",7,1,4,7 September 2014
Judgment at Nuremberg," Great depiction of conflicting interests and principles
","The movie, even as a courtroom flick, is really not for just about everybody. It's because the movie with it's long duration tends to be boring at times with those long dialog. The intermezzo between the court room scenes didn't rally help much because those scenes don't really expand into something new beside being refreshing scenes between the court room sessions. But the depiction of the conflicting principles and interests is neatly done. The movie can really crash those in the court room, silently portraying it on the faces of the characters. The cinematography helped a lot in this effort by providing the right angles for close ups at impeccable timing.",6,0,3,14 November 2015
Apocalypse Now," Strong depiction of war story-wise and technical wise
","The story rolls out strongly from the very start, depicting the post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. It ran a steadily strong story with virtually every scene, presenting the depictions as various as the scenes of Hau Phat, the Playmates, the ARVN, the bridge, and finally the Colonel scenes. I watched the redux version, which runs for more than three hours. The movie for me is very successful in depicting the Vietnam war visually using great lighting techniques. But the strongest part of this movie is surely the straightforwardly kind of disturbing scenes. Martin Sheen retained the composure of a slightly appalled soldier who is tempted to question his orders. Marlon Brando enrich the movie with the successful depiction of the Colonel character which was neatly built through mystery throughout the movie.",8,0,1,5 September 2014
Divergent," A good franchise starter
","DivergentHere comes a new post. Another movie review, on this week's highest buzz on the cinemas, Divergent. FYI, I haven't read the book as I write this review, but I just saw the movie just now, on the local theater, which I seldom do. Looking at the buzz, not just from IMDb and movie sites, but also from my own community of colleagues, I think the title does worth a review.So the story of the movie is another post apocalypse future of the real world. Everywhere else is presumably wiped out, all the way BUT Chicago. Yeah, you can bet that feels strange for me. Why Chicago? It eludes me why Chicago should be picked as the city surviving the apocalyptic war a hundred years earlier. So anyway, the society of Chicago is then divided into groups, Factions, based on the 5 basic dominant nature of humankind according to the author. This also bothers me, why only five? And after that, why THOSE five?....... okay, enough with it LOL, let's get back to the story. The five traits are intelligence, represented by the Erudite faction; justice, represented by Candar, kindness, represented by Amity; caring, represented by Abrigation; and last but not least bravery, represented by Dauntless. And then we go to the main protagonist, Beatrice, an Abrigation kid, who comes of age and has to choose her own faction freely. Before so she has to go through a test that will advice her what faction suits her best. But guess what, her test results are inconclusive, a Divergent as it's called. Beatrice's faction advice was Abrigation, Erudite, and Dauntless altogether. The test admin Tori then secretly sneaked her out, Divergents are considered dangerous to the society. She then chose to enter Dauntless, and change her name to Tris. It's a logical decision, in my opinion, that she chose Dauntless, even without her being aware of it as logical. Any unaligned behavior would be most tolerable within the Dauntless, which are tasked as soldiers and guards. She then goes through rigorous physical and strategic training. She had to strife well on the physicals, but she surpasses everyone else in collective strategic training. At the next step of training, which is supposed to be the hardest, mental test through hallucination of your biggest fears, she passes with ease, so easy that her instructor Four is suspicious. Four and Tris then get close, and they found out a plan of the smart Erudite wanting to overthrow the caring Abrigation from government. Four then is revealed to also be a Divergent hiding in the Dauntless. The finale is the Erudite manipulates the Dauntless using a chemical controlling agent. Tris and Four's identity as a Divergent is discovered, but they manage to escape death.For me the cast is quite good, mixing in the seasoned ones with rising stars. After that sexy performance in 'The Spectacular Now' Shailene Woodley is to proof to the cinema world that she can have a good franchise movie series. Theo James acts well enough for a newcomer in the big leagues. Same goes for Zoe Kravitz. Seniors as Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn and Kate Winslet adds flavor and appeal to the movie as a whole. Unfortunately their role dies out on this movie, since with that kind of ending, I'm sure there will be sequels.The basic story is indeed very interesting, though indeed too imaginative. In reality, that kind of categorization of the society will not run at all. Logically a normal person will have more than one dominant nature within him or her, even from the five natures that were chosen as the story's faction natures. But then again it is indeed a very interesting story that is also developed well. The story twists are quite good, despite of them being a bit predictable, and the whole story being designed to appeal primarily to young adults.The advanced development into screenplay is just average for me. The dialog and expressions don't really expand the basic story. But they are alright, in the way that it does just meet the limit to communicate the message of the scenes well enough.The action sequence is just simple one-move stunts or scenes that are heavily manipulated through editing, making it relatively easy for the cast who are mostly without any previous background in movies of action or fighting. In my opinion the stunts are relatively simple because they are can be easily shoot in one take using multiple cameras in different angles to get the editing process easier and offer more perspective to the shot.The fighting style is quite unique. It sports a new-to-the eye stance position. It is close, but not being to close, in launching attacks. In my opinion this addition compliments the movie greatly.Being a movie about the future post-apocalypse world, costumes do play a big part in it. And costumes for 'Divergent' doesn't fall into the disappointing category. Costumes for each faction at the same time matches the look for the respective factions and not being to hyperbolic. Touches of coloration is played well in the costumes section. Having the movie's tangible element for story emphasizing focused on the costumes, the makeup for the movie doesn't really have to stand out, just enough to depict the conditions of each faction. For me the scoring for the movie doesn't really stand out. It is just there to fill out the audible moments. Yet the soundtrack contains many catchy contemporary musics. I hear tunes that sound like Emmy Rossum's songs, which are happening currently, a tune with some clubbing culture influence, but not being too much of a niche's music. The soundtracks are put beautifully into matching moments.Overall, for me it's a good movie, but still is not as good as 'The Hunger Games'. From me, I give it a 6 out of 10 score, and a go-and-see- it recommendation.",6,2,14,22 March 2014
In the Name of the Father," Very solid in all aspects
","The story gets nicely and quickly direct. It greatly covers many subjects beside the focus on the wrongful imprisonment. There are also the father- son relationship, small instances of youth mischief, the overall Troubles in Belfast and the pressure that makes the four confessed what they didn't do. The visuals are also great thing to see. The early Belfast depiction is something very attention grabbing. I watched '71 some time ago and now know where does the movie get their inspiration to depict the Belfast chaos. The acting overall is also a great job. Daniel Day-Lewis did great in portraying the character's personality and the changes happened through the fifteen years. Emma Thomson did well enough through her relatively short screen time. Pete Postlethwaite also did very well in balancing Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.",7,1,1,30 October 2015
Being John Malkovich," A crazy story yet very much entertaining
","The movie starts very curiously with the puppet dance sequence. The next sequence about the house full of various pets even more intrigued me while watching. The story keeps on building the stupid ideas with the floor number and the literal manifestation of it. And when the real John Malkovich comes in, well, its just the real start of the craziness. The movie depicts various bad values people tend to choose in order to indulge themselves; from homosexuality, unfaithfulness, to organized crime of some sort (the mob of old men rushing to John Malkovich's body). The acting is nice. John Mlakovich can keep his hard and peculiar character even though he plays the shocked character. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz all played their parts very well, defining the crucial angles for the story.",7,0,0,26 September 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Good, but still can't beat Ghost Protocol
","After preventing a batch of nerve gas transport to Syria, Ethan Hunt gets trapped by the Syndicate, the organization he's been tracking, and a figure reveals himself to Ethan. In captive a female Syndicate agent helps him escape from Janik Vinter. At the same time the IMF gets shut down by CIA Director Hunley. So Ethan goes ghost again for the next six months investigating more about the Syndicate. He gets Benji to help him on a mission in the Vienna opera, convinced that the figure will be there too. Ethan finds the female agent and two other Syndicate agents aiming for the Austrian chancellor, so he clips the chancellor to prevent his killing. Ethan finds the female agent and together they escape the building, only to be chased down by Syndicate agents and the chancellor gets killed by a car bomb. The female agent introduces herself as Ilsa Faust, a deep cover inserted by MI6 into the Syndicate. Ethan has to let her go to lose the pursuers, but he already gets her lipstick, which actually has a hidden USB compartment.They meet again in the Moroccos where Ilsa explains about Syndicate leader Solomon Lane and a file kept in an offline secure computer facility. Ethan has to swim and hold his breath for three minutes to install a security profile to help Benji copy the file. Ethan passes out right after installing the profile but Ilsa goes in and helps him exit. But Ilsa steals the file from Benji and escapes, so Etha and Benji pursues her, who are also getting chased by Syndicate agents. Eventually she loses them all and brings the file to Atlee, her handler in MI6. Atlee denies her request to get out of cover and instead sends her and the file back to Lane. Lane finds the file has been deleted, but they all know that Ethan already made another copy. Ethan's team finds the file to be a British virtual red box, unlock-able only by the UK prime minister. Lane then kidnaps Benji while the team meets with Ilsa. Ethan then convinces his team to help him, particularly Brandt who gets anxious about the mission.Brandt phones Hunley to meet him in London, convincing Hunley that the PM's life is in danger. Hunley goes to Atlee, who is in fact the Chief at MI6, and they with Brandt secures the PM in a room and explains things to him. While unlocking the file, the PM reveals that the Syndicate is real, the brain-child of Atlee, which surprises Hunley which all this time disbelieves Hunt about it. Ethan reveals himself behind a mask of Atlee's face and Hunley gets to be the hero when the real Atlee arrives. With the file Ethan faces Lane, who has Benji hostage with a bomb. After an argument Lane releases Benji, but then hunts Ethan and Ilsa. Ilsa ultimately faces and kills Vinter. Ethan eventually manages to trap Lane in a box, a payback to what he did in the movie's start.The story feels nicely comparable to previous Mission Impossible movies. All the signature elements are still in play; the hidden message compartment, the face mask, and the intrigue and deception among intelligence agents. As a whole, this installment feel somewhat lacking, especially if we compare it to the last in Ghost Protocol. The thing is that despite that the basic premise of having an anti-IMF organization hell bent on destroying the system of the world feels very urgent, yet the movie didn't really keep up with this and lacks in depicting the sense urgency in it.The characters in the movie are developed in an unbalanced fashion. While Ethan Hunt and his team has the starting capital of the character development from the previous movies, The balancing character angles have very poor development or even screen time in that manner. The character Solomon Lane succeeded in inciting curiosity after the cold introduction. Yet he rarely gets seen on the rest of the movie that his character feels quite empty.The action is quite good in overall. They still look very much a Mission Impossible action scenes with cool looking action scenes. Although again they didn't really help the movie as a whole, especially in creating enough suspense. Many of the action sequences looks repetitive either in previous Mission Impossible movies, such as the bicycle chase sequence, or any other spy movies, such as the rooftop escape sequence that is reminiscent of Bond movies. Still many of them had impossible continuance, like Ethan having no scratch after his bicycle accident.The acting overall is a good one for me. Tom Cruise acted his parts nicely and this time managed to cut down his grinning which made Ethan look stupid in the previous movies. Simon Pegg did his parts nicely although his character here seems like he's only a sweetener. Rebecca Ferguson is indeed the movie's crown jewel with her charming and convincing performance and her character's high significance. It's too bad that we don't see Jeremy Renner in any action, though.My final say is a solid 7 out of 10 score for Mission Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015). A recommendation is a definite yes from me. Although this movie can't really top Ghost Protocol, it can still give us nice action sequences.",7,0,3,7 August 2015
The Machinist," A creepier and more suicidal version of Tyler Durden
","As said in this review's title, the basic premise is still an uncommon one although it's increasingly often used in thrillers. The recipe of insomnia + hallucination + going crazy because of the first two things is strikingly similar to the one used in Fight Club (1999). But The machinist (2004) take it on a more realistic route, that is the dwindling weight and deteriorating physical shape. At the end this movie takes it a bit further to make guilt as the the biggest drive of the insomnia and hallucination, and that the need to sleep is the main purpose of the main character. I personally give a huge regard on how Christian Bale gave his great totality in all of his movies. And this movie more than others highlights that totality by having Bale slim down to an almost dangerous level of body weight. The other cast member also did quite a good job, but they pale in comparison to Bale's efforts to get in to character.",6,0,1,9 July 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the rare gems of this year's movies
","The story follows Wolverine as his mind is sent back through time, using Kitty Pride's powers, into his old body to stop a losing war between mutants and the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels. He then finds and convinces young Charles/Professor X and Hank/Beast to help him. Charles is able to walk by taking Beast's serum, in exchange of temporarily losing his mutant powers. Aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik/Magneto from his concrete prison. Logan tells the group that the war starts from the moment Raven/Mystique kills Trask, the scientist who designs the Sentinels. The group catches Raven just as she's about to kill Trask and her cover is blown. Trask escapes and Erik shoots Raven to prevent anyone getting her DNA that can help Sentinels against the mutants. Hank disrupts Erik but he manages to fire and hit Raven. Logan sees Stryker in the room and he goes haywire, injuring Kitty in the present. Erik keeps on hunting Raven, as bystanders watch in horror, but Beast tackles Erik as Raven escapes. Erik manages to escape after subduing Beast. People panicked at the sight of mutant powers in public and Trask wins funding for the Sentinels. Raven ambushes Erik, but Erik tells her Trask has gotten her DNA from the blood on the street. When Logan's group reaches home, Charles goes ill as he needs the serum. Logan convinces Charles not to take it and to read his mind, by which the old and young Charles converse. Erik slips into the Sentinel shipment and reconfigure the non-metal Sentinels into having metals. Charles locates Raven but fails to stop her. Logan's group then goes to the Sentinel launching event in the White House to stop her. Erik goes to the same venue. Logan's group arrives then Charles locates and subdues Raven. Suddenly the Sentinels, under Erik's control, turns on and go haywire so the VIPs flee to a vault bunker. Erik then drops a stadium around the White House, pinning Charles in the debris. Erik yanks the vault up. At the present, fighting also rages on and the mutants slowly but surely losing their ground, dying one by one. Logan and Hank attacks Erik, but he sends a Sentinel on them. Hank handles the Sentinel, but Erik incapacitates Logan, tying him with metal bars then throws him into the river. Erik then rips open the vault and makes a speech about the mutant world order. Raven, disguised as the President goes out from the vault and challenges Erik. Hank patches his serum and the Sentinel goes from him into targeting Erik and Raven. Erik disjoints the robot and Raven shoot him and removes his helmet. Charles then subdues Erik but Raven aims then gun to Trask. Charles reasons with her. As the present Sentinels fire beams to kill the remaining Logan and Kitty, they all disappear. Raven yields in, dropping the gun thus altering the future. Logan wakes up in the present Xavier school, seeing all those who have died still live. He meets Charles and Charles realizes that it is the Logan from the past and begins explaining what Logan has missed from the past to this altered reality.The base story is just exceptionally great. Though it's not as epic as other sci-fi gems, but it's able to present a complex story without differing from the original comics story characteristics. It is by far the first movie to successfully marry the concepts of super-powers and time-travel in one story and executes the story greatly. The movie also offer some epic moments, some never before seen in any movie. I personally liked the Quicksilvers resonating hands and of course Magneto's stadium drop. The dialog contains many catchy comments. I liked Magneto's words to Logan as seeing his claws 'Imagine that with metal' that sounded just as vividly as a premonition of what is to come.One thing that's not so satisfying is that the movie looks to be too limited by a duration length target that it doesn't spare any character development on any of the newly appearing mutants. I just hope that they get more spotlight in the next movie.There is little to complain about the acting. A-list cast of stars is a great choice in doing this movie. The parts composition for each characters is great, able to showcase the senior talents in enough duration and at the same time still keeping the younger and newer talents to keep the lead roles. Hugh Jacman's Logan is an exception on this though, due to his character have a great relevance to the story's technical aspect.The score department is good that is helps to build the scenes' mood well, keeping the focus at the characters and without being overbearing. The costumes and set department did great in reliving the 1970s era in the movie, though unfortunately, there's not much scenes that focus on things that are particularly special to that era.From me, I'm glad to say that this is one of the most deserving 8 out of 10 scoring movie this year, and a recommendation is an absolute certain yes. I watched this in the streaming sites, and will definitely watch this again on DVD or any other higher quality medias.",8,1,2,26 May 2014
Underground," Three hours of pure weird story
","As a war-comedy movie, the movie did more than just achieving its original goal of showing a depiction of war and making people laugh at the same time. I think the movie, using its long duration at its best, really exerts control on what the audience feel when seeing it. This movie can be very funny when it is in the comedic scenes; with very black comedic satire laughing at the hypocrisy of war. But it can also be stoic and ironic when it shows the scenes of war tearing a country apart. It can reach the sorrowful depths, as when the movie shows Ivan looking for Soni, or when Crni looks at the burning wheelchair. The acting is quite nice, although I think that the movie lacks so much in story telling, possibly due to overly extensive editing.",6,1,2,13 November 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," So predictable all along but very entertaining
","The story is nothing special, just another story that revolves around romantic relationships. But what makes it interesting is that it caters to the appetite of the majority of the population of the movie goers, the youngsters. The movie tells story in a very hyperbolic way with all those comic styled written sound effects and all those game style detail notifications. But what make it even more hyperbolic are those battles with the exes. It's a great homage to Kill Bill movies in my eyes, as well as a great tribute to the more geeky youngsters who are in the band scene and the other youngsters who are gamers. The finale gives a very nice twist in line with the all too common gaming culture of save points and redo lives. The acting is just standard overall fr me. No one in this movie offers anything special with their acting parts, even having Chris Evans doesn't really help at the acting. But the whole movie feels very much entertaining, and that should be enough to cover for it.",7,0,0,5 January 2015
Inside Out," Too philosophical or technical for kids
","Somehow I don't really think that this movie is really suitable for parents to bring kids to watch. The basic concept is either too technical or too philosophical altogether. The concepts of humans' five basic emotions is well beyond the grasp of an elementary school kid, let alone a toddler. Even though the movie gets to be more and more reasonable as it goes on, still it won't be such a good experience to share about. The animation is nice, it doesn't have overly weird or disproportional drawing styles or camera angles that will further confuse children audiences. And the voice acting is nicely expressive. That should balance the things that this movie lacks.",6,11,40,23 June 2015
Quantum of Solace," Still good but rather a lack to it's predecessor
","After introducing a new formula in the first Daniel Craig Bond movie in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace reverts back to the old formula of centering on the hunt to bring down a world class villain and thwart his plans. But the movie did quite a good job in grounding the story; the villain's scope gets to be local or regional instead of the usual straight shot at world domination. The early emphasis on the secret organization also makes for a good thread between the Daniel Craig Bond series. Yet I feel that the action quality rather decreases, due to the increase use of mid range shots and close ups. The acting overall sees a polarized view as Daniel Craig maintains his performance as James Bond but Olga Kurylenko looks awfully silly as Bond's sidekick in this movie. Gemma Arteton is plainly underutilized while Judi Dench did great in retaining her character for the role of M.",7,1,7,7 November 2015
No Country for Old Men," Great and entertaining although not that perfect
","The story is just another one that develops quite aimlessly. But really like how the movie throws the focus back and forth between Chigurh and Moss without loosing any moment but instead complete the story's puzzle pieces altogether. What quite disappoints me is that not even once did Tommy Lee Jones had the chance to sound out one of his usual pitched commanding order barking yells or excited characteristic lines of dialog. The action bits are great and, I got to admit, were designed superbly. The execution also considers the night factor nicely that the dark of the night doesn't reduce the quality of action despite they're using less lights such as muzzle flashes. The acting is just superb. All thumbs up for Javier Bardem's performance. He really nailed his role greatly. Josh Brolin also acted out great, although still his performance is not as great as Bardem's due to he played a character which he already used to depict. Too bad that the movie doesn't really give Tommy Lee Jones' character more part.",7,1,3,1 August 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," This movie is heart-touching and relate not just to sick people.
","The story is about a cancer patient, Hazel, her condition requiring her to always carry a set of breathing equipment. At a support group, she meets Gus, a boy with a prosthetic leg after amputation from cancer. Their relationship grow, sharing a same passion in the novels, going together to Amsterdam to meet their favorite writer, and dealing with their illnesses together. Until the end, it turns out that Gus goes ahead of Hazel.The base story was a so-so for me. A sick girl finds love in a fellow sick boy, going through hardships, until at the end one of them dies. This recipe is the essence of almost all of Indonesian drama in the 80s and 90s, that they bore me and made me have some low expectations on this movie. I don't even want to elaborate on the story like used to on my reviews because it's the same like the ones I mentioned.But the development into screenplay and the execution is just great. The little things that often go undermined are the ones that in fact make this movie different. Yes this movie truly relate to other sick people and their suffering. But this movie also relate to the healthy population, but feeling a bit unstable in their minds, particularly on the later parts. The value being spread implicitly is that it's okay to not having so many people adoring or following us, as long as there is one that cares and loves us deeply.The dialog is quite the strong part of this movie. There are more than a few remarks and punchlines that really touch the emotions and the hearts of the viewers. I personally am not a person to weep over any movie, but sometimes I get the chills when a movie is inspiring, and I admit, the dialog of this movie does give me the chills. I personally like the first and last monologues, they really touches the heart quite bluntly without being softened. Also the lines Gus tell Monica's mother is just a punch to any person's conscience.The side scenes are also worthy of mention. The struggle of Isaac in coping with his breakup and the efforts of Gus and Hazel to cheer him up is a great addition to the main story. The twist and revelation of Van Houten's own struggle with the memories of his daughter is also touching.The cast of up-and-coming actors are just a great recipe for this movie. It's the second time we see Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in one frame after being brothers and sisters in Divergent a few months back. Well, I sure see Shaylene Woodley feeling quite at home with this genre of drama romance after last year's The Spectacular Now. For me this is the first I see Elgort in a focal role, and he doesn't disappoint. He plays the character Gus well and quite enliven the intended liveliness of the character. An addition of a senior Willem Dafoe playing the disgruntled and grumpy Van Houten completes the recipe without stealing the focus from the two main characters.The acting is just quite as expected. I say just expected because quite frankly there isn't any highlights from the whole act. The movie is being great more from it's screenplay and story points. At least Woodley's acting is quite good because she is successful in transitioning from the quite fun drama in The Spectacular Now to this rather sad story. The soundtrack is greatly done placed. The selection is quite the safe ones for the taste of the common era's young adults. Overall from me, it's a movie worth an 8 out 10 score and a recommendation to go and see. With such a heart-touching story and values relating not only to sick people, I think it deserves it.",8,2,6,12 June 2014
To Rome With Love," Four different stories, all with overly illogical twists on them
","One changes a mortician into a literally shower opera singer; one lives out the predictable eventual unfaithfulness accompanied by the 'guardian angel' senior; one focuses on the instantaneous yet utterly stupid fame; the last one speaks about a husband and wife couple, each having their own strange experience of sex lesson in Rome. The screenplay is just purely stupid for me, particularly with all those stupid twists within each of the sub-stories. Why the senior architect did just stands still and did not tell Sally about what happened between Monica and John? Where did the prostitute come from? And why would Giancarlo be willing to a great degree humiliate himself with the stupid shower on stage? Yet I find the acting is quite sufficient. Ellen Page didn't do enough to hide her real sexual orientation here. Alec Baldwin got really undermined with such an insignificant role. Jesse Eisenberg sticks to his usual character of the timid and often sloppy character.",4,0,3,6 October 2014
Before Sunset," Great acting and connection kept after so long after
","It's nice to see this movie, a sequel to the great story presented in Before Sunrise (1995) about nine years apart. Having the sequel parted by so long of a distance, the movie adapted the circumstance and created a nice twist to continue on from Before Sunrise's ending. I like how the location is now in Paris, that most of the movie's length features the great sights of the great city; it's walkways and alleys between tall old buildings, the cruise on the river, and also of course the famous Parisian garden walkways. I also like how this time the movie ends more in conformity to what the audience will prefer more when they see how Before Sunrise ended. Yet I score this movie lower than its predecessor because the whole thing only feature a faster time than the former. I like how Hawke and Delpy still managed to stay consistent and kept their connection nicely, even after literally nine years.",7,0,0,7 August 2014
Non-Stop," A new take on suspense thriller
","Okay, the first and foremost I'd say is that I was fooled by the poster art. The poster depicts high intensity of action, yet I fact the movie is more dominant in mystery and thriller region of a genre. But it is to no disappointment because the movie is indeed good in terms of suspense thriller.The story is of typical action, a hostage ransom situation, with the initial twist that the perpetrator is invisible, as usual. But then as the conflict starts, there is no stopping, literally non-stop. Yes we have seen movies like 'Flightplan' that do this kind of suspense build, with extra action sequence on the ending, yet 'Non-Stop' gives us another take of that particular build.Liam Neeson's acting is great as usual. His facial expressions are kept consistent to the emotions Bill Marks should be having at all the times. Julianne Moore is just a complementary act all the way to about seven tenths of the movie. The other cast, which are mostly TV series cast did quite a good job being paired with Neeson and Moore. After seeing 2014's Oscars, we won't expect to see Lupita Nyong'o to have such a small role, yet she did in this movie.The pace of story building is kept in quick steps, yet it is still in a thriller suspense style. It makes you stay at the edge of your seat right from the conflict started. For a seasoned movie goer, especially suspense or thriller or mystery and detective stories addict, this film presents viewers with a lot of points and details that left you wondering, is this thing gonna be important as the movie nears its end? For instance, the stewardess, the co-pilot, and some of the suspicious passengers.The screenplay is great, every thing that happened has major consequences to the continuing scenes and baffles us the viewers even more about who the real perp is. And with every five or ten minutes, the pressure in the lead character gets more and more immense.The climax is served with a good twist, although the story of the climax is rather mediocre. I'd give it a 7 out of 10 score and definitely recommending you to see it. But expect to see dominant action. Think of it as 'Flightplan' with a lot more nerve.",7,0,1,5 March 2014
The Princess Bride," Funny and mild with a lot of lessons for kids
","Although it's a family movie, the story can nicely be unpredictable with all the unbelievable twists here and there. The midget getting killed by his own complicated logic, and his men eventually join Westley is really unpredictable. The movie also has great lessons for kids, about chivalry, honor and trust, which any kid should always be taught as they grow up. The acting work feels quite a standard, especially since the movie tends to be satirical and comedic. Cary Elewes did quite well in balancing the character's supposed charisma and the comedy in his scenes. Rovin Wright comfortably filled the angle for Westley's counterpart in the story. Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant provided most of the amusing comedic ignites for their characters' scenes.",7,1,2,9 November 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Good addition of concepts and depth to a sequel story
","The story still focus on Hiccup, the hero from the first movie. Now, five years from the first movie, Hiccup's village Berk has already adapted to the dragons. Hiccup's father Stoick grooms him to be the next chieftain but he's reluctant at it and prefers to explore new areas. One day while exploring, Hiccup and his dragon Toothless found a band of dragon trappers, who work for Drago. Hiccup tells Stoick about it but Sroick gets afraid and seals the village. Hiccup escapes to go and talk sense into Drago about dragons. In his journey he stumbles to a masked dragon rider, who turns out to behis mother Valka. She reveals to Hiccup about a less-known alpha dragon, which all dragons obey. Stoick and friends follows Hiccup. Stoick reunites Valka, right in time when Drago attacks. Valka calls upon the alpha but to everyone's surprise, Drago brought his own alpha, which wins the battle against Valka's alpha. Thus all the dragons, including Toothless, surrender to Drago. Toothless, against his will kills Stoick with his fire burst. Drago then goes on to bring the battle to Berk. Hiccup and his band of riders get the baby dragons, the immature dragons which don't listen to the alpha yet, to Berk where he then manages to disenchant Toothless. Toothelss then challenges Drago's alpha and wins, and the alpha and Drago flees. The rest of the dragons then bow to Toothless.The base story is quite good because it gets more mature and dramatic compared to the first movie. Now the movie gets more emotional by giving not a perfectly happy ending, instead the story executes a character change from one character to another by the means of a return and death. The story design is quite nice because it's able to stand as itself without the overwhelming need to watch the first movie.Instead I found some discrepancies to some detail that will be clear especially if you've watched the first movie. For example, the story is set from the first movie, when Hiccup was still a 15-year old teenager, but the funny thing is that Hiccup's voice doesn't really change, when he should've grown an adam's apple which would've deepen his voice. Also, while Astrid gets a bit of body work in five years, Hiccup's body growth is virtually unnoticeable.But the changes offered but this installment is quite nice. About four years from it's prequel, the thing about Hiccup's mother appearing is a good thing, though it should've been predictable from her absence in the first movie.The cast is quite the same from the first movie, which is a good ensemble of actors. The new additions of voices from Cate Blanchett and Djimon Hunsou is also a good one. About Djimon Hunsou especially, he has quite an easily recognizable voice, and the character design can compensate this well enough by giving the white raced Drago dread-lock hair.The new concept of ice-spitting alphas, and the ensuing epic alpha battle, is just a great addition to keep viewers' eyes on the screen. The practical jokes of dragon behavior gets more cute and funny in this installment, having new dragons join in to the dragon roster.For me, How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a definite recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's a fun and good family movie to enjoy together.",7,2,7,14 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Ralph Fiennes did it again
","The story premise is both a common but also a unique one, that is of a personal biography. The unique adventure is presented nicely with the use of exotic locations, lavish sets and makeup, and also non-common camera angles. The acting is indeed quite a gem. Ralph Fiennes did a great job in doing his character, a focus character a distinction from his other roles. And he does this very well, considering that the character experiences wide variety of scenes including training a lobby boy and surviving a gun shootout. Having big names such as Saoirse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, and Harvey Keitel on the supporting characters is just a great thing to make this merry movie the merrier.",7,1,3,12 July 2014
Foxcatcher," Great acting for a serious story
","In 1986, Mark Schultz, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist wrestler is on the low point of his life barely scraping for food while his brother Dave, also a 1984 Olympic gold medalist wrestler, lands a decent coaching job. One day the millionaire John Du Pont contacted Mark. Mark ends up getting a sponsorship from John to train for the 1988 Olympics. Mark asked Dave to join him at John's Team Foxcatcher, but Dave initially declines due to contractual reasons. Under John, Mark trains with a handpicked team other of other athletes and Team Foxcatcher succeeds in taking home two gold medals from the 1987 Wrestling World Championship. Throughout training John exhibits eccentric behavior like shooting a gun all of a sudden. At one point John decides he doesn't like Mark's training method so he pays out Dave's contract and gets Dave to join Team Foxcatcher.John tries to serve his ego using Team Foxcatcher by introducing Mark as his protégé, claiming the title of the team's coach and making Dave only the assistant coach, filming a documentary about the team's preparation on winning the Olympics, and even returning into practicing the sport disregarding his old age. Even since before Dave arrive, John slowly poisons Mark with bad habit of drinking, skipping practice and even cocaine. This influences Mark significantly that Mark lost his first match on the Olympics selection. Mark is devastated by the defeat but Dave comes to him and helps him sobers up and prepares so eventually Mark wins the slot for the Olympics. But in helping Mark prepare, Dave prohibits John from seeing Mark. Mark feels this and asks Dave to quit the team together but Dave says they have to stay with their commitment. But Dave also sees what's coming and forces a deal to John that if John wants to keep Dave on the team even after the Olympics, John has to keep paying Mark.John agrees to the deal because Dave and Mark agree to let John stand at Mark's corner in the Olympics. They go to Seoul for the Olympic game but Mark loses his matches. Back at home, Mark retires from professional wrestling while Dave stays to coach Team Foxcatcher. But one day, after seeing the completed documentary film he commissioned, John goes to drive on a car. He drives past Dave's place but then reversed the car to see Dave. Dave goes to greet him but John suddenly points out a gun at him. After asking a weird question, John shoots at Dave. He then runs away with his car.John soon gets arrested, convicted and goes to prison. Mark still scrapes for money, this time in the then up and coming sport of MMA.The story nicely depicts the fate of athletes of less favored sports. Even though highly talented on the sport, some of the athletes and retired athletes face the same life as Mark's life depicted on this movie's start and end. The middle and focus part of the story portrays even a classic nature of man, that power, in this case deriving from one's wealth, ends up corrupting the owner. We can see the movie depicts how John gets to be erratic and selfish due to not knowing where or what else to spend his wealth on. John feels that everybody can be bought with a certain amount of money. He doesn't seem to think of other people as equals to him due to this. His first impression of seeming to appreciate Mark on his early appearance in this movie seems to be root on that there is something that he wants in Mark, which is to win the Olympic gold medal.I really like how the actors delve deep into the real techniques of the sport thus enabling this movie to portray the actors doing the sport as how it is meant to be done. I don't know if instead Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum actually have any background in wrestling, but if they don't, they turn out to be well enough wrestlers themselves to be able to execute such techniques well.The acting in general is a great job. Channing Tatum is successful in depicting the almost desperate athlete looking for money. Although I must say that his role here doesn't really have his expressions to come out. Mark Ruffalo also acted well as the close brother yet now distanced by his responsibilities for his own family. But surprisingly, Steve Carrell's performance as John Du Pont is a great job in this movie. He really nailed the role, transforming into a totally different person. This is especially true when we compare it to Carrell's other works, most notably comedies in which he played the roles of less witted males.My say is that Foxcatcher (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation. It's too bad that this movie doesn't really get distributed globally because with this level of acting and depicting a story based on true events, it surely succeeds in telling the serious story of athletes' struggle.",7,0,3,3 January 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Great work in focusing on the cultures and cultural clashes
","The movie sure takes it's time to build on the story. It does so even a little bit too much for me. The opening sequence can be done better with a shorter sequence. The whole story gets pretentious and patronizing even from the very beginning. But it sure does depict the culture differences and the culture shocks Lawrence had very well. Those depictions occur very much at the starts when he was first stationed in the Arabia, the journey to Faisal and the later journey to Aqaba. Lawrence's reactions and his reluctance in doing much of his reactions did very much the justice of one stranger in a new world of culture. The acting is quite an example of a transitioning from a rigid dialog of the old styled movies to the modern style of more fluid conversations in the movies. Peter O'Toole did well as Lawrence, capturing all those diverse and sometimes contradicting emotions and expressions. Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness did nice in giving the balancing angle to the story as well as giving the Arab taste to the movie. But then again, for me the movies only appeals just as that and not as special as everyone else thinks.",6,1,5,6 November 2014
Legend," Nice crime biopic, but rather lacking somehow
","The movie serves a nice story in overall. The biopic seems nice and the events depicted feel significant enough for the movie. But it's strange that the movie left a whole lot of the story behind, leaving them to the narration by Francis. This makes the movie feel severely lacking since there's no adequate transition between scenes. Also this obscures the time perception since the movie didn't really mention the time setting for each event. This makes the distance between each event seems unclear. The movie can really use some montage also as it will improve the storytelling. The acting overall feels great. Tom Hardy did well as the two characters, providing adequate distinction to deepen the story. Yet Emily Browning didn't give enough depth to her character, making Francis look so sad even as she's happy with Reggie. Taron Egerton and Paul Anderson did well to complete the story.",6,1,3,1 January 2016
JFK," A great movie that really stirs up anxiety
","The movie nicely captures the story behind Jim Garrison and his quest to bring the conspirators of the Kennedy killing to justice. To me personally this movie is the one presents the most compelling story that encompasses almost everything which stands out. The end finale really sums u the three hour movie perfectly. It nicely depicts the massive flaw in the official story and explains that questionable point and provided the alternative explanation that fits the thirsty mind. What's better is that the movie nicely sets a warning to the date when the secret should be shed clear. The acting overall is a nice one. Kevin Costner didn't overdo his parts, nicely controlling his character's emotions. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman and Michael Rokker nicely gave lives to their characters.",8,1,3,17 August 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Strong, nicely built, and also scary as a war movie
","The movie did a very good job in downplaying the starting hype the trailers had made that we bring at its start. It nicely elaborates on the background of the war, the background of the focus character, and the position of the warring parties; all while delivering funny images of children's creativity and cunning. The suspense escalation is built nicely stable in increments and made sure that the audience feels the difference between the fun opening scenes and the start of the war. Then, after the conflict sets in, the audience is confronted with waves of some what disturbing images of how uncontrolled war can really take a toll on not just a child person, but also on an entire generation. The acting may seem like a standard job in overall, but the overall direction is just great. Abraham Attah looks like he can really blend in to the rest of the adult cast fairly. Idris Elba did very well in depicting the ruthlessness of the Commandant.",7,2,3,21 October 2015
Gone Girl," A ping-pong play at the viewers' assumptions and a sudden slam mid-way through
","On their wedding anniversary, Nick finds his wife Amy missing. Investigation indicates she may have been murdered, thus Nick becomes the prime suspect. It gets more incriminating to him with his unfaithfulness and his debt history after both Nick and Amy lost their jobs, thus having to spend Amy's trust fund. The case gains media attention, putting Nick under the spotlight. He hires a lawyer who then coaches him through the public opinion control, and even booked a TV interview to clear his name. Nick's own investigation reveals Amy is a cunning mastermind of framing people. Meanwhile it turns out that Amy is still alive and on the run. She faked her own murder and pregnancy and frame Nick with it to get back to him. She did a very meticulous and thorough job; faking her journal entries, staging her blood spills, stealing a pregnant woman's urine, and even changed her looks to avoid recognition on the run. She casually watches the media frenzy on Nick and befriended a local girl Greta. But after Amy slipped up, Greta and her boyfriend rob her blind. Penniless, Amy contacted her ex-boyfriend Desi, who still longs for her. With Desi, Amy watched Nick's interview, in which Nick asked Amy to come back home. Some time after, Amy tricks Desi into having sex with her. Amy tells him to go rougher, but as Desi enjoys the moment and is off guard, she slashes his throat. She goes back to Nick, with all the media on them. Amy tells the everybody she went missing because Desi kidnapped her. Nick, knowing Amy's capability to frame things on people, confronts her. She presses him to conform to the public opinion that they're happily reunited. Nick is terrified that Amy can kill him too. Seven weeks since returning, Amy shows Nick she's pregnant bearing his son. Nick denied this saying he never touched her since she got back, But Amy reveals that she took his semen from the fertility clinic. Nick then forcefully goes back to his marriage, to the horrors of his twin sister.I watched this movie without prior information about the book. And after watching I think that the story is very nice. It manages to make a ping- pong play out of viewers' assumptions toward the main characters Nick and Amy. The movie opens hinting that Nick may be facing a possible kidnapping or murder. But soon the ping-pong starts as Nick's flaws are revealed little by little. But then hints of Amy's possible past faults are also shown, making us question Amy's voice-over allegations to Nick.Then the shocker comes as the movie slams the truth about Amy staged th whole disappearance and murder thing up. Watching this online, I wondered why did the movie open slam this big part of the mystery and keeps a big chunk of runtime behind? The following twists with Greta and Desi are just magnificent and really complete the movie as a classic frame and betrayal story.The mystery aspect is nicely very thick in this movie. That assumptions ping pong play just really keeps the viewers' curiosity going. What's good is that it doesn't end when the truth of Amy is slammed onto the viewers' face like that. The drama on the conflict build up, side by side with that ping pong play, did great in emphasizing the conflict seeds and made the romance part look better.The thriller part isn't really much. It's just there to dramatize more on the police investigations and the suspicious minds. But as the fowl play of both Nick and Amy is revealed, the thriller part moves more in holding up the suspense and curiosity of what's going to happen next, particularly after the sudden revelations of Amy's truth.The acting department is a great overall. Ben Affleck nicely grasped every aspect of Nick; his confusion at first, his try to hide his side of the problems, his conviction on standing his ground of denying the murder, and his eventual fright to Amy. Rosamund Pike also did great, reviving her career to the spotlight. She really used her experiences, such as the cold traitor Miranda Frost, the sanguine Sam Chamberlaine, and the tough Andromeda, and blended them together into acting her role here. Other mentionable performances include Tyler Perry's in-control lawyer role, and Neil Pattrick Harris' long time ex-boyfriend role.For me Gone Girl (2014) definitely deserve an 8 out of 10 score and a a recommendation to go see it in the theaters. It's a mystery movie that offers not the traditional case-build-to-twist-to-ending ordering. The unorthodox approach of viewers' assumption play and the sudden revelation midway will bend your mind over.",8,1,8,12 October 2014
Mr. Nobody," A surreal tread through nonlinearity
","The story just don't get enough justice to be called a story, due to it serving multiple possibilities of Mr. Nobody's life. Those who get comfortable with this kind of surrealism are those who also get comfy with Darren Aronofsky's story telling and visualizations. Yet the movie offered something different from Aronofsky by presenting somewhat rather patchy editing and transitions, which actually turn out to be great due to them helping set the movie's pace to be really fast and tight at all times. Then again, I must say that this kind of movie can only be fully enjoyed by those who are experienced in understanding and thus enjoying complicated movies such as Nolans', or those who simply let go of any assumptions and expectations and then just absorbs all to then deconstruct it after watching. The acting feels very nice, especially in Jared Leto's work, being total and encompassing a wide breadth of character variations.",6,0,2,30 October 2015
Drive," Nice presentation yet it lacks a big deal
","The story is nice and intriguing. There's not much of the classic heist crime movie being done well in recent years. Al though I should also say that after the great initial thriller sequence, the movie kind of pace down very much drastically. The entire pace of the movie kind of walks in that way, disorderly switches from fast to slow to fast to slow again. The soundtrack manages to make this movie a one of a kind. It can emphasize the other aspects capable of being of interest such as the artsy lonesome indie movie feel, I like how Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan acted here. They can withhold the overall calm, not so much into talking feel for their entire performance. Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman also did quite a nice job despite having not so significant roles here.",6,0,3,8 August 2014
Insidious," Just another horror
","The opening kind of fooled me for me thinking that it was Dalton. As like any other Hollywood horrors nowadays, the story builds the characters for quite far too long. Then the main scares come. And again just any other recent Hollywood horrors, the scare strategy remains the same; build up the smaller scares with medium length build up and peak them with sudden appearances that don't last more than two seconds. This lets the audience off as to when the finale comes. And then the finale builds with all those lengthy thrills with strings of those previously thrift sudden scares, with sometimes a twist here and there. But this movie contains one good twist to the opening scene and the nice additional element of fatherly sacrifice. The ending is predictable, as most Hollywood horrors leave a wide room for a sequel or at least to keep the scare in the hearts of the audience for long after they exit the theaters. The acting is actually quite good. This movie shows Rose Byrne's capacity to act in almost any genre. Patrick Wilson still retains his usual successful cocky man, even though his character now is only a schoolteacher.",5,0,0,9 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," Nice balance of all connected issues
","The movie starts as the Cambridge student Stephen Hawking meets Jane, and although shy at first, eventually they both get close. Stephen soon learns about his illness and decides to shut Jane off from his life. But Jane insisted on him and stated her for him even though knowing the illness will progress and slowly take Stephen away from her. They get married soon after, and Stephen soon graduates his doctoral study, having more interest to cosmological physics. Jane stands by Stephen as the illness progresses, impairing his locomotion, balance, speech and even swallowing. They have two children and Stephen's work starts to gain spotlight. But little by little, Jane starts to loose her spirit, though she doesn't reveal it.Jane's mother advises her to join the church choir to help her fill her spare time so she goes. There she meets the choir's tutor Jonathan. Jonathan gets close to Jane and her family, even with Stephen. He goes as far as being a helping hand for Stephen when the family goes on an outdoors trip. Jane ultimately starts to feel attracted to Jonathan. But Jonathan backs away when friends and families start to whisper. As Jane goes with Jonathan, Stephen goes to watch an opera. But Stephen has an episode and goes into a comma, and the doctors hesitate in doing a tracheotomy on him due to his muscles have already undergone atrophy which means that it will disable Stephen's ability to speak. Jane insists on tracheotomy, but the family then have to struggle in communicating with Stephen.Jane hired a help, Elaine, who quickly suits Stephen's needs while Jane slowly slips away from him. Stephen then gets the robotic speech aid program which helps him a lot. But then Jane reaches her threshold and she and Stephen gets a divorce. Jane goes on to marry Jonathan. But Stephen calls for Jane, as the first spouse, to accompany him in receiving a title from the Queen.The movie proves to be a great treat for me for several reasons. First, it's timing of nearing Interstellar (2014) nicely complements each other especially on the theoretical physics field. Also, the story strikes a nice balance between the focus between Stephen and Jane, as well as addressing the assortment of connected issues such as religion, family, and also persistence and not giving up.The movie also has nice touches on the technical sides. The coloration choice is a way in making the story setting stand out. The camera angles, particularly on the early Cambridge time, are also great, utilizing nice through-the-window angles. The slight blurring and edging incorporated more significantly in key emotional scenes are also a great way to emphasize the story.The acting side is a very nice overall work for me. I agree with those who say that Eddie Redmayne should have at least an Oscar nomination. His acting here doesn't only involve slimming done his body to the proper weight for his character, but surely he must also endure cramps in doing the muscle-atrophy impersonation. Felicity Jones did quite okay, although she didn't really get much of variation in expressions.All in all, for me The Theory of Everything (2014) is worthy of a 7 out of 10 score. Again, it's great timing of release in connection with Interstellar (2014) sure does help in building a positive feeling in watching early on. But the later on drama build also doesn't disappoint.",7,1,5,23 November 2014
The Lives of Others," Great story and screenplay with less of the usual scene montages
","The story unravels nicely although a bit too slow for my taste. Yet I really like how the opening exposes the meticulous practice of the Stasi. The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice. I like how Ulrich Muhe played the calm yet meticulous and then the affected version of Wiesler. Martina Gedeck also shows a good performance and went total on this movie. Sebastian Koch does well in completing this movie with his performance of quite an undecided character.",7,2,2,1 August 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Nice adventure + fantasy combo
","Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller), a photo negative asset manager for the Life magazine for more than 15 years. In his position, Walter builds a good work relationship with Life's main photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). But because of the nature of Sean's work, they never actually meet in person. Also, due to the rapid expansion of the digital media, Life is bleeding out printed sales and thus been acquired buy another company that wants to transition totally to the digital format of Life Online.At the same time, Walter have some personality issue, he is too shy to make a move on his co-worker Cheryl Melhoff. In the transition time, It's decided that the next issue will be Life's last issue. The transition management wishes to honor Sean's request that the final cover uses the Negative Number 25, his so-called 'Quintessence of Life', which Walter fail to find on the delivery package.The story builds up pretty fast for a 1,5 hour movie. The start with Cheryl Melhoff's online dating profile page was a confusing one for a start, but it then picks up later on. This movie has a main catch, Walter often has this moment of 'zoned-out' when he suddenly daydreams and retracts to his own wild imaginations. These imaginations are hyperbolic and makes Walter to be some kind of an action hero in his own thoughts. Walter then gets zapped back in to reality often in embarrassing situations.The movie plays well with visuals. It uses vivid difference in color contrasting in portraying Walter's Life in clear distinction between office moments and out of office moments. Also, as the movie progresses, Walter develops his character to live his adventures and not just enjoys them solely in his daydreams. This transition is pictured well by differentiating the daydreams and the real adventures by using hyperbolas on the daydreams.These hyperbolas are the only difference to the real adventures because both 'action' sequences rolls through seamlessly on the movie.One other thing that can differentiate them is maybe the timing, that is the daydreams are concentrated mainly on the early moments of the movie while the real adventures are concentrated on the later moments.The twist of the wallet is also nice. It makes me remember one similar twist I read on the book 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. The difference is that Walter didn't have to travel all the way back to find his real treasure.Overall, the movie is good. It serves you the journey of Walter's character transformation. Though it is different from the usual Ben Stiller's comedy range, but it still suffice for this one, yet still being not that heavy. a 7.5 of 10 is my score for this flick.",6,0,0,10 July 2014
22 Jump Street," a definitely nice laugh
","Schmidt and Jenko are back on undercover. After a failed bust on Ghost, this time they're in college after a new drug WHYPHY claims one girl Cynthia. Jenko soon makes friends with Zook and Rooster the jocks, Rooster has the same tattoo as a man in an intel photo. Schmidt gets close to Maya, an art student, to a point that they have sex. It turns out that Maya is Cpt. Dickson's daughter. Jenko gets play football and turns out to be good at it, up to a point that he tells Schmidt that he thinks of quitting being a policeman and continue football with Zook, all while in a car chase after Ghost, which ended in a failure. They separate for a while but reunites again and finds that Mercedes, Maya's roommate, is actually Ghost's daughter and WHYPHY dealer. In a bust, with Dickson's men, Ghst run off after Mercedes shoots and kidnaps Dickson. Schmidt eventually catches her and joins Jenko in chasing Ghost. They both jump and hang on Ghost's helicopter. Schmidt grabs Jenko's hand as he slips and then Jenko throws a grenade on the helicopter, finishing their job for this movie. Dickson then tells the pair about their next job in medical school, which is a sneak peek at 23 Jump Street, the next sequel.The story is 'just the same' as the original, if you catch my drift, LOL. Anyways, yeah the story is essentially the same as the prequel, as the narc pair navigate their way within the world of college. The twists are quite nice, especially about Maya and Mercedes, although quite predictable.But the real fun factor and magnet for viewers are the jokes, which are quite original. The 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' fight scene is just a hilarious spoof of the Pitt-Jolie movie. The thing with Schmidt wanting to take a bullet for Jenko is also stupidly hilarious although only shown for some short time. The thing with Mr. Walters and Eric is also a nice and crazy comedy.The acting is quite surprisingly a bit of lower quality than of the original 21 Jump Street (2012). Channing Tatum loses a bit of his facial expression in comparison to the prequel. But Jonah Hill gets more hilarious. Ice Cube gets a more cheerful mood for his character now, despite the thing for the scene before the taser scene.The verdict is a definite 7 out of 10 score from me for this movie. A recommendation is a yes because this movie is not a waste of your time and money, definitely a good laugh.",7,6,13,25 June 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Well, that's in the seventies
","The movie started out nice enough, sparking adequate curiosity. It also gets interesting as the robbery takes place. But then the movie falls to become stupid by today's standards. No scope on the snipers' rifles, the crowd being too close to the scene, the police officers are too reckless, there's no negotiator at hand, and the list goes on. What becomes even more stupid is the fact that Sonny easily waltz in and out of the crime scene again and again. Well, I think that would look normal since it happened in the seventies, when police procedures haven't got any set standards yet. It gets more stupid as the story ends just like that, whereas it took the police and the FBI the whole day to do it. The acting overall surely highlight Al Pacino's great and convincing acting work. It's too bad that he hasn't smoke that much yet thus his signature voice wasn't there yet.",5,0,3,25 November 2015
Amadeus," A nice depiction of genius
","The movie successfully surprised me with its depiction of Mozart's character and of how he lived his life. But the movie also did very well in depicting the genius of Mozart. I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter.",7,0,1,28 January 2015
Gran Torino," A nice story of fatherhood, cultures, and action and consequences
","The story is one of a mix of fatherhood, cultures, and also action and consequences, stirring and mixing together nicely. All the other ingredients of having the priest and the distant family members. It's funny to see that though the 'prize' Gran Torino is all that is hyped in the title and above the entire story, it only has the slightest of significance in the actual scenes. The story blends well the fatherhood and responsibilities and the atonement background for it. It also focuses well on the cultural clashes by giving nice spotlight on the clashing cultural practices. Eastwood acted out great as anyone would expect. Surprisingly the other main cast are also available to compensate Clint's performance.",8,0,2,16 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Nice touch with the story development
","The story start by delving deeper on Peter's parent's death, then focus on the events from the first movie with Spidey and the police chief. Peter can't handle the dilemma so Gwen breaks up with him. As always there's controversy among New Yorkers about Spidey fighting crime. Trying to move on past Gwen, Peter gets reminiscent of his late parents. The focus then starts alternating shifts to persons like Max Dillon, who was briefly saved by Spidey, his complex insecurities, and his ultimate transformation into Electro. The focus also shifts to Harry Osbourne who inherits Oscorp after Norman Osbourne dies.Spidey then meets the psychologically unstable and transformed Max Dillon. A battle ensue between them because Max take it too personally when Spidey fails to remember his name. Peter researched about his parents while fixing his web-shooter that breaks in the fight against Electro. Not long after, Harry find out about the project that will be Green Goblin's gear, and a conclusion that Spidey's blood can cure him from his genetic illness. He calls Peter to see him in Oscorp Tower. Meanwhile, Gwen escapes capture after she is to be arrested by internal Oscorp security for searching information on Max Dillon.Spidey then sees Harry to explain to him that it's dangerous to give Harry his blood but Harry can't take it. Aunt May tells Peter a thing that she kept from him about his father and Peter is confused over it. But he soon finds a keyword and heads to the place referred, Meanwhile the traitor inside Oscorp manages to fire Harry off his position. Harry then gets revenge by freeing Electro and forcing the Oscorp brass to give him the spider venom which is supposedly the alternative for Spiderman's blood. His body doesn't react well with venom and he gets into Green Goblin armor to support the self-healing effort better.Electro draws Spidey out by plunging the city into blackout. Spidey goes on to face him, telling Gwen to stay behind. Gwen disobeys and helps Spidey to reset the power grids. After that Green Goblin comes, revealing that he has discovered Peter's Spiderman identity and feels disappointed on the Spidey's blood issue. Another battle then ensue, in which Goblin is defeated. Harry the plots to gather men for what's to be known as Sinister Six.As all previous Spidey movies, drawing straight from his characteristics in the comics, this movie is full of small laughs and on-liner remarks. The story builds well to considerable depths. No scene is wasted as almost all consistently contain significant weight, either to character development, story build-up, or to include snippets of cross-reference to the comics.The acting is good overall. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone still retain their class, and even the lit up Jamie Foxx portrays the bad guy well enough. Dane DeHaan did a good job also, although I think that the screenplay isn't being developed well on the final battle scene that it feels like his acting is a little lame there.For me the action is quite a so-so, considering that most are done through CGI. What I was surprised to see is that the materials that were published for marketing purposes such as on featurettes, clips and even trailers have elements of the ending, something that is rarely done nowadays. The first movie doesn't really give obvious hint for a trilogy setting. But here the leads are more than crystal clear. And there's also room that is left vacant in the romance department for the next installment. From the way the story develops, it makes me curious about the next installment. Is it going to be a trilogy, meaning that it's likely to be an epic scale battle, or will there be more than a trilogy, meaning that the story will be developed into a more detailed presentation.Finally, overall from me The Amazing Spiderman 2 gets a 7 out of 10 score from me and a recommendation to go and see it.",7,4,13,21 April 2014
Ex Machina," Way to predictable, but the mood's great
","As one of those movies with supposedly futuristic notion as its story background about the rise of AI and how human seek to control the AI, this movie falls sadly very much predictable, just like all the rest f its kind. You can simply guess how the rest of the movie will unfold at the point just a little after Eve is introduced. It became even more crystal clear as Kyoko comes into the screen. That makes the rest of the movie's remaining hour or so duration feels quite lame. Yet I really like how the director packaged the mysterious aura around the whole thing by using many silent moments, with intriguing combination of camera angle, music and lighting plays. The acting overall is a very good work in my eyes. Oscar Isaac's performance is very good since his character really grasped most of the screen time he is in. Dmnahall Gleeson did adequately okay, just enough no to let his character gets swallowed whole by Oscar Isaac's dominating presence. Even Alicia Vikander acted out better than her work in Seventh Son.",6,2,6,2 June 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," An animation that inspires a lot of other movies
","I can directly tell that this is a great movie indeed. The Japanese are great people in designing fantasy worlds. I like how the world has so great diversity in contrast. Anyone versed enough in movies can immediately spot the things that gave ideas to other movies. I see this movie's influence on Avatar (the ship design, the plants design, the forest design), Attack on Titan (the Titan's own design), and even Starship Troopers (the whole insects theme, and the ohmu's design on the brain bug). The story is unfortunately is a straightforward a children's story of good versus evil with minor twists here and there. There it's very much predictable. I saw the original version with Japanese voice, adding adequate authenticity to the experience.",7,1,2,30 November 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Male strippers....road trip?
","Well I watched the first movie just a few days back before I watched this. It seems like the movie makers listened to my view about cutting down the montages. But they did way more than that. They instead tear the original movie's basic concept and try to sink in some new concept that is usually in for high school movies or most strictly for comedies; the road trip. This may seem nice, but the fact is the movie cuts all the mix of the seriousness and all that portrayal of the male strippers literally out of the screen until later at the ending. They didn't use montages anymore for the dance parts, with longer shot duration and less edits. But the dance parts come in way less than the original movie had. The acting overall is just the same as the original movie, only this time it's without Matthew McConaughey so it felt different acting-wise.",5,1,2,30 August 2015
Big Hero 6," Very funny and enjoyable
","The movie tells about Hiro Yamada, a genius student in the city of San Fransokyo. His brother Tadashi, also a genius already built a 'personal nurse' robot Baymax, manages to persuade him to join the 'Nerd School' SFIT college with Tadashi's friends, Honey Lemon, Wasabi, Gogo and Fred. At SFIT's tech fair, the Hiro amazes everybody, even the great Professor Callaghan with his micro-bots invention. Commanded telepathically through a radio transmitter, the micro-bots can be erected to structures very fast. Hiro gains an entrance to SFIT with it. But later that night there's a fire in the SFIT hall. Tadashi goes in to save Callaghan but the building explodes. Hiro drowns in sorrow of Tadashi's death, but his shout of pain initiates Baymax's nurse protocol. Hiro finds last remaining micro-bot trying to find it's way to rest of the micro-bots, which is quite impossible since the other micro-bots should have perished in the SFIT fire. To help Hiro feel better Baymax then follows the micro-bot, with Hiro tailing behind. They find that someone is manufacturing a lot more of micro-bots. Soon a man in a kabuki mask uses the micro-bots to attack them. Hiro and Baymax narrowly escape. Hiro then creates some combat alterations to Baymax and goes back to the warehouse where they met the villain. The four Tadashi's friends come after Baymax contacted them, and again they escape the kabuki mask villain. The four of them eventually agree to help Hiro to find the villain, who's suspected at setting the fire at SFIT. Hiro also make combat costumes for him and his friends. The upgraded sensors and Baymax finds the villain's whereabouts, in an island. Lurking about the island, the six find a video of Alistair Krei, the tech mogul whose offer Hiro denied at the tech fair, testing a teleportation machine that goes wrong. The villain appears and attacks the six, but their cooperation manages to knock his mask off, revealing Callaghan inside it. Hiro goes into a vengeful rage, taking out Tadashi's nurse commands chip off Baymax, leaving only Hiro's combat chip in him. The five manages to disrupt Baymax and put Tadashi's chip back in. Hiro leaves with Baymax, and then he repairs his broken sensor. But Baymax denied Hiro access to take out the nurse chip again and shows Hiro videos of Tadashi building Baymax, which then sobers Hiro out of his rage. The six then goes after Callaghan, whose now targeting Krei. They manage to lure Callaghan's micro-bots into the teleportation portal Callaghan built himself. But the portal is still engaged and sucking things up. Baymax's sensor picked up a woman, Callaghan's daughter from the video, still alive in the portal. Hiro and Baymax go inside it and manage to locate the girl. But they get stuck by building debris, damaging Baymax's jets. After Hiro says Baymax's shut down protocol key phrase, Baymax sacrifices himself by shooting his fist that's propelling the girl's pod with Hiro on it to safety. The five are sad that Baymax didn't make it. But then Hiro finds Tadashi's nurse chip on the fist, and rebuild Baymax.The story is nicely developed to a good balance. Being of a Marvel superhero origin which is now a trending theme for movies, but being developed as an animation which largely associated with kids' movies, the story can really grasp the best of both worlds. The story gets to be nicely emotional but not to the point of making the viewers cry. The movie also can be a nice expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although I should also say that it's intelligently positioned as remote as there's still possibilities to link the live action movies with this movie.The movie is also hilariously funny, I must add. It seems like the creators of Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph can really have a larger space in this movie to make it into a funny and enjoyable movie. The comedic moments are spread evenly all through the entire duration of the movie, mainly centered on Baymax and his reactions to the world and Hiro's interactions with him. This movie makes even the supposedly dangerous moments into very funny and laughable.The voice acting quality is very nice. Scott Adsit really did his job well that Baymax can really be that funny and seemingly without knowing that he is. Ryan Potter nicely fills in the shoes for the main character, capturing all Hiro's emotions into the voices. All other actors and actresses are also of top end list of the Hollywood roster of younger talents, which makes the voice acting quite a completion for this movie.For me, a 7 out of 10 score for Bg Hero 6 (2014) is a suiting rating. It is very enjoyably entertaining with quite a solid story and very funny scenes all around it. It also retains much of the Marvel superhero movies' trademark signatures.",7,22,33,25 November 2014
Grave of the Fireflies," All around depressing yet it's well executed
","The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister.",7,2,4,29 September 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Very much an enjoyable comedic action entertainment
","The movie starts with Peter Quill, kidnapped by a spaceship as a kid, he's then seen on an alien planet retrieving an orb. But he soon meets Korath but escapes. His buyer in Xandar refuses to buy the orb after hearing the name Ronan associated with it. Immediately after that Gamora jumps him for the orb and Rocket and Groot join the fight, in subdue Quill for Yondu's bounty. They all get captured by the Nova Corps and sent into prison where they meet Drax. Quill talks Drax out from killing Gamora and soon the five embark on a quite comical escape. Gamora lead the group to Nowhere to meet with The Collector. The Collector reveals the powerful stone inside the orb and an accident happens. The group escape but when they're outside it runs out that Drax sends a signal that summons Ronan and Nebula. Drax go to fight Ronan while Nebula chases Quill, Rocket and Gamora. Ronan bested Drax, while Nebula manages to destroy Gamora's pod and left her to die after taking the stone. Quill saves Gamora by giving her his mask and calling out for Yondu. After talking out a deal with Yondu and a comical standoff with Rocket, The group rallies again devising a plan to save Xandar from Ronan. After Quill calls the Nova Corps to warn about Xandar the group and Yondu go to battle in Xandar's skies. Rocket and Yondu pierce a hole on Ronan's ship and the rest of the group breaches it. Gamora faces Nebula, Drax handles Korath, and Rocket helps the Nova Corps handle Ronan's fighter ships. The four reaches Ronan but Quill firing Rocket's special cannon does nothing to him. Rocket slams Quill's ship to where Ronan is. That makes Ronan's ship plummets down even more unstoppably, so Groot grows his tendrils and cocoons the other four. Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Drax survived, but Ronan is still unharmed. After a speech by Ronan, Quill distracts him while Rocket and Drax shoot at his hammer, releasing the stone on it. Quill grabs the stone, but like what it did at the Collector's, it starts to take Quill's life. Gamora, Rocket and Drax instinctively grab on Quill, and the stone's power is spread between them and they kill Ronan with it.The story rolls out slowly just for the first three or four minutes, and then it's a hell of a ride after that. The pace is very quick with just enough moments to slow down and breathe a little, yet it never stops actually. I like how the story completes out the background very well for Peter Quill, although the same can't really be said about the other four main characters. The mood is very nice, crazy action and all the hilarious jokes you can laugh at. The action is nice. I was anticipating that the action will be quite boring since I expected to see the usual laser shootouts, mêlée blade fights, and heavy personal artillery fires, pretty much what there is in a typical space based action movie. But this movie contains the awesome mêlée smack down action with well designed moves nicely performed and edited stunts.Especially on the jokes, they make this movie into one of the best jokes in superhero/comic based movies. They very much laughable and enjoyable. What's even better is that they're not scarce to find. And also they come in many forms, not only the classic one-liner dialog, but also practical jokes, references, and long duration call backs.The acting is a nice overall. Chris Pratt gets the character of free minded yet past-bound bounty hunter nicely. Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillian gets the action scenes nice enough. Bradley Cooper can really make all Rocket's scenes enjoyable. Vin Diesel is the one who needed to make the least effort for his one line dialog almost the entire movie.The props, sets and makeup do their job nicely. But the thing that is praise worthy is the visual effects and photography combination. The right amount of light plays, combined with the right angles and pans and zooms make the scenes both enjoyable and enable them to deliver the story well.From me, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is worth an 8 out of 10 score and a definite recommendation to go and see in the movies. It is very enjoyable both on the action and comedy sides.",8,3,6,5 August 2014
The Imitation Game," An entertainment, a history lesson, and a lesson in moral contradictions
","Professor Alan Turing is the man who broke the supposedly unbreakable Nazi encryption Enigma. He started very awkwardly at an MI6 sanctioned team based in Manchester. As his fellows uses various methods to decipher Enigma, Alan instead designs a machine to do that. When his team leader denies his request for his machine's spare parts, Alan wrote to Churchill himself, who then makes him the new team leader. Alan fires disagreeing members and re-recruits through selecting with a crosswords puzzle. They get Joan Clarke through this. In and out the movie also shows Alan's school days, a time when he only has one friend Christopher, gets bullied by others and his anti-social manners starts to grow in him. Alan and the former team leader Hugh fights due to Alan not helping the rest of the team in decipher work while he only tinkers with his machine. Joan helps him to reconnect with them, who then defend Alan when the MI6 is firing him due to his completed machine is not working as fast as it should. When Joan states she's returning home due to traditional culture reasons of having to marry at twenty five but not having any candidate yet, Alan proposes to her as the most logical thing to do.One night, the team go to the pub for drinks with Joan and her friend Helen. The anti-social Alan gets confused when Alan and Helen flirts at each other. But a hint from Helen's intuition of partially breaking the cipher sends the team and Joan rushing back to the base. Alan finds that there are repeated words that makes the cipher predictable thus the machine doesn't have check on all possible setting. With that they manage to break the Enigma. But immediately after, the team has to fight against moral values to let a convoy be attacked less the Nazis will find out that Enigma has been broken and they'll change the cipher design. Alan and Joan goes to see MI6 head Menzies to arrange cover ups so the Germans don't get suspicious about the broken enigma. Alan finds out one of his teammates John is actually the double agent their commander has been suspicious of. But Peter threatens to open Alan's own secret of being gay. The suspicious Menzies forces on Alan by threatening to convict Joan as the spy. Alan reveals John is the spy but Menzies says he already knows that and insists Alan to decide what to leak and what not to leak to John. Alan opens up to Joan about his being gay and Joan says she can accept that. The war is then won and Menzies tells the team to keep it a secret. In 1953 Alan Turing is sentenced to a hormonal therapy and killed himself a year later.The story is a great one due to being a depiction of many moral contradictions on varied fields. We see conservative traditions hinder so many things, including the efforts to win the greatest war ever fought to date. Things such as binding women to social values as to marry at most on her twenty fifth age, A gay is legally punished just for being gay, and that someone is doubted due to being anti-social are just some of those things. It's good that eventually persistence and a little bit luck, as in chance meets preparation, helps a great deal to overcome those things and win the war.Its's quite the shame since the person gets to be humiliated by punishment and considered fair whereas his achievements of saving many lives is kept silent for the past fifty years or so. It's nice to see that characters like Hugh Alexander and Joan Clarke exists in the real world. They embody the good things about tolerance and willingness to work together and adapt, instead of dismissing people based on their obvious flaw but neglecting their other potentials.Back to this movie, the drama is nicely set around the aforementioned base conflicts. The characters built strong in their own share of significance. But even the least significant character, like Peter who only has a big impact on that one convoy thing, is designed nicely to make the story's drama strong. The movie centers itself mostly on Turing, having the other characters appear in and out and even putting Turing's character as the narrator. But the screenplay nicely share the liveness of the scenes at all the other characters every time they are involved.The acting feels very nice in overall. I really like how Benedict Cumberbatch does all those confident stutters and manages to reduce a little bit of his deep voice to reach the level of perceived insecurity of Turing. Kiera Knightley also acted nice in recreating the more authentic feel of the woman of that particular era in England, and at the same time still looking smart and confident. Matthew Goode and Mark Strong also give their characters great work that they have nice impacts to the movie.My say for this The Imitation Game (2014) is that it deserves a score of 7 out of 10 and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. Besides being a great lesson in history and a nice entertainment, this movie also serves us a great lesson in those moral values contradictions that hinder progress.",7,0,2,10 January 2015
8 Mile," It's Aaa'ight, but it ain't that good tho
","The story is based with a good premise about a struggle from the bottom. But the development wasn't that good. the side conflicts are too messed up they don't really intertwine, they are more like entangled on each other. The whole movie is just one slow work when it's about pace building. The editing doesn't help clear the mess up either. Although I must say that the mood of being quite gloomy and cold was maintained well and stable throughout the entire movie.The acting is quite nice. Eminem did quite a nice job, one so predictable considering he is playing his own real-life experience. Kim Basinger also do quite good, although she doesn't really get the drift. So does Brittany Murphy in her role. The real attraction from this movie is those tight rap battle scenes and also.the freestyle lyrics. A 6 out of 10 is from me.",6,0,0,27 June 2014
Jurassic World," Nice action-thriller and lived up to the spirit of the original movies
","Two brothers Zach and Gray are sent by their parents to have a vacation at the dinosaur theme park Jurassic World, which has opened for quite some time despite the horrible failure of Jurassic Park some twenty years ago. They meet with their aunt Claire, a high ranking employee of the park, but Claire leaves them with her assistant due to her businesses. Claire meets her boss Misrani and they oversee the newly genetically engineered dinosaur Indominus Rex which is staged to be the new attraction for the park. With a body twice the size of a T-Rex, Indominus shows signs of high intelligence. On the other side of the park, Owen Grady works as a tamer for a pack of raptors. An InGen man Hoskins approaches him with a purpose of weaponizing the pack, to Owen's rejection saying that the pack is still largely an uncharted territory. Yet when a co-worker accidentally falls into the raptor cage, Owen nicely displays his command of the pack, at least not to eat the both of them.Claire meets Owen, persuading him to try to tame Indominus for the park, much to Owen's rejection, saying that it's impossible especially if the conditions are compared to the raptors. When Claire brings Owen to the Indominus' cage, the dinosaur tricked them into entering the cage and leaving the gates weak. Indominus wreaks havoc through the gates, claiming lives of the cage keepers, with Owen barely escaping the dinosaur's jaws. Park security personnel dispatched to handle Indominus also rendered dead when it's found that it can change skin color and avoid thermal detection. The next thing destroyed in the dinosaur's path is the old aviary where the park holds the flying dinosaurs, also claiming Misrani's life. The flying dinosaurs come to the visitor area and wreak havoc to the civilians. Seeing Misrani's absence, Hoskins and InGen take over the park's control, insisting Owen to bring his raptors to hunt Indominus.The hunting party catches up to Indominus, when it simply communicates with the raptors, then assuming the position of the pack's alpha. The hunting party gets to be hunted, with Owen, Claire, Zach and Gray barely escaping. The retreat to the visitor area where there's only security personnel. The four get caught by the raptors. But Owen manages to sway the pack into his command again. The pack attacks Indominus, but it's not enough. Claire makes herself as a bait, luring the park's T-Rex out to fight Indominus. But this too proves insufficient. They all catch their luck when the dinosaur battle between the T-Rex and the raptors against Indominus gets dragged to beside the Mosasaur pool, where the gigantic marine dinosaur snaps from its aquatic habitat and bites the Indominus by the neck and drowns it to be its food.The story really tried very hard to be something different. It seems like the movie really tried to get out of the common generalization. This way makes the movie instead builds up a little bit too slow at the beginning, showing too much of the brothers' family than the actual park. And strangely, when the park is actually shown, the movie just happily jumps right back into the usual recipe for these kind of scientific action thriller movies; show a dazzling world with potential dangers, show a new yet risky change to that world, and let the risk happens by itself and the action begins.Yet despite the story being so predictable and all, the movie still has many plus points it can brag about. The most important is the really nice thriller sets it has here and there. The piece with the raptors, which has already been shown on the trailers look very tense at the actual movie, so did the piece where the two kids are trapped inside the gyroscopic ball with a dinosaur up their butts. The action sequences, instead, are not really that great in overall in this movie. The night time raptor-truck chase sequence couldn't really top the original movies' T-Rex-jeep chase sequence. The fact that most of the action took place at night really didn't help at all.The CGI and VFX however, is one amazing job in overall. They really took care of nice details in bringing back animatronics for the scenes of kids in the baby-dino zoo. The Mosasaur is also quite a spectacle. What tops it all for me is how the movie places the camera in Kate's Pterodactyl ordeal. The acting overall is a great job in my view. Chris Pratt, being at home with this kind of character like what he did in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) brings the sanguine persona devoid from the previous Jurassic Park movies. Bryce Dallas Howard did okay in balancing the movie with the alternate perspective of the park. Casting Vincent D'Onofrio as the side threat is a great thing the movie had. It made the threat side more significant and not only focused on the dinosaurs.For me Jurassic World (2015) deserves a fair 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to see in the cinemas. For action-thriller junkies or junkies or just those people who grew up watching the original movies like me, I think the movie will worth your money. Besides bringing back the nostalgic awe of dinosaurs, the movie succeeded in being suspenseful at the action-thriller parts.",7,12,34,17 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," The monkey sure is a great addition
","The movie doesn't really have anything new to present. It basically runs on the first movie's story and characters. It just changed the location setting from Las Vegas to Bangkok. It sure is quite nice to have a different location and culture influencing the story. But seriously, the plot is simply the same, right to the very details. The only difference in the plot is that this time it is Stu's wedding instead of Doug's, and this time Doug didn't get into trouble. But having everything work out just as the first movie did is just boring. Fortunately this time the comedies are a bit better. We get to see hilarious craziness in them. The ladyboy, everything with Chow, and of course the monkey, are the things that made the comedies worth laughing at. Particularly the monkey is the funniest of those gimmicks.. The acting overall is just as the same as the first movie, if not lower. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zhac Galifianakis successfully reprised their respective designated roles.",6,0,0,3 February 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Only little surprise left after all those promotions
","Following Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), the team storms Struecker's mansion, reclaiming Loki's scepter as Tony gets Scarlet Witch's mind poking. Clint gets injured facing Quicksilver. Hawkeye gets healed using Dr. Helen Cho's tissue generating cradle. With data from the scepter's gem Tony gets Bruce to create a peacekeeping AI Ultron. Instead, Ultron goes haywire and tries to kill The Avengers. Ultron makes body copies, spreads through the internet, then flees with Loki's scepter. Ultron tracks Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and recruits them saying they are after the same peace. They track Ultron at Wakanda. But Scarlet Witch tricks the entire team except Hawkeye. The worst effect is to Hulk, who then rages through the city, with only Iron Man using a special Hulkbuster armor manages to pacify him. Low at morale, the team retreats to a safe house, Clint's home. They realign themselves but Thor separates himself and seeks Erik Selvig for help. Nick Fury comes to the team with information.They find they've forgotten Dr. Cho. It turns out that Ultron hypnotized her into using the cradle to create a vibranium enhanced body, to which he'll insert himself as the consciousness. As the body, his vision, nears completion, Ultron takes the gem from Loki's scepter and put it at Vision's forehead. The Avengers crashes the lab and Ultron flees. Previously unable to read Ultron's mind due to his inorganic origin, now she can as Ultron's mind is being downloaded into the body. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver detach from Ultron and helps The Avenegers from the fallout of Ultron's escape. They eventually gain the body but Ultron kidnaps Black Widow. Hawkeye brings the body to Tony who intends to give it live, injecting JARVIS as it's consciousness. Steve objects to it but Thor comes and charges lightning onto the cradle, giving life to Vision. Vision states he's not Ultron nor JARVIS but entirely his own being. He tracks Ultron back to Sokovia, so they heads out to confront him and rescue Black Widow.They arrive at Sokovia and evacuate civilians out. But when they face Ultron, who has built an army of copies, they find out his real plan; levitating the whole Sokovia city with jet propulsion, and crash it down from a certain height, creating the effect of the meteor which wiped the dinosaurs out. The team fight to protect civilians but the city is already sky high. Nick Fury comes with the old SHIELD heli-carrier and transports the remaining civilians. The Avenegers then protects the propulsion core from Ultron so he doesn't disable it to crash the rock down. Quicksilver gets shot and dies. Scarlet Witch feels it and lets down her guard as an Ultron copy kills the core. Iron Man and Thor team up to crack and split the rock down. When finally Ultron runs out of copies, he flees the scene and Vision catches up to him and finishes him out.The story as a whole is typical of any Marvel movie. But the screenplay is in fact very well thought of. I really like how the script quotes from the Bible evenly for the misguided mind as Ultron's and for the righteous mind as Vision's. Presence of humor throughout and Stan Lee's cameo return as signatures, minus a real post credit scene.One thing that I feel as this movie's disappointment is those promotional clips, and early shed details have showed so much that it feels that there's only little surprise left in the story elements. Although I should say the Hawkeye twist is a neat one. The other thing that feels weird is how Natasha Romanoff is placed in connection to previous movies. She's with Bruce Banner here, when instead we saw her implying something with Hawkeye at the first Avengers movie, and last year with Steve Rogers in The Winter Soldier.The movie feels a bit nagging because the smaller details don't add up. The thing in the trailers about the African American woman in the pool where Thor takes a dip didn't appear anywhere in the movie. There's also Thor dialog saying there's already four Infinity Gems out, without any mention of any Asgardian knowing about the events of Guardians of the Galaxy. Also there's the sudden term change in referring to super-humans, from 'miracles' in The Winter Soldier's post credit scene, to 'enhanceds' in here.The characters feel more deeply developed, and that's good. Through a certain story element we get to see the heroes' deep dark thoughts and their responses to them. Sadly this isn't also applied very much on the villain Ultron as his animosity only shouts out through his witty dialog lines and sinister voice of James Spader. Yes he thinks as fast as electricity itself as he's an AI. But this feels inadequate and makes the movie rather shallow in regards of what drives th villain.The action scenes are as promised in the trailers, epic. The opening sequence on Struecker's mansion a nice set-piece that feels very much flowing even though it has so many camera and focus change points between the characters. I really enjoyed the Hulk vs Hulkbuster sequence. Even though the trailers have been showing much, but the fight's end is really an epic sight.The action overall is quite nice. The main characters can really keep their characters and weave themselves into the the story with them. The added heroes also had their acting pieced together neatly by the good directing job. James Spader can really use his voice to compensate more on the lack of character deepening. Having Andy Serkis serves good in bridging on to the next Captain America or Black Panther movie.My view for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10 and a surefire recommendation to go and enjoy it in the cinemas.",7,4,10,23 April 2015
Big Fish," Great family and fatherhood movie in an adventure wrapping
","I really like how the story rolls out quite fast using the back and forth flow style but still maintaining focus and delivering just enough detail to build up at the very beginning. The next moments also introduces nice variations by having not just one person telling the stories. I like how Tim Burton can get the story to be so alive with all those fantastic details. And there is a really nice positive message conveyed through the father and son interaction scenes. Ewan McGregorr did great in making the fantastic story feels alive, while Albert Finney did nice to build the older version of Ed Bloom to have a deeper character while still retaining the story teller's enthusiasm. Billy Crudup did okay in building up the balancing angle for the story. Marion Cotillard gave a nice color in completing the whole story. Helena Bonham Carter did very nice in keeping the little girl's character, and she is also very pretty in this movie.",7,0,0,29 August 2014
Everest," Great although with unbalanced character developments
","1996. Rob Hall says goodbye to his wife Jan. He and his team go to Nepal to guide clients to summit Mount Everest, at more than 8,000m. His clients include Beck Weathers; Yasuko Namba, who had been to six of the seven summits; a journalist Jon Krakauer; and Doug Hansen, an ordinary man enthusiastic about summit-ting Everest. They reach the Everest base camp at about 5,000m. Rob meets his competition team leader Scott Fischer who quips about Krakauer originally being Scott's client. The team gets to do three acclimatizing ascents to adapt to the thin air. On the first ascent Doug coughs, repeating his problem that made Rob turned him back last year. Beck calls home. His wife feels something strange about him since Beck never calls when on a mountain. On the second ascent Rob turns the team back for a storm. Rob did the same on the third ascent. But they get stuck on the Icefall region due to a crowding on the stairs. Beck almost falls on the stairs and Rob guides his hand, although Beck gets grumpy about it. Rob persuades Scott to work together, to Scott's agreement, although there's friction between their Sherpa guides Ang Dorjee and Lopsang. May tenth, they go on to summit. After a while Scott goes back to base camp for a missing client. He then goes back up, despite Rob's advice. Past Camp 4 Beck starts having sight problems so he stays put while the others go on. Ultimately most of the them reach the summit. Scott tells Rob to go back first. Rob guides the pack down as his schedule arrives. He finds Doug late to reach the summit, but Doug persuades Rob to help him summit. Rob helps Doug, passing his own schedule. Soon a violent storm engulfs the summit. Rob struggles to guide Doug, who's now half conscious, to the Oxygen stash point, where they find none. Rob radios back for help and his crew Harold climbs back up to help them. Scott tells Lopsang to leave him due to him running out of breath. The rest of the team going down finds Beck and brings him too. Beck and Yasuko get separated in the storm while the rest of the team make it back to Camp 4. None is willing to go back out to help due to the storm. In the storm Rob and Doug shelters on a narrow ridge. But Doug rips his fastener in his hallucinations and falls to his death. Harold reaches Rob with Oxygen but the cap froze. They have no other choice but to wait the storm out through the night. At night hypothermia catches on to Harold and he too falls to his death. In the morning Rob wakes up numbed down to frostbite. The team at base camp tries to motivate him by patching him to Jan. They send Ang Dorjee to find Rob but he turns back when the storm descends again. The base camp radio him this message and he talks again to Jan. Beck miraculously wakes up from the ice and walks himself back to Camp 4. Other climbers guide him back to base camp where his wife arranges a helicopter to come and pick him up. Rob, Scott, Yasuko, Harold and Doug died on the incident and their bodies are still on the mountain.The story is good enough that it captures a balanced portion of the incident and the general view of the more dangerous side of mountaineering or summit-ting, particularly at Everest. The movie nicely spots a highlight at how summit-ting Everest has become a business, and how the lack of governance on that part of the world has resulted in the strong competition between guide teams and also dangerous crowding on potentially dangerous areas like the Icefall.The first half still seem very nice If you sit yourself down and try to learn some new things about mountaineering. Even if you are actually a mountaineer, you can instead sort the true practices beside the gimmicks added to make the movie more dramatic.I think the second half of the movie is where its real main attraction is. The struggle of the characters to survive and the harsh ordeal most of them had to go through seem very much in contrast to their confidence and mountaineering experiences at the beginning of the movie. The refusal of those who made it to Camp 4 to go back and help out also adds to the contrast.Furthermore, for people like me who haven't read the book, this movie nicely gives a variation to our mindset about Hollywood movies' ending. It's now too often to see a happy ending in many Hollywood movies, even in disaster movies like the last 'San Andreas', that people tend to generalize that a movie's ending will be a happy one where the characters get to go back to their lives. I have another friend who told me she is annoyed that the main character dies at the end. The acting overall is quite good. A starry cast list helps very much. Although we don't get balanced character developments, at least the movie managed to present a believable level of acting. Jason Clarke did well in portraying Rob Hall as a 'hand-holder' as Scott says. Jake Gyllehaal, Kiera Knightley, Sam Worthington and even Elisabeth Debicki nicely adds to the factor that attracts our eyes to the screen for seeing familiar faces in the movie.A solid score of 7 out of 10 is deserving for Everest (2015). A recommendation is definitely a yes to go and see it in the movies.",7,0,0,29 September 2015
Into the Wild," Modern era prodigal son, with a different ending
","This movie depicts the dream of most of us, despite the wrong reasons its being done for. I enjoy all the great sets and locations all across the USA I this movie. What's even greater is that the movie interacts more with the location, not just like any other movies which only take the location as a background picture. I really like how the movie uses the length of its duration to really emphasize the story into building up the details such as the characters and background story. The movie is indeed a great experience in watching. It's quite rare for me to give a score rating of 8 and above, but for this one, I was certain after watching just about a quarter of it. Emille Hirsch did a nice job in staying the fit and total for this movie. Jena Malone did just enough of a presence and help the flashbacks get a better sense to them, Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt acted the completing set for the story nicely enough. Even supporting characters that Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart played had enough depth to pay attention to.",8,0,2,30 August 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," A good mystery thriller, but necessarily an entertaining one
","The story opens in a very absurd way, forcing the viewers to look at what's supposedly the inspiration for Planet of the Apes movies for the whole 25 minutes or so. No dialog, just monkeys telling monkey tongues. But then the cinematography of the space condition and how they execute them is just an awesome job. Never before while I watch a movie I was intrigued into guessing at how did they do those anti gravity shots. The concepts of the futuristic technology are also very nice, and as we can see, they are not very different from what becomes reality nowadays. But that's all there is to it, and you'll only get them on little bits and pieces along the movie. Stanley Kubrick really likes the overall depressingly lonesome and gloomy mood of his work here. Despite the very good presentation of two conflicts, maybe three of you count those crazy monkeys, the abundance of duration without dialog, or even without meaning in the eyes of some, is overwhelmingly irritating for me. The acting overall is quite a nice job, despite the kind of stupid accents done by some.",5,1,6,18 September 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Great romance, even the side plots are nice
","The story is very touching. It opens up subtly soft with the ending, and then builds its base conflict straight up. The details reveal themselves very neatly afterward, and the turning point and main conflict is then presented in a very touching yet somehow funny and cheerful way of story telling. I like how this movie even has spare time to develop a side conflict between the supporting characters. The main conflict and the side conflict both serve neatly designed twists that are quite unpredictable up until the very moment they're about to arrive. The acting is very nice. I love seeing Jim Carey doing something other than comedy, although he still doesn't leave his funny-man aura. Kate Winslet gets into the carefree and careless Clem very nicely. The appearance of Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson made this movie more alive especially with those extra twists.",8,1,3,19 September 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," Long duration for so relatively few conflicts
","The movie opens very nicely with the ending. It uses the back and forth flow very well. The use is very clear with the make up on Robert DeNiro. The story also flows back and forth in a not too often frequency that it confuses the audience. However, the story presents only a few conflicts in the main time frame of between when Noodles getting out of jail and when the bank job failed. I really like the acting overall which is very good. Robert DeNiro as always played out his character smoothly, expressing his deep suppressed anxiety very well. James Woods gives the movie a character with the contradicting polar of Noodles, expressing out the anger well. We get to see Joe Pesci and even an earlier career job for Jennifer Connelly here which is very nice.",7,1,7,8 October 2014
The World's Fastest Indian," A beautiful story with funny quirks here and there
","The story is nice and the basic premise is a rare one. Burt teaches us about determination, indomitable spirit, perseverance, and hard work all at once with this story. The great thing about this movie is that the dramatization contains a whole bunch of funny quirks here and there that this movie should also be considered as a comedy genre too. This movie also shows us about culture clashes and shocks, and how we should be facing them accordingly. Hopkins really acted nicely. He gets into his character well. Seeing his role as having quite a hearing loss, I personally quite accepted that this is what Hopkins' current mental health state until I remembered that he acted out in contrary in his role in Meet Joe Black.",8,1,2,5 July 2014
Victory," A good story despite all the many hiccups
","The story is one of the unique tales to be based on World War II, The basic premise departs from the love of the game of football in both the sides of Allies and Axis, despite there's a war between them. The added weight of having the Nazi will be very tempted to use the game as a great propaganda against the rest of the world and the Allied POW will be tempted to use the game as a cover to escape makes the story more interesting. However, the story develops rather unpredictably weird, having Hatch willing to go back inside to convey the info to Colby, and having the mob rush in without the Nazi shooting a single bullet. There's also all the little hiccups here and there such as the alarm didn't sound when the light hit Hatch's face when he's escaping, and also the football game rather played stupidly despite being designed by Pele. The acting is surely an average one, despite the big names of Stallone, Caine, and Von Sydow here. From all the roles, I only see Michael Caine delivers a quite convincing acting, although is also refuted by the sheer weirdness of how the story unfolds.",6,1,1,24 July 2014
Frank," Gloomy tale of music and mental issues
","The movie focuses on Jon, a young musician with no band and still lacking good song material. One day by accident Jon meets an indie band on a beach as they are left with an open slot for a keyboard player. Jon volunteers to join and on stage Jon sees first time the complete band, including the eccentric front man Frank who wears a fake head and never taking it off. Sometime later Frank calls Jon to join the band and go with them some place in the woods. They record their album there for a year. There Jon's position in the band slowly rises as he gets closer to Frank. He begins to win Frank's heart and, as the band obeys Frank, thus the band's direction. After the album does done, Jon reveals he had been publishing clips of the band on YouTube without the others know. They hate him for it, but he wins Frank's heart as he shows them the many views. They go to the USA to play on SXSW. It's shown that Frank had some past mental issue. Seeing the possible crowd multitude and their effect on Frank, the others ask Jon to cancel the gig. Jon persisted and, as Frank sides with him, the other band members split. But Frank gets a mental episode and their gig fails. Impatient, Jon demands Frank to take off the fake head. As Jon fails to force him, Frank runs away from Jon but his fake head is smashed. After sometime searching, Jon finds Frank, in his parents' home without any fake head. He apologizes to Frank but the aura is lame between them when Jon leaves. Jon finds the other band members playing live music in some deserted tavern. The movie ends with the band getting together again and jamming to Frank's lead, with Jon only watching.The story rolls out all too like any indie spirited movie, with the constant gloomy lonesome mood. The pace is at the slightly slowed down speed, perfect in combination of the mood and the normal take on photography. It's nice to see that the story unveils perfectly over the course of only ninety minutes or so duration. Although it's quite regrettable that being a movie with somewhat strong mystery genre aura, Frank (2014) doesn't offer any surprising plot line or twist. It goes all too predictable.One mentionable thing is the music indeed. The music in Frank (2014) is indeed a not rare find amongst indie musicians, incorporating a lot of electronic sound modification and samplings. Done in a grunge and britpop mix, the songs don't necessarily offer great vocals. What makes the music different is that the lyrics and melodies are very catchy.The acting is indeed more than a decent performance. Domhnall Gleeson did a decent job in maintaining the role of the story teller focus character although the story focuses on Fassbender's character. Having big senior names such as Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scott McNairy is nice in boosting attention and awareness as well attracting viewers for this movie. Seeing Michael Fassbender act without actually seeing his face up until late into the movie is indeed a nice new experience. This concept has been done before, but again it feels quite different due to Michael Fassbender is the one doing it.My final say for Frank (2014) is a score of 7 out of 10. A recommendation is only for those of you are real life musicians or music enthusiasts, or those who have high patience to wait until the story gets interesting.",7,2,5,24 August 2014
Selma," Another movie on the monumental civil rights movement
","1965. After the end of segregation Dr. Martin Luther King receives Nobel Prize amidst the still heated south of the USA, with the then recent church bombing that claimed five little girls' lives. D. king meets with President Lyndon Johnson, demanding him to act on black people's right to vote. When Johnson evades, Dr. King goes to Selma Alabama where blacks are of more than fifty percent of population but are still restricted from voting. The white supremacists are embodied in the Sheriff Jim Clark. Dr. King says the movement needs drama to attract Johnson's attention. First they stand in front of the county registration, which ends in arrests. While Dr. King is in prison, his wife meets with Malcolm X, the leader of the other polar of the black movement. X tells her that he's views of Dr. King has changed and he's willing to help, although in a harsh way.When Dr. King gets out of jail and is out Selma, an unofficial gathering happens at night that ends in violence as troopers disperse the crowds. A boy Jimmy Lee Jackson is killed in that incident. Soon the group decides to have a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The march ends in total violence where the participants are bludgeoned and beaten and all the imagery are captured on TV and news papers. Dr. King didn't walk with them as it's expected to end in violence as Johnson's aide told them. He calls out to all kinds of people to join the next march. Many people come to join, even whites, most of them clergy. But when the march actually goes, despite Johnson's attempt to make a deal with Dr. King, The troopers withdraw from their guard. But Dr. King backs down from his march. But that night a clergy member who participated on the march gets beaten and killed. And the court grants the legality for the march. At last President Johnson sends the Congress a bill to end the voting restrictions.The story nicely depicts one of the milestones that Dr. Martin Luther King accomplished in his years of the civil rights movement. It encompasses enough proportions of the other sides of Dr. King's life, especially the family and politics side. There is fair depiction of Dr. King's character and life to view him as a human being rather than just a movie character.We can see his devotion to the cause. We can see his patience to others' reactions. But we also get to see the human side of him, while at the same time he sees his moves as a strategist who dissects all the important details in order to come up with a strong plan. I personally think that Dr. King was kind of inspired by what Gandhi did with his march to the sea. And both of them proves that non violence is the way to do a resistance.The technical aspects also help the movie to view quite beautifully. The constant sepia like color tone helps in adding the sense of authenticity to the movie. All those clever lighting play also looks nice. The occasional angle play, particularly at the speeches and sermons, also adds very nicely on how the set influences the scenes.The acting is decently nice in overall. David Oyelowo has gone a long way since his days as supporting roles and now proves himself that he can handle the main focus character. Carmen Ejogo acted just a standard work in providing the completing angle of the family. Tom Wilkinson did his usual character as someone in power. Tim Roth did quite well in giving the expressions needed as Governor Wallace, although I think his accent needs to be sharpened a little bit. Giovanni Ribisi adds a nice color to the whole movie.My view for Selma (2014) is that it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see in the movies is quite a yes for me. It's an entertainment that can also inspires while at the same time reminds about the struggle that had to be done to achieve what we have now.",7,5,11,16 January 2015
Invictus," Unity through sports
","The movie tell's the story elements very well with enough proportions indeed. It's about overcoming old hatreds in a post apartheid environment, and that subject is depicted very well in scenes and images, some are subtle enough while some are striking yet none reach the stage of being disturbing. It's also about sports, with the rugby parts depicted quite totally without having to be too technical about the sport it self. I like how Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman done their accents. Those give the more authentic feel to the characters. Yes it's not as good as other Eastwood movies such as Million Dollar Baby or Gran Torino, but still this movie was worth watching.",7,0,1,2 September 2014
Life Is Beautiful," Optimism, wits, and a bit of luck go a long way
","The story is magnificent and remarkable. The first half shows us a funny part of Guido's story, already a highly witted person with no shortage of optimism, in getting by his life and reaching for his love Dora. The second half displays how Guido, now a father, shields his son from the grieve of a concentration camp, all while always incorporating his wits to get by things, his optimism and enthusiasm to get by with his son's curiosity, and having a fair share of luck that eventually saves his son's life. I rarely see such a movie that can turn its mood from the happy tone into one of a sad tone so drastically, yet the happiness is still there even in the sad moments. The background is of course the classic and usual set of World War II's Europe, but again the developed story takes us to see the war from a very touching angle. Of course there are pot holes and things that don't really make sense, But the story itself is so touching that it belittles the shortcomings. Benigni, Braschi, and even the little Cantarini act well and can make us us fell the mood of the movie and connect to it.",8,1,1,17 July 2014
The Hurricane," The Shawshank Redemption in a true story
","The story is so strong, and it being a factual one only makes it even stronger. It's like that if you've already watched IMDb's number 1 movie of the Top 250, The Shawshank Redemption, and thought that was a great movie, I think you will enjoy this movie at least just the same. I like the earlier story flow style of back and forth. The movie puts enough duration to draw the background, not just to the main story but also to the root of the hatred and Rubin's childhood. The dramatization is just enough without have to be too graphic to depict the needed crucial details. The screenplay and the dialog are also nice and compact, not wasting any unnecessary moments yet without sacrificing anything essential. Denzel Washington did a good job here, and I think he would've been very much honored to have played his role here. Having Unger, Hannah and Schreiber here is also quite a nice work considering that this movie is one of their first big works.",8,0,2,5 August 2014
A Clockwork Orange," The best Kubrick work I've seen so far
","The movie goes on strong in all of its scenes and sequences. From the quirky and mysterious opening, to the utterly crazy first chapter of the story, to the explicit depiction of forced brainwashing, to the 'full circle' final chapter and the conspiracy theory ending. The movie is a great work for me because it can make me feel two different types of attitude towards Alex. At first I was utterly disgusted by what he and his gang do in their spare time on the first chapter. But then when the 'full circle' revenge is exacted by the cripple, I was kind of sorry for him to have endured such atrocities. But then the feeling return back to normal when the conversation with the psychiatrist happens. The acting is okay in overall. It's shows just he kind of standard Stanley Kubrick work which also sometimes allow a bit of hyperbolic over-acting here and there.",7,3,7,4 October 2014
Woman in Gold," Great emotion play
","The movie is nicely loaded with enough emotion play about Maria's memories. The build up is quite strong with all those flashbacks alternating with the main story. It's a bit lacking though since the actual moment of the uncle commissioning Klimt to paint the portrait didn't really had a scene in those flash backs. Yet I find the movie lacks very much in addressing the main story's flow. The main story doesn't really flow that well, especially on the relations between Randy and Maria.It's quite unclear of how Randy can really get any interest to the case at the very first place. Also there can be more potential in the moment where Randy persuade Maria to go at the first place. The acting overall is adequate, although I see Helen Mirren only doing her accent well and didn't really gave her best performance here. Ryan Reynolds is really having difficulties in adjusting to his character.",6,0,0,10 July 2015
Groundhog Day," Another nice concept
","The movie's concept for its main conflict is really nice. Able to relive the same day over and over again magically seems to have it's own perks of repetition and learning from mistakes. Too bad that the concept is only developed into a meagerly interesting final product. I've seen Edge of Tomorrow, which uses the same concept, but it ends up better for me due to it took the concept into a more serious matter. Nevertheless this movie can still have good grip on its main concept and took it into quite a good story with nice repeated scenes. Too bad that the ending is only about love and nothing else. The acting overall is quite good for me. Bill Murray's acting is really suiting to his character's reluctance at things. Andie MacDowell did well to provide the balancing angle for the story",6,0,5,27 July 2015
Sicario," A little dose of action to focus more on the thriller
","FBI Special Agent Kate Macer leads an anti kidnapping team raid an Arizona house tied to Sonora drug cartel's VIP Manuel Diaz. Surviving an IED, she finds her boss discussing about her with a 'DOD adviser' Matt Graver. Matt asks her to join his team targeting Fausto Alarcon, Diaz's leader, and Kate agrees. She meets Matt the next day and he introduces Alejandro. They fly to El Paso and join in extraditing Guillermo, Diaz's brother, from Mexico back to El Paso. Kate pries about Alejandro and he reveals he's Colombian. They make it back pass the border but get stuck in traffic near the border post. Everybody scouts for possible attacks. Alejandro tells Kate to draw her weapon, to her confusion and hesitation. Soon he spots a car with gang members and calls it in. The team gets ready as Matt orders to follow the gang's actions in engaging. A gang member steps out and the whole team quickly exits the cars aiming at the gang members, warning them. One wrong move from a gang member sends the entire gang crew dead by bullet storm.Kate questions the shooting claiming it out of protocol, suspecting Matt as CIA. Matt dismisses this as he brings Guillermo into a building. Guillermo seems afraid as he sees Alejandro. At night they fly back Arizona. Reg picks up Kate but Matt orders them to join him to Tucson. There they question immigrants from Nogales, Mexico, where Guillermo claimed a secret tunnel into the US is located. The next day sees them busting Diaz's money launderers in a bank. Despite Matt's warning, Kate goes in the bank seeking evidence to build a case against Diaz, and puts her face on the CCTV. She brings Matt evidence but he refuses to build the case. Kate and Reg take this to their superiors, who deny them any action, hinting that Matt's team gets the approval of an elected office way above them. Frustrated, Reg takes Kate to his regular bar. There he meets his friend a local cop and introduces her to Kate. Kate brings the cop to her place. But she stops as she notices he wears the same bracelet as on Diaz'd money. He tries to kill her as she fights, but Alejanro comes at the right moment. The next day Kate and Reg witness Matt's team's unique resources, such as drones and SpecOps soldiers, in hunting Alarcon.Matt confirms their first objective is accomplished as Diaz leaves for Mexico to meet Alarcon, whose location is unknown. Matt feels it's the right time to strike the tunnel, and reveals that CIA cannot actually operate within US soil except the operation is endorsed by another domestic agency. This reveals that he's been manipulating Kate all along. Yet Kate decides join the tunnel strike. Alejandro tells the team he'll move ahead as point, not needing help. The assault goes well although Kate loses her rifle. She follows Alejandro as he reaches an exit and ambushes a local Estata Policia officer delivering drug cargo. The cop asks whether Alejandro is Medellin and Kate appears behind him. Alejandro takes the cop hostage. Kate asks what Medellin is, but he instructs her to go back and don't follow him. She refuses and instead aims her gun at him, to which he replies with two stunning shots to her body. He then leaves with the cop as hostage.The team helps Alejandro track Diaz and he makes the cop pulls him over. He tricks Diaz into taking him into Alarcon's place, and kills him after he gets inside. Kate returns to the team, punching Matt in the face. As she settles down, Matt reveals that Alejandro is their second objective, the agent infiltrated into Mexico to kill Alarcon. Alejandro casually kills off Alarcon and his family, settling his vengeance over his wife and daughter. The next day Kate finds Alejandro in her place as he asks her to sign a letter expressing that the operation had gone according to procedure. He threatens her as she refuses, to which she finally yield and signs. As he exits the place she manages to assemble her gun and aims at him, but she refrains from shooting him.The story seems quite interesting although to be honest this theme of drug war has more recently descended into the script for B-movies. Thus the movie producers have quite a big job in regaining the interest of the action thriller audiences in general. Starting the movie with the raid scene is a common move to plant interest into the movie's opening. Yet I have to say that after that the movie tends to became a little bit disappointing.The movie nicely plays on at the thriller side, adding more and more tension into the scenes and audience anticipation by adding suspenseful scoring and duration. But I find that the duration adding at times had gone too far to where the turning point actually happens and harvest from the built intensity of the thriller.The action side however helps to focus more on the thriller side very much. By giving short doses of real action but instead emphasizing on the short action's quality and tying it critically to the story flow, the movie nicely grasps its more thriller side of its nature.The acting overall is quite good although I find some imbalance between the main roles. Emily Blunt's acting is just adequate, nothing really special. It's just enough to portray the curious and |by the book| attitude of the character. Yet she could done better as she did on her last role on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Josh Brolin did enough to cover his angle for the story, but Benicio del Toro's performance is somewhat nice. His acting can really grasp the whole mystery and secrecy shrouding the background of his character.My final view for Sicario (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,6 October 2015
Departures," A great drama about death
","The story is a great tale to tell. It uses nicely the length it takes to tell a detailed and complete story with many sub plots, which all of them completes full circle at the movie's end. The main story is told well using the midway point as its starting point. The neat trick about this movie is that it has more than a few significant characters, who has even clearer significance near the movie's ending, yet this movie is able to keep just Daigo as the sole focus of the story. The story gets more and more heart-warming and touching as it nears its end. I particularly like how the movie turns the people around Daigo from hating his job into embracing it and even being proud with it. And the ultimate finale is a great personal turning point for Daigo himself. The acting in general is a good overall work. Motoki Masahiro played Daigo well, encompassing enough expressions t cover his emotions, although a bit lacking at the most demanding moments. Hirosue Ryuko also did well as Mika, keeping consistency on his expressions that suits Mika's cheerful basic nature. Yamazaki Tsutomu leaves a good impression as the boss who often look emotionless.",8,0,0,11 January 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Funny and ironic
","I watched Snatch way before I watch this one. So the movie is really predictable to me. And with Snatch as my standard for a Guy Ritchie movie, it really isn't any disappointment to see this movie turn out to be beneath the former in terms of overall watching satisfaction. The movie is indeed one that shaped a general image of a Guy Ritchie movie, a greatly funny and ironic crime movie, a heist movie in sub genre. Though the movie being ironic an funny is more or less predictable for me, I was still curious about how the story will unfold. Also the quirky and shady characters developed are the things that add much curiosity to the movie. The acting overall is a great job for me, especially in how the performances feel so natural because they are done by natives. It's quite bad that not all the alumni of this movie's cast made it into bigger stages and careers.",7,1,1,18 July 2015
In Time," A great original concept with a poor execution
","The story's original concept about time being just about everything is a great original idea. It develops very nicely showing all the details of the consequences of such an idea. The details are also incorporated quite seamlessly into the story; it makes quite difficult to follow on this movie if you watch it from half way or later. Yet the execution in the acting parts is not the satisfactory. For me honestly, the lead role should be given to anyone other than Justin Timberlake. He acts just below okay for this movie. Not that it's a bad acting, but with a great concept like this, it should be played by someone else with a better reputation for a sci-fi. Amanda Seyfried also didn't give a good performance here. Her use of facial expression is dominantly flat. Cillian Murphy and Olivia Wilde, on the other hand, id a very nice acting job to make this movie feel alive.",6,0,0,22 September 2014
The Fountain," Great mood depiction and consistency
","Darren Aronofsky's movies are surely great in doing mood depictions and keeping the consistency on it. We see constant rebellion and self indulgence in Requiem for a Dream, constant reluctance within obedience in Noah, and here we see fervent strife even though there's no hope. As an atheist Aronofsky nicely developed his ideas and presented them to the screen and still keeping his sense of atheism. Yet this movie toyed with the sense of hope as the final conflict draws near. It presents the audience with disappointments at all levels of the story. Also I really like how the movie weaves the three sub stories together by using the back and forth story flow. The acting overall is a very nice job. Hugh Jackman proved here that he's not only great at action and superhero movies but also for emotional drama movies. Rachel Weisz did also great, especially in keeping the emotions at all those extra close zoom takes.",7,1,2,5 August 2015
Mystic River," A nice story of suspicion and reluctant actions
","The base premise is a good one, considering it's a rare one. The development into the final story is nice, considering the movie offers only ordinary straight and linear story flow.The pace built is nice, at quite a fast pace rate. The mood is also maintained stable by having balanced emotions of the characters, even the ones who are not the main characters.The story is built well to develop suspicion to all the possible characters involved, and also the reluctance to act to face the consequences of actions of others.The acting is good from some of the preferred actors at their time. By for me this movie's strong point is mainly it's strong story. The story can keep the viewers curious and stay in their seat to keep watching.A solid 8 out of 10 is from me.",6,0,2,20 June 2014
Zombieland," A fun ride for a zombie movie
","Out of all the zombie movies I've watched, Zombieland presents an easy going and fun ride for a story compared to its counterparts. This movie can nicely tell a zombie-post-apocalyptic world and retains many traits of a standard zombie movie without having to be overly stupid or gruesome or horrifying. I like how the movie keeps the focus about the survivors on a journey and banding together. The sharply contradictory characters are also deeply developed with each of the characters having a specific flashback sequences to base their behaviors on. The acting overall is a good one. With Woody Harrelson as the senior of the four main cast, I see his role not only extends as in the movie itself, but also as a mentor to the then newcomers of Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin.",7,1,3,7 May 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," A great story, one of those which brings shivers of awe to me
","Despite the age of this movie, the story of the movie is an incredibly marvelous one. The story of how one often underestimates his/her own life especially under sickening burdens.The flow is quite a slow on the start, up to three-quarter parts of the movie. But it picks up at about the last half-hour and builds up a fast paced yet long and detailed finale.There are also things to compensate, regarding the age of the production, such as the color, the spoken accent which sounds quite stupid for the current times. But besides those, I think the story is a strong one that it helps the movie overcome those obstacles.",8,4,8,21 June 2014
Psycho," A classic thriller with probably the best twist at its time
","Although the background conflict drive is introduced very early in the beginning, the story took quite a long time to build up until the first real conflict occurs. And it takes up to about half an hour to reach the real focus of the movie. The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead. The acting is just a decent one. What's quite irritating to me is that most of the male actors try very hard to have the fake commanding accent. Janet Leigh acted nice enough, though. She handled her gestures nice in making the conversations more alive.",6,0,2,3 August 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the classics of long span romance movies
","The story is one of those about relationship stories spanning a long time, with all the clash of characters in between the times. The sub genre will be complete with the predictable happy ending where the main man and woman get together at the end, which this movie has. This story felt like choppy on some parts with all the supporting characters didn't have any adequate character development. But by maintaining the focus only on Harry and Sally, the movie kept the whole thing intact well enough. The movie also feels lacking in terms that it didn't really use the location to interact with. The comedy inserts are nicely done since they don't come often, but when they do they can really crack up laughs. The scene with Sally's fake orgasm is one of the classics indeed. The acting overall is nice. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan showed nice chemistry to make their roles come to life. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby did nice in filling the required supports.",7,1,1,5 August 2015
Crazy Heart," A decent story out of a common background
","Yup, just like that. The story is just a common one in musicals, where a rising star or a veteran, in this case a veteran, struggles with his life due to the overwhelming lifestyle, the by product of free paradigm of stardom and celebrity status. The movie's quite good because of the live performances by Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell themselves. The performances not only showcase the actors other potential as singers, but are also engineered well, both the indoors and the outdoor concerts, to be readily enjoyed as they are. The conflicts portrayed in the movie are some common themes found in the similar movies, even the conflict climax, the turning point moments, and the reconciliations are commonplace. But the acting overall is a good one. Jeff Bridges gives a bit of nice touches by trying to go total here. Maggie Gyllehaal gives the right edges this story needs to be complete. And while his role is quite complimentary, Colin Farrell can complete this movie with his nice acting and singing. It's quite entertaining for me.",6,0,1,30 July 2014
Wedding Crashers," More romantic than a comedy
","The story is one of those clichés of comedies; starts a movie with a premise based on a lie, let it develop and peaks and see how the dust settles after the moment of truth, which because it's a comedy, is sure to be a happy ending. The story gets to be more romantic than comedic in a very sort while, particularly because the movie only uses a lengthy montage of scenes to depict the mischief of the wedding crashing. Then the movie gets slower as the romance takes over, and to be frank it gets to be boring. The comedic inserts after the romance part kick in makes the movie instead a confusing one since those inserts are horribly weird. The moments with Todd are well freaky and even the character Sack fits in just to complete the movie's turning point. The acting overall is also quite lame. Owen Wilson didn't really progress and depicts his character here almost the same as any other of his characters. Vince Vaughn's craziness completes the comedic angle perfectly. It's too bad that they whole comedic set only lasted well for a while. Rachel McAdams also didn't really gave any difference to her role. Bradley Cooper's surely a waste in this movie",5,0,0,5 August 2015
There Will Be Blood," The black gold takes tolls on everyone
","A strong story indeed this movie has. And it's also developed nicely. Focused about the oil business, the movie depicts just what a sly businessman would do to get his way. Yet in getting his way, and even after getting it, Daniel's dominant character of anger and easily offended get the best out of him all the time. This is not excluding persons dearest and closest to him. Unfortunately the 'all is fair' attitude is also shown by people he comes in contact with, including the townspeople stuck in blind faith and also especially the town's false prophet. I like Daniel Day Lewis's performance. He can really create a great distinction between all his roles. This shows that he is quite a master in the art of getting into character. Seeing Paul Dano giving the right balancing performance is also a great here. It's an entertainment good enough for men for a 7 out 10 score.",7,1,4,3 August 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," Great subjects presentations and weaving the two of them together
","The movie opens mildly, looking like a children's adventure movie. Then little by little the more serious theme of racial prejudice seeps in and gain more focus until the touching transition scene with Atticus and the country folk after Tom. The scene really was great both emotionally and technically. It transitions smoothly from the children adventure subject to the serious rape charge clouded in racial prejudice subject. Emotionally, the scene may have stirred something in people's minds about what they were doing wrong; the racial segregation issue. Gregory Peck acted quite flat on the expressions, but his dialog and body language parts are quite good.",8,0,0,10 October 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," It won't be a waste of your time and money
","Edge of Tomorrow focuses on Will Cage, a military media relations officer, who gets thrown into the heat of battle wearing heavy exoskeleton suits, against Mimic alien invasion, all against his own will. On the battlefield, he accidentally kills an Alpha, a different kind of the Mimic, and dies right instantly. But he didn't die but instead he repeats his last day. Realizing his new found ability, he meets Rita Vrataski, the war's poster girl tough soldier, and trains under her. It turns out Rita once had the same ability but she lost it at the last battle. Rita tells Cage the rules, that for him to repeat the day, he must die, and also to stop the whole thing, they must win the war by killing another rare Mimic called the Omega. Cage grows more adept in battle with each day he repeats. One day Cage and Rita make it to a house with a helicopter, a point in time where Cage knows that if they continue, however the way, Rita will die. He tells her this but she refuses to listen. Rita keeps on starting the heli, a Mimic comes out of nowhere attacking it, and Cage goes for his weapon in the house. Cage kills the Mimic but Rita still dies. He then repeats the day but this time, he doesn't get to Rita, although seeing her. He gets past the house and heli point without her and flies the heli to a dam where the Omega is located. Inside he's confronted by an Alpha and dies. The next repeat, he goes back consulting Rita. They then go to General Brigham to get a gadget to locate the real Omega's nest. They located the Omega in Paris, while being chased by the military. They're captured and the hospital gives blood transfusion to Cage, eliminating his day-repeat ability. Escaped capture, Cage and Rita enlisted the aid of his squad to assault the Omega. Once again Cage asks Rita to stand aside and once again Rita insists on going. After a failed insertion, Cage and Rita manages to break into the Omega nest. They encounter an Alpha. The only way is for Rita to distract it while Cage goes for the Omega, so they do it. Cage drops the bomb on the Omega and it repeats to about two days earlier.The base story is great. Yes it's not an original story, but a free adaptation of the Japanese graphic novel 'All You Need Is Kill'. Usually we are presented the story of time travel, but this time it's about time repeat. It's like when you play a video game from the early console era, before the save-point development. When you die, you repeat the game, not from the checkpoint or save-point, but from the very beginning. But the advantage of this story is that it has the ability to be non-linear. Here we see Cage going from saving his friend from the falling transport, to not saving him.The story twists, like the visions turning out to be a trap, are quite predictable to me, but they're still fun to see due to excellent execution. I see also that the editing is done well for this movie. It's because, like all sci-fi movies, problem comes when a complex base concept is being done with a fast tempo. People, especially those who have, pardon my addressing, inferior capacity, may lag behind. This was what happened with The Matrix (1999), many people watch it repeatedly, not out of liking it, but out of curiosity because they don't get the concept on their first time watching. The editing here is good that it eliminates this problem. Less experienced viewers may again lacks when it comes to the times when Cage asks Rita to stay behind, but seasoned sci- fi watchers will get it faster.The action is good. But for me, the action may not be the movie's main attraction point. The suits do make the characters look cool, but at the same time they make them harder to move agile in a cool way. The action is quite saved by the visual effects showing the Mimics being speedy and agile, drastically increasing the dramatization of the action sequences.A senior Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is a good recipe of a cast selection for this movie. Here Emily proves herself capable to handle even action sequences. A bit of a role for Brendan Gleeson doesn't hurt either.The acting is great. It's funny to notice that this is one of the rare movies where Tom Cruise rarely do his smug grin, LOL. I personally think Emily Blunt handles the scenes and character greatly. Hr facial features fits perfectly into the tough soldier face, when compared to the many smiles she does in The Adjustmen Bureau (2011).The costumes and make-up departments did a great job. The suits look great in making the soldiers look tough, although they don't look so agile and nimble. The make-up of the faces in the battlefield is also great, not too bloody, instead being of enough dirt and soot. Sets are beautifully made for this movie, even the ones in the battlefield, like the house with the helicopter. The music scoring is just enough to build the mood and not taking the focus out of the scene.Overall from me a score of 8 out of 10 is deserving for this movie. I personally do recommend you to go and see it. It won't be a waste of your time and money.",8,0,2,6 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Retains the interesting parts from the original movie and added something new
","Well, at least the story quality is still about the same, considering that it's being as predictable as it was in the first movie. Yet as the first movie did, this second installment really knows what are it's plus points to retain and emphasize on and added more interesting stuff into the mix. I like how the movie retains the original a capella battles with the free styling, although this time it's quite not as grand as it was on the original movie. I also like the songs which are still able to do they task of keeping the movie's mood always up. The comedic inserts are also nicely placed, even in the middle of the supposedly dramatic finale. I absolutely like how the movie added cameos of great artists in the real industry like Snoop Dogg, and the judges from The Voice. The acting work in overall is just a bit above the standards. Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld, being the most prominent names in the cast list, should have done better, though. Rebel Wilson nicely keeps her character's as the anchor for the comedic points.",7,5,8,17 June 2015
Downfall," Nice elaboration on the final days of the Fuhrer
","The story rolls out very nicely, Having most of the scenes done in the bunker setting makes this movie prone to being boring at some point of its more than two hour duration. But this movie handled it well by depicting striking images and great shocking moments. What's lacking in my opinion is that the war scenes don't really get the real war aura, especially after we see what's done in Saving Private Ryan. But then again, the main focus of Hitler's surroundings on his final days at the bunker really captivated me as I watched this movie. Bruno Ganz acted out nicely in this movie. Before I see this movie, I have seen parodies of the angry Hitler scenes here and there and I wondered what movie was those from. Now that I found the original movie, it makes sense why people choose Ganz's Hitler character as the closest to the real person.",7,0,2,30 August 2014
Whiplash," One of the best of 2014
","Andrew Neeman is a student at Shaffer, the best music school in USA, but he's just an alternate drummer in some school band. One night he accidentally catches the attention of Terence Fletcher, the most revered conductor in the school. But even since acquaintance, Fletcher has been such an irritating and abusive man. He humiliates Andrew at his first day on the band, to the point where Andrew cries. Andrew asks Nicole, the girl working at his favorite cinema, to go out with him. In a competition, Tanner, Fletcher's band's core drummer left his music sheets to Andrew, who neglects it for two seconds. The sheets disappear oddly. Tanner can't play without the sheets. Andrew steps in, stating he knows the song, Whiplash, by heart. Andrew plays well and earns Tanner's spot. But Fletcher introduces a new song, Caravan, which needs an extreme time stamp measure of 330 bpm. Fletcher keeps saying, harshly, that Andrew need to practice harder to gain the speed and tempo, Fletcher's tempo. Andrew breaks up with Nicole, saying his ambition will only hinder their relationship. One day Fletcher introduces Ryan, Andrew's band-mate in their former band where Andrew was Ryan's alternate, as another alternate drummer, heating more competition for the spot. At another competition, Andrew gets into an accident trying to be on time, after showing up late and has to go get his sticks back. He goes on and plays, all bloodied and battered, but Fletcher says he already loses his spot. Andrew had it and launches at Fletcher. He gets expelled from Shaffer for that. A lawyer approaches his family, encouraging Andrew to speak up against Fletcher's abuse, noting Shaun Casey, a player Fletcher boasted about earlier, was driven into suicide by Fletcher's attitude. Andrew agrees to it and Fletcher gets kicked out of Shaffer, without knowing who the whistle-blower is.Andrew continues on, leaving the kit for a while. But he sees Fletcher performs live. Fletcher sees him and they chat. Fletcher explains his view on his teaching method, that he drives the best out of his students. Fletcher offers the drummer spot for his band to perform at another upcoming festival with the same songs, Whiplash and Caravan. But it turns out to be Fletcher's revenge. The festival audiences are influential figures in the industry who can make or break someone's career. Fletcher intentionally leaves out Andrew from the opening song's music sheets. Andrew performs clueless. Embarrassed, he leaves the stage. But he goes back on to prove himself. As Fletcher talks into the second song, he starts himself with a solo and cues the band in for the song Caravan, which now he fully masters. After the song he still continues on with a long and speedy solo.This movie has been in my wish-list since I saw its first trailer months ago but I just get the chance to see it now after there is access to it on the internet. I have an experience in drumming so this movie relates to me even more. The story gets to be very engaging and it also teaches a very good lesson in my eyes, that to pursue your dreams you should do your best, and that includes putting blood, sweat and tears into the effort, and also choosing between your dreams and other priorities.The movie focuses on great characters. Andrew depicts a great character in his passion for music, for his dreams, and his ultimate choice to work himself out to achieve them. But the movie also plays it fair as it shows the consequences of being ambitious like Andrew does. Yes those cuts do happen to a drummer's hands, although maybe not that dramatic. Fletcher maybe perceived as the ultimate antagonist in this movie, shoving emotional pain to all his students. But we can also see the positive effects that students achieve their potential. Come to think of it, Fletcher has a great memory and a deep sense of ironic humor. When Andrew asks about Tanner as the drummer for the band performing on the JVC Jazz Festival, Fletcher answered that Tanner moved to a pre-med school, which is very ironic since Tanner stutters out from playing in Overbrook since he has a medical condition about his memory.The musical aspect is just great. The first time I saw this, there are many times that I feel a dilemma of choosing between closing my eyes to focus on listening to the great music and drum techniques, or keep opening it to see the acting. I am not quite sure that it's really Miles Teller on the kit, especially on those crazy 330 and 400 bpm tunes. But if it is really him, or if he at least plays a large chunk of those parts, I think he deserves more respect for his skills. The references to great musicians also serve as intriguing parts, if not inspiring.The acting is indeed a great job overall. I like how Miles Teller portrays the ambitious student, strengthening himself to withstand the obvious mental and emotional abuse to get the drummer spot for his dreams. J.K. Simmons acted out his usual part of yelling and screaming, we all got familiar with his J.J. Jameson parts on Spidemran movies. But this time he takes it up a few notches, getting more serious without the clumsy jokes.My say for this movie is that Whiplash (2014) stands up as one of 2014's best movie. It's a great regret that this movie doesn't get a wider release. I do think this movie deserves at least a nomination as best picture. Besides being entertaining and inspiring, like other best picture nominations do, this movie tells a great story about dreams and the struggle for it. A score of 8 out of 10 and a definite recommendation is from me for this one.",8,0,3,5 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A really fun movie
","The Wolf of Wall Street. Leo DiCaprio as the main character of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who conned his way into being one of the most successful brokers in Wall Street... illegally. The movie is full of nudity and obscenity, they show buttocks, women breasts, sex, or a combination of those almost every 5 minutes of the whole 3 hours of the movie... wew.In an overall neutral standpoint, I give it a 7 out of 10 score. The story streams itself in an irregular way by starting jumping (and humping, literally) on to the time when Jordan is on his prime, then slings back on to the time when Jordan's just beginning to tip his toes on Wall Street.The narration is backed well by the monologues that Leo's Jordan reads directly to the camera addressing the viewers. With the words choices such as those, I'm sure they'll crack some laughs on the audiences. The buildup of the story is nice, it really made good use of the 3 hour duration to develop the characters, even the supporting characters like Jonah Hill's Donnie and others like Brad and even Rugrat Nicky.But especially, Leo succeeded in building Jordan Belfort's character that I myself even believe that I don't have to read the book on which the movie was based to get to know the real Jordan Belfort.I haven't read the book, but the way I see it, the gimmick 'sell me this pen' may come from the book, and may be the only closest thing one can take home as a sales lesson from this movie. Also, I was curious on why did Matt McConaughy only get a part that lasted for only 1/6th of the movie. Matt was great in this movie. He went total on it by shaping his body way thinner to portray the addiction.The rest of the 3 hour was story buildup and a lot of comedy. The scenes of 'cerebral palsy phase, the flight to Switzerland, and Donie's 'she's perfect' scene was all hilarious comedies that also builds the story well. There is drama in the movie, but it is very clear that Director Martin Scorcese and Co-Producer Leo DiCaptio were not intending those to be a heavily emphasized points in the movie. The divorces, persecution, and jail time was only a brief silent moment compared to the rest of the whacked-out serotonin-dosed movie.In the end, for me the movie was good overall, but it doesn't really deliver anything more than a wacky dose of entertainment. It does really prove Leo can handle wacky comedy too beside his usual action or thriller.",7,0,2,10 July 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Great acting work but the movie is quite flat
","The movie takes on one of the most notorious true story of the Ugandan Iddi Amin. Yet the movie is too confined on the point of view of Nicholas, so the movie didn't really explore enough on Amin's notoriety. Yes, Forest Whitaker's acting did greatly in building up the character for this movie. But that character wasn't quite portrayed evenly due to the heavy focus from Nicholas' point of View, which kind of balanced the charm and intimidation Amin had. Yet the truth of ruthlessness wasn't really covered, since the actual ruthless side the president wasn't depicted in the movie. Yet as I said earlier the acting overall is a very good one, all thanks to Forest Whitaker's performance in giving live to the character, despite the imbalanced depiction of the ruthlessness. James MacAvoy did quite good in playing the confused doctor.",7,0,1,11 June 2015
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Quite funny although full with stupid jokes
","The movie starts off right as many stupid comedies do, making a group of people look like they fall under some spell of following stupidity, this time it's the whole San Diego watching Ron. It then builds the story well enough, introducing the character who is the source of the main conflict in a common way comedies do, a hyperbole of spotlight among a group of people. The rest feels just like other movies, but with Will Ferrell's funny yet stupid babbling. The jokes are not really balanced on the funny scale; most of them fall short on cracking a laugh from me. Will Ferrell acted his comedy part quite nicely, going total on those stupid babbling stuff. Christina Applegate gives the balancing role a good spirit, taking more part compared on her other comedies. I like what Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and even Tim Robbins did for smaller roles in this movie.",5,0,1,10 September 2014
The Reader," Slow in building up,, but very after a few moments in
","The movie starts and builds itself so very slowly that feels very strange. Also there's the awkward focus transitions between the young and older Michael and also between Michael and Hanna from time to time. But the movie really sets itself up well after a few moments in with those intimate shots. The characters, especially the main characters, are revealed very well by peeling their layers one by one. I like how the movie emphasizes on the characters' flaws, especially their hypocrisy, innocence and their reactions to ordeals, their own or of others they know. The acting overall is a great job indeed. Kate Winslet really depicted the character very nicely. We can really see all Hanna's angles, from her wild adventures with Michael, her firmness to him, but also her powerlessness which she hides from him. David Kross nicely depicted the innocence of a youngster who gradually changes into someone wiser. Ralph Fiennes did also a great job in imparting the emotions on the reading recording scenes and depicting the older Michael's doubts and reluctance toward Hanna.",7,0,0,23 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Less epic moments than the other movies
","Third and last installment in the adventures of Bilbo Baggins first we find the dragon Smaug wreaks havoc in Lake Town, angered at Bilbo's intrusion. Bard freed himself and manages to kill Smaug, shooting a black arrow at Smaug's exposed weak spot. Devastated, the Lake Town people head to the ruins of the former city Dale next to the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor. News of Smaug's demise travels fast and soon the Elven King Thranduil arrives with his army, uniting with the humans in demand for fair share of Smaug's gold. Thorin barricades Erebor's gate, refusing to share the gold as he's poisoned by 'dragon sickness', the lust for gold derived from the plunder which has so long been the bed of Smaug. At the day the elves march to Thorin's gate, his cousin Dain arrives with a dwarven army. Suddenly, the orc army under Azog reveals themselves and begin their attack. Humans, elves and dwarfs unite against the common enemy.But Azog cleverly divide his army to also attack Dale, forcing the alliance to also divide their forces, weakening it. With Thranduil, Gandalf and Bard in the city, the alliance manages to defend Dale. But Legolas and Tauriel returns with sore news, The second batch of orc army from Gundabad is arriving. Meanwhile, Thorin finally wins his own fight against the lust for gold and goes out to help in the fight. He then aims to hunt down Azog with three others at a watchtower. But the place turns out to be Azog's trap where his ambush costs the lives of Fili and Kili. Bilbo arrives to warn Thorin of the Gundabad army. Azog suddenly appears and attacks Thorin, knocking Bilbo unconscious. Azog's men corner Thorin but Legolas helps him by shooting down the orcs for a far. Fortunately, help arrive for the alliance as Beorn, Radagast and the eagles come to help. Legolas then defeats the orc second in command Bolg. Thorin manages to drown Azog beneath the frozen river but the orc returns to launch at him, pinning him to the ground. Thorin accepts Azog's stab but then quickly returns the favor, killing the orc. Thorin dies of his wounds while Bilbo goes with Gandalf's company back to The Shire.The story in general feels very much lacking since the movie altered the single book novel into a trilogy of movies with this installment in particular focuses mainly on the last battle of the five armies. With the way the trilogy splits the movies, Smaug's death looks only as a sweetener as it's placed very early at the very starting point. Adding in characters not in the book like Tauriel feels like a waste for me as they dilute the real story. But the action scenes fortunately retains Peter Jackson's nice feel for it. Although I should say that this movie sure lacks epic moments in the battle scenes. I personally only find two instances where the battle scenes look cool. First is the whole sequence of Smaug's assault on Lake Town, and the second is when elven troops jump over the dwarven phalanx to assault the orcish army's front rows. Having to much emphasis on the on-on-one fights sure reduces this movie's epic battle scenes.The acting is good in overall. Sir Ian McKellen and Orlando Bloom kept their characters well for this third in the trilogy and sixth in the Tolkien adaptation. Martin Freemen did well enough in portraying the more lively hobbit of Bilbo as to compared to the more sad looking Frodo. Richard Armitage plays it very well, nicely encompassing the right expressions on the good and bad sides of Thorin. Evangeline Lily plays out well enough for an added role that doesn't exist in the original novel. Lee Pace also adds nicely as Thranduil gets more focus than on any of the other movies.My say for The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies (2014) is that the movie deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is unfortunately just a so-so from me considering that while it's still a good part and ending to the trilogy, there's less epic moments than on any of the other Tolkien based movies.",7,1,4,9 January 2015
Ray," Balanced and powerful
","The story is nicely well balanced and powerful. The movie creators did a great job in creating those powerful scenes that exposes the real character. I honestly didn't have any significant experience in knowing Ray Charles' life events or works, but having seen Get On Up before I saw this movie, I'm pretty sure that the latter was partially inspired by this movie in terms of honesty and balance. The movie nicely explore the beginnings and the childhood in a way that doesn't bore down viewers using the alternating back and forth story flow. The acting overall is indeed one worthy of an Oscar. Jamie Foxx's role is so natural that it's very clear that he's really affected by the character he played.",7,1,2,18 June 2015
The Good Shepherd," Intriguing story yet not the best of spy movies
","The story uses back and forth story flow very nicely in building the background story completely and at the same time focus on the issue at hand. The espionage details are depicted and presented very nicely through the extensive help from the camera angles and zoom plays. I must say I was amazed to see so many big names performing greatly in this movie. Matt Damon performs greatly here, going out of the Bourne espionage character that made him famous, into one that is non operative yet still demands at least the same attention to detail. Angelina Jolie managed to pull out the balancing side for the story. Michael Gambon and Alec Baldwin also did well in filling in the shoes of those characters that don't take much duration.",7,1,2,30 August 2014
The Terminal," A touching story in a funny way
","This movie's opening is quite slow, introducing the environment and the general rules within it. It doesn't wait long and the main character and conflict is introduced very nicely with all the technical jargon in the dialog making it heavy and looking serious. But slowly the story builds on itself well, depending on the elements of Viktor's hardworking nature and lucky encounters. The side conflicts really help the movie builds up until it reaches its finale conflict. The funny little things is what I like from this movie. The comedic moments don't come from any jokes or dialog punch lines commonly found on comedy movies. It's rather made up from all those little things depicted being done by someone with a culture gap and thus also has some degree of culture shock. The acting side is really nice. Tom Hanks can really get into character portraying the man stuck in a hard situation but refusing to break from his nature and code. Stanley Tucci gives the antagonist in his not such hostile role a nice touch, keeping his well known knack for the bad guy roles but still maintaining the approachable presentation. Catherine Zeta Jones also give quite a nice performance in doing the romantic sweetener part.",8,2,3,11 September 2014
The Blind Side," A great story addressing many issues at once
","The story is a great one indeed. A rare tale about the love of a family can change a life of one and touch the hearts of many. The story nicely touch on issues as diverse as pure and simple love, racial pretenses and stereotypes, handling adversity, trust, and motherhood. And still, this movie can deliver all those moments with some very funny laugh spots. I like how Sandra Bullock acted out here, just the right level of accent, facial expressions and body gestures to get into her character. We can see her portraying moments of being affected without having to shed any tear. Tim McGraw and Jae Head gives the needed depth in building the story's crucial points. Kathy Bates gives it a nice touch an the short duration she's in. One thing that disturbs me quite a bit is Lily Collins' eyebrows LOL.",8,2,3,27 July 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great technicalities and acting, yet the story only revolves on itself
","Riggan Thomson was a big Birdman superhero movie star from twenty years ago. Now in an effort to get back in the game, he writes, directs and acts in his own Broadway play adaptation of Raymond Carver's story 'What We Talk When We Talk About Love'. But his old Birdman had nested in him and formed a split personality voice, cursing him for not going back to play as Birdman again. When a co-star Ralph gets an accident, he single- handedly changed him for Mike, a great-ambitious-but-acts-like-a-snob actor. His producer/lawyer/best friend Jake constantly reminds him of the financial problems they have, including having to talk Riggan down so that he keep Mike in the production after Mike crashes a rehearsal preview. On the other hand, Riggan has to constantly keep the confidence level of Leslie high. Leslie is a Broadway newcomer actress, who had a thing with Mike sometime a while ago. Riggan's daughter Sam was recently out of drug rehab and currently works as his assistant. His ex-wife Sylvia is constantly nagging him about Sam. His girlfriend and co-star Laura gives him the news of her pregnancy. And not the least of his problems is the NY Times critic Tabitha, who threatens to give him a bad review due to hating everyone who sells out to Hollywood.Riggan himself is the type of man who shuns internet developments. He doesn't have any blog or Twitter or even Facebook. One night while only in his underwear, Riggan gets locked outside the theater's back entrance. He walks all the way through Times Square to the main entrance, resulting in amateur YouTube videos that go viral almost instantly. Riggan finds out that Mike and Sam are having a relationship. The Birdman persona keeps nagging him with verbal harassment and giving him hallucinations. At last Riggan's play enter the opening night, and the crowd really likes it. After a talk with Sylvia, Riggan goes back to do the final scene where he shoots himself. Previously Mike had complained about the gun looking unrealistic, so this time Riggan uses a real pistol, shooting his nose off. He ends up at the hospital. But he regains his success with thousands following his Twitter Sam set up. Sylvia is there with him. Jake is also happy for his success. Sam comes to visit. The play went well with Laura and Leslie acting great.The story for me has a nice setup base. It starts with very potential points that deserve more development. The combination of all those problems Riggan has is just sitting there waiting to be developed and explored upon more. But instead the movie just hovers its way around Riggan with some little bits of time when the movie centers on Sam and Mike. Despite the eventual relatively happy ending, Riggan's cocktail of problems don't get any more scene showing them being actively solved.What really makes this movie deserves its praises and credits are those meticulously designed and executed technical aspects. The editing design that makes this whole movie feeling like almost entirely a one-shot is indeed an exceptional work of art. The camera angle play and movements are just plain ecstatic. We see this trick once or twice on many movies. But Birdman just makes us see this all throughout.The acting is also an exceptional work. All the cast responded very well on those close ups, pouring all the seriousness into their acting. I agree to the voices saying that this is Michael Keaton's best performance to date. His expressions and mannerisms successfully made Riggan a very unpredictable character. Edward Norton as Mike also acted out greatly with his body language. Zach Galifianakis at a serious role proves he still has a lot to offer. Naomi Watts, Emma Stone really nailed it at her close up emotional scene. Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan really add significantly to this movie.For me Birdman (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 score, while a recommendation is only a so-so for me. It's indeed not for everyone. I find this movie more entertaining from its technical and acting prowess than its actual storyline.",6,1,6,23 January 2015
Centurion," Interesting story with unbalanced acting
","The story opens nicely with that kind of scene, and the narration also makes it more interesting by stating it's not the end and it's not the start of the story. The rest of the story develops well, although very much predictable. The good the thing is that the're's plenty of action to see in this movie, provided that the viewers have a strong stomach to swallow down all the quite disturbing imagery. The twists are quickly foreseeable yet some of them are quite unclear when they happen. The acting is strangely unbalanced in overall. Michael Fassbender and Imogen Poots did great expressions work in their close up shots. Fassbender's action scenes are also quite well done. But Olga Kurylenko's acting lacks expression, presenting only one face throughout the entire movie.",6,0,4,14 October 2014
The Conjuring," One of the most real horror movies for me
","Presenting a story based on factual events, this movie did enough justice in dramatizing both the story and the horror aspects. What I really like about this horror, which is quite unusual for me since I don't really dig into horrors, is that the movie doesn't glorify the devil portrayed in it like other horrors do. The main proponent of that is that the demon doesn't win at the end. This movie falls into the exorcism sub genre of horrors, but it feels like none of the same, because it actually shows that the power of God is the thing that kicks out the demon from possession, not the Latin liturgies or the holy relics. Like this movie showed us, the demon or devil doesn't have to win on the end for the movie to have a sequel. The acting overall is decently good. Patrick Wilson seems to be finding a new home as a horror actor after mediocre roles in action and romances. Vera Farmiga played out her clairvoyant role well enough to give the ability enough realism.",7,0,0,10 February 2015
Platoon," Balanced view of war deeds
","The movie's story unravels a bit slow at the opening stages although with all those strong images of war. The story gets more interesting about half way the movie plays by depicting the internal conflict.. The set, props and makeup are done nicely, even for that particular time of the movie's production. The things that lack quite a bit are the sound and visual effects. The sound doesn't really give the real feel of stereo location placing, a technology that wasn't yet available. Yet the visual effects look somewhat too much forced, like we see on the lightning scene. The use of throwing flares in firefights is quite stupid since the damage of the unseen bullets are not really visible aside from what the makeup depicted. It's great to see that many alumni of this movie grew into big names such as Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, and even Johnny Depp. Most of them acted out really nice performances in this movie.",7,0,1,25 August 2014
The Water Diviner," Very emotional, great fatherhood movie
","Four years after the Battle of Gallipoli and after losing his wife, Joshua Connor leaves Australia for Turkey to look for his sons, soldiers in the battle. Arriving in Istanbul a kid Orhan brings him to a hotel managed by his mother Ayshe. Meanwhile in Gallipoli Major Hasan Bey and his aide Sergeant Jemal arrives at a request of the British War Graves Unit to help them locate their fallen. The British denies Joshua a permit to Gallipoli. Joshua gets close to Orhan, until one day Ayshe tells her how to get to Gallipoli without permit. Detained at arrival in Gallipoli, Joshua doesn't go back to Istanbul but instead stays on the beach. The ranking officer Lt.Col. Hughes then welcomes Joshua to search for his sons in the field. On an excavation day Hasan walks with Joshua retelling the chronology of a battle night there. It's revealed that Joshua three sons Art, Ed, and Henry are gunned down there. Finding a skull shot at the back of the head, a soldier provoke Joshua into attacking Hasan. Hasan instead then reveal an information that Art may still be alive and was taken prisoner to Istanbul. Back in Istanbul Joshua meets a dead end for more information but he gets closer to Ayshe and Orhan. Ayshe tells a local fortune telling game of coffee to Joshua, but when the game is done she refuses to tell the coffee's premonitions about him. Joshua steps in to help Ayshe as her husband's brother Omer, who eagerly asks her hand in marriage, starts hitting her. Omer tries to exact revenge but Jemal comes for Joshua. Hasan tells an info that Art maybe taken to Afyon. That night Joshua dreams of Art and knows he's still alive. The British army is determined to send Joshua back home. So Joshua evades capture and joins Hasan and Jemal and the Turk Army to infiltrate to Afyon in the Anatolia. But the group is ambushed by the Greeks on the way. Jemal dies to protect Hasan and Joshua, who then run on horses. They come across a village where Joshua feels Art is, and finally finds him. Art refuses to go with him due to his guilt over his brothers' death. The Greeks have arrive and start to shell the village. Hasan bids them farewell. Art rushes to a hill top to show an escape path to Joshua. Joshua talks to him and Art follows him. Back at Istanbul Joshua finds Ayshe who isn't surprised about him coming back. She says it's in the coffee few weeks back.The story builds up rather slowly, although with that strong opening sequence. But it nicely presents a solid story about fatherhood, guilt, believe, and redemption. For me it nicely captures a balanced depiction about both sides of the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turks and the ANZACS. The additional romance part nicely stands out without being just a sweetener in the movie. The finale also plays very nicely on emotions with quite a shocking revelation.The drama feels nicely strong. The movie utilized the back and forth story flow very well in building the memory, character relationships and the common thread for the story. The use of a repeated magic carpet story element that doesn't seem to be relevant to the bigger picture, linked the scenes about Joshua and his sons very nicely.The depiction of the war has nice enough dose for it. The war does seem intense and real enough although there seem to be more light than needed in the night time war scenes. One thing worth noted is that the choice of the lighting and coloration, especially for the day time scenes, and also the great job in location scouting made the movie feels very much authentic Turkish in it's locations, where instead the movie was shot predominantly in Australia.The acting overall is surprisingly good in my opinion. Russell Crowe did his most convincing role of a calm Australian father here. His deeper involvement as a director probably drives him for it. Olga Kurylenko also acted out her parts nicely, speaking the Turkce language dialog lines quite convincingly, though I think only native Turk couldn't tell the difference if there's any flaw in the accentuation. The Turkisj cast o Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan also acted their parts nicely convincing. Erdogan can even make his role feels very much emotional.My say for The Water Diviner (2014) is a score of 7 out of 10. A recommendation goes out as a half-yes from me. But if you're a drama enthusiast, I think this movie will be interesting for you because even I find this quite entertaining.",7,3,12,26 March 2015
Paths of Glory," What's the meaning of this movie anyway?
","Honestly I don't get the meaning of the story the movie is trying to deliver. The opening talk about the order to carry out the assault takes too much duration and done simply quite about stupidly. The trench scenes are done quite adequately nice considering the technology at the time of the movie's production. It has a nice effort of sound effects. But the story just goes on and on without any real focus, from the talks, to the half baked assault scene where there were no German seen, to the court marshal. Besides the story building talks up front, the sequences show only failures, cheats, treacheries and stupidity. Kirk Douglas is the only actor doing a decent job in this movie. His character is the only one enduring the story quite unscathed. For me, the lack of sufficient technology made the assault sequence quite stupid, where the soldiers just drop dead without shown any blood splattered or bullet wounds opening up.",3,4,17,25 August 2014
Raging Bull," A great take on totality for a character
",The movie is strong on its vivid screenplay and the acting by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The screenplay is so vivid on the depiction of Jake LaMotta's behavior. The story goes on quite slow in my opinion and it looked like it didn't put enough time for the boxing scenes. the fights on the boxing scenes seemed to unrealistic for me. The sound effects sounded like something from a sixties movie. But it's quite good to include the famous element of Italian American culture of ties to the mafia. De Niro's acting is just truly superb. His facial expressions are nicely fitting just as what he did in 'The King of Comedy' for comparison. He went total for this by gaining weight to make his suitable look for the older version of LaMotta.,6,0,2,7 September 2014
Straight Outta Compton," No Boyz n The Hood but still a solid story
","Compton, CA. 1986. Eric 'Easy E' Wright narrowly escapes the police when his drug deal goes bust. Back in his home Andre 'Dr. Dre' Young moves out of his mom's house. O'Shea 'Ice Cube' Jackson witnesses first hand gang intimidation when his school bus gets cut off by gangsters who were taunted by his friends. Cube goes to Dre's new house and tells them about it and his new rhymes. At a club Cube raps the rhymes while Dre spins. There Dre, Cube, E, MC Ren and DJ Yella meet. Dre convinces E to invest in music. After E bails Dre from jail, they form Ruthless Records with E rapping out Cube's rhymes Boyz in the Hood. This draws the attention of a music manager Jerry Heller. In 1988, their group NWA has have solid fan base. Jerry invites recording people, who mostly pass except for Bryan Turner. A bodyguard Suge Knight is also there and offers the group his services. NWA records their album 'Straight Outta Compton'. But when they have their breaks outside the studio, they get harassed by the LAPD. This inspires Cube to write 'Fuck Tha Police'. The song goes number one but the FBI warns not to play it. Cube mentions there's something fishy about their contracts with Jerry, to Dre's dismissal. In Detroit NWA plays 'Fuck Tha Police' despite prior warning, making them get arrested and rioting ensues. Jerry gives a contract to Cube but Cube smells something wrong and refuses to sign it and ends up leaving Ruthless Records. He ends up with Turner's Priority Records in 1990, scoring a hit debut solo album. He goes on a lyric battle with the rest of NWA over their songs. Meanwhile Suge Knight now changed careers to managing talents and tries recruiting Dre. Meanwhile the Rodney King case takes place. Dre talks to E about Jerry's misgivings but E still believes Jerry, making Dre leaves and joins Suge to form Death Row Records. Suge beats E into releasing Dre from contract. Death Row soon has artists like Snoop Dogg. Suge's violence starts to irritate Dre. On April 1992 The Rodney King case has its verdict deeming the LAPD not guilty, triggering the LA riots. In 1993 E starts to have money issues while Cube gets successful in the movies and Dre's album is a hit. E's girl shows him Jerry's misgivings. E meets Cube at a club and they forget their beef. Cube agrees on NWA reunion but without Jerry. E starts to look sick. E soon fires Jerry, and soon meets Ren and Yella to work on a NWA reunion project. But E suddenly faints and doctors deems him HIV+ and has only about six months. E goes public with his disease. Dre visits E who's now in a coma. Cube also comes but refuses to see E like that. E dies at 31 years old.As a biopic movie of one of the most influential groups, particularly to the black community and culture in the US, the story is really tightly knit and solid. The movie creators did well in not minding the duration to go through more than two hours in exchange for a solid story presented. It's also quite well executed, developing the movie's start and end points well without having to be vague and still within a reasonable duration time frame.Yet I admit I was rather disappointed to see that the movie wasn't really like what I expected. Having seen Boyz n the Hood (1991) a few months back, I was expecting more depictions of the real life in the Hood down in South Central LA. The movie is like that for only the mere beginning sequences. For me it would have been nicer if the movie gets back to this location and mood fro time to time, like when T dies. The fact is the movie changes into a mix of Empire and some other band movies altogether.It's quite nice to see how the movie finds look-a-likes and insert them to put more legitimacy to the entire depiction of the true story. The mood was really well placed with the younger Snoop Dogg and Tupac. But it's also a double edged blade since Corey Hawkins' face looks nowhere like Dr. Dre's. Ice Cube's character gets even better since it's being played by Cube's own son.The acting overall is quite good. As a newcomer Corey Hawkins did a decent job in depicting the emotions of the iconic figure in Dr. Dre. O'Shea Jackson Jr. did well in acting out his father's life. But I really doubt that he can act other parts well enough with this level of performance. I think he nailed being Ice Cube here because he's Cube's own son who lived with him all these years and got to know the person quite so much inside out including his mannerisms. Jason Mitchell did quite well in providing he other angle in E's character. Paul Giamatti completed the required character angle that has significance.My view for Straight Outta Compton (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10. It's really entertaining with a solid and tight story based on actual events. A recommendation goes out especially to you who are exposed to the culture. I don't think the movie can get much acceptance in communities rarely touched by the culture, though.",7,6,34,18 August 2015
Vanilla Sky," Really balanced between two powerful genres
","The movie presents a very interesting story, although it's not an original one. Furthermore I really like how the movie marries its distanced genres of romance and science fiction. The movie did a very great job in shifting the focus from the romance side, bit by bit moving it until the grand revelation of the science fiction side. Both of the genres were done quite powerfully. The romance side had its story strong enough with the conflicts coming in and out. The science fiction side feels rather unlikely at first but then gained its significance more and more over time. The acting work is a great overall job. Tom Cruise did his character nicely although his usual grin really bores people down. Cameron Diaz did her part well, having her character suddenly reappearing after the middle point. Penelope Cruz adds her accent very nicely to the romantic side of the story. Having big names like Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon's kind of a cameo, in supporting roles really adds to the movie as a whole.",7,1,3,11 May 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," No real originality on the story
","After interviewing him for her campus newspaper, Anastasia Steele gets close to Christian Grey, her college's benefactor. Soon, Christian saves her from being abused while she's drunk. He then dazzles her with a fancy date. But as she surrenders herself to him, Christian instead reveals a bit about himself and shows Ana his play room, filled with BDSM equipments. He offers her a contract to be his 'submissive' while he becomes the 'dominant'. They have sex that night, but not in the play room as Ana says she will review the contract. Ana and Christian discuss the contract in a business meeting, with her striking out items which don't fit her. For Ana's graduation Christian buys her a new car. He even takes Ana to see his parents. Ana goes to see her mother in Georgia the next day, and Christian flies there to see her. More and more Ana tries to convince Christian into a more normal relationship but he refuses again and again. He reveals bit by bit that he had a rough past which shaped him into his behaviors. But eventually Ana can't stand of Christian's obsessions anymore and decides to walk away.Well that's just about the shortest synopsis I've ever written so far for my reviews here. Why, you may ask? It's because that For me the movie offers a very predictable set of story, all the way from the background to the development, to the final ending. Yes I haven't read the book, and what I watched was a rather incomplete copy of the movie that I have to watch it again when a better is available, but I'd say I agree to those negative comments about this movie.In my eyes, the story and character backgrounds are a full copycat. People say that this is just a lame BDSM fan fiction of Twilight. Well I say that even Twilight is better than this movie for the romance angle. For me this movie feels like a slightly modified version of the famous Meteor Garden / Boys Before Flowers drama from back in the early 2000s. The story is just that drama series, minus the other insignificant three guys, plus the BDSM, jam packed into a Hollywood 100-minute long movie script. All the elements are in perfectly; the wealthy yet dominant male lead, the innocent female lead, meeting the male's parents, and even the piano sit in uncut, even though many of those elements get tweaked to account for the focus shift to the added BDSM elements. With them in place, the movie lost the unpredictability aspect, which makes it quite boring from the early fifteen minutes or so.The romance is just nothing special. There's no relationship build-up that takes some time. There are montages accompanied by the good soundtracks, then they suddenly move to the BDSM build-up. Having said that even Twilight is better than this movie, I find it very strange that the focus on the BDSM is kind of reluctant. There are too many cuts and edits into those scenes that they give out Dakota's body double away. There goes both the romance and BDSM angle.The acting overall is just a decent one. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan played out their focus roles at just standard levels of performance, nothing bad but also nothing special. Although I should emphasize that while she kind of gets the innocent angle for Ana, Dakota Johnson didn't really get the sexy part for the submissive scenes. Jamie Dornan looks like he didn't realize that the movie's focus is about the two characters that he displays only the same expressions over and over.My say for Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is just a 5 out of 10 score. It's not quite an entertainment for me due to the story gets so predictable. A recommendation is just a so-so considering the high anticipation this movie gained. But seriously, wetting yourselves in the cinemas for this is just stupid.",4,1,4,18 February 2015
Win Win," A rare drama comedy that's more focused on the drama side
","Seeing Paul Giamatti who's famous of his comedic performances and dialogs, even in action movies, I expected a lot of goofy laughs in this movie. Well, what I got is a bit the contrary where the drama side about the themes of family issues, trusts issues and motivation and achievement issues is more focused and prevalent. But I won't say that I was disappointed because there are some enjoyable laughs in the one-liner dialogs and awkward settings. It's nice that the drama side is still prevalent even at the comedic moments. Aside from Giamatti, and maybe Cannivale, I didn't see any other special performances. Their performances are just enough to cover the crucial aspects of this movie. Bobby Cannivale did quite well on the sport scenes, although he should really work on his use of facial expressions.",6,2,4,6 August 2014
Ben-Hur," Epic...
","There is only one word worthy enough to describe this movie, as I wrote on the title; EPIC. I watched this movie out of curiosity, and aiming for the IMDb badge. But it turns out that it was a very worthy experience. An epic adventure of almost four hour in duration, this movie was able to include many genres into it. There's the whole drama parts, where I see so many other revenge movies, also epic ones, take their inspiration from, such as The Count of Monte Cristo and even Gladiator. There's the great cinematography done on the ship battle scene and particularly the chariot race scene. And there's the touching moments time and time again where the story brushes with the story of the life of Jesus. The acting overall feels quite nice. Charlton Heston did well in giving definition to Judah Ben-Hur's character, as well as Stephen Boyd and Hugh Griffith in their respective characters. The other cast members also did well enough to attain such deep characters, supporting this colossal endeavor of a movie.",9,1,3,14 November 2015
Casino Royale," Great fresh shift of the Bond formula in overall
","The story shows a great new and fresh take on the Bond franchise. After so many years and movies and actors, it's just right to use this movie, in a refreshment and introduction from Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig, to really steer the whole Bond feel to a new direction. I really like how the movie divert from the usual and repetitive focus on the brilliant villain and henchman with their uber crazy world domination plan, to a more personal focus of Bond. This is done without lessening the action quality. I enjoy the action scenes, particularly the early parkour chase sequence, which really gave me a queasy feeling when it reaches the high cranes. I like how the actors commit to the story in their acting. It's a great acting job in overall. Daniel Craig did very well in giving live to the cold and efficient Bond personality without reducing the womanizing charm. Eva Green really managed to keep the audience tethered to the whole Bond's personal story.",7,0,4,7 November 2015
La Vie En Rose," Great acting and art directing, but too bleak for a movie
","The movie presents the story as if it's the most bleak story about a real life singer. For a two hour long movie, this flick presents you with a fast paced story, with most of the scenes lasted only below the three minute mark. The coloration choice sure helps a lot in setting the tone to a dark and bleak story, as if it's saying that's how Edith felt about her own life. The non-chronological story flow ordering just made it even darker as it forces the audience to rethink of past scenes and make connections on their own. Yet I find this kind of ordering, met with good editing, proved to be great factor in setting in the story build-up for the ending. The acting overall is just a great work by Marion Cotillard. She went very much total in her role here, that kind of made her other roles pales in comparison.",7,0,0,16 October 2015
Before Sunrise," One of the best romance movies I've seen so far
","The story rolls out the big coincidence thing at the very beginning to develop into something cute. The togetherness depicted in the movie is maybe representative of the kind that many people crave. The kind that is less or even free of having to bind together into a commitment. I like the thing about this movie that the very attraction of the romance depicted in this movie is the conversations, of how thoughtful they are. They don't have to be all in agreement all the time, but they can be resolved in recognition of the different perspectives if thinking. I like how Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted out here. They seem to connect nicely. Their performance can depict the needed amount of connection considering the sheer coincidence and serendipity involved in the togetherness.",8,3,4,6 August 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Almost comedic in some ways
","The story is a classic example of how a Hollywood script can be so pretentious. There's too many instances where the script completely disregard real human nature and proposes and promotes sheer carelessness and egotistical indulgence over clear thinking. Yet, as I play along and continue watching, I find the movie to be more and more comedic. It's especially so since the story becomes more and more predictable as the movie goes on. Yet the almost hypocritical presentation of the story developments did crack some laughs and made the movie funny for me. The bad thing is that the filmmakers really didn't pay any attention to the more natural story development and just went away with their own somewhat perverted imaginations. The acting overall feels like a standard romance movie job. Scarlett Johansson did just enough to portray her insecure character and Rebecca Hall did enough in portraying her character's deep anxiety. Javier Bardem did better in his action roles than this kind of character.",6,1,2,6 August 2015
The Deer Hunter," Very high contrast of pre- and post-war lives
","The movie is indeed a great work, portraying the contrast of pre-war and post-war lives of the characters. The movie took the long way in planting the pre-war lives into the audiences' minds, that the contrast in the post-war only need a few sequences to make. The war scenes are also greatly done. This feels somewhat special since the movie doesn't depict much on the war side. Yet the movie succeeded in exploiting the more dangerous side of war, the psychological side of it. The whole psychological game of the Russian roulette gets to be the nice metaphor, getting repeated several times along the movie. The acting overall is just great. Robert DeNiro did great in applying the the right level of his role's emotions. Christopher Walken balanced DeNiro's work perfectly, pulling the audience into the their characters' relationship. Meryl Streep did well in putting live in the state-side sequences.",7,0,1,30 November 2015
Lucy," From limitless to transcendence, in so short ride
","The movie focus on Lucy, a simple girl tricked by a friend into being a drug trafficker forcefully by storing a big bag of experimental drug in her abdominal cavity through surgical process. On the drop point, Lucy refuses to be molested by her captors thus one of them kicks violently, particularly to her stomach. The bag in her break open and the drug is then absorbed. It runs out that it's a special drug that increases the usage of brain capacity of the normal 10%. Waking up, Lucy easily frees herself and gets revenge to the drug trafficker boss without killing him. As her brain usage increases steadily, she then devise another purpose of contacting a Professor Noraan about what she's been through, and at the same time getting her hands on the other three packets of drug en route to Europe. She does both of that at the same time, raising awe of Professor Norman and his colleagues. But at the same time, the drug boss has not given in and the drug mob assaults the university where Lucy meets the professors. While the police accompanying Lucy have a shoot out with the mob, Lucy steadily nears 100% of her brain usage. The drug boss slips his way to the room where Lucy and the professors are. He shoots her in the head but it turns out that Lucy has already 'dispersed'. The detective arrived and killed the drug boss, but as he wondered where Lucy is, his phone rings with a message replying to his question.The story is somewhat epic if we look at the scope that it encompasses. In short and implicitly, it kind of suggests that alternative explanation on the biblical account of humans are created in God's image. It kind of suggest that as we are in God's image, we have what God really has, that is as we have brains ourselves, so do God. Yet unlike God, we don't use our brains to the full capacity. SO if with just 10% brain usage humans can create huge civilizations like what we have now, the thing we can achieve at 100% usage is explained by Prof. Norman: 'I have no idea'.The thing is, this movie puts such heavy concepts in a such relatively short duration of a movie. Thus it makes the flow kind of overly hasty and feels rather rushed. Moreover the initial flow buildup and main character introduction took too long. The transition from the drug induced brain optimization, much like the concept in Limitless (2011), to a concept of controlling pretty much everything, much like the one in Transcendence (2014), feels rather too drastic for such a short duration. Thus the transition will feel weird and stupid for some people. That will in turn downplay the sci-fi appeal of this movie.The action is quite nice. And by having Scarlett Johansson, the level of action is apparently no surprise to her. It's nice to see an international cast of seasoned actors. Here Morgan Freeman has his third back to back sci-fi movie role. Choi Min Sik doesn't lose his edge f calm and sudden bursts. And Amr Waked looks great as a European after all those Middle Eastern roles.My verdict for Lucy (2014) is, although it offers an interesting concept and entertaining action, is that the movie will get only a 6 out of 10 score. It's because of the rushed pace and short duration of a big concept.",6,1,8,29 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," great start for a new trilogy
","The movie starts with the traditional scrolling marquee, narrating that First Order had risen in place of the Empire and Luke Skywalker is missing. Leia's best Resistance pilot meets Lor San Tekka to retrieve a map to Luke. The first Order lead by Kylo Ren storms through the planet Jakku to intercept him. They succeed, capturing the pilot and killing San Tekka. But the pilot put the map chip into his droid BB-8 which escaped. Meanwhile one of the Order's stormtrooper feels guilty of his actions. The droid find it's way to a scavenger. The guilty stormtrooper breaks the pilot free. The pilot introduces himself as Poe Dameron and he names the stormtrooper Finn. But their escape fighter gets shot down and they're separated as each survives the crash. Finn wears Poe's jacket and finds his way to the scavenger. They escape First Order pursuing the droid by stealing a ship, which happens to be the Millennium Falcon. But the Falcon gets pulled into a freighter and Han Solo and Chewbacca finds them. They fend off a two pronged attack by the Kanjiklub and Guavian Death Gang. Once safe they exchange stories, and Han Solo decides to help them and brings them to Maz Kanata. Meanwhile Kylo is tasked by Supreme Leader Snoke to get the map. The patron's at Kanata's bar alerts both First Order and the Resistance about the droid's presence. Finn asks Rey to follow him to flee. But Rey instead follows a calling she hears and finds Luke's lightsaber. The First Order alerts Kylo about Rey and he manages to capture her. The Resistance storms in and pushes the Order away. They retreat without the droid since Kylo thins Rey is enough due to her already saw the map piece. The Resistance meets up as The Order fires its massive weapon The Starkiller, destroying The Republic sanctum at multiple planets at once. But Rey manages to defy Kylo's mind probing. She even manages to Jedi mind- tricked a stormtrooper into releasing her. Leia asks Han to bring Kylo, who turns out to be their son, home. Finn, Han and Chewbacca sneak into the Starkiller planet to seeking Rey. They find her, and as they rig explosives, Han confronts Ben, Kylo 's birth name. But the son kills Han. Chewie shoots Kylo but he manages to chase Finn and Rey. Finn uses Luke's lightsaber against Kylo but he fails to defeat him. Rey takes it and manages to slash Kylo's face, but the same time Poe's fighters and the explosives manages to destabilize the weapon planet, creating a gorge separating Kylo and Rey. After Rey comes to the Resistance base, R2-D2 comes back from his power saving mode and completes BB-8's map to Luke. Rey finds him and brings him his lightsaber.The movie indeed feels epic at all levels. You name it; nostalgia for older generations of the first and second trilogies, continuance of the old saga, the flood of cameos, and for Indonesians especially; The Raid trio pulling up small roles. The story is nicely played, able to satisfy the saga's fans while also heavily leaving an assortment of curious questions for the next movie. This makes the movie feels somewhat lacking due to it incites more curiosity than it quenches.It's quite a different approach that Episode VII has to face, providing a continuation story arc after thirty years of the iconic trilogy followed by a controversial prequel trilogy. Anticipating the prequels, die-hard fans had already known how the story would eventually end. This time they get more curious as the movie throws in a heap of new materials, still with the classic signature of the story elements being intricately weaved. Those inter-weaving of story elements are clearly designed to be completed at the end of the trilogy as there are only questions so far.The new characters are at least able to balance the legendary icons here. The story nicely incorporate them and let's the icons have a grand gesture before they fade in the story to give room for the new generation. The twists and turns feels somewhat less strong, only Han Solo's death becoming the real kicker. All the rest feels like they are in the movie just as snippets of reference from the old movies.The CGI looks great, adding great depths to the more mysterious story elements such as Kylo's saber glowing wavy, Snoke, and especially the Starkiller base. The CGI helped greatly to make the weapon look cool, although it's essentially only the Death Star getting significantly magnified. The creatures also look great. I had the thought that maybe Maz Kanata is of the same species as Yoda, only with different skin color. After all, nobody knows what Yoda's species should look like.The acting feels nice in overall. John Boyega did well enough to divert the audience's attention from the absurd background of his character. Daisy Ridley did great in playing as the awakening Jedi while still keeping Rey's mystery for the next movie. Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and even Peter Mayhew did well in their characters. All the small roles and cameos also adds to enjoying this movie.I score Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) a solid 8 out of 10 score, and a definite recommendation to go and see it in the movies.",8,6,25,22 December 2015
Unbroken," Inspiring survival story indeed
","The movie tells the story of Louie Zamperini, US Olympics track athlete, and his ordeal as a soldier in World War II. The movie starts with his job as an Air Force bombardier on a bomber crew with Phil and Cup, and a bombing mission that really damages their plane. It goes back and forth to flash backs about his childhood as the son of an Italian immigrant family, his introduction and advances in track running, and his first run in the Olympics. The crew gets another mission and replacement men for their fallen comrades, but no new plane. En route, the plane's engines fail and they dive into the ocean. Only three made it out alive from the crash; Louis, Phil and Mac; and they are stranded on the ocean for almost fifty days. They spot two planes flying over them, the first didn't see them while the second is a Japanese that shot at them. When rations thin out, they try to eat everything to survive from raw fish, seagull, to sharks. Then their salvation comes, but it's also a bad news since it's the Japanese, who then puts the into a POW camp in mainland Japan.The commander of the camp is known as The Bird by the prisoners for he doesn't like the name they call him. The Bird is an erratic behaving corporal who grew up a rich kid and aspiring to be an officer but gets denied by the Japanese military and instead gets stuck in POW camps. He somehow taken a special interest in Louis making him a frequent target of his his does of cruel abuses, especially after he knows that Louis was an Olympic athlete. The Bird gets Louie to run against a Japanese, who wins easily due to Louie getting fatigued and malnourished along his time as a prisoner. The Japanese asked Louis to speak on a radio program, declaring he's alive and treated well by the Japanese. But he denies the second request to do so again as he's requested to say that he is betraying his country to live in Japan. He gets returned to the camp where The Bird makes the other prisoners punch his face once per person. After that, The Bird personally says to Louis that he sees Louis as a strong man just like he is and he respects that by considering Louis as a friend. One time, The Bird personally comes to tell Louis that he is getting transferred to run another camp and asks Louis to congratulate him, but Louis keeps silent. But the Allies bombs the nearby city so the prisoners get transferred to another camp, which turns out to be a coal mine run by The Bird. The coal mine is located at steep hills so the prisoners have to climb up and down through many flights of stairs. Fatigue and stress weakens many of them that some even fall from the railings as they climb. One day The Bird demands Louis to lift a wooden beam and orders guards to shoot him if he drops it. He lifts it for a long time until The Bird himself gets annoyed by it and beats him severely. Finally the war ends and Louis gets flown home and reunites with his family.The movie depicts a great true story of a man's survival. I'm quite amazed at this movie because it nicely depicts two survival events in one movie. For me it's like seeing a WWII multi person version of Robert Redford's All Is Lost and a movie like Empire of the Sun, back to back and with the same protagonist. The movie eve complete it's biographical aim with the nice flash backs of Louis' childhood and his track times. The initial sequence of the aerial bombing and subsequent airplane battle is really a good way to start this drama.The part of the survival at sea is quite realistic as Angelina Jolie nicely directs this part to encompass many aspects of the condition of the sea. We get to see day and night, calm and storm, and also hope and disappointment when the planes fly over the men. One thing that for me feels like it's the least of the possibilities is when the seagull just comfortably lands on the raft. For an instance I laughed at this, and then thought that it might have come to the time when illusions start to take the men's minds away. The prison camp part is also very nice. It's indeed a nice depiction of how brutal the Japanese can be on the war that I read in an article that some Japanese people actually protested at this film over those brutality depictions. Well, I find the protest really weird since they let it pass just okay with Colin Firth's The Railway Man which also depicts cruel things done by Japanese soldiers in the war.The acting overall is a great work. It sees Jack O'Connell once again performed very well in portraying the various emotions and needed expressions, although I think that he has to work more on his American accent. Having Domnhall Gleeson also really helps in dramatizing the survival at sea part. It quite strange for me that Jai Courtney only takes a very insignificant part in this movie. Takamasa Ishihara has done very well in embodying the perfect antagonist for this movie. I'm quite sure we'll be seeing more of his acting in coming future.Unbroken (2014) deserves a strong 7 out of 10 score from me, and a definite recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. A great entertainment depicting an inspiring true story of survival and steadfastness is surely a worthy watch at the movies.",7,3,6,12 January 2015
Rear Window," A great classic of mystery crime movies
","I love how the movie scaled up the simple initial concept of peeking at one's neighbors into a great detective movie. The detective movie aura presented isn't one with rich and intriguing details, rather it's one with so many parts built of hunches and intuition, yet it proves to be a classic after all. I like how the movie played with the mood, downplaying and emphasizing back and forth both the mood and the pace. After watching North by Northwest, Psycho, and Rear Window, in that order, I now have a greater regard toward how Alfred Hitchcock handles his movies' concepts, plots, and the general direction. James Stewart performed better in other movies, in my opinion. But I like how Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter acted out. A bit overacted at the dialog accent, as is the common doing in movie of that age, but the overall facial expressions and body language suits the scenes quite perfectly.",7,0,1,17 August 2014
The Truman Show," One of the movies that really raises questions about one's own life
","The story is indeed a great example of a thought demanding tale. Even for now, the story still stands as one of the greatest, especially for me. What's lacking about the movie is that even though it runs at about two ours, it doesn't really elaborate much on Truman's unsuspecting life. The movie immediately sets its conflicts and Truman's suspicions as soon as Truman's character is introduced. Nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and robotics-moved cameras to give the actual spy- cam feel. The acting overall feels also nice. Jim Carrey's acting feels suiting to Truman's character and the changes he goes through.Laura Linney did her part well enough, maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time. Noah Emmerich did also well by providing the balance needed for Truman's dialogs. Natascha McElhone and Ed Harris did nice in completing the needed angles this movie requires.",8,0,0,27 July 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Nice sequel
","The story continues from the first movie. Having won the 74th annual Hunger Games with Peeta Mallark, Katniss Everdeen is seen by the elements of revolutionaries as the symbol of hope for an uprising. But President Snow has anticipated this, and tries to eliminate her through forced natural and inevitable means by plunging her into the 75th Hunger Games.The flick starts with Katniss in the woods, kind of repetitive. President Snow threatens Katniss, warning not to have any thoughts of a revolution. The victors are then tasked to visit the other Districts starting from District 11, home of Rue, Katniss' real and loyal ally in the first movie. Peeta and Katniss are given speech cards, which they emotionally cast aside. Katniss' speech, mentioning she knew Rue, especially encouraged some folks of District 11. The whistling of the four-note mockingjay call, plus the hand gesture, now makes one an instant revolutionary. And in the presence of the Peacekeepers, that person gets apprehended and executed publicly on site. It's a great change considering at the end of the first movie we see many people did that publicly and in the presence of the Peacekeepers, and nothing happened.Back home to District 12, Katniss defends Gale from lashing. Peeta and Haymitch, their 'mentor', step in to calm the Peacekeeper commander down from executing the Capitol's darling victor Katniss. They succeeded, but the scene was televised nation wide, and becomes extra fuel for the revolutionaries to start local riots. Snow then alters the rules of the 75th Hunger Games to force Katniss into it, considering the loop that she is the only female winner from District 12. It's just typical of bad guy kingpins, Snow alters rules on the last minute, right before the 'reaping' of the tributes.Doing the showcase tradition on the eve before the games, Katniss, the 'girl on fire', again does her signature turns, this time making her dresses burns entirely, only to change appearance into a mockingjay dress. The mockingjay dress looks awesome story-wise, but looks ridiculously stupid in reality. Fortunately the angle turns into a head shot when Katniss says 'like a mockingjay' LOL. Anyway, the dress gets the stylist to be beaten up by Peacekeepers in front of Katniss, just right as the start of the Games.On the games, Katniss and Peeta team up in alliance with Finnick and Mags from District 4. later in the night Mags gives her life on a poison fog so Finnick can carry the injured Peeta. Katniss has seen the fog mover closer in a fast pace but fails to determine in time that it was dangerous. This is odd, a survival expert of a Katniss doesn't seem to ever see a fog in her entire life. no natural fog move that fast, girl LOL :DMoving over on the Games, it looks like things are getting better for Katniss' alliance considering that the surviving tributes out of the alliance are only those two from District 2. Still, Katniss is uneasy at all others besides Peeta.At the midnight prior to the lightning strikes, Johanna knocks Katniss down but she doesn't kill her. Instead she makes a little cut in Katniss' arm while making a distraction so the District 2 tributes wouldn't bother Katniss. Experienced movie-goers should have guessed it right here. Yes Katniss have uneasy feelings on others besides Peeta. Yes Johanna was being a prick with her stunt in the elevator the other day. But why doesn't Johanna kill her right then then and there? She even hushed Katniss from moaning her pain so not to alert the District 2 tributes.Still katniss' uneasiness lingers on after she comes to. Katniss almost kill Finnick while he can't see her. But Finnick say the right words, a quote from Haymitch, proving that Finnick did not obtain the bangle through a foul way.On the lightning strikes, Katniss redirects on of them to the force field dome, destroying the arena, making a hole big enough for a transport plane get in and grab her unconscious body out. She wakes up and finds Finnick Haymitch, and Owen Davian.... no, wait, sorry, it's not MI:3 LOL, the head game maker, who was really secretly a revolutionary too.The main characters are developed well, but not so for the supporting characters. The other tributes are vaguely clear on their roles in the Games, especially when we compare them to the ones in the first flick.The Games itself are also somewhat unable to perform its emphasis of being the third Quarter Quell, considering it is very short-lived, only two days and not as much filled with action as the previous movie.The setting is not so supportive to the Games considering that there is only one open area, the main spot of the cornucopia.But then again this second installment is good in overall. Katniss gets to show action with her bow in the holographic training room. This balance the lack of action before the Games in the first movie.The scene of Katniss and Peeta talking in the lounge on the back of the train is a great use of setting and property, considering the angle of the shot depicting the moving train's movement at the rear.The costumes are overall well designed. Although I think the main Games outfit of tight suits are just ridiculous. Yet the other costumes are great, fitting the scenes. One thing to mention, the Peacekeeper costumes have nice detailing on the armor padding.Despite it's certain shortcomings, this is a good movie to watch, whether you've watch the first movie or not, or whether you've read the books or not. For me, I give the film an 8 out of 10 score.",7,0,11,10 July 2014
Godzilla," A good movie, but it should work more on the monster department.
","The story follows the Bordy family. Joe Brody lost his wife in a radiation accident in a nuclear plant in Japan. Years later his son Ford, an army bomb specialist, joins him in Japan to uncover the truth about that accident. It's revealed that a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that eats out radiation caused that accident and cocooned there the past years. Now the MUTO then spring out of its cocoon causing another accident wounding Joe. The researcher Serizawa brings Joe and Ford to get more data. Joe doesn't survive and Ford goes to Hawaii to head home to San Francisco. The MUTO snapped a Russian submarine and placed it there. Godzilla emerged to fight the MUTO but it escaped. The monsters are no more secrets.The MUTO is tracked to be going to US soil. Serizawa informs the army there is another MUTO in Nevada, that turns out to be the female. The female MUTO then springs out of its dormancy, obliterating Las Vegas. The army goes with a plan of luring the MUTOs and Godzilla with nuclear bombs. The plan botched because the female MUTO chomped on the train carrying them and snacked on one bomb. Ford and the other bomb is scooped by the army. The army then sets up the remaining bomb time to lure the monsters somewhere near the SF coast. But the MUTO again snapped it and bring it to their nest, in downtown SF. Godzilla emerges right beside Golden Gate being and the soldiers attacked it. The bridge is damaged because of the incident. Soon the two MUTOs have a showdown with Godzilla. The army sends a team HALO jumping to disarm or move them bomb away from people.Ford and the team finds the nest. Seeing the eggs they rigged to blow the nest. The explosion panicked the female MUTO, giving a second take for the losing Godzilla, that eventually kills the MUTOs. Gdzilla then drops down as if its dead, but as the day breaks, it awakens and heads back to the ocean.The base story is better from the last Godzilla adaptation back in 1998. The quite complex story forces the pace to be more of a jog than a walk on the earlier parts. Unfortunately there is no pace variation and the ending doesn't fell as epic as it should.There's much controversy about the movie's overall quality. Many comment on Godzilla's new look. I personally agree to the unsatisfied comments. Godzilla looks strange, if not stupid, in this movie. The character design gives back Godzilla's more original shaping from the Japanese origin with a much bigger posture. Guess it's not only currencies that get inflated.The fact that some scenes show the iconic monster from not so alluring angles just do worse to the look. The leg shot, now that Godzilla has pretty much scaly elephant legs, is just awful. The bridge scene looks like Godzilla clumsily tangled it's hand onto the cables.Godzilla's foes the MUTOs are well planned and executed. The design doesn't stray much from the original monsters but not specifically too Japanese. On the early promotions, some media even mistakenly wrote the MUTO as Mutou, presuming them as some Japanese monster name.Unfortunately the monster fight scenes are stupid, if not suck. The daytime face-off is all too same to other monsters or mecha battle scenes with airborne entities. One flying foe will go and perch on one building, obliterating some parts of it, and taunts. There is not new thing offered here.The real monster fight is just stupid because it's done in night time. It's just like the movie's crew didn't even try to give a better fight scene on daytime. Also the fights are not well documented because there is insufficient environmental lighting to cover the fight like for example in Pacific Rim (2013).The acting is overall a so-so. Bryan Cranston acts well although sometimes he gets a bit overacting. Elizabeth Olsen doesn't really shine compared to her last take on Oldboy (2013). Juliette Binoche did quite a good job playing her so-so role while Ken Watanabe doesn't really shine due to his role that is not so much challengingOn the other hand Aaron Taylor Johnson did a great adaptation since his last Kick-Ass role. Besides managing to get his body buffed up well, he also manages to land a safe performance on his role, although in my opinion he must use his facial expressions better.For me, The movie is indeed a recommendable watch. But for the score, it's a 6 out of 10 from me, due to the critical disappointments on the monster department.",6,1,4,20 May 2014
Casino," A distinct Scorcese tasteful movie
","The story feels very engaging. How Martin Scorcese tells it makes the audience leave the movie screening feeling enlightened. I really like how the movie used so many narrations as a supporting way to help the scenes build up. Add that with the clever and dramatic visuals using camera trickery, you get the astonishing look at the crime scenes. Particularly, the scene where the con artist gets his hand smashed is really neatly done.It's actually simple trick using camera angle and mock props, but the movie used it in a sudden way that is guaranteed to pull your eyes to the screen. The acting work is also great. Robert DeNiro nicely depicts the cooler mafia while Joe Pesci repeats himself as the great actor of the ruthless kind of the mafia. Sharon Stone did well in balancing both men.",7,2,2,31 October 2015
Heat," A nicely stretched but complete story
","At first seeing the almost three hour duration, I thought this movie would take it all up to mostly unnecessary scenes. Yet the story nicely fills all the void that I now understand why Michael Mann took that long for this movie. All the characters, the many of the significant ones, get enough coverage that none of them feels like just a cardboard cut-out. All the interactions feel natural and the criminal craft looks pretty much true to reality. The action looks great; it gets very much suspenseful and also went to a grandiose level few movies nowadays would go to. One thing made the action scenes seem stupid is the perception of how many bullets can an assault rifle carry. With the rate of how the robbers shoot their rifles in full-auto mode, they should be changing magazines more often. The acting is a great job in overall. both Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro did remarkably stunning work, and their face off scenes are the best of this movie. Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo and Tom Sizemore did great also in filling for the story angles.",7,1,2,29 October 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Entertaining, even with some dry humour
","The movie tells the daily lifeerrunlife of flatmate vampires Viago, Vladislav, Deacon and Petyr in New Zealand. Viago is the 16th century vampire, aristocratic and bossy often times. Vladislav is the medieval vampire, a noble vampire but also the most ruthless killer of them. Deacon is the youngest changed vampire from the World War II era, often acting out living like a bum in the flat. The last of them, Petyr, is the oldest of them, aging about 8000 years old. They live their everyday lives n the flat, still influenced by the cultures from their own times. The trio Viago, Vladislav and Deacon sometimes go out to the town and hang out. Deacon has a human familiar Jackie who does most of the blood cleaning related housework in the flat. She also lure in victims for the vampires. Deacon has promised vampirehood to Jackie but hasn't turned her yet. One night Jackie brings a couple Nick and Josephine as victims. Nick gets his blood drained by Petyr but he also turns him into a vampire. And then there were four. Nick brings in new cultural color to the group. Soon He brings his friend Stu, an IT guy, to the group. Stu introduces the modern information technology to the group and becomes a good friend to them. For this, and because he's Nick's best friend, the group form a pact not to eat Stu. Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood. He has been carelessly telling just about anybody that he's a vampire, even showing some of his abilities to complete human strangers. One day, a vampire hunter comes to the flat's basement, Petyr's lair. Petyr easily kills the hunter but he dies of sunlight. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. Alas, the night for the Unholy Masquerade comes. The masquerade is the once a year night where New Zealand's undead community comes and mingles together. Vladislav doesn't go for knowing his nemesis is the event's guest of honor. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick. They also bring Stu there, still human. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human and they get eager to eat him. The group manages to get Stu out safely but on their way home they meet their nemesis werewolf pack who are transforming since it's a full moon night. They eventually attack Stu and mangle his body. But it turns out that the attack turns Stu into a werewolf and that make the vampires and the werewolfs to be friends.The story is quite nice in overall. Focusing on the age old human fascination about the pseudo-immortal undead of vampires, the movie presents a very light mood about what used to be a strictly horror plot base. It nicely imagines the daily, or should I say nightly, consequences of a vampire's life of staying alive in the modern world. This is done by incorporating contemporary culture and customs such as flat sharing, hang outs, and the social internet critically into the story as plot defining elements, even though weaker ones.But the story also did justice to connect older vampire movies and the general myths about vampires by staying true to the main attributes of the vampires. Minus the garlic thing, this movie incorporates plot defining myths about the vampiric abilities, blood drinking, 'let me in' catch, silver, and the crucifix effect. What's good is that the movie doesn't add any more imbalanced super powers to the vampires. No offense to all of you Twilight Saga fanatics, but for me a vampire based story is already maximum without having to have superhero powers. When I see vampire movies, I really want to see vampires, not blood sucking X-Men wannabes. For that, I think that this movie, and Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), are great example of vampire movies that aren't predominantly horror but still also have the frightening side of vampires.Though they often feel dry, the humor nicely incorporates the vampire myths into it. I kind of like how they put in the silver, the 'let me in' catch and the hypnosis into the story. A funny surprise even comes in a post-credits scene for this. Yet again I feel that although most of the jokes are interesting, they don't really crack big laughs from me.For me the acting overall is not very good. I see a lot of overacting here and there by the three main characters, and 'under-acting' by the rest of the cast. But then again, I think that this movie's real interesting point is not the acting or the comedy, but instead the story and how the story mixes everyday modern life with the vampire condition.For me What We do In the Shadows (2014) feels like it deserves a humble 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's mild and very entertaining. After the wave of Twilight Saga, I think this movie can put back the older vampire myths into the general understanding consensus.",7,0,3,4 February 2015
Deadpool," R rated fun and all
","Never mind all the fuss about the movie being unsuitable for kids. Parents would be very stupid if they generalize all movies with costumed characters in them as movies suitable for kids. Deadpool finally received justice in treatment for a movie. This movie kept it staying true to the character's whole aspects; the fourth wall breaking, the smart mouth, the crazy comedies, and all the nicely flowed action. Though it seems that the studio put some distance to the wider X-Men franchise by only showing the group's name and references without any cameo from the previous movies, Deadpool in itself has already been a great fun.",7,5,15,9 April 2016
The Replacements," It's interesting because it's a comedy without real comedians at the lead role
","The story is pretty much the same as many other sports comedy movies, which are about the long shot at beating the overwhelming odds and pressure while at the same time uniting a very differentiated team. The romance angle is nicely put just as the sweetener and didn't go influencing the bigger story so much, despite the usual victory kiss. What makes this movie very interesting for me is that Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, and even Brooke Langton are not necessarily comedians, though they play the lead and significant roles in this movie. The backing by the seasoned comedy actors like Orlando Jones nicely completes the comedic angle that the movie needs.",6,1,3,13 March 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great spy movie, cool action and funny comedy in one
","17 years after the sacrifice of his friend Lee and welcoming Lancelot into the secret spy organization Kingsman, Galahad/Harry finds Lancelot killed in a solo rescue attempt, and Lee's son Eggsy arrested. Harry then have a chat with Eggsy where he dismisses the thugs who had a quarrel with Eggsy. Soon Eggsy comes to the tailor shop, which has the secret entrance to the Kingsman HQ. Harry offers to recruit him and Eggsy accepts. In boot camp Eggsy quickly gains a friend in Roxy, and an enemy in Charlie. Meanwhile, Harry investigates on leads from Lancelot's death and gets thrown into a coma by an explosion. At night Eggsy and the other recruits find their room full with water. Roxy finds a way to get air, while Eggsy breaks the two-way mirror to their rescue. Eggsy visits the recovered Harry and they learn that the leads all lead to Valentine, who's sharing free SIM cards.Harry visits Valentine under guise and finds only information about a hate group in Kentucky. Eggsy and the recruits are tested to parachute with one of them having no chute. Only Eggsy, Roxy and Charlie passes this stage. Eggsy meets Harry back in the tailor shop and to their surprise Valentine is also there trying a suit. The three youngsters have another test to sweet talk a girl. But actually it's a test to endure interrogation, in which Charlie fails. The final test has Eggsy and Roxy to shoot their pet dogs, in which Eggsy fails, thus Roxy becomes the new Lancelot. Harry dragged the angry Eggst and revealed that the bullet for the dog is a blank. Harry goes to Kentucky to investigate. But Valentine activates a signal through his shared free SIM cards, which makes everyone kills each other, from which Harry is the only survivor. But Valentine waits for him at the exit and kills him. Eggsy meets Arthur about Harry, but he learns that Arthur had gained a scar like the professor Valentine kidnapped. Thus Eggsy evaded Arthur's murder attempt by switching his drinks. Eggsy meets Merlin and Roxy to stop Valentine. Roxy wears a special suit to go into orbit and take out a satellite to inhibit the signal while Eggsy and Merlin goes to Valentine's base. Eggsy manages to sneak in and help Merlin hack Valentine's signal. Eggsy goes back to Merlin as Roxy nails her target. But Valentine gets another satellite and uses his biometric security, preventing any hacks as long as his hand is on the scanner. Eggsy arrives and fights Valentine's hench-woman Gazelle, and finally throws one of Gazelle's bladed prosthetic leg to Valentine.The story is very nice. It's reminiscent of oldies Bond movies yet it's even more. At first I thought the movie's edge is the combination of the comedy into it. But after I see it, the movie very much like a great nostalgia as it also looks very lively to the younger generations. The elements paying homage to old Bond, and spy movies in general is a great thing to refresh the spy movie sub genre. spy movies get to be varied now; as some rely on the sly gadgetry like Bond movies, while other focus on the intrigues like Spy Game, action like Bourne movies. Or even humor like Austin Power movies. But this movie definitely states that a spy movie can have all of that and still be great without losing focus.The action is very nice. You get to see classy action and fighting, using the classic spy gadgets like the poison-bladed shoe, lighter grenade and bulletproof umbrella. Don't expect to see efficient fight moves like the ones in Bourne movies. The fight moves are flamboyant with flips, somersaults, and also has a Kill Bill feel to it with close up blood and gore.The comedy is also very nice. Overall they are funny and well paced. They even get to be very funny at some spots. I couldn't stop laughing at the scene where Eggsy takes JB for a walk. Matthew Vaughn really used his Snatch and Lock Stock experiences to a good way in making some of the fights, particularly the fights with the local gangsters, look funny at times.The acting is decently good. Having Colin Firth as the focus gentleman spy is a great thing since he has the roots and the face to create the authentic Bristish gentleman aura. He did play as the British king George after all. Taron Egerton didn't disappoint in his performance. Samuel L. Jackson adds a thing to the villain that makes the character easy to remember. Having Michael Caine really adds to the British feel.MY say is that Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score, and a must-see recommendation. Entertainment is guaranteed for me from this movie, and a sequel is a yes for my wish list.",8,4,11,21 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Where is the hangover?
","The movie seems to be a forced third installment in creating the forced trilogy of sorts. While the second movie only changes the location of the entire plot line from the first movie, this third movie tries to innovate with new plot altogether. The move to still incorporate old elements of the story like Chow and even Marshall is quite nice. But the movie ultimately has to gave up it's main concept of the comedy resulted from the friends having a severe hangoer. Literally, the movie loses the thing that gives it its own title, and relied only on the previously built characters and their relationships. For me that played out quite nice, even the thing with the baby is another nice addition. But by doing so this movie really sacrifices on the humor and comedies. The jokes feel rather dry. Even the opening feels like it's meant for a thriller or sorts. The acting is strangely decreasing in overall. This time it's all about Zach Galifianakis' character, but he doesn't seem to be in control of the depiction. Bradley Cooper acted out just a standard performance here, and so did Ed Helms.",5,0,1,3 February 2015
Easy A," Poking out moral value flaws with this comedy
","The story nicely lines itself, and even identifies itself with the book character Hester Prynne as a straight up comparative, which is a very nice touch. It grounds the story to an anchored perspective. It gives nice start and twists to the book's story. The things that happened really exposes how the western, particularly American, youngster moral value has been severely distorted and even reversed. Yet this movie remains very fun entertainment because the comedy is very enjoyable and laughable. Typically this movie is one of those comedies where a lie gets added with more and more lies until it reaches the boiling point and exploded. But the comedy is indeed very entertaining that it set this movie apart. The acting overall is very good. I like knowing that this movie, a comedy, is one the movie that started Emma Stone's acting career. She really built her acting through the hard part of making people laugh then continue to the serious roles.",7,0,0,7 March 2015
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," One of the great classic modern vampire stories
","The story nicely portrays what is it that makes a vampire story good, a desire to keep being human. Surely a story about vampires being vampires, feeding and killing every night, would be one dull and boring story. The movie makes it even better as it stayed true to the more common mythologies by keeping the most of the duration to the night, maintaining the sad and anxious mood, and providing great location settings. What noticeable is that this movie contains much of the mythological inspirations focused in other more recent vampire stories such as the Twilight saga and Let Me In, particularly about the child vampires. The acting overall is indeed great. Brad Pitt nicely depicted the lingering human emotion in a vampire. Tom Cruise succeeded in depicting the annoying vampire that keeps on pushing Louie to his emotional limit. Antonio Banderas and Kristen Dunst adds the movie with strong performances also.",7,1,2,14 March 2015
Minions," Still funny though much of the funniest stuff has already spoiled through trailers
","The movie starts with a narration about the minions, how they have existed since long ago, seeking the most evil entity to serve. The change from master to master due to often it's them who cause their master's demise. One day they find themselves isolated in an ice cavern and thrive as a tribe. But as time passes they lose spirit in living because they don't have a master. A minion Kevin decides to go to the outside world to find a master. He gets Stuart and Bob as his companions. They arrive at New York and after some time wandering around they found a secret villain TV channel that announces the Villain Con in Orlando. Hitching a ride with the Nelsons, who turn out to be villains also, the minions reach Villain Con. There they see Scarlet Overkill, then the world's most notorious villain, who turns out to be seeking for a henchman. Bob accidentally wins the contest to become Scarlet's henchman. The minions follow Scarlet to her castle and Kevin phones his fellow minions to come. She tasks the minions to steal the royal crown from Queen Elizabeth of Britain. With gadgets from Scarlet's husband Herb, the minions succeed in stealing the crown but get caught red handed so they run from capture, until Bob accidentally releases the sword in the stone from the Excalibur legends. Thus Bob is crowned king. Scarlet is infuriated by this and visits the minions. They instead happily give the crown and the kingship to Scarlet. But Scarlet instead sends them to a torture chamber. But somehow the minions can't be killed by the torture equipments and they sneak back into Scarlet's coronation ceremony to apologize. But again their will don't as well as their deeds, as instead the crash an ancient chandelier onto Scarlet's head. Scarlet sends the other villains from Villain Con after the minions. Stuart and Bob get captured. Kevin escapes and stumbles into Herb's secret weapon, which transforms him into a gigantic minion. He saves Stuart and Bob while battling Scarlet, while the rest of the minions arrive. Kevin swallows Scarlet's rocket but prevents her to escape, blowing her up and returning Kevin to his size. Kevin, Stuart and Bob are rewarded by the Queen. But Scarlet returns and steals the crown, only to be stopped by young Gru, who takes the crown and gains the minions as his servants.The story feels like just another children's animation, a group of kids or youngsters going on an adventure to help their community. The thing is, even the most basic concept of the movie is actually a perverted version of a good story for children. In this movie we find the actual purpose of the adventure is to find the most evil entity to serve, which is not the thing one would teach his/her kids.It then becomes obvious of how the movie gains interest through those publicity linking the franchise with the Illuminati. For me it's even funnier since all those signs appeared long before sine Disney animations. The thing is those who link the movie to Illuminati had already been exposed to the subliminal works altogether that it rang a bell in their minds and triggered them to publish. For me the movie is just another entertainment, for readied minds, mind you. I think it's okay to take kids to see the movie, but as soon as they start their school years, parents should really start to teach them to beware of those subliminals.Back to the movie, I really like how the script retains the overall crazy attitude of the minions. All those goofy stuff are really funny indeed, that it will crack your laugh as soon as the movie picks up it's narration. The thing is many of the movie's comedies has been badly spoiled by those many trailers dated from as early as last December. And the funny stuff that's not in the trailers couldn't really top those which are.Well Minions (2015) deserves a meager 7 out of 10 score from me, and a recommendation. A guaranteed laugh throughout is what you'll get throughout this movie. Thus this movie isn't really just for kids as the comedies appeal more to grown ups.",7,8,18,7 July 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," A funny movie but...
","Inside Llewyn Davis So it's basically musical where we see Llewyn Davis, a washed=up folk- singer, struggles to get back to his game in the music industry. The movie starts with Llewyn having an almost literally f^cked up life, and continues on with his struggles over his solo act record, his relationships with others, and a cat.The flow is just freaking hilarious. From a live lounge or café thingy gig to a playback accompanying a day's activities to a trio part with Justin Timberlake to.. 'Shaaoot!' LOL ROTFL.Normall I don't really dig into folk music, I find the music quite boring makes me sleepy. But the music in this movie is just good. It's relaxing and I seem to be able to endure the whole length of them.It's the first I see Justin Timberlake sing something just off his habit like folk-music. Great harmonization on the trio part.John Goodman's part is also hilarious, just won't shut up that old man Turner LOL. The only silence with the old man is only when he's sleeping with his mouth yawning like the gates of hell itself LOL.And one other funny part is when Llewyn found out about the cat's name 'That's his name?' LOLEveb though it makes the movie looks darker than real world, and though it contains some laughs, the film coloration is great, it adds up to the soothing effect from the music.One bad thing of this movie is that it doesn't really teach you about anything, in fact it doesn't really give any ending. I feel that the movie is just meant to be a plain form of an entertainment, without any intention for any moral message whatsoever.I give it a score of 6 out of 10. Though all in all I wouldn't recommend you to go and see on a theater. It'll be a waste of money.",6,1,2,8 February 2014
The Ugly Truth," A suggestion-less suggestive movie
","The movie's main theme is really directly depicted in the suggestive nature of the scenes. The comedy is full blown geared up for mature audiences. I like to compare this movie to Hitch (2005). I think that this is quite the opposite of Hitch, especially on the methods and the conflicts the two movies presented. But The Ugly Truth hits it harder and rougher to those who have the symptoms of serious passionate relationship issue syndrome. This movie's appeal comes from all those suggestive scenes, which also sets it way apart from Hitch. The acting is just another okay overall. Gerard Butler provided the right amount of balancing to Katherine Heigl's lead performance, which is for me not very special. I like how the movie builds just enough of the complimentary characters such as Joy and Colin.",6,0,1,28 August 2014
Gangs of New York," The origins of Daniel Day Lewis' 2007 character play
","The story goes on nicely, starting off quite slow but gradually building momentum by increasing pace. The story flows in a straightforward line; helps the story to tell itself congruently. The location and sets made are nice, so does the properties played and costume designed. What is worth mentioning above all is the acting overall, which is indeed a great job to see. Her we see Leonardo DiCaprio learning to get into character more totally than what he did in his earlier works. And he learned from few of the best here. We see him here acting with Daniel Day Lewis, who is quite an expert in getting into complex characters such as his in this movie. Daniel Day Lewis kept his character up to the great movie There Will Be Blood (2007).

Spectre," Still good in overall but the ties in seem too forced
","The movie continues on from Skyfall. In Mexico City James Bond tails a target. He eavesdrop him talking to another, mentioning The Pale King. Bond shoots him but misses. He chases him all over the plaza, eventually killing him out of a helicopter, retrieving his signet ring. In London Bond's agent status gets suspended, as the Mexico incident blows wide, and MI6 merges with MI5 with MI5's head C in charge. Bond asks Moneypenny to inquire about The Pale King, showing the late M's order to kill Marco Sciarra, which he did in Mexico, and to attend the funeral. Planted tracking blood by Q and stealing Q's car, Bond goes to Sciarra's funeral. He meets Sciarra's wife Lucia, who tells him of her husband's organization meeting at midnight to appoint Sciarra's replacement. Bond goes there and passes the guard easily. But the organization's leader recognizes him. Thus he has to escape the organization's new henchman Hinx in a car chase. Moneypenny reveals The Pale King is the previous movies' Mr. White, now in Austria. Bond locates White and persuades him to reveal the organization's leader in exchange for White's daughter's safety. White points him to his daughter's place then kills himself. Bond finds White's daughter Madeleine Swann. Q intercepts Bond, pleading with him to go back quietly to London. Bond gives Q the ring for analysis. He prevents Hinx from kidnapping Swann and Q avoids capture. After an argument, Swann with Bond meet Q, and she reveals the organization's name SPECTRE. She takes Bond to White's old suite in Tangiers hotel L'Americain. Bond finds a secret room with coordinates of the SPECTRE's leader place. They take a train there, only to find Hinx barging on their dinner. They defeat him with great effort. In London a summit of nine country's heads of intelligence is held to approve Project Nine Eyes system which will converge their intelligence. The vote is halted due to South Africa not agreeing. Soon Cape Town gets an explosion, sending the system to its approval. Arriving at the place, Bond and Swann are taken to a base. The SPECTRE leader reveals his hackers intercepting intelligence and CCTVs; and also plays Bond and White's conversation recording, swaying Swann's heart. Bond gets knocked out and wakes up strapped on a therapy chair. The SPECTRE leader reveals himself as Bond's stepbrother Franz. He adds that Franz died years ago with his parents, and he's now Ernst Blofeld. As he increases torture to Bond, Swann approaches Bond and he gives her his watch. It activates a bomb, creating an opening fro Bond and Swann to escape. Back in London M, Q and Moneypenny finds a safe house where Bond and Madeleine are waiting. Bond goes with them to stop the system's countdown to operational while Madeleine parts from them. On the road Bond gets kidnapped while M escapes. Bond gets taken to the old MI6 building scheduled for demolition, while M orders Q to hack the system to disable it before it operates. Bond escapes, eventually finding Blofeld behind a thick glass, who gives arms a time bomb with Madeleine in the building. Bond finally saves Madeleine and escapes the blast. They chase Blofeld's helicopter and Bond shoots it down. Bond refuses to kill Blofeld and M arrests him. Next Bond says goodbye to Q as he quits MI6.The movie in overall is good. It meets the anticipation people may have from the heavy promotion. The story may impress moviegoers who watch this as a single movie. But if you are a Bond fan, or at least like me had seen the previous Daniel Craig Bonds and remember the critical plots, you'll find that the story culmination as indeed forced too much.First there's the SPECTRE. While its presence is hinted well in Casino Royale and also Quantum of Solace's beginning stage, Skyfall didn't give any SPECTRE's hints. Thus this movie's naming Skyfall's Silva as a SPECTRE agent feels weird. Furthermore, Quantum of Solace had already has its own evil organization Quantum. It gets weird as Blofeld admits Greene worked for him. Then what about Quantum? What's its difference from SPECTRE that the franchise had to have it instead of focusing it all on SPECTRE?The stepbrother issue is quite interesting at first. But as Skyfall didn't hint this at all; where there are already many scenes inside Skyfall house, the appearance of the burnt photo feels too forced. Furthermore, Blofeld appears after the movie's midpoint, add with his contrast mood swing, didn't really help to create an intimidating villain, despite Christoph Waltz good acting.I quite like the movie's approach in minimizing Bond's dependence on his spy gadgets and instead focusing more on his skills. The opening uncut sequence, which gives a nod to last year's Birdman, looks very good. Yet I think this movie seriously lack the usual Bond action dose as there's more vehicle chase sequences than actual fighting. The train fighting with Hinx looks great, although I still think Casino Royale's stairs fighting and Skyfall's train fight are better.The acting overall doesn't disappoint. Daniel Craig deserves to be named the best James Bond so far. Lea Seydoux did enough, although I think she still has to work on her expressions. Christoph Waltz did well, as usual, in portraying the bad guy. His Blofeld is quite good considering his little screen time. Monica Belluci proves that even in her fifties she still deserves to be a Bond girl. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw, here with increased screen time, really give the movie the more elaboration on their characters' relationship with Bond.My say is that SPECTRE (2015) deserves a score of 7 out of 10. A recommendation still is a yes. Although it's a good movie, for me it still doesn't rival Skyfall, especially as it failed in linking its story to the previous movies, instead forcing its logic into the franchise.",7,2,6,11 November 2015
Her," Nice movie of relationship concepts
","In a future world, one in which an Operating System can bridge all equipments, the main character, Theodore Twombly, is just about a year living by himself after a marriage separation. Working on a job which he loved so much, writing customized letters, He fell in and out of relationships. One day Theo came across a new Operating System, OS1, which is essentially an AI butler but with highly advanced adaptive intelligence which enables it to learn and somewhat be human.The relationship of Theo and Samantha, the persona of his personalized OS1, is then evolved into a romantic one, which is becoming a growing trend amongst the AI OS users. Yet, being a person without any physical manifestation, Samantha and Theo's relationship soon meet it's inevitable and quirky dramatic consequences.At first the concept gives me the 'cool' response because I pictured it as some cross over between the ideas of how intelligent and functionally helpful Jarvis AI can be in Iron Man movies, and the eventuality of Ais learning and developing their own independent emotions like what the Kara android from the Heavy Rain game's developer's trailer did.But then my response turns into getting creep ed a bit because of the reality of the current world. Even without any AI, many people, males especially are going literally socially acceptably insane by marrying inanimate objects for real. I read a news article some 2 years ago about a Japanese male marrying a game character How messed up is that?And then my response was getting laughs because the story just brings pure imagination that is to my point of view hilariously funny, especially the parts that picture Theo and Samantha's relationship's consequences, like the part when Samantha hired a surrogate sexual partner, which then grows into Samantha and Theo fighting. I don't if these scenes aren't meant to be funny, but for me my mind comes back to the basic idea that Theo is arguing with his computer.Sure the whole concept of having a relationship with an AI partner is not really an original one. If we really delve into it, the relationship between Planton and Karen, his ECG monitor manifested computer AI, in Nickleodeon's Spongebob Squarepants was the first to ever incorporate this concept. But Her brought the concept into a more realistic enactment.And yes, Her's realization of the concept isn't really taking into account the developments in the real world. Such developments may include improvements in the robotic sectors and the sure demand of live- sized dolls. I see that those developments are intentionally omitted from Her's world to emphasize the point of Samantha not being able to have a physical manifestation, a body.The use of music to illustrate the moods and feelings of Samantha is just great. They really are able to picture the well. Also the music choice is great. And the part when Theo and Samantha sings together is just otherworldly. I watched the scene in two ways, at the first few seconds with my eyes closed and the rest of the scene with open eyes. Both experiences gave different sensation entirely. With eyes closed, I pictured Theo and Samantha as just another couple singing together. But my eyes open AFTER with my eyes closed, the relationship between the two manifested and pictured more vividly, at the same time it emphasized the real oddity of Samantha's lack of physical manifestation.The picturing of jealousy between Theo and Samantha, both from Samantha to Theo and vice versa, is also pictured nice, without omitting the natural subtlety and obvious logical human need of defensive self- actualization. The dialog between Theo and Samantha about Catherine and also Theo's facial expressions when talking with Samantha and Allan describe the emotions of subtle jealousy well enough. And just a few moments after that, because of Samantha's ever grow adaptive intelligence, you'll find a few shockers along the way.The acting is generally good. Joaquin Phoenix really did a great acting in Her, although most of the time the mustache and glasses cover up the facial expressions. Amy Adams got a sidelined part here. And Scarlett Johansson did a great job with the voice acting. The movie generally pictures Theo's world of contrast of loneliness among so many other people well.As a closer, I give it a 6.5 out of 10 score. Not really a movie that I'd watch repeated times though. But again, overall it's good and I recommend you to go see it, just don't consider it to be a romantic movie, because it is romantic in a very weird way LOL",6,2,4,31 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Two hours of crazy cars, car-chases and pure action
","The story is just another one of those cliché action movie stories of the hero helping the party who is running from the evil ruler. It even completes with the common finale of the evil ruler dying at the end and the escaping party gets to become the new ruler. Nothing new from the story as there's no new ingredient added to the story as a whole, not even a good enough twist. Yet This movie grants a spectacular display of a very crazy action, from start to end. From the time as Furiosa starts to veer off her course the movie just doesn't give any room to stop to catch your breath. And the action is the kind of action which you rarely see in other action movies, with lots and lots of crazy stunts everywhere. I also like how the movie keeps and even develops the original Mad Max's style of vehicular mods and character designs. The acting overall is a great job for me. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max really equals, if not bested, Mel Gibson's performances from the original movies. The voice play is also nice. Charlize Theron can really make her character stand out. Nicholas Hoult did great to shed his previous characters and play this role of crazy eager War Boy.",7,1,9,2 June 2015
The Breakfast Club," The classic that started to elaborate on modern social classes in high school
","It's a shame that I just watched this movie so long after its release. Then again, it was release at my birth year. All the teen movies where we see all those social classes like the jocks, the nerds, the goths, the band-mates and the popular girls, all get first exposed in this movie. But maybe the audience nowadays will find many of the words and idioms used rather strange. Saying sporto instead of jock and saying dweeb instead of nerd sounds very far off even though the audience will catch the meaning quickly via the context. The movie also has real nice and natural flow portraying high school teens where they can be shouting in conflict in one time and be in discussion in a civil way the next few minutes later. The acting overall is kind of a mixed point. Emilio Estevez did well in portraying the cool and determined character while Judd Nelson did well in grabbing all the attention for his character. Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall did also well in portraying the stereotypes of they respective characters.",7,0,0,17 September 2015
Donnie Darko," The creepiest and quirkiest time travel movie i've seen
","The story unveils slowly at the opening and gets to normal pace when the characters set in. Yet the story is filled with the constant mood of mysterious happenings and suspicious possible connections. The details are very sketchy, these kept the viewers curious and stay on watching. But some people with less patience will likely be bore off, I know I did feel kind of bored as the story only reveal sketchy hints and details to make out a guess. Yet the finale revelation is nice enough that covers and sums up the entire story into one complete tale. Jake Gyllenhaal acted out just enough to keep the story alive while his sister gets not a very significant role here.",6,0,2,22 August 2014
Princess Mononoke," Great artworks on those background drawings
","The story brings the viewers, as always expected from a Studio Ghibli's work, to a fantasy land. The fantasy mostly contains of spirits and weird things, with some elements of technology that shouldn't be around on the time frame. The animation work is great and rich in details, again as always from Studio Ghibli. But especially I liked how this movie contains some of the most beautiful still set drawings of backgrounds. As stills, they look so realistically beautiful, which also a bad side that it makes the foregrounds and moving animations seems too distinctive and don't blend well. I watched the English dubbed version and for me the voice acting is an okay performance done by experienced names.",6,1,2,12 September 2014
The Wizard of Oz," A real classic with strong legacy all over the popular culture
","The story is surely a classic of a family adventure fantasy movie. It doesn't have many twists and the dialog isn't that complicated. These things help the movie to be easily comprehended by kids of all ages and from all generations. This movie becomes timeless due to those factors. But I have to admit that this movie doesn't really serve my personal taste, even for a family movie. I see the acting as to inflated, making the movie enjoyable for kids exclusively while the older viewers can only find interest in the story as a whole. The acting is quite a standard work for me as all the characters looked like they kind of overdo their roles.",6,2,5,21 November 2015
The Martian," Entertaining, Informative and quite inspirational
","Mark Watney is the Ares III Mars mission's botanist astronaut. A few days (sols) there, a storm rages through the Hab site forcing the team flee the planet on the Mars Ascent vehicle (MAV). Hit by a debris and presumed dead, Mark is subsequently left behind. Awaken, he patches himself up and starts video-logging his activities. With no communications and the next Mars mission in four years, Mark has to 'science things up' to survive. He rations food and plants stash potatoes in his own feces. He creates water by oxidizing hydrogen and nitrogen. NASA eventually learns of his survival and announces it but refrains from telling it to the Ares III crew. Mark mods the rover to enable him drive longer distances. NASA engineer Vincent Kapour finds Mark is traveling to the 1997 Pathfinder rover. As Mark recovers it, Vincent is able to control it from earth, enabling a simple communication.Vincent's team instructs Mark to hack the Rover's OS to enable text communication. NASA finally reveals the truth to the Ares III crew. As NASA prepares a supply mission at the least, Mark becomes somewhat a celebrity on earth. One night, a malfunction in the airlock destroys Mark's second potato crop. Mark's left with his food, which left a limited time before NASA can reach him. Mark chats with the Ares III crew and rebuilds the Hab. NASA tries to launch a supply probe but their rocket explodes mid-air. CNSA, the Chinese NASA, helps out with the propulsion technology. Meanwhile astrophysicist Rich Purnell contacts Vincent about his calculations that instead of sending a new mission to rescue Mark, NASA can just resupply the Ares III's spaceship Hermes to go and get him. Even though the NASA director disapprove the plan but the mission director secretly sends course plan to the Hermes, thus the plan is underway.NASA and CNSA cooperate to relaunch a probe to resupply the Hermes for their return to Mars. Meanwhile Mark starts his journey to the site of Ares IV's MAV. After seven months he reaches it. NASA tells him to dismantle the protection layers to lighten it so Mark can reach the Hermes better. As the Hermes gets into range, its crew remotely ignites the MAV with Mark in it.Floating on space, Mark still can't reach Hermes automatically, so the Ares III's Commander Lewis 'bungee jumps' herself to catch him mid-space, with him puncturing his suit to make an 'Iron Man style' flight to approach Lewis. With that Mark safely board the Hermes and gets back home to earth.In essence the story doesn't really offer something unpredictable as a big picture. Everyone who has seen the trailer, let alone read the book which I haven't, will easily know that the movie only tells of an astronaut mistakenly left on Mars and have to utilize his craft to survive the overwhelming odds. And with the current trend in Hollywood movies and literature, with the exception of true story based tragedies like the recent Everest (2015), one can safely assume that this movie will have a happy ending without having to watch the whole thing.But with that kind of expectation this movie still able to give me wow moments as it use so many scientific points which are logically understandable without having to delve deeper back into the science textbooks. There are a lot of technical stuff lying around in the critical story flow, even technical abbreviations and jargon. But the movie went on with confidence to insert them without having to explain them in the duration. This is quite smart considering that The Martian (2015) took advantage of the steady flow of space movies since 2013's Gravity, which exposes the audience to the technicalities of space travel. The setting and location filming, with aid of CGI, do worth a mention. The end results look so convincing indeed that I gave up searching for unedited set bloopers after about thirty minutes in. Coupled with all the factual physics and space travel knowledge, this adds into the enjoyment of watching the movie.Acting-wise, the movie presents us with a nice level of acting work, although it's kind of weird to see most of the cast list of familiar faces only take less significant faces. Matt Damon of course nailed his parts very well. His balanced up depiction of Watney's ingenuity and despair at different times completes the story angles well. Jeff Davis provided the skeptic and cautious angle very nicely to the story, Sean Bean gives us a more entertaining performance through references to his other work, rather than his actual role here. It's very nice to see other familiar faces like Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and even Kristen Wiig brightening up the cast list.my say for The Martian is a solid 7 out of 10. A recommendation surely goes out to see it in the cinemas. It's very entertaining and indeed also informative.",7,2,7,9 October 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Not quite the Odyssey I know but it's nice
","While stated at the very beginning that this movie is based on Homer's Odyssey, I feel that the Coen Brothers really take their freedom and gives a loose interpretation of the extant. The story feels like it's not a complete version of the Odyssey, rather a collection of snippets of the more significant incidents. The characters and backgrounds are also getting reinterpreted, wildly must I say. Yet those interpretations get to be very funny and entertaining. I really enjoy the interpretation about the Cyclops and the sirens. The mood gets to be formed very nicely with the coherent choices of lighting and coloration. The acting in overall looks also good. George Clooney takes most of the credit for it, but John Turturro did also quite good, especially on their face expressions.",7,0,0,17 October 2015
Furious 7," Very emotional and nostalgic for the series' followers
","About two years after the last movie, Dom jogs Letty's memory, but she's tired of it. Brian's now a good dad. Elena works with Hobbs. Hobbs catches Deckard Shaw hacking his computer. They brutally fight, badly injuring Hobbs. Dom gets a package from Tokyo and Shaw calls, then the package explodes destroying the Toretto family house. Dom meets Hobbs about Shaw. Brian hides Mia and Jack at a friend's and Dom goes to Tokyo to bring back Han's body. At Han's funeral Dom spots Shaw and chases him. Shaw lures Dom to a standoff, but a 'Mr. Nobody' steps in and lets Shaw escape. Mr. Nobody briefs Dom of a kidnapped hacker Ramsey who created a powerful program, God's Eye, with the terrorist Jakande in the mix. Dom agrees to get the God's Eye in exchange for Shaw. The team's assembled with Letty added. They bring their cars parachuting from a cargo plane to reach the terrorist motorcade. They manage to free Ramsey but Shaw interferes. Dom, with Ramsey, and Shaw veers off road while Brian fights out of the motorcade with Letty saving him at the end. Shaw escapes but Dom gets cornered by the terrorists. He crashes his car down hill with the team saving him below. Ramsey and the team goes to Abu Dhabi for the God's Eye. They go to a billionaire's penthouse party, which houses a hyper-car with its ECU containing the program. Letty sneaks into the man's room while Tej and Ramsey hack the security. Roman distracts the crowd as Dom and Brian sneak to the hyper-car. But Letty's caught by the bodyguards and the plan shifts. Dom and Brian decide to take car instead. Making matters worse, Shaw comes in. Dom brings the car flying through to the adjacent towers, jumping off as Brian nabs the ECU. The team gives God's Eye to Mr. Nobody after they use it to track Shaw. They go after Shaw but Shaw has Jakande as an ally and a shootout ensues. Mr. Nobody gets shot so Dom and Brian evacuate him, leaving Jakande to acquire the God's Eye. The team goes home, preparing for the enemy to come to them. The plan is to counter-hack the God's Eye and inserts a virus to it. The team circles around and Jakande's men picked up Dom, so Ramsey starts her hack. But she's made and the terrorists send a drone at her and Brian. They manage to escape but Brian loses his car and the terrorists blow up a signal tower, cutting Ramsey's hack so Brian manually climbs a building to restore the signal. Dom faces Shaw at a parking building's top while Ramsey gets transferred to Letty's car.The drone almost had them but Hobbs comes and slams an ambulance at it. Ramsey completes her hack and the terrorists lost the God's Eye. Jakande in his helicopter finds Shaw and Dom and send a missile to the building, collapsing it. Shaw falls at the collapse and as Jakande aims at Dom, Hobbs barrages the helicopter with bullets. Dom gets some time and escapes as Jakande continues to collapse the building. Dom launches his car at the helicopter, throwing Shaw's grenades into it, and Hobbs finishes the job by shooting at the grenades. Hobbs, Brian and Letty races to see Dom unconscious, and Letty admits her memory has returned. Dom wakes up and Shaw gets arrested. The added epilogue is not for me to divulge for it gives me the real shivers. The story is a very nice addition to the great saga. Impacted by the loss of Paul Walker, the story changes turn out to be quite unpredictable and very much emotional. The revealed Shaw revenge is actually only a small portion. Despite the obvious signs of the movies getting more and more strange in the action selection, the other main theme of family of the crew, including character depths and character relations, are really taken to a whole new level.I like how the movie acknowledges the breadth of the story so far and didn't focus on adding new characters more and more. Although new characters are added, with big names playing them which feels like potential comebacks at future sequels, I see this seventh installment actually focuses more on the main character quartet of Dom, Brian, Mia and Letty, who have the most share of story depth and screen time. The story nicely play on reminiscing from the first movies. I also enjoyed how this movie connect Tokyo Drfit into the whole saga very nicely.In any way, this movie leaves us with many potential for the next movie in line. And this is a good sign that the saga will continue even without Paul Walker. Throughout the movie I curious on those action sequences, about in which one will Brian meet his end. But I'm glad that Brian retires nicely and emotionally like that. Because if he's ended by dying, it will face Mia and Jack to a painful irony concerning something Brian said about his father from back in the fifth movie.The action is done greatly despite the tendency to be more and more unbelievable. The fight scenes are also a great job, I really like the spinning cameras. The dialog gets more and more emotional at the right times. I'm glad Tyrese Gibson still plays his part very nicely as the crew's funny-man. The acting in overall is just at a standard level from all the cast members. The story so far, character relations, nostalgic points, and the emotional content are the things that make this movie a good and entertaining piece of action movie.For me Furious 7 (2015) deserves and 8 out of 10 score and a recommendation. I maybe a bit biased I've following the series from it's first movie. But this movie manages to be good at the action side as well as the emotional side.",8,1,3,4 April 2015
