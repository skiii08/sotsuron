Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GEORGE LUCAS IS GOD!!!
","After 16 years the wait is finally over!!! I saw the 12:01 am showing.  It was, well, incredible.  The computer animation alone was amazing.  I won't spoil the movie, but I thought it was as good as the original Star Wars. I can't wait until I see it again at 11:00 am this morning and again at 5:00pm this afternoon and well a whole bunch of times after that.May the force be with you...",8,0,0,19 May 1999
