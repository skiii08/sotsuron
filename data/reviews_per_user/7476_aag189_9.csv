Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not good
",This movie was just sad. Why did they have to do this? Hollywood has no soul. They really should have stopped at the first movie. Deep is in this movie and it is just heartbreaking. They have a black wearing captain in it and I think mermaids and stuff. All I know is that this movie is very forgettable. I have no idea what it was about and I just saw it 2 nights ago. It started off okay. It was like a 3 way race to something and then it just got boring. So much for the good times on the high seas. Will they make a sequel to this? I hope not. They just need to stop. We need to get them to stop doing this. We go out and watch these movies and they just keep making more of them. It isn't right. Not right at all.Deep played Captain Jack and I honestly think he didn't even want to be there. This movie was just basically a cash grab and omg did they grab cash alright. If you haven't seen this movie you can tell by my review that is isn't that great so do yourself a favor and go back and watch the first movie and remember the good times.,3,2,3,8 April 2013
The Mummy," Awesome adventure movie
",When people say 'Remember when Brendan Fraser was good?' they're talking about this movie. This has to be his best movie not that he is known for a lot of things. I think pretty much this film series and Georgie of the Jungle. Anyway this movie is fun and a good time. Rachel Weisz is great in it and see still looks the same today. I have recently saw her in Oz and she hasn't change much. Way to go Rachel Weisz! Arnold Vosloo is an outstanding bad guy. He play the part to perfection. He also did a good job in the first GI Joe movie. I haven't seen the second movie yet. I am waiting to watch that on video just because the guy who directs the Step-up dance movies directed that one and I have a bad feeling about it just because of that fact. Anyway this movie was awesome. I love the American cowboys in that movie. I see so much of myself in them. I wonder if that is how the rest of the world views us American. If so then they're more or less right about us. Sadly. The effects in this movie are outstanding but that isn't what makes this movie so good. It is the fact that this is an excellent ride that never lets down. I wish the sequel was better.,8,2,2,8 April 2013
Life of Pi," Ang Lee is the man.
","This review has spoilers in it. First off I do not agree with the philosophy of the film and it is frankly insulting to monotheism however I must say that this is a very good movie in terms of entertainment. It is based on a book that pretty much stoled from another book most of the major things that make this movie so good. You should look up the book it is called 'Max and the Cats.' I haven't read that book but if you read the summary for it you can see that it is pretty much plagiarism. REGARDLESS of the things I listed above this movie is great and a must watch because the story is so, so good and grabs you. The ending reveals.. the ending is just awesome. (Same ending as Max and the Cats but whatever) Ang Lee knows how to make a movie. His Hulk was awesome, his Flying Dragon was great and I am sure I saw a few other things he did but I can not think of them right now.I can't wait to read the books. Both 'Max and the Cats' and 'the life of pi' I hate the author for his straight up plagiarism but I love the story he told.. even if it wasn't from his own imagination for the most part.",8,1,3,8 April 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Great feel good movie
",This is a nice little feel good movie. Great movie to watch during these dark times in our economy. Something to take your mind off the troubles of the world. Oh and Chris Tucker is in it! Where has Chris Tucker been and why isn't he in more movies? He is just pure awesomeness. Everyone in the movie does an excellent job. Cooper and Lawrence work very well together. Lawrence is so young but that girl can act. She can out act even some of the old timers out there. Why couldn't see play the Wicked Witch? I wasn't big on the dancing but the rest of the movie was more or less great so I tolerated it. Chris Tucker really needs to be in more movies.This is the type of movie that will make you feel better about yourself and lets you know that if you try hard enough that you can cover come anything. What I like about the movie is that it isn't prefect and it doesn't try to be which makes it a gem of a film. This is a solid rental. By the way Chris Tucker NEEDS to play in more movies!,8,1,2,8 April 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," A movie about candy. Not a movie about video games.
","This movie is trash because it was boring and not what it advertised itself to be from the previews. That being said, whoever made this movie is brilliant. They basically marketed this movie to children and gamers but the movie itself was nothing but a 2 hour commercial for candy. While I was watching this movie I wanted to go and trade my popcorn for candy.They have Sonic the HedgeHog in the posters for this movie but he was just a talking sign in the movie for like 3 seconds. They showed all the bad guys talking in an AA style meeting but EVERY SECOND of it was in the trailers for this movie! OMG I am so upset for wasting movie on this trash! Q-BERT was in this movie... I miss Q-BERT. Why did Q-Bert have to be in this awful movie???The story is about a video game guy and he meets a little computer girl and they spend 2 hours talking about candy and making children that watch this movie addicted to candy. I wonder if the parents that took their kids to see this movie put 2 and 2 together?This movie is garbage. It is going to have an adverse effect on your kid if you make them watch this propaganda. Hollywood makes me sick. I hope people wake up.I had to edit this review 6 times because I used prohibited words so it isn't going to sound pretty but I don't care. All I have to say is don't let any children under the age of 19 watch this diabetic inducing propaganda.",1,8,32,8 April 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Like LOTR but more for the young ones
","Great movie. Very well done special effects and the 48 fps made the movie so very easy to watch in 3D. I am a guy who is anti-3D but it worked in this movie. Even though it worked in this movie didn't mean that it was great. In fact I will be seeing the sequels, the two upcoming Hobbit movies in 2D because that is the only way to watch movie. 3D technology just isn't there yet and maybe it will never get there. Anyway. If you liked LOTRs you'll like this. We get to see middle earth and all that fun stuff. I wasn't a fan of the trolls in this movie. They were just silly. I currently have the ranking of this movie at 8/10 but because of the troll I will have to bring it down to 7/10. Let me do that now. There we go. They trolls got a little too clowny for my taste. And the singing of the Hobbits was a bit much but forgivable. Martin Freeman was awesome. He did a great job and I believe maybe the best hobbit I've seen on film. I didn't really care for the hobbits in LOTRs but Martin Freeman was outstanding. I wish he played a hobbit in LOTRs. Just because of Martin Freeman I am going to change my ranking of this movie back to 8 out of 10 stars. Let me do that now.",8,1,3,8 April 2013
Django Unchained," Not that great. Sam Jackson saved this movie
",I almost gave this movie a 7 but I had to give it a 6 because it is kind of a sleeper of a movie. The first half of this movie is sleepy. It has great shots and environment but Jaime Foxx is an awful actor. He is a stone faced actor with no emotion. Tarantino is a smart director and shoots around the stone faced Foxx but you can't shoot around the lead of a movie all the time and because of that the movie is a poorer film. I remember watching the first half of this film thinking that Hollywood needs to make a real movie about slavery because it is an untapped well of emotion and human interest that will produce AMAZING movies if done right. Why couldn't Tarantino just make a movie about slavery? This was just a revenge story set during slavery times.Anyway this movie dragged on until Sam Jackson came into the picture and literally saved it. Almost single handedly saved it from being a sleeper of a picture. His energy woke up Leonardo DiCaprio who didn't start really act until Sam came into the picture. Sam and Leonardo played off each other so well. Loved it. However Sam Jackson's energy wasn't enough to wake up stone faced Foxx. That man just can not act. Why is he an actor? Someone please tell me!Christoph Waltz was in this movie and he did an okay job. I think he won an award for his role in this movie but he wasn't anything special. It wasn't like he was bad or anything I just believe that his acting wasn't anything to write home to Mom about.,6,1,4,8 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Awful, laughable... Shows that Nolan is only human
","This review will have spoilers.First off I loved the first two movies of the series. I like the second movie better but the first was also a welcomed gem. Now we're talking about the 3rd movie here and it is a stinker. I almost didn't believe that Nolan directed it and I wondered what the heck happened to Nolan?Why would he allow such an awful movie and here is the reason he did:According to an interview with David Goyer (an awesome writer who worked on this project) him and Nolan got 'stuck' halfway through the movie with plot devices and concepts because so many elements were involved in the movie. So Nolan told him to take 2 weeks off to clear his head. In those two weeks Goyer came up with the idea and story for 'Man of Steel', the Superman movie coming out soon. Goyer showed Nolan the idea and Nolan loved it. After that Nolan and Goyer pretty much put The Dark Knight Rises on autopilot and worked on Superman because they knew The Dark Knight Rises it would be a money maker regardless of the piece of trash it ended up being.Now the movie itself is trash but Nolan fan boys are being fan boys and eating it up for some reason. I can picture Nolan and Goyer laughing their butts off about that fact. So basically all positive reviews of Dark Knight Rises come from Nolan fan boys or from critics/media people that want to work with Nolan in the future. The rest of us however are not afraid to call this movie what it is, which is an abomination.So finally my review:The reason I gave this film 2 stars is because the last 15 minutes of the movie was good...or had good enough action and because the acting in the movie was solid. It is a shame that such good acting was wasted on this movie. What is wrong with the movie you ask? Almost everything; the plot is easy to understand but so stuffed with details upon of details that are just there to cover plot-holes that are almost unbearable and translate in to a movie that is mostly talking. Talking about plot devices that are only there to push the movie along. Plot devices need to be in a movie for character growth or major themes or something other than pushing the movie along. So basically this movie was just a bunch of outstanding actors standing around talking about stuff. Talking about stuff you frankly wouldn't give a penny about if it wasn't for just movie the plot along. MAYBE if it was a 8 hour movie then this could have been better because it would give people the chance to care about the characters, plot, themes and etc. I hope Nolan learns from this mistake because it KILLED this movie. That is why I am so upset with the fact that people try to defend this movie! Please don't do that! Nolan has to learn from his mistakes.Lets talk about Bane. Bane played by that guy from Inception (he is also playing Mad Max in the upcoming remake....oh boy..), Bane was the guy that broke Batman's back into comics and you would expect him to be a badass in the movie but that was not the case. I felt like I could have kicked his ass (in fact I really wanted to about 40 minutes into the movie.) He wasn't believable as a badass. He didn't look the part and (maybe because of the mask?) he didn't act the part. Another thing about Bane is that everyone seemed to know who he was before he even set foot in the city. I am not just talking about the FBI; I mean literally everyone one! The cops, Alfred, school kids, random old people..omg I hate this movie so much..Lets talk about all the mistakes... or lets not because this review is already long. Let us just say there were so many basic mistakes like magical knee braces, easy to fix protruding spinal discs, magical ice and so many others. The problem was that this movie was frankly so BORING that you notice every single mistake.Lets talk about Alfred. He left Bruce. Umm...yeah... Wait, wait.. lets examine this. Basically they needed a way to get rid of him while Batman was taken by Bane (revenge of the plot device!)Yeah this movie sucked. I could write a book about all the problems with this movie.By the way this movie sucked. If you were lucky enough not to have seen it then wait for it to come out on TNT. Don't even watch it on HBO because you'll need the commercials. I am not kidding I wish I had the commercials during this piece of..",2,8,15,8 April 2013
Jurassic Park," Still an awesome movie but I'm not going to watch it in 3D
","I remember this when I was a kid and watched it again on Blu-Ray last week. The special effects still hold up today. But 3D kills movies and I am not going to waste time watching this in 3D. 3D is only good for movies that are filmed at 48 fps. When it comes to 3D you shouldn't waste your money. If they released this again in non-3D I could go see it maybe.So everything about this movie is great; the acting, the story, the effects, the action. It is a must see for people that enjoy smart movies. Sam Jackson is even in this movie. The special effects stand out the most. This movie is just an epic dino adventure. A movie for people of all ages. So few smart movies nowadays. Why is that?",8,0,1,8 April 2013
