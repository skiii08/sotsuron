Hereditary," Horrible
","HEREDITARY was the WORST movie I've ever seen, waited the whole time for it to get better, it did not!! It was so boring,literally nothing happened, then in the last 10 mins a few weird (not scary) bits were randomly thrown in as a quick panic attempt but it just left me confused and very very very disappointed.",1,1,5,24 March 2019
