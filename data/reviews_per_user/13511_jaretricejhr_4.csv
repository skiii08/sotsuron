It," Loved IT.
","I could not believe how much I enjoyed this film. I am not really much of a fan of the 'Horror' films, I definitely like a few, like Get Out, The Shining, It Follows, and others, but not a whole lot of them. But this film I couldn't help but enjoy. I really love the amount of comedy that they had put in this film, also loved Finn's role in the movie as Richie, reminds me of 'Stranger Things'. The fact that they were able to put a relationship (Bill and Beverly) along side the horrific story line was pretty incredible to me. Really wasn't expecting the sewer scene to be so horrifying when Pennywise literally BIT off Georgie's arm, which is honestly what they should've done considering that the mini series wasn't able to do it, because of it being on live 1990 television. The amount of story that they had put into this was pretty amazing. This was the most incredible way to make this movie and they definitely outdid themselves with it. After watching this movie, I started reading more Stephen King novels, mostly because I really enjoyed this film and couldn't help but credit this movie's story line. Also liked the style of horror it used, they used such a classic style of horror, but they made it even more nightmare-ish to the point where it's actually genuinely disturbing. After this movie, I'm definitely going to start reading more Stephen King novels. If you enjoy more of the classical horror, then I'll bet you'll enjoy this flick.",9,1,1,21 December 2017
Hereditary," It was good, I definitely enjoyed it more than my family though.
","The Good:I went to see this film with my family when this came out, and it was definitely the disturbing experience. I was on the edge my seat through pretty much this whole film, I was really into what was going on in the whole atmosphere of the movie, and was really interested in what would happen next. It definitely does a good job of getting you hooked into the plot and it makes it very hard for you to even leave the room for something such as using the restroom! I really wasn't expecting Charlie to die near the beginning of the film, I seriously could barely guess what was going to happen, especially to each character.The Bad:One thing about this film, was that the ending was definitely unexpected, in a bad way. It definitely could've been better, but at the same time, it also could've been worse. I kind of felt that I had wasted all of that 2 hours of getting gripped to the storyline on a disappointing ending, but I definitely don't hate the entire film for it. The ending wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible either (not exactly what my family thinks though), which is why I gave the film the rating that I did, becsuse the ending could've been much worse.I honestly don't know whether or not I should suggest this film, but I can say that you should look into it first before watching it so you don't get completely disappointed. By the way, there really isn't any 'ugly' I have for this movie, if you had picked up on the references.-Jaret",7,1,3,12 November 2018
Deadpool 2," A fun action film for fun people.
","This has to be one if my favorite action flicks that I have ever seen in my entire life. Usually, sequels don't meet up to my expectations, but this one did just that! I meant to write this review sooner, but here it is now. This film mashed all of my favorite things for an action/comedy into one movie, talented and humorous writing, satisfying action sequences, a good plot, and good ol' fun. This didn't out rank the first deadpool for me, as I do love them both the same, because I definitely like going back to the first one for a much more simple action comedy, and back to this one for the incredible writing, perfect plot, and the many more Deadpool gags. I can't stress enough how much Ryan Reynolds fits this role perfectly, especially due to his actual personality. Vanessa's death definitely striked me as fairly depressing, but it did fit with the rest of the story/plot. One thing I wished for in this flick that I didn't get was seeing the X-force get more of a role in the film, and see them fight along Deadpool, instead of dying instantly due to severe winds, but other than that, the film was amazing, and couldn't be any more of a perfect action comedy, with the perfect cast.Also, I definitely got a really good kick out if the alternate time travelling gag that played during the credits, my family couldn't stop laughing neither at the baby legs joke. I suggest you give this flick a watch if you hadn't already!-Jaret",9,2,3,12 November 2018
12 Strong," Far better than what most say it is...
","'Depth':
 This film was incredibly satisfying to me. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat when I was watching it. I really hate seeing these reviews that are complaining about the movie's depth, and I can see why you would consider that one of the film's flaws...but giving it a 5/10 or less because of that one flaw...really? If you think that there are more flaws than that then I would understand...but there's more to a film than it's 'depth', especially a film based on a true story. I honestly thought this movie was very meaningful and thoughtful of the people that actually fought after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It seems that critics aren't thinking about that at all, they just care about this one flaw in the film. You know that people don't look into a film as much as they need to when they give a film a pretty low rating because they noticed one flaw, especially one that a lot of people wouldn't notice, and or care about. My Thoughts On The Movie:
 This movie really showed me what the fights after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were like...and that's pretty much the movie's entire goal, is to educate it's viewers on what happened after 9/11. It was also a very heartwarming movie. Seeing all of the character's saying goodbye to their families was pretty sad to watch, but then you see characters like Mitch Nelson (played by Chris Hemsworth) smiling when they come back home seeing their families joyful reactions, you feel your heart sitting next to a fire (well...unless you care WAY too much about the films depth...). And that is what makes this a good 'War' movie, that it's not just violence, it also explores the lives of the characters that are fighting in it. Seeing all of the main protagonists bond and joke with each other could also be really satisfying to people who don't like the 'overly-serious' type films (I, however, am not one of those people). I just like how the writers put some humor into their script for this movie, and that's something you have to appreciate for films like this. If you're into these kinds of movies, I definitely suggest you watch it, and if you don't know, give it a watch, and if you're not, then you probably shouldn't watch it. Just focus on the movie's storyline and not on ENTIRELY on the depth, this movie has a lot of meaning to it and it's not aiming to become a perfect movie (not many films do), it just wants to educate it's viewers, which is what a lot of 'History' films do, try to educate the viewer. I enjoyed it.Also, I was really satisfied about Michael Pena, Michael Shannon and Rob Riggle's roles in this flick.",8,96,193,21 January 2018
