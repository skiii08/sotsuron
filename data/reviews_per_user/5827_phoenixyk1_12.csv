10 Cloverfield Lane," Very Surprised that this was ACTUALLY GOOD!
","The whole idea of making 10 Cloverfield Lane filled me with trepidation the moment it was announced. Things got yet more worrying when it became clear that the film was going to have NO CONNECTION to CLOVERFIELD...But the trailers looked interesting, so I gave it a chance......Damn Glad I did!There is not much in the way of effects to speak of until quite late on, Make up Effects are ASTOUNDING and very believable.John Goodman is excellent in his role, and truly creepy...The film is Tense, Really Tense... If you have avoided Spoiler talk online, then this film will have you on the edge of your seat... Not scared but Tense and Bewildered.So - Basing my views on did the film achieve its goal of entertaining me? YES... Yes it did!!! Its slow burning, So if you like action and blood... Look elsewhere - This is Psychological Tension not a all guns blazing action romp!So Yup - I enjoyed it and you are probably now asking if I have anything bad to say about it...Well... Yeah! I do... The Ending is so Cliché... Don't get me wrong, its fitting but it is Cliché! In fact, I feel they could have ended the movie far better with a darker ending... But that's just my view and I do not want to include spoilers.Much of the film is Guesswork - Trying to work out what the hell is going on, who is telling the truth, what really is going on around the lead characters.So seriously, If you have managed to avoid Spoilers and have NOT seen the film - SEE IT... Its a slow burn movie but it works well! A Must watch at least once!And if I am honest - Far Better than Cloverfield ever was!",8,0,1,9 December 2016
Suicide Squad," DC seems to be getting it right... slowly...
","I finally got around to watching the movie after missing out at the cinema. Kind of glad as it was the extended cut.I also watched after YouTube Veteran I Hate Everything released his own scathing review of the movie...So the key is what do I think?Well, in all honesty - IHE - Or Alex as he is better known - had many valid points about the film... For me the film is a mix of the Good, The bad and the downright Ugly.The Joker: The GoodJared Leto - I have to admit, I was concerned about Leto as The Joker - Following up the late Heath Ledger was going to be an uphill struggle.Thankfully, he actually pulled it off... More of a reckless gangster than Ledger's darker portrayal, Leto does come across the right side of Crazy and sells the New Joker very well indeed...The Bad:Simple - LACK OF SCREEN TIME!!! Maybe DC and WB have plans for a solo Joker Movie but if that's the case, Suicide Squad FAILS TO SELL THAT VISION!The Ugly: Flamboyant though the Joker is in the DC Canon, Many have taken exception to the Makeup and tattoos of Leto... I am somewhere in between, they do suit his portrayal but I can also see why fans are up in arms.Harly Quinn, Margot Robbie is FANTASTIC and gets the best amount of screen time to sell her character in my view. Sadly, and it is rumoured to have been a major point of contention for Robbie on set, she is WAY TOO OVERSEXUALISED!This does detract a lot from what should be a very personality driven character.The Effects are FANTASTIC! The sets look great and a perfect balance of CGI Vs Practical for many set pieces works well... With that said, there is a LOT of CGI. Which actually leads into IHE's Biggest gripe and one I concur with.In a Universe that has Batman and The Flash, Both making Cameos... They rely on the Suicide Squad to take out this evil... WHAT THE F**K!?Seriously, While the Enchantress looks amazing, and the first transition is LEGENDARY - I can see why Alex calls this the best scene in the movie, it truly is epic in its simplicity - the overall idea and what they are fighting... NO! JUST NO! THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE SUICIDE SQUAD!!!While we are on Enchanteress, Carla Delevigne is one of those Models that everyone raves about, but to be honest I have never really paid any attention to... As the Archaeologist, she plays her role very well indeed and seems to be a very competent actress......But when she becomes Enchantress which is 90% of the movie, She is not acting!!! She is just being a damn supermodel!!!Now some may rave about this, but I am sorry - it really spoils the immersion. She literally is just modelling!!! BORING! A real shame as I think she actually has real potential.Will Smith - What more can you say - He is Will Smith!!!Overall, Each Character is great and played well... Its also where the film suffers its greatest issues.It has action a plenty, some lovely slower moments to develop SOME of the characters - El Diablo's story is great... But there is too much to build on...While in the comics each character has had time to shine and build up a history, there is no room for that here!Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is actually great fun - But you never really get to know him... This is a character that needs a place in a stand alone movie to build his history. Likewise, Killer Croc, El Diablo has a story that would be great for the Big Screen...For DC's Cinematic Universe, Suicide Squad is a step in the right direction - Overall I found the movie very entertaining, but it lacks in other areas.The problem is that the movie has been made far too early - All the characters could have done with a role as a villain or their own stand alone to really shine!Its has plenty of action, some real heart wrenching moments and some laughs - Nothing laugh out loud funny but some... And it is enjoyable!But DC is never going to compete with Marvel as long as they keep trying to cram so much in! DC, Warner Bros... SLOW IT DOWN!!! You saw what happened to Spider- Man when they tried to shove in way too many story arcs and characters... You are doing the same thing!!! BUILD UP!!! That's what is needed!!!So overall, I have marked it quite low for those technical reasons - There is so much potential in this movie that was wasted by trying to go full force too soon.A real shame as actually it not a bad film at all... But its way too cluttered and most of the characters you just won't give a toss about unless you are an avid comics fan.",7,1,2,7 December 2016
Doctor Strange," Very Entertaining - But not always for the right reasons!
","Oooooooooooh! I am a massive fan of Sherlock, and Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor... So his casting in this movie was EXCELLENT in my view...So, was it good - Well, honestly - I thought this was excellent!!! It was thoroughly entertaining if a little jumbled.Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was a controversial choice to many, but honestly I could not give a damn... Yes, it is an Asian character in the comics, but Hollywood KNOWS that it needs big names to sell seats - And her acting was fantastic!The Story, while not the greatest had some fine action scenes and though it borrowed a little too heavily from Inception - It all worked!And it is damn humorous as well... Some great Funny Moments...So why only a 7 if I enjoyed it so much? Well, yeah there are bad points - To Quote Rossatron, a popular YouTuber and Movie Making Critic, The 'Geography in the fight scenes gets a little convoluted and can be quite hard to follow at times. The fight scenes are all epic but it can be difficult following the various characters.And there must have been some kind of 'Behind the Scenes' discussion... As they made a TERRIBLE CHOICE asking Cumberbatch to try and do an American accent!!! OH BOY IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH SOME OF THE WORST ACCENTS IN MOVIES EVER!!!Only slightly behind Sean Connery trying to do Irish in The Untouchables...Benedict tries really hard to maintain the American Drawl, but it sounds so fake... and far too often he ends up reverting to British!I know that in the comics Strange is an American Doctor, but GOD DAMN IT its an Adaption!!!! Play to the strengths of your leads!!! Would it have been that hard to believe that Strange was a British Doctor who had migrated to the US for better opportunities to test his skills? NO! It wouldn't... And it would have saved us from the TERRIBLE Accent that Cumberbatch delivered!And its the accent that makes the film unintentionally hilarious too often... It slips in and out so much you wonder if Strange has a Split Personality!No, It has to be said - Its an enjoyable movie... Not perfect but to launch Doctor Strange into the Marvel Universe, it works!Now lets just hope they do NOT ask Cumberbatch to try and be American again and try and get a little more focus behind the action next time instead of relying on the effects to sell the film.Far better than I actually thought it was going to be... Just minor niggles let it down.",7,1,2,2 February 2017
No Country for Old Men," A very worthwhile watch
","While the critics were in awe of this film, I do not rate it quite so highly but its still a great film!The story is somewhat 'par for the course' as a Hunter comes across a drug deal gone bad and steals the Money that was left only to be hunted down by a hit-man.It is Anton Sugar that steals the show - His whole attitude throughout the whole film is just menacing... Through most of the film you spend your time trying to understand him and his motives - And that's about it!There is little to say other than the film has some amazing acting performances and introduces the most amazing 'Killer' who you somehow end up feeling closer to than any other character in the whole film.A great film!",7,2,3,5 September 2014
Kick-Ass," Why did I wait so long?
","There are a lot of superhero movies and a lot of comic spin-offs, so when Kick-Ass was first advertised in the UK and everyone started raving about it... I was like 'yeah so what?' - After some of the licenses flopped quite badly in the UK such as The Spirit (Which I actually enjoyed...) I was not really expecting that much.What a MISTAKE! Cage is wonderful as usual, and the film just rips through so many different emotions - Its hard to believe that this comic book adapt ion which stuck to its comic book predecessors' more or less to the letter in its total parody of the whole Super-Hero Genre.There are some quite 'Oh Yech!' scenes towards the beginning (Hey! I have grown up now... I am a family man! Masturbation jokes just ain't cool no more!) but these are a minor aside from what is frankly an amazing movie.Its fun, action packed and completely insane!Do I hear cries for a Kick-Ass 2? Very Likely but I doubt it would ever have the same impact.",9,1,3,22 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This may not be the Star Wars you are looking for...
","OK! This will be my LONGEST EVER iMDB review... As such, I am going to break it down into sections - YES THERE WILL BE SPOILERS... It is necessary to try and explain how I have come to my conclusions.Because, At first - I HATED THIS MOVIE... But as i planned to review it on YouTube and DEFEND REY who has become a poster child for Fans who Hate the new films, and as Fans get ready to DESTROY the career of Daisy Ridely the same way we did to Jake Lloyd (Annakin Skywalker _ Episode 1) - I had to rewatch and make sure I was on point...I have now watched the movie 4 times... And I now see tings i originally missed... Now, Is every Star Wars fan going to be happy with this Movie - NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT! But is it a Good Movie... Well, let me start with my breakdown...CREATIVE CHOICES: I do not know Rian Johnson as a director, but I do know DISNEY as a Business... I have NEVER AGREED with the idea to bring out a New Episode in the Trilogy every 2 years - This is more about maximising profits and pleasing shareholders. Sadly, with that Mindset of Disney, Creativity is Stiffled.That being said, there are creative Choice made by Rian Johnson that tome are foolish - GONE are the Screen wipes which,while dated have always been a tradition of Star Wars... You may think they do not matter but when you spot it - You suddenly realise what they added to the films.They slowed things down just for a second or two and allowed you to take in the scene... It was never something I thought about as a child back in 1978, but now they are not there - It does show something... It is a subconscious change that helps the movies thematically and should never have gone... Without them, The Movie seems a little too Generic! Like a generalised Hollywood Action Movie.Sadly, These creative decisions also lead into section 2.STORY: I think everyone knows by now that The film Picks up DIRECTLY where The Force Awakens left off... BUT not at the same time, At teh endof tehForce Awakens, Genral Hux and Kylo Ren are given orders by Snoke NOT to pursue teh rebels after Starkiller Base is Destroyed... But teh Last Jedi opens with The First Order chasing them down... IGNORING THE STORY THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED!I could have forgiven this if it was at least alluded to in the Text crawl at teh start of the movie - Just a hint that Kylo Ren had DEFIED Snokes Orders or such, but NO! IT IS EMPTY!!! IT MAKES NO EXPLANATION!Even Fans who loved The Force Awakens, Such as Myself, have called out this BAD creative choice as a Plot Hole - And Sorry Rian Johnson but IT IS A MAJOR PLOT HOLE!!!The Story overall does continue man themes that had already been laid out in TFA, The idea of Legends, Inspiration Faith are all handled well... But Mired by many unnecessary Sub-Plots... I know that many fans are NOT happy with these themes as they wanted a more coherent 'The Force is something you are born into 'Story - a Continuation of the Skywalker Linage... Myself? Sorry but I am happy that that arc has CLOSED!The biggest issue for me was teh Sub-Plots, They had far too much attention and not enough attention was paid to the Man two Plots of Reys Training and teh Rebel Escape plan... The whole situation on Canto Bight just comes across as Filler...With that said, If you can ignore the subplots and focus on the main story that truly matters - Its holds up very well... But there is one more issue here that does throw people out... It even got me...Star Wars has always had subtle nods to its real world influences, whether that be History or Religion, you can see it.... But its never in your face...The same is true of The Last Jedi, BUT - Many of the 'Nods' are FAR TOO SUBTLE!!! True fans will miss them over and over again and new fans will not see them at all.... Hell I am as OLD as the Franchise itself, and it has taken me 4 VIEWINGS to spot teh little Story arc Hints and Easter Eggs that foreshadow where the story is supposed to go... The Ideas and influences are FAR TOO SUBTLE this time that most will simply NOT CARE!CHARACTERS: OH BOY! This is an area me and many fans will agree - Some of the Characters are NOT handled well.. But again it comes down to SUBTLETY... The Film does not do ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY WHY CHARACTERS BEHAVE AS THEY DO!!! Multiple viewings CAN give you a better idea, but it should not need multiple viewings to understand a characters motivations... The Biggest Victim of this is POE DAMERON - His Character at first appears completely Neutered, and treated BADLY!Again, It took multiple viewings but thats not actually true - But to understand you NEED to watch over and over again... THAT IS BAD SCREENPLAY!Once it does become clear... It actually makes sense... For Long Time fans and Fanatics, They will be P**SED OFF! For newer fans, Most probably wont even see that at first t makes no sense and will just shrug it off... I could not shrug it off but I at least now see where Rian Johnson was heading - He just handled it VERY BADLY!Another aspect many have taken issue with is Forced Humour in Characters - And sadly, again this is a creative choice I CANNOT DEFEND! The worst being - Spoiler Alert! - Luke being handed his old Light sabre by Rey and Tossing it over his Shoulder... While it got an initial giggle from me... It felt WRONG! An Empty hollow Gesture played for laughs... The scenes following make clear that Luke has NO INTEREST in teaching Rey... But that could have been done with one line of Dialogue, DAMN It was done with the LOOK in Mark Hamill's EYES!!!Even one word... Just Hamill looks at Rey, Silent for a few seconds before dropping the sabre to the ground and saying in a cold monotonous tone 'NO'So - The Chgaracters are BAD? Actually - No... Many get Great development - Rey is growing as a Charcater, Kylo Ren is more dangerous than ever, Poe Dameron is shown to be a Rebel Hero but also a bit of an asshole with an Authority Problem... In fact the east developed Character is Finn who is consigned more to a Comic Relief Role.many Fans are being far too hard on the characters - Especially Rey - And I hate to say this but I will call out the Fanatics who are still attacking her - We destroyed the career of Jake Lloyd, Now you want do the same with Daisy Ridley?She is a Great Actress doing an amazing job with the material she is given... The HATE on Rey is UNFAIR! If you are NOT happy with her character - That's fine, but ATTACK DISNEY for not developing her character... Dont just belittle the Character!EFFECTS: Frankly, The effects are mainly Stunning - A great use once again of both Practical and CGI, teh way Star Wars SHOULD be handled... I thought I would hate the Porgs as a CGI addition but they are actually used Fantastically and are not a issue as I expected them to be... In fact, they add to two of teh funniest scenes in the movie and feel perfectly fine... There is not a single thing I can critique about the effects - Some have moaned abut the sets such as Snokes Throne Room, And I admit I found it Bland, but thats more a personal preference... It does not affect the story and does not get in the way - So I do not consider it an issue. Canto Bight on the other hand.. Well, We have already covered that this is more a sub-plot that goes nowhere so anything to do with that is just wasted...OVERALL: I always lok at a movie in One way... Did it Entertain me?Taking advice from YourMovieSucks.org - Adam Paluze, thank you Dude! - I go now to each film no matter how hyped I am and give it an average 5 out of 10... What it gets right may see it get a better score, what it gets wrong will see it drop...On my first viewing, While entertained, I was VERY disappointed in the film and it was a 4.5... But upon rewatching, it was back t a 6, Then a 7... And a & it has remained...I cannot and will not defend teh Creative choices of Rian Johnson, He was given too much free rein and altered things that are staples of the Franchise... Much like George Lucas with the Prequels.And I feel that teh true Ire from fans should be directed at Disney being more interested in Shareholders and Profit Maximisation -as this is hampering teh creative process by placing extremely heavy and dangerous time constraints on the Movies...There will be fans who are DEEPLY unhappy with The Last Jedi... Some of it is indeed justified... But not all of it - And I feel that its a mark of a pretty poor Star Wars Movie that you need multiple viewings to understand where the story is heading... To Paraphrase Han Solo from The Force Awakens - 'That's not how Star Wars works...'But there is actually more to enjoy here than hate... Badly handled, Indeed - A Bad Movie? I guess thats up to you.. To me, It was at first but I now appreciate what it was trying to do even if I do not like the direction it took to get there.When my new computer returns, I may do an upload to YouTube breaking down the areas I feel have gone wrong and why Fanatical Fans are now the REAL THREAT going forwards...(Seriously, I get told I am not a true fan because I have not immersed myself in every book... By 25 year old's who first watched the movies on VHS and DVD - I am 45 YEARS OLD! Not only did I see A New hope on the Cinema Screen, I Bought the first issues of the Marvel Comics back in 1978... Don't you DARE tell me I am not a True fan! I have QUITE LITERATELY Grown up with these movies...)Despite my 7/10 _ this film will NOT be to to everyone's taste... If I marked it as a Star Wars Movie, I have to admit it would be more a 5-6 out of 10 as it fails in the creative choices... As a Movie in general it has many good moments... So its a Final 7/10 - Its good.. But Not that good!",7,2,9,1 March 2018
Evil Dead," A good reboot...
","When I first heard they were going to do a remake... I was worried...I need not have been - While the film loses much of the Classic and misses much of what made the original Sam Raimi Classic such a hit, it also does a great job of paying homage to the great man!The film has lost its dark humor, and tries to be a very serious film... Some aspects work great - At least there is a plausible reason for them to be at the cabin for instance.Other parts do not work so well... The film focuses of trying to squeeze in as much action as possible, so lacks some character development - Then again, the original lacked character development while focusing more on the story...While it will never beat the original - It stands well as a great film!",7,1,5,5 September 2014
Prometheus," Something short of genius... But not bad!
","I am going to warn people straight away, If you have not yet seen the Classic ALIEN - DON'T WATCH IT BEFORE PROMETHEUS or you will be Disappointed!The film itself is well made but lacks a bit of depth. The only character I really felt anything for was Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace)who was far more delightful on screen than Charlize Theron.. Just my view.There are many viewers complaining that the story did not 'Fit' well... This is true, there are more questions by the end than answers. Overall, its not bad! Effects are great and there is some great acting from Noomi and Fassbender.But - And now for the spoiler - Key Elements for a prequel are that it SHOULD fit with the original story... his film FAILS major on this point as in ALIEN, The 'Pilot is seen in his cockpit with a 'Chest Busters' Hole in his body... Yet the film ends with the 'Engineer' (Pilot) attacked and dying elsewhere...MAJOR BAD PLAY THERE!Technicalities aside, Worth a watch but far from Scot's best work... A bit of a let down for fans.***UPDATE*** If rumour is to be believed, The reason the story does not 'Fit' is because a sequel is already planned that will expand on the history once more - Apparently there will be 2 More films...",6,2,4,5 May 2013
The Wolverine," Logan Still has claws... Even if they are a little blunt right now...
","OK! Die hard comic book fans may be a little disheartened at the continued reference to Logans Love for Jean Grey (Femme Oke) - But the films were never going to be a direct correlation to the comics... Logan has taken to living in the wilderness, not unlike the comics, after the death of Jean in X-Men 3 when he is summoned by a Japanese soldier he saved the life of during the Second World War.Cue lot of fighting and action and a new love interest for Logan... And its not bad at all.Die Hard fans of the comics will enjoy the inclusion of a host of familiar characters... Even if some have actually had their roles changed. The addition and early hint in the film of the appearance of the Silver Samurai is something to look forward to and is animated beautifully.The addition of Viper to the story was something of a surprise, as she is not an archetypal X-Men baddie... But fun none the less.So, what do we have so far... Well, we have two high end bad ass baddies, lots of fighting and a reasonable story - Despite the constant 'I love Jean Grey' Flashbacks...What you see is what you get with the Wolverine Franchise, and this is a good film. A definite one to watch... Would have been nice to see more Super Human fights though - OK! That is one area that is lacking... But still - If you are a Die Hard X-Men Fan, Even if you will pick inaccuracies with the Comics, This is a film to see.",7,0,2,20 September 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as bad as the Critcs are saying...
","OK! Just ahead of me doing an Audio Only review on YouTube on my 'Just Another Review Show' Channel - Still in its infancy, I thought I would do my usual and share a few thoughts - Relatively spoiler free - on Batman Vs Superman...And I am going to be brutal and honest IT WAS... Actually quite good! Criticisms first! How many bloody times do we need to see the Batman Origin Story? His parents were murdered in front of him as a child... We get it! The first 10 or 15 minutes is the same story AGAIN! ENOUGH ALREADY! Secondly, If you are one of the many people who has watched the Trailer expecting an all action set piece - FORGET IT! YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE!!! The Trailers are very misleading! This film is all about atmosphere and build up... It takes time to get to the meat of the story, hence many critics saying its Boring and Too Long...NO! Actually its not, Thats GOOD STORY TELLING! I have to be honest, much as I tried to avoid the hype train, Even I went in expecting things to happen a lot sooner than they did... So I am giving you fair warning - DON'T TRUST THE TRAILERS! The film is all about Build up and pay off!!! If you go in expecting that, you will enjoy the film a lot more...Finally, BaGhoul Scares!Yes, this movie has a freaking Jumpscare!!! For crying out loud Hollywood - Has this clichÃ© not done its rounds enough? Bruce Wayne having a nightmare and a bloody Jumpscare? OK! Credit where it's due.. It did make me jump - Even though its so damn obvious that its coming... But it was NOT NEEDED!!! END OF! So, That's the bad out of the way... Whats good about it? The Build up, Its atmospheric - Emotional, Maybe the more cynical and the young will not get affected by that but for me as a father, there are many points that really tug at the heart...A lot of people seem to be moaning about Ben Affleck's Batman as well... Personally, I liked him! He looks the part, and plays it damn well...Henry Cavill as Superman - If you hated Man Of Steel then you are NOT going to be on board for this film, so don't bother but again - I think he puts in a perfect performance.The shocking castings, Amy Adams returns as Lois Lane - And she once again portrays her really well... So no shock there! I am just finding hard to get used to her in serious roles after seeing her in The Muppets... But yeah she is good! And Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor... Possibly the one casting EVERYONE was worried about!!! He comes across to me as Jon Simms as 'The Master' In Doctor Who (If you have not seen them, Check them out AFTER you have seen the ORIGINAL Master in The Classic Episodes with tom Baker and Peter Davidson)...He walks a really fine line of being slightly camp to overly maniacal... And he walks that line well! Very Well! It was the one casting choice I actually thought would fall flat on its backside, but instead I was enthralled!!! It was sad not to see more from him and the diabolical plot - Well they are far better than Gene Hackman's Real Estate plans in the 1978 Superman!!! Unsung Heroes so far - Wonder Woman's appearance - Yeah! You can already see the reviews out there - She REALLY IS BAD ASS! If I was worried about a Wonder Woman Movie before, I am not now... I can really see it working but will want to see a Prequel before anything else! Obvious clues for the future - I should warn of Spoilers but we have the Internet and we all know its coming... The first glimpses of Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg...There is no avoiding it - We all knew a Justice League Movie was on the way so I do not really think its a spoiler... Disappointments here - NOT Linking The Flash into their already established show (Why not? Its done no harm to MARVEL with Agents of Shield!)...Plus Points - A Cyborg Origin Story is definitely going to happen in my view - Or needs to... And Jason Samoa as Aquaman - It is only a brief glimpse but again I am ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD to the movie even though I have NEVER LIKED AQUAMAN! So, Long and the short - The hype train has done its worst and the film due to that is going to be VERY polarising... If you are after an all action epic, Avoid it as you will be plain ANNOYED! But if you want a slow build up to a good pay off (I want to say great pay off, but I didn't really care much for the final battle... Except for seeing Wonder Woman!) then go in with open eyes and I am sure you will like it.Overall, 6 out of 10 from me - Mainly due to the Hype train....Would have been a easy 7 or even 8 had it not been built up for a fall!",6,0,3,26 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The same as my first ever YouTube Review... Worth a watch!
","Fans have waited too long to see if the Franchise can survive without Lucas.. So is the film any good?Well, Lets deal with the Critics first and look at the bad points.The film is a re-skin of Episode VI: A New Hope ... A little unfair from critics but yes there are many similarities. So is this a bad thing? George Lucas tried to experiment with the Prequels, look how that turned out!!! Long an the short, if it ain't broke - DON'T FIX IT!Poor Acting - I saw this on another reviewers comments here... And yes some of the acting is quite 'Stilted' - But hang on - The Original Trilogy which I LOVE AND ADORE had really poor acting, some really cheesy lines and they are declared MASTERPIECES!?I have to disagree... John Obayga as Finn is AMAZING and worthy of an Oscar for giving a full range of emotions in a retentively short space of time... He won't get one as Fantasy films NEVER do...Its a Bad Script - Again! So was the Original Trilogy!!!Its predictable... Sadly, this is one major downside - It is... This is not just because of the story but the Disney/Lucasfilm Marketing campaign which gave way too much time for leaks and spoilers!!!The Good... Effects are amazing, the story is EXACTLY what Fans wanted... Its fits the overall feel of the Original Trilogy without being 'Too Good' - And for all those moaning about the stilted acting, if they had been BETTER than the OT, Truly Oscar Worthy... It would have gave Disney the power to REMAKE THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY!!!THAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN!!! Ignore the hype, go in expecting a good Fantasy/Action movie without the Internet japes and you will enjoy! No its not perfect - Its not supposed to be either or it would truly destroy what we have all loved for so long!",7,0,6,20 December 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Truly Great take on a classic Genre
","Man I am so behind the times - Why has it taken so long for me to see this movie?Lets get the way as this film is EXCELLENT! Samuel L. Jackson is HILARIOUS! Colin Firth is simply Colin Firth but god damn does it work... I never had him pictured as an action hero but he pulls it off brilliantly!The film is just plain enjoyable... It takes all the greatest Bond Movie Tropes and turns them into a thoroughly entertaining movie... While at the same time throwing a lot of real life questions into the mix... Not going to go too much into that as it would spoil the movie.So for an Excellent Movie - Why only a 7?Well, yeah there are bad points and here its the old classic of Shaky Cam... I can forgive it as this was 2014 and this was pretty much a staple of most movies back then, but it makes fight scenes very hard to follow. The action IS enjoyable, but also somewhat too chaotic at times...And some of the editing is DEPLORABLE!!! Why have 3 cuts when you can have 15?No Seriously!!! Some of the action scenes cut between two different scenes up to 15 TIMES!!! The Church scene cuts between Samuel L. Jackson and the main fight over and over and over... And to be honest there is just no need for it!With that said, its a brilliantly written comedy, and has a reasonably good pace... A must see if I am honest.",7,1,4,5 February 2017
