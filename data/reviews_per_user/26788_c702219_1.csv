The Hangover," not for emotionalist or dumb people..
","in years one of the best comedies I've seen from American soil, no dumb boom bangs, no dumb teenagers, no dumb stars, actually spoken word and this is done very well.. I've been to see this in theater and everybody laughed.. don't mind me wrong, but this is almost a story for X-files, as usually if I'm trying to attend a movie, which was described as 'comedy' most of the people are turning their heads and don't believe, how dumb you must be laugh at it.. so people, go for it, its worth trying, you wont be disappointed, you actually find out yourself laughing.. :) I give it a solid 9, a big surprise for me..",9,3,8,31 August 2009
