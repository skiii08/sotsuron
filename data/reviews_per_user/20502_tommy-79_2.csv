Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great special effects, fun, but something missing
","I couldn't be classified as a Star Wars nut, probably have seen the first 3 two or three times over the years. So, I just went without too high a level of expectations.It's a pretty movie to look at, lots of good special effects. Go read 'The age of spiritual machines' by Ray Kurzweil if you want to think twice about the world of droid/robots and people...lots of robots in this movie.Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were fine as Jedi master/apprentice, and they are the depth as far the cast of the movie goes. Jake Lloyd was fun as Little Anakin, Natalie Portman reminded me much more of Princess Vespa from Spaceballs than a queen. Somehow Samuel L. Jackson wandered onto the set by mistake and ended up an executive Jedi (Lucas must have lost a bet or something).Maybe Lucas really is missing the influence of Joseph Campbell (check out some of his writings if you want a great read and wonderful set of stories...Lucus did) to develop the mythology and legacy of the picture. There's an odd nod to a big Bible story (don't want to give it away)...see if you get it. Beyond that, not too much going in the good vs. evil, path of the hero department.On another level, it's another movie with tons of guns and bloodless deaths. Sort of 'Saving Private Ryan' meets 'Starship Troopers', without the gore. (On a side note: Lots of cute creatures to lure the young kids in with, then lots of violence. Not too sure of this formula; seems like something the tobacco industry would do)All in all, a fun movie though. Just not at the same level as the first three, IMHO. Not sure if I'd take young kids to this; the 10:45PM showing I went to was packed with them.",7,0,0,22 May 1999

","Don't want to be preachy, or prudish. I don't think I'm either of those, but this movie is really nothing more than a gore-fest with a lot of nudity. The nudity was fine, cute girls and all that. But, it's essentially a torture and gross-out movie.Probably was more disturbed at the number of young kids at the show. Yeah, yeah, I know, kids are kids. But at the least, enforce the Under-17 rule. At the AMC 30 in Warrenville, IL, there were quite a few under 17 kids (and like 10-15 y/o's) that were there. It's pretty easy to get in, there is no one at the movie area itself to check the age. So, if you have a ticket to another movie, you can get in.All in all though, really not very scary, didn't actually think it was very well made either. See it for yourself and compare it to producer Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill series...those movies features about as much gore and violence, but far better made.As Steve Colbert says, 'Eli Roth, you're on warning'.And I'd add, 'AMC 30, you're on warning too for letting in lots of unescorted young kids'.Good luck, you may like it. I thought it pretty much sucked.",1,2,3,9 January 2006
