The Avengers," Short Review -- Weak weak weak
","Short review here.. Action, Action, Action, Action, Action and not much else.. Weak writing, weak characters, feels like the script was thrown together with not much thought as if they put all the actions scenes on the board first then half assed pretty much the entire story and dialogue.. It really is a film made for young kids, not one extra is shown being killed.. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next one there shooting for a PG rating only.. Ticket sales would most definitely be higher, and you know the more people you can get in that cinema seat the more $$$$ the studios will make.. Who cares if the movie is a pile of S***.. And theirs always part 2 to look forward too, to bad they're throwing that one together even faster then this one.... YIKES!!!!!! that's pretty scary...",5,4,9,22 July 2013
