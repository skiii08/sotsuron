Requiem for a Dream," Brutal but realistic
","A brutal movie from the director Darren Aronofsky. It reveals the beastly reality about the world of substances and addiction. Not just the drugs, not just for brainless teenagers but also medicins and every type of addiction. The cast is elusive! Jared Leto is an amazing actor and actually that was my first movie with him. Jennifer Connelly stood out with this movie. But that was the begging of a raw of amazing movies such as 'A Beautiful Mind' 'Blood Diamond' 'House of Sand and Fog' Movies like requiem for a dream are rare. Not only because of the script and the cast but also because of the music. All the soundtracks speaks to your soul and they fit amazing in the movieOne of the greatest movies and soundtracks ever!",9,0,1,7 April 2015
