Iron Man 3," Very Subtle Plot
","Plot - The plot was very subtle and very typical. The only twist planned(Mandarin), turned out to be a huge backfire. Characters - Very disappointed to see Mandarin(Ben Kingsley) was just a huge joke. Little Harley had an abrupt beginning and end. He was used just as a filler to fill out the logic. Aldrich Killian's role was pathetic. There was nothing impressive about him or about his intentions, he is just 'yet another villain'. Only good thing was Robert Downey Jr, he played his role with a cocky attitude and a style that's very unique to him. VFX - Awesome visuals in ripping Stark's Mansion apart. The last 30 minutes was a bummer, felt like I was watching transformers and a random mob war with a lot of havoc. Audio - The audio quality was very poor especially the BGM (it makes all the difference), I'm not sure whether it is like it everywhere or just in the theater I saw. Round up - Very juvenile in all the three genres(Sci-Fi, action, thriller) it's classified under. It gives you some laugh here and there, but ultimately leaves you with tears for having spent so much money on watching it.",4,14,28,27 April 2013
Gravity," The dance of beauty and thrill
","The whole movie is a feast for the eyes; especially if you're into space- photography, you'd love the majestic Earth as the backdrop and the bokeh effects created here and there by the rising sun The plot was pretty neat and carried out with no glitches. Some scenes might remind you of the movie - Mission To Mars. There are some scenes that would raise your heart beat to the speed of light! Intense space-drift thrill is coupled beautifully with the music. The credits score at the end really deserves to be mentioned. Sandra Bullock was at her best and George Clooney played his supporting role beautifully.It really is amazing to see that our VFX has come so far, this movie must get the appreciation it deserves with the Academy Award or for the VFX alone, at the very least. To sum up, you'd leave the theater with goosebumps for having embarked on this breath taking 'space odyssey'.",9,2,5,12 October 2013
