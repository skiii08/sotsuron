Your Name.," What am I missing?
",I can't get past the awful voice characterizations - all the grunting and what you usually have in American dubbed anime. The artwork and animation is stunning but can't hold my attention.,3,3,16,23 March 2018
Aquaman," Meh . . .
","I guess movies like this get made because of the profits to the studios and the investors, regardless of how trite these over the top superhero films have become. Aquaman is text book formulaic and reminded me of a combination of Gladiator, Star Wars and Finding Nemo - lol. I quickly became fatigued and could not finish it.",6,1,2,30 March 2019
Collateral," Excellent film . . .
",Say what you want about Tom Cruise but he delivers an extremely authentic performance - I was stunned. I am writing this December 2017 and I was also very impressed with the image and sound quality (on Blu Ray) of a film from 2004. Looking forward to seeing it again.,8,0,2,26 December 2017
Incredibles 2," Too busy and not enough heart
","To say I was anticipating this movie would be a huge understatement. The first one was so amazing. One of the few movies that I have watched over, and over, and over. A straight forward and simple story that emphasized love, family, and good conquering evil. One protagonist and a very clear plot line. Who didn't get choked up when Syndrome sends rockets that destroy the plane the Helen and the kids are coming on to save their dad 'mayday may day, there are children on board!' And the way they all came together as a team - so wonderful. Incredibles II is just too busy and goes off in too many directions. Too many new (repugnant and uninteresting) characters. I watched it through once and have tried on three occasions to re-watch it. I am probably selling it short and will enjoy it in the future, but that is my opinion at the moment.",7,3,3,15 March 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Just awful . . . an insult to the intelligence
","Everything bad everyone else said I guess. Just so contrived and formulaic and unrealistic. I just don't understand the positive reviews . . . Does IMDB get kick backs or something? Technically, it's flawless in it's image and sound quality but wow, couldn't they have listened to the military consultants I know they must have hired? The younger brother comes to the breakfast table and says 'I'm going to enlist' or words to that effect, and he, lol, is, hilariously, already in uniform. They used every cliche from every war movie from the last twenty years - I found it cringe worthy. Not to diminish what Desmond Doss accomplished but dang, they really missed an opportunity to do it justice . . . too bad.",1,15,29,16 August 2018
