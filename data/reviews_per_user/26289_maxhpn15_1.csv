The Sound of Music," Awesome
","This is kind of a spoiler.This is an awesome musical! I think the actors did EXCELLENT! It would've been hard for the younger actors/actresses to memorize the dance moves, songs, and lines.(and for the other characters too) My favorite would have to be Brigitta, i can relate her to myself, she looks like me when i was younger too!I also liked th other characters especially Leisel. I auditioned for The Sound Of Music at the local theater. I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, I rate it a 10, Scale 1-100 I rate it 99.99%. I especially love You Are Sixteen Going On 17, Eidelweiss, The Sound Of Music (of course),and Climb Evry Mountain. These Are A Few Of My Favorite Things about The Sound Of Music!",10,1,7,13 January 2007
