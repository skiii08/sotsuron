The Blair Witch Project," A tad overhyped, but still good
","Cynics has butchered this movie into pieces, calling it nothing but cheap footage of three people screaming, swearing and smoking. I thought I was going to be one of those cynics, but after viewing, I was pleasantly surprised. Okay, so the hype may be excessive, and the editing was a bit too neat for it be considered 'real footage', but overall it was a genuinely creepy, thoroughly fascinating and innovatively made film. It's not very scary, definitely not as terrifying as 'The Exorcist', but it's harrowingly realistic footage style is a refreshing change from everyday blood-and-guts material. 'The Blair Witch Project' has been called 'a masterpiece' and 'brilliant', I wouldn't go that far, but it's movie that definitely stands above the rest, proving that the most effective chills are through minimalism. The two eeriest parts for me were the 'What the f**k is that???!' chase through the woods (which looked extremely menacing) and the very final scene, which was just chilling to bone. The performances by the three actors were impressive, especially Heather Donahue's. Although they are screaming hysterically at each other most of the time, we were still able understand perfectly why they were so angry and terrified. More information on the Blair witch would of made the movie a bit more clearer, we would of known what exactly was so horrific about her, the makers should of made Heather recite more passages out of her book. The famous 'I'm so sorry' speech given by Heather near the end unfortunately had no effect on me, but I'm pretty sure it wigged out some people. So in all, 'The Blair Witch Project' has a few flaws, but it's definitely a horror film worth seeing.",8,1,1,29 August 1999
Fight Club," For the most part solid, but bizarre ending throws whole thing off course
","'Fight Club' is a jarring and often thought-provoking satire about people fighting against the system, and the explosive violence that could erupt when humanity starts to retaliate against society and it's confinements. It's dark social commentary basically points out the fact that man's search for self-identity and value can only be achieved through raw violence, because that is the only way a man can find out just how powerful he is, letting go of life's monotonous routine and deconstructing himself in every possible way. The film's gritty and unflinching portrayal of havoc breaking loose, mentally and physically, is at times hard to swallow, but overall it is a pretty fascinating thing to watch,  and only it's strengthened by the lead performances and a caustic script. Edward Norton is great as a bored business man who begins to explore the satisfaction of destruction and rebellion, and Brad Pitt is simply terrific as the fearless sociopath who guides Norton through this journey, he successfully keeps his character believably complex. 'Fight Club' is pretty much a solid movie for the most part, but for some reason it derails into bizarre psychological revelation in the last third. In many ways it is weakly established, especially the conclusion, and it just throws the whole movie off-course. But in the long run, 'Fight Club' is strong enough to keep the virtues outweighing the flaws, and it is overall still an audacious and powerful film that will keep you laughing, cringing and thinking all the way through.",8,0,2,16 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Excruciatingly Overrated
","I hate this film with a burning passion! There is no way that I will ever appreciate one aspect about this movie, from beginning to end I was stunned by just how dull, uninvolving and pointless it was. There is no reason why it had to be made, what are the film makers trying to prove, that William Shakespeare had sex too? I do admire Shakespeare's work, and I do believe that he is probably the best play writer in history, but if someone was going to make a sem-fictional film about his life, they could of at least made it moving and engaging, qualities completely absent here. The 1999 Academy Awards made a dreadful mistake by naming this Best Picture instead of 'Saving Private Ryan', which was an immensely better film in so many ways. Just watching 5 seconds of it would be more entertaining than watching 'Shakespeare in Love''s entire length. But aside from all my negative comments, I can't deny the fact Joseph Fienne's performance as Shakespeare was excellent, and Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal as his lover was fine as well, but it was far from being Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchette's performance as Queen Elizabeth was definitely better than Paltrow's, it's just a shame that the Academy made so many bad choices. A truly disappointing film.",4,3,7,6 August 1999
American Pie," A fusion of raunchiness and warmth
","'American Pie' is not you average teen flick. It's reputation for being raunchy and outrageous is totally justified, given the fact that it does refer to, and sometimes show, everything involved with sex, from bodily fluids to masturbation to using food as a a metaphor for third base. It's sort of like a 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' touched with 'There's Something About Mary' grossness. Believe it or not, this film is relentlessly honest when it examines teen guys, with their consistently raging hormones, driving them to explore just about everything. Yeah, it does get a bit silly at times, but is also, strangely, illuminates alot of information about teens adults don't know about, or probaly don't wanna believe. But it's not like the lead characters are one-dimensional youths trying to get laid, there are actually some touching moments near the end where they come to realisation that relationships and love will always be more fulfilling than scoring. 'American Pie' manages to successfully combine hilarious toilet-humour with warmth, and it owes a lot of credit towards the performances, everyone showcases potential, including Jason Biggs. Okay, so it's gags do get a but tiresome, and some character's don't develop well, but overall 'American Pie' is a teen comedy worth watching.",7,0,0,23 December 1999
The Shining," Eerie, Tense, Memorable
","'The Shining' is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I`ve seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. It may not be faithful to the Stephen King book, but it still manages to have an intensely eerie tone to, even though any traces of a plot are practically absent. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as always, and his descent into sheer madness is one of the most entertaining things about the movie, especially when he finally snaps, and turns against his own wife and son. Stanley Krubick has been called mysterious, and there is no doubt about it in this movie, almost every scene has some sort of obscurity to it, some mystery, and it forces to the viewer to feel at least a little bit frightened. Krubick is actually quite brilliant in the way he transforms almost every seemingly normal thing into something menacing, such as the snow-bound atmosphere, a set of twin girls, and even some shots of hallways and rooms gave me chills! In a critical way, 'The Shining' is not a great film, there isn`t much substance, clarity or depth, but at the same time, you can`t help but be engrossed by it`s strikingly different style and effect. 'The Shining' may not hold up to close fault-finding, but it`s certainly one of the most exceptional horror movies ever made.",Null,77,130,3 July 1999
American Beauty," One of the year's finest
","Watching 'American Beauty' is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly 'perfect' suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, 'American Beauty' is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. 'American Beauty' shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film.",10,6,9,10 October 1999

American Beauty," Visually Arresting, Mentally Provocative, Emotionally Shattering
","'American Beauty' is in many ways like a rose itself; On the outside, its surrounded with a captivating beauty, but as you get involved with it, you will understand with great pain and sadness that it also comes along with sharp, nasty thorns.
     This is not your everyday American satire, instead, it is a stunning combination of family drama, character study, illicit love story, social commentary and modern tragedy. Sam Mendes has brilliantly created a film that displays the true beast that rages behind the walls of a perfect suburban home, and proves that the saying 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' is nothing less than the truth. 'American Beauty' has many elements that make it work, the main thing that struck me about this film was that even with it's scathing story of two families tragic exploration of moral decay and happiness, it still successfully combined both provocative humour and brutal honesty.  I was  astonished with it's overall sense of sincerity, it penetrated right into the dark heart of American society.
    Another thing that makes this film soar is it's profundity, I was overwhelmed with it's enormous rush of richly layered meanings and thoughts, you will not believe how deeply it will impact your mind.
    But of course, what would a film be without the performances? Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply spectacular as the couple stuck in a loveless marriage, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley are equally as impressive. The way this film explores these character's lives is remarkable, there is a consistent tone of complexity and truth in these people, and even though they couldn't be more flawed, we still sympathise and identify with them on so many levels.     'American Beauty' is definitely one of the best films of 1999, it shines with intelligence, imagination and heart. A triumph.",10,0,0,6 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," An Extraordinary Achievement
","Usually war films don`t appeal to me, but Steven Spielberg's latest hype-drenced film, 'Saving Private Ryan', did look like a remarkable film, so I watched it. I have to say, from beginning to end, I could not take my eyes off the film for one second, it was absolutely compelling, almost in a a surreal way. I have never seen such a film as this one, Steven Spielberg triumphantly proved to the world once again after 'Schindler's List', just what a phenomenal director he is, it totally baffled me how he could of crafted such a physically and emotionally complicated with virtual flawlessness. There are two major battle scenes , one in the beginning and one in the end, and they are both extremely harrowing. The first one burns with unflinching realism, you almost feel like you`re right there with the soldiers instead of watching them on a screen. It shows just how terrifying the war really was, every form of anihilation and destruction is captured on film. The second one is a bit more sombre, mainly because the audience has gotten to known the main characters, and after witnessing some of their deaths, our feelings and sympathy and sorrow are evoked. The performances given by Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, and the rest of 'the crew' (Forgot their names, but are all enormously talented) are all exceptional. They all have diverse personalities, but when they put in serious situations, we powerfully sense their shared emotions of instinct, terror, longing and grief. 'Saving Private Ryan''s power comes mainly from it`s clear moral, as it proves just how tragic the war really was, and the devastating impact it had on the world and humanity. The story may be fictitious, but the movie still enables us to have a pretty good idea of the savage violence that rampaged the earth during the wars, all while asking the ulimate question; Was there any reason AT ALL why this had to happen? It was a question that lingered in my mind for days afterwards. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a truly extraordinary film.",9,0,0,22 July 1999
Good Will Hunting," Excellent
","'Good Will Hunting' is not one of those conventional Hollywood dramas that are filled with sentimental moments, melodramatic situations and stereotypical characters. It is a film that  focuses on realistic characters, their complex lives and the things life has to give them, whether they want them or not. Something every human being can relate too. 'Good Will Hunting' is a genuinely good film, that has qualities I consider a rarity these days in movies. This may sound over the top, but this movie will most likely be one of the most memorable dramas of the 90`s.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck`s honest and invigorating script transfers almost perfectly onto the big screen, with the help of director Gus Van Sant. 'Good Will Hunting' is about a young, cocky but deeply troubled young man named Will Hunting. He lives in South Boston with his street bum friends, but there`s something that separates him from the rest; He`s a genius. After an MIT professor accidentally discovers his gift, Will`s life starts to change, more dramatically than he thinks. Two strangers almost simultaneously then enter Will`s life; Sean Maguire, a widowed psychologist who tries to help Will, played greatly by Robin Williams. And Skylar (played equally as good by Minnie Driver), a vibrant Harvard student who quickly falls in love with Will. Will`s relationship with both them and his blue-collar friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all seem to deeply affect him, making it more difficult for Will to realise what he truly needs. The ending of the film sort of leaves you hanging, but you will no doubt me moved. 'Good Will Hunting' is pretty down-to-earth film, but it is enriched with an indescribable power that is probably generated by all the exceptional performances, the script and Gus Van Sant`s unparalleled direction. A satisfying, powerful and thought-provoking movie.",9,1,4,18 March 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," An abomination of cinema
","I rented this film with high hopes, thinking that it would a be gripping, stylish and explosive film. After I finished watching it, I was utterly appalled. This has got to be the most vile, pointless, repulsive film ever made!! The first 20 minutes were intriguing, sort of like a 'Pulp Fiction' plot, but it just cheapened into a silly gore-fest, with nothing but vampire/monster slaughtering and crappy dialogue. I have never been so sickened in my life, this film was so horrible. George Clooney`s performance was alright, but Quentin Tarintino was so incredibly annoying.  I also found the film`s depiction of women very sexist, I am positive that there is no woman on earth that found this film appealing or flattering at all.",Null,0,0,10 May 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," Imperfect, but interesting
","'Girl, Interrupted' does not cover a lot of new territory. You can call it a female version of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' as both films deal with the issue of mental insanity, and are shown from and insider's perspective of how it's really like, and the way society reacts towards people who are institutions. So, this is not a film that breaks new ground, but it is still an interesting one. Flawed, yes, mainly due to it's unfocused plot and lack of emphasis on some situations, but overall the film is worth watching. It's a candid look at the 60's, as people who did not know where they were going, or did not have a solid plan, would be deemed crazy. The protagonist, played well by Winona Ryder, is sort of like a lost adolescent who finds herself indifferent towards life, and ends up being locked up, only to realise that sometimes it's the world who causes people to lash out, not themselves. We are taken into her long journey inside a mental hospital, introducing us to a handful of 'loonies' who are both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch. Angelina Jolie steals the show playing a wild sociopath who befriends Ryder during her stay, it's affecting to know that she was actually a real person. Brittany Murphy is also a standout, her character is profoundly tragic, I don't think she will get out her my head anytime soon. The story moves at a decent pace, and has many memorable moments, but for some reason, loses it's edge during the climax, resorting to melodrama in order to evoke emotions. But despite it's weaknesses, 'Girl, Interrupted' is still a thoughtful study of a young woman's discovery of hope during a time of despair.",7,1,1,15 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A Perfect Vision of Sexual Jealousy and Obsession
","Stanley Krubick's death is definitely one of the main reasons why this film, 'Eyes Wide Shut', is surrounded with so much hype and anticipation, however, after watching the film, it is safe to say that the movie does live it up the all the expectations that the country is holding for themselves, there is no doubt about. 'The Shining' is the only Kubrick film that I have seen before this one, so I was not very aware of his direction style. But as his death generated a lot of buzz, causing everyone to express just how brilliant a director he was, it sparked my curiousity furiously as to what his final film would be like. Comparitively, 'The Shining' is a horror classic, and 'Eyes Wide Shut' is the current 'hot' movie that everyone is talking about, but both films clearly manifested a stunning power, a visual, mental and spiritual exploration. The theme of this movie is sexual obssession, and the whole thing is just one mesmerising, thought-provoking odyssey through the streets of N.Y.C at night, seen through the perspective of Tom Cruise, who delivers a fine performance playing the troubled husband of a beautiful but difficult woman (Nicole Kidman) who is trying find the heart of his own enigmatic sexuality. The movie keeps on giving the audience a slew of characters who meet Cruise along his journey, and each one subtlely brings out new-found insights into his own mentality, bringing him closer to his destination. Feelings of envy and obsession are intensely sensed throughout the whole film, and I am totally amazed with the way Krubick crafted the film with such sharpness, you can literally feel of his ambitions, even when the actual content is deliberately vague. When Cruise finally reaches his destination, everything just seems to collide, making him fully understand the true meaning of sexuality. The final confrontation between Cruise and Kidman is absolutely unforgettable, as it honestly depicts the extreme complications that exist in marriage. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is definitely a film that will leave you thinking about the instincts of humanity, and how they are ultimately one of the most puzzling things on this earth. A brilliant film.",Null,0,1,19 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," Offbeat but excellent
","Original doesn`t even begin to describe 'Pulp Fiction.' How about 'ground-breaking' or 'extremely innovative'. Being probably one of the most distinctive films of the 1990`s, 'Pulp Fiction' is an offbeat, gritty, but hysterically funny film about two hitmen, their boss, his crack-addicted wife, a boxer and a few eccentric but fascinating characters and and their bizarre stories. There are about 4 or 5 stories in this film (I can`t remember, I saw this a year ago), that all overlap each other, and they`re not in chronological order either. It sometimes can be confusing, but I`m sure you`ll be able to understand it. The script for this film is sheer genius, as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, the two hitmen, argue about everything from Big Macs to shooting someone in the back of their car. Uma Thurman is radiant as the unconventional, junkie who likes to dance and crack silly jokes. 'Pulp Fiction' doesn`t really have a plot, it sort of like a collection of a few stories, that don`t really go anywhere. There a few bloody moments, but you`ll be laughing hysterically, it`s THAT MUCH of a black comedy. The film`s low budget is very visible, but that just creates an even more raw atmosphere. 'Pulp Fiction' is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy an outrageously funny, startlingly original and dark film, this is for you.",Null,0,0,4 April 1999
Scream 2," Not very good
","First of all, 'Scream' is a horror film that can`t possibly be outshined when it comes to slasher flicks, at least not by any made in this decade. It`s the movie that made a breakthrough in the horror genre in the 90`s, and it`s just a shame that churned out so many mediocre clones, including it`s own sequel. I didn`t really have high expectations for 'Scream 2', I estimated that it would be a reasonbly good follow-up, but nothing special. After I viewed it, I was quite disappointed. 'Scream 2' lacks a lot of the first 'Scream'`s virtues, including cleverness and suspense, and even though there were some traces of those qualities,( with the exception of irony, which was quite well done) it felt like they were just recycled from before. Don`t get me wrong, there a few moments that are scary, but it`s shock value doesn`t do much for the overall movie. The reunion between some of the principal characters were cheesy, and they got old very fast. None of them seemed to have the same zest as they did in the first one, not even the most eccentric ones. Also, a lot of the death scenes were very unbelievable, people get butchered in broad daylight and on public streets and still nobody seems to be around to notice.  But the worst part about 'Scream 2' was probably its climax, suspense was completely absent, and some parts of it were quite humourous instead of frightening. When the killers expose themselves, the movie already starts to wane, probaly because nobody knows anything about them, and frankly, no one cares either. The resolution is sketchy, and conveniently almost all of the survivors of the first 'Scream' live on. In simple words, 'Scream 2' has its moments, but it`s not a worthy sequel.",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
Scream," Thrilling
","'Scream' is a sharp, startling and thrilling slasher movie that deserves all the praise that it received. I strongly believe that is the most influential horror films of the 90`s, it revived the dying horror genre. Instead of recycling cliches that have been used to a tedious extent, 'Scream' is brilliantly created with it`s own ironic, mocking style. The script is one of the film`s main highlights, as it constantly delivers references to other classic horror films, while it takes place in one at the same time. The film certainly entertains as well, from the first nerve-jangling twenty minutes to the electric climax, 'Scream'`s wit and scariness is impossible to ignore. All the characters in the movie are complex and believable, mainly because the actors who play them are fit perfectly for the role (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Courteney Cox, etc.) and second, because they actually have brains.(Unlike the conventional 'Help me, I`m being stabbed repeatedly'! kind of bimbos seen in inferior slasher flicks). If gore is a problem for people, this movie is a lot of it, but not to a repulsive degree. 'Scream' never ceased to surprise me, not even after the climax was over, and I don`t think it will for most people either. A great movie.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Carrie," Chilling
","The horror classic, 'Carrie', is not just a one-dimensional horror film, instead it is a rare combination of high school drama, science-fiction/fantasy, and tragic horror. It is a very chilling film in the way it concentrates on teenagers, sexual repression and terrifying retaliation. Director Brian De Palma did an excellent job unraveling the film`s plot, and attracting attention to its important elements. Sissy Spacek`s performance as the title character, Carrie White, is remarkable, and it is the film`s main highlight. What makes the movie so interesting is that the 'force of terror' of the story is just a shy, teenage girl who also happens to possess telekinetic powers. Carrie is taunted by her classmates, tyrannised by her religion-frenzied mother (played superbly by Piper Laurie) and still must understand her sexual outbreak of psychic forces. Carrie`s compassion-deprived life is almost difficult to watch, and it makes the viewer feel sympathy towards her. 'Carrie' is well known for its prom scene climax. Brian De Palma`s famous camera tricks are present here. It may not seem realistic, but that`s because not everyone has psychic powers. The film shows just what might happen if someone gets pushed too far, and the violent retribution they would put in effect. What makes 'Carrie' such an effective film that it 'fantasizes' about revenge in a cruel adolescent society, but still remains grounded on how even the most innocent person can be driven over the edge.",9,0,0,15 May 1999
Carrie," Great movie
","'Carrie' is basically a film that shows how destructive human anger can be. A true horror classic, director Brian de Palma made 'Carrie' a film that no one else could touch.  To some, this film isn`t scary at all. I partially agree, the first sixty minutes of this film can almost pass for a drama. On the other hand, 'Carrie' exudes a distinctive eeriness and intensity that is more effective than blatant gore and horror. Sissy Spacek`s performance as Carrie White is nothing less than brilliant. Piper Laurie is equally good, playing Carrie`s religion-frenzied, psychotic mother.  High school has always been a hot concept for films, and this film focuses on a real adolescent issue; adolescent cruelty. It can be painful and unpleasant, but for Carrie White,it was pure hell. To top it off, she has to endure her mother`s madness AND understand her new-found psychic powers.  De Palma`s stylish but gloomy direction makes this film riveting, from beginning to end. 'Carrie' also possesses a quality that a lot of horror films do not, poignancy. You can easily sympathize for Carrie and her sad life. Even when she unleashes her powers, destroying everything in her path at the end. The conclusion of 'Carrie' is very disturbing and almost upsetting, because the protagonist`s battle to win some compassion ends terrifyingly and tragically. Carrie`s deadly wrath was unfairly triggered, but she had to pay the ultimate price. Powerful and chilling, 'Carrie' is a horror film that should be enjoyed, appreciated and cherished.",9,0,0,21 March 1999

This harrowing, chilling and riveting movie takes a look at a very popular subject; adolescent cruelty.  Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a withdrawn and sexually repressed misfit who also possesses psychic powers. Brian De Palma`s famous prom scene is electrifying, but it is the final scene between Carrie and her mother that will both disturb and haunt you. 'Carrie' is a very distinctive horror film, that combines chilling horror and tragic poignancy, creating a genuinely good movie that should be watched again and again.",9,0,0,17 March 1999
The Sixth Sense," Intriguing, moving, but nothing extraordinary
","'The Sixth Sense' doesn't really make 'sense' to me. After listening to all the hype and seeing the massive money it's raking in, I thought it would be a memorable and effective movie. Well, it didn't really turn out that way for me, I can safely say that it was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's fairly good, but it doesn't quite deliver all the goods like it seems to. I think the main thing that keeps this film's quality from declining are it's performances and it's rich sense of poignancy. Terror doesn't seem to strike very largely or often, with the exception of it's eerie atmosphere and one 'jump scene', frights are practically absent. The child (forgot his name) delivers an excellent performance as the tortured boy who sees dead people, he breathes life into what could of been an annoying, one-dimensional character. I thought Bruce Willis was going to be mediocre, considering that this is his first 'serious' role, but he was surprisingly convincing as the boy's counsellor. Toni Collette's character was sketchy, but the complicated relationship between her and her son really affected me, it was actually quite moving, especially towards the end. The movie's main flaw is it's sluggish pace and occasionally wooden script, there were some parts that just didn't persuade me, like there was zero power. To be honest, the whole ghost aspect of the film's story was quite weak, it seemed to be more of a backdrop than a plot, but it did quickly get better when it reached the shocking conclusion. All in all, 'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie in some ways and a fair one in others, overall, it's really the performances that keeps this film worthwhile and interesting.",Null,0,0,8 October 1999
The Breakfast Club," Over-rated film
","'The Breakfast Club' is an altogether mediocre film, that could have  been a lot better, except that its major flaws tainted the rest of the movie`s good quality.  This supposedly teen classic has a pretty basic but interesting plot that intrigued me; five very different teens stuck in a library for a whole day, serving detention. After I viewed the film, I was let down. The beginning of the film was quite slow, it took quite a long time for the 'heart pouring' near the end, which felt kind of rushed and forced.  Practically all the characters were one-dimensional and stereotypical, (the jock, the princess, the tough guy, the nerd, etc). The only exception was the basket-case girl, whom I admit, left me cracking up every second with her scathingingly funny remarks.  The biggest problem of the film though, is the ending. For some strange reason, the princess and tough guy magically fall in love, even though they were at each other`s throats before. That fraction of the film just irritated me. 'The Breakfast Club' could have been a great movie, but its major flaws stand out too much to be ignored.",Null,2,7,10 March 1999
The Breakfast Club," Fairly good
","I had heard a few positive things about this film, that it was a very original, humorous, moving, and accurate film on teenagers in the 1980`s. After I viewed the film, I got mixed feelings. Altogether the film was fairly good, but there were a lot of flaws in it that just subtracted from the film`s quality.  Sure, there were a few memorable parts of the film, some of the witty and comical, and others that were realistically poignant. The film`s plot was pretty basic; Five very different, almost stereotypical teenagers are forced to stay in a library for a whole day, serving detention. At first they can`t connect, but they ultimately bare their souls to each other. John Hughes did quite a good job constructing some real depth out of it. Now, it is time to review the film`s downside. The conclusion of the film was that bothered me the most. I don`t want to say what happens, but it is positively the weakest part of the film that just stands out too much to be ignored.  The beginning of the film is also quite slow, it sort of takes a long time for the story to unravel.
