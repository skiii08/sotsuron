Blade Runner 2049," cash cow
","Another one that's taken several attempts to get through I mean I fell asleep sleepwalked to the pub had three beers & games of pool came back home woke up & didn't miss a thing.Boring,tedious & unnecessarily slow just a cash grab,had none of the mystique or characters of the first we get the point of the visuals & all the rest but why did everything have to be in ultra slow mo",1,11,19,3 June 2019
Fury," furry
","Meandered through with a tiny,tiny thread of believability......until the end,waking everyone out of a confused stupor with 'they're coming'......'who's coming?' err well seeing as how you're in Germany during ww2 one shouldn't need multiple choices.Wasnt just that the whole ending was total hokum claptrap,silly beyond imagination.",1,1,4,3 November 2019
World War Z," world wwwurrr....zzzzzzzzzzz
","The first time I saw this we were also imbibing a few ales so although I thought a few things odd still found it somewhat entertaining,but,after watching it again found it quite annoying amongst other things.
The first thing the inexplicable ability of a rubbish truck to maintain infinite speed through a static traffic jam especially if possibly being 'driven' by a zombie,then to be the luckiest,out of many thousands,to find an abandoned driveable campervan in the middle of the city.Then we get to the supermarket where hundreds if not thousands have already plundered & yet there's still stuff on the shelves,not just that but while everyone else is in hysterics these guys,mainly the kids,are as calm as if they're frolicking around during a family picnic.
Anyway this will take longer than the movie itself so let's just go to points
Hubbys of to save the world possibly not to return alive as we know it & he doesn't even get a kiss or a teary goodbye.
A giant plane noisy plane lands but only stirs a handful of zombs but a phone truly does wake the dead.
A giant four engine plane takes less fuel than a lawnmower.
Whilst in a helicopter make sure you fly low enough for zombs to grab hold of it.
Lopping a persons hand off will be all good once wrapped with a dirty rag.
A grenade in a plane is fine because you two will survive & the already undead wont.
Then the last half hour is just tacked on nap time.
In conclusion & retrospect...beer really does make some things better",1,0,5,12 April 2019
Interstellar," space ghost
","One tip for movie makers when making said movie use actors that one can understand,even with subtitles I can't understand what m.m. says like having marbles in his mouth tom hardys the same.As far this movies concerned what starts with some reasonable ideas soon turns into a ghost story",2,2,7,4 March 2019
American Hustle," no chemistry or cohesion
",Lawrence totally ruined.overacted this rather disjointed fizzer,1,2,6,27 January 2018
Rush," wooden at best
","Instead of a decent movie about a great rivalry of teams & drivers howard turned it into a childish shaky camera hand job.Really boring to start & Hemsworth as wooden as ever,then when the action starts it's this silly shaky zoom in & out of wheel nut.Over hyped & really not well acted using the term extremely loosely style over substance",1,6,17,1 February 2019
U-571," laughably stupid
","I remember first trying to watch this tripe when it first was released & then only managed 25-30 minutes,it was mind numbing stupid & just something annoying & incromprehensible about McConaughey.Well twas on recently & tried to watch again & it hasn't got any better there are so many inconceivably ridiculous things let the actuality of the event.Just to name a few a bunch of u.s. navy guys that cant speak or read a word of german take over a german u boat get chased by a destroyer the likes of which have never been seen,because it's a tug boat,& blow it out of the water with one extremely lucky shot.Before that they're releasing oil,debris & a body with a vest on before the depth charges are even released & a vest aint gonna help you when you're getting blown out of a sub at 100 or metres but nah the germans 'bought it'.Theres so many more ridiculously stupid things its almost a comedy this & pearl harbour just suck this is definitely total rubbish",1,1,4,26 May 2018
The Departed," not worth the hype
","Saw this again as a friend hadn't previously & I actually couldn't stand to watch anymore the first time due mainly to damon.The highly forced & often disappearing accent & totally,broomstick up my ass,wooden 'actng' from damon just drove me crazy.Even Jack,of whom I'm a big fan,really overdid it where as the joker etc was great this was just poorly & tackily scripted.The story of the newcomer becoming the boss's main man has been done to death & as mentioned by others out of small crew suddenly can't figure out who's the mole.Then there's whiny DiCaprio taking on 2 mafioso's,the meteoric rise through the ranks of both characters,no IAD or senior officials investigations although the mole in the department seemed to be common knowledge.
Anyway the whole thing seemed overdone,forced & disjointed compared to the IA it's based on & nowhere near Goofellas etc..The only really convincing one in the whole thing was Ray Winstone,as usual,everyone else seemed either too forced & stereotypical or just pointlessly bickering.But the main reason I couldn't watch the whole thing the first time was damon I just couldn't take his terrible 'actng' there's plenty more to dislike about this but enough for now.",1,3,6,5 September 2018
