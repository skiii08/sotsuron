Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was worth the 16 year wait since ROTJ
","I was lucky enough to see the latest installment as part of a charity event last night which helped raise money for the Children's Hospital of Denver. Below is my summary of The Phantom Menace.  Don't worry, there are no details to ruin it for you.My biggest fear with this movie would be that I was going to be let down after hyping this moment in my head for 16 years.  I can safely say that this didn't happen.  I was thrilled with this movie from the opening moment (standard Star Wars scrolling prologue) to the end.  Needless to say the effects were top notch.  The sound was even better.  My whole body vibrated every time a ship flew by.  The light saber fighting was intense.  The scenery was beautiful - I want to live on Naboo!  The underwater scenes had some incredible creatures.  The pod race scene was amazing - worth the movie alone.  What I really liked were the little hilarious details going on in places in the middle of tense action sequences.  I will definitely see this many times to see new things I'm sure I missed the first time.The characters were really good too.  Lots of critics have slammed this for being silly and too cute - kinda like Return of the Jedi.  The character Jar Jar Binks (the goofy one with long ears in the previews) will probably annoy some people.  I liked him though.  He reminded me of Inspector Clouseau - sovling problems and saving the day through bumbling without evening realizing it.  Good comic relief.  The kid playing Anakin Skywalker was really good.  Liam Neesen is a great Jedi Master.  Natalie Portman plays a believable young Queen.  She's going to be huge after this movie.This movie was tense, funny, and vivid all in one.  You will not be disappointed!  A previous reviewer nailed it on the head when he said - 'How long until the next one?'  I can't wait.",Null,0,0,17 May 1999
