Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece.
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel that measures equally to its predecessor, a masterpiece in its own right. However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays 'K' and Harrison Ford who returns as 'Rick Deckard', act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen. Under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 shows that he is one of the most talented directors and one of the few masters of storytelling in the movie business today.",10,9,21,5 November 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A new perspective into the Star Wars universe
","Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards, is the first standalone film in the Star Wars saga and by far the most intriguing in the franchise. Set as a prequel to Episode 4: A New Hope, Rogue One brings in a group of unknown rebels led by Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), as they travel to new worlds to find the plans to the Death Star, devised by her father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelson). Gareth Edwards, who's other major films include 'Godzilla' and 'Monsters', brings in a new perspective into the Star Wars universe, combining characters and action so well, you'll leave the theater buzzing for more (even when you realize that it leaves you right off a New Hope). The plot to Rogue One is very simple, but it's the characters that really take this movie to new heights. The likes of Jyn, Captain Andor (Diego Luna), K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk), Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) make this movie worth watching (other than it being a Star Wars film). The droid, K-2S0, was the stand-out secondary character, able to bring great sources of humour while still being of use. But the real star of the show was Jyn Erso, with Felicity Jones doing a great job as the female lead. She is tough, rebellious and reckless, making her a well-crafted character, that has a great backstory.Though Star Wars creates great protagonists, Rogue One's main antagonist Orson Krennic is definitely up there with the best. Ben Mendelsohn is powerful, able to give you a villain that any Star Wars fan would want. The action was also spectacular, with the final climatic fight one of the best in the franchises history, which is definitely saying something. Full of wonder and delight, you never drift your eyes away from the screen, with the special effects staff deserving full recognition as they recreate some of the characters of the originals.It seems hard to not mention Darth Vader, so I will. He has little screen-time, but for every second he is in, he steals the show. One scene in particular was very special, as we see him in action for the first time in years.Overall, Rogue One is a Star Wars movie that really takes you on a different journey from what you would be used to. It connects itself so well to the beginning of A New Hope, you could combine both movies with no problem. The cast and crew deserve the credit for the effort they made in creating a standalone film in the biggest franchise in movie history. Though the most 'war-like' of the 8 films, it still has moments of levity spread throughout, which reminds you of the original Star Wars spirit. It stands alone in the saga, and I believe it stands as one of the best.",9,8,17,15 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Marvel's most audacious film to date.... and it pays off
","Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-'that's what heroes do'. The 'Revengers' as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), 'his friend from work', Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",9,51,91,30 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-man: Homecoming proves that Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-man
","The enduring presence of Spiderman on the big screen over the past fifteen years presumably caused a little fatigue once news spread of the third depiction of the crime-fighting hero. However, Spiderman: Homecoming fails to induce such feelings as the exuberant Tom Holland masters the role as Peter Parker in almost every way. After seeing him briefly in Captain America: Civil War and now under the wings of Marvel Studios, the introduction of Spiderman into the ever-expanding MCU proves to be an incredibly entertaining ride. Spiderman: Homecoming is a very well directed film, as Jon Watts gives us a joyful adventure of the teenager Peter Parker who troubles to find the balance between his personal and superhero life. Still consumed by the actions he took against the likes of Captain America in Civil War, Peter Parker becomes a desperate man, hoping to join the Avengers and impress Tony Stark aka Iron Man, who acts as his mentor. It is with this mentality that he becomes entrenched into the Spiderman persona that has severe ramifications on his social life, both at home and at school. And as the nerdy and unpopular teenager, he uses his hidden persona to define his own sense of duty and morals. As seen in one of the trailers, Tony Stark chastises Peter, quoting, 'If your nothing without this suit, you shouldn't have it'. Tom Holland develops great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr in all their scenes, however, Tony Starks appearance doesn't shy away from the fact that this is a Spiderman film. This is a film that is grounded to Spiderman, and Spiderman only. His high school story was very intriguing to watch, as we meet Ned (Jacob Batalon) who aids Peter Parker as his nerdy and funny best friend, Michelle (Zendaya) as the quirky, yet the lonely student who stands in the background, and Liz (Laura Harrier), Peter's accessible love interest. With Spiderman, Peter becomes less involved with the school, causing dysfunctional relationships to occur between him and many other students. Likewise at home with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), who we see Peter become more distant with her as his agendas begin to take over. The main villain, the Vulture, is unlike many of Marvel's villains, in that he is the most human out of all of them. He despises the rich and the powerful messing up the lives of those below them, in this case, Tony Stark and he cares deeply about his family, wanting to do everything in his power to keep them safe and happy. His backstory, seen in the opening of the film, and the effects of his actions proves that Adrian Toomes (his hidden persona) has more redeeming qualities than one might expect of a villain. Michael Keaton brilliantly plays the role, adding hidden depths rarely seen in a Superhero villain.Of course, every movie comes with its negatives, however, those in Homecoming are only minor. I would've like to see more of Marisa Tomei and Donald Glover, and possibly some other secondary characters, yet I do see them playing a major role in the future of Spiderman. Another minor problem was the music score by Michael Giacchino, who actually created some really good music pieces, but I personally felt that it wasn't enough to lift it even further to something more memorable. Overall, the action was solid, yet the film serves better as a character-driven story rather than the usual action we tend to see in other Marvel movies which may disappoint some fans. However, comic book films are about the characters and Spiderman: Homecoming accomplishes that extremely well. Tom Hollands gifts us with a great performance of the crime-fighting, friendly neighborhood Spiderman, accompanied by a great villain acted superbly by Michael Keaton, and a host of secondary characters that really complete a very well written film.",8,67,124,6 July 2017
Doctor Strange," A magnificent and trippy film that takes you on a visually impressive journey
","Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, is not only the fourteenth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a film that brings in a whole new perspective of magic and sorcery in the franchise. What you are given is a spectacular tale of a man who defies all odds, to learn the art and craft of magic, who is magnificently played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch. Other than Benedict, the film boasts a stellar cast with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, Rachael McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor, who all play their parts great as well. Accompanied by top-quality visuals, interesting origin stories and one of most fascinating music scores in Marvel history, you are giving one of the better Marvel films in recent memory.With 2016 slowly drawing to a close, the year of movies hasn't been the most satisfying as major blockbusters haven't been able to reach the heights we wished they would. I have been slightly disappointed with what has come out so far this year, with the likes of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Apocalypse and Jason Bourne failing to live up to the hype. I believe Doctor Strange is up there with some of the best this year, which include Captain America: Civl War, Finding Dory, Zootopia, Deadpool and the Jungle Book. Not only do the visuals take your mind away, but it shows that Marvel still has what it takes to make good films (especially with so many superhero movies coming out in the next couple of years). It also proves that Marvel is capable of placing unknown directors with big blockbuster movies, like what they did with James Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy and Scott Derrickson with this movie. It also sets up the character well for future movies as Benedict has confirmed he will take part in Avengers: Infinity Wars and possibly other Marvel movies.If I were to make one criticism for the movie, it'll have to be the overuse and forcefulness of humor, especially when the movie started to get more serious. But, it did make the audience laugh in some moments, so it isn't much of a concern. To finish off, we are taken on a visually impressive journey throughout Doctor Strange's world and how he prepares to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a big way.",8,6,10,7 November 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War is brave, brilliant and spectacular
","Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.",10,7,16,25 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," An underwhelming and frustrating film
","Since 2000, Marvel and 20th Century Fox have created a number of movies with the X-Men, usually led by director Bryan Singer, who is also at the helm of their latest installment, X-Men: Apocalypse. There have been some great films like Days of Future Past, and some pretty bad ones like X-Men Origins, and this movie lies in between. Boasting a great cast, led by James McEvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, and some great characters, this movie ends up being an underwhelming and slightly frustrating film as you reach the credits. But it also manages to spice up some memorable moments, in particular a scene involving Quicksilver.The movie lacks in several areas, with one standing out the most being the plot. The plot is very simple yet bloated at the same time. You begin with the antagonist, Apocalypse, and introducing his origins. Then the protagonists, which are the X-Men, gather a force which can hopefully sustain itself against Apocalypse, who also gathers his own followers. It sounds very simple, yet when you see the movie, it starts to get confusing. As of late, superhero films such as Captain America: Civil and Deadpool have attempted to expand the genre, whilst this film continues with a very cliché story and archetypal villain. If it were a couple of years ago, I might not make the same case as these movies were only beginning to be a part of the movie industry. Another downside is the misuse of some of the cast, in particular Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Apocalypse doesn't seem the least menacing or frightening, which isn't entirely the fault of Oscar, but maybe the writers. Likewise with Jennifer, who feels much underused in the context of the story. Some of the other characters feel very forgettable, especially some members of Apocalypse's team (Angel, Psylocke). They aren't that interesting and are very one- dimensional. The final battle was good, though a little underwhelming, which had the occasional wince of bad CGI. Magneto's transformation was by far the best of all the characters, and probably one of the only sides of the story you can get emotionally involved in. Fassbender did really well in his performance, especially given he had quite a change in character throughout the movie. McEvoy as usual was great as Professor X, and some of the young newcomers proved they are capable of being part of a massive blockbuster. Its movie worth watching as it is fun and enjoyable ride, but make sure you enter with low expectations.",4,7,11,11 September 2016
Logan," A masterfully orchestrated film
","The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of 'The Wolverine' (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's 'Hurt', I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.",10,94,197,16 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A compelling and funny sequel
","James Gunn returns with the sequel to the Guardians of the Galaxy with a movie that brings back many of the things that made the original so great. Is it greater than the first though? It is hard to rank one above the other, but I still believe the first installment (in what is now going to be a trilogy) deserves the nod. Led by the continuously likable and charismatic Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, we join the Guardians on a journey across the planets and galaxies. Vol. 2 introduces many new characters such as Mantis and Peter Quill aka Star Lord's father, Ego, the latter played by Kurt Russell. The characters of Drax and Rocket were hilarious as usual, Drax especially in many scenes. We learn more of the intense relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula, but there were two who really stood out for me: Baby Groot and (surprisingly) Yondu. Baby Groots time on camera created many laughs, not just for his sheer cuteness, but for his interactions with the other characters. Yondu in this movie was given far more story to deal with, and it certainly paid off. It made you really care for him on an emotional level, which does sound quite unusual given he is a ravager. And last but not least, Star-Lord, and being the lead character, deserved all the attention because he was great. The movie was another great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has created more anticipation for Avengers: Infinity Wars where we will see the Avengers team up with the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 will provide more laughs, more emotion and more action for any movie viewer, led by a great director and cast.",7,28,48,28 April 2017
Arrival," A film about humanity rather than the 'Arrivals'
","Arrival is a beautifully complex film that centers on the role of humanity in this world rather than the 'arrivals'. With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the clichés we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages.",10,12,24,7 July 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A mediocre Superhero flick
","Ever since the announcement of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I was excited at the prospect of pitting two of biggest superheroes of all time, but also apprehensive at how they were going to make such a movie. A lot of people will enjoy the spectacle, but feel a little disappointed that it didn't reach the heights we wished it would. This is what I felt after leaving the theater. Directed by Zach Snyder, who was also at the helm of Man of Steel, he brings in all the action and enjoyment you would want in a typical superhero movie, and is shown through some cool fighting scenes and more emotionality from all the characters. I'm going to split this up into what is a good, OK and bad in the movie.The good stuff first. What I really liked in this movie was Ben Affleck's portrayal of the Dark Knight, and how he approached being the hidden, crime-fighting superhero. His performance was strong and solid, and I enjoyed the brutality he brought to the field. I was worried when I heard the criticism of him being casted as Batman because I think he's a good actor and can really make a movie his own. I also enjoyed Gal Gadot and Wonder Women. I thought she gave the movie a good push, but I wished that they gave her a bit more screen-time as she had the ability to really take the spotlight from the other heroes. Back to Batman, I really liked how he approached Superman and his motives towards killing him. His work on Superman's history and weaknesses was quite interesting to watch, as well as him working closely with his butler, Alfred, played by Jeremy Irons. I enjoyed Jeremy Irons portrayal as it was different from the Alfred we've seen in countless Batman movies. He still helps build suits and gadgets for his battle with Superman despite his doubts over Bruce's decision. Overall, Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman is one of the best parts of the movie, but I still believe Christian Bales version is slightly better. Moving on from the characters, the action was hectic but in a good way. Each action sequence brought in new detail to the story, and showed off each heroes and villains abilities to its full potential. I especially liked when Superman arrives to meet Batman near the end of the movie and the Dark Knight says, 'well....here I am'.Now, some of the things that weren't good, but not bad either. Something basic to start off with is the plot. The title is quite misleading and the plot is messed up with many sub-plots which take you away from the real battle. The story sounds complex but is very simple, which makes it a whole lot easier for the viewer. Another thing are some characters I haven't mentioned yet, in particular Lex Luthor and Superman. Superman, played by Henry Cavill, was a bit boring and bland, and he didn't really bring anything exciting or jaw-dropping to the table like Batman or even Wonder-Women did. Lex Luthor on the other-hand was as crazy and weird as the Joker himself. He completely went over-the-top, but I didn't entirely mind it. It's hard to rate him, especially as I like Jesse Eisenberg as an actor, it's just that Lex didn't completely feel right. Also, I found him really annoying in some scenes. Another character is Doomsday. Like Lex, I didn't mind him in the context of the story, and during some parts of the final fight, I found him unnecessary. I guess he was just there to kill off Superman, which I also didn't mind if it continues on the DC universe franchise. But, it did take me by surprise that DC would take this cause of action, even for the benefit of the Justice League and other movies.Lastly, the bad stuff. The editing is quite horrible actually. Never in a superhero movie have I seen badly transitioned scenes or a change in context. At some stages of the movie it put me off. To extend on that is that there were too many scenes that had little to no influence on the plot, and too many dream sequences. Even though some will have connections to future movies, I disliked it a lot. These scenes only made the movie longer than it should've been. The two things I hated the most with the first being really laughable is the reason Batman and Superman stop fighting and all the hatred towards Superman. So the first pointI just laugh in my head sometimes thinking about that. Plus, the choice of words from Superman. Why say Martha when he could've just said that his mother was kidnapped by Lex, and not wait for Lois to tell Batman at the end of the fight. The second really annoyed me because when Superman does die, you felt very little sadness or sympathy for him. There are many other little nit-picks which I won't mention because some a pretty obvious when you see the movie.Overall, it's an average movie, not great, with many flaws in its plot, but as a fan of the superhero genre, I enjoyed seeing two of the most prolific comic-book heroes' face-off against each other.",5,9,15,25 June 2016
Godzilla," A great entry into the Godzilla franchise
","Godzilla has been a movie icon for over sixty years, emerging from the deep oceans and causing havoc in cities across the world. This new depiction of the great kaiju, acting as a reboot of the franchise and directed by an up-and-coming director, Gareth Edwards, is a very entertaining film despite the complaints of there being too little of Godzilla. I somewhat concur with this argument, however, having seen many of Japanese films, especially the original in 1954, it is known for Godzilla to be teased throughout the movie (or have limited screen time), yet still have a profound impact on the film and the audience it is delivered to, and this is what the 2014 version does very well. However, at times, it did come at an annoyance when right as we see him, the scene changes. But this should not take away from otherwise a really good film. The design of Godzilla and the monstrous villains, the MUTOs, were very well created and augmented to represent a respectable scale to real world buildings/infrastructure. As usual, the action scenes were a blast, with the final act dedicated to the fight we've been waiting for between the creatures. The plot carried the film smoothly, coupled with some good acting from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn. But it should be noted that the good acting came from secondary characters while our central character, Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, was very bland and one-dimensional. The film was an attempt at very human orientated monster film rather than focused on the monsters themselves, which is somewhat of a problem in a movie called 'Godzilla'. However, Gareth Edwards blends both well enough to not detract what this film manages to accomplish. With the news of a Monsterverse being created by Legendary Studious, involving the likes of King Kong, I am very excited to see where they take Godzilla in his next movie in 2019, where he will pit off against his greatest foes, King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan, before taking on King Kong in 2020 to determine who the real 'King' is.",8,40,59,25 June 2016
Alien: Covenant," A solid film that deals with thought-provoking philosophical ideas
","Alien: Covenant is a film that stays true to form in terms of the general formulaic story line it tends to follow within the Alien franchise. However, this does not detract from a largely more suspenseful and dark film compared to its predecessor, Prometheus. Ridley Scott handles this film with enough precision that the stories and philosophical ideas (however convoluted they may be) are treated well in the context of the over-arching plot. Though the attempts, or rather the execution of these thought-provoking ideas into the film could've been done much better. With some worthwhile action and terrorizing aliens, the blockbuster aspect of the film is done very well. And though the plot does become slightly rushed towards the end and somewhat predictable, it is still a very solid movie and a film definitely worth watching",6,8,13,8 July 2017
