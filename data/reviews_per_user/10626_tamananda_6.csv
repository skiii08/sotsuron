Howl's Moving Castle," Mortal Engine
","Summary : Hayao Miyazaki backs with another Beautiful Animated Film.
The opening of a film shows very well how the main character character is and how she views life.A storyline that recalls the fusion of horrors of war and the mystical world provides a basis for good story theme.The beautiful world design, the varied character of companion is also very well designed (story and appearance) to give the impression of a strong team bond.Critics:However As it grew, the plot of the story felt so vague on several sides it could be called a plothole. The explanation of the cause and effect in this film is not well explained,(I did not write it in order to avoid spoilers) .at the end of the film felt like a hasty or forced ending. (maybe that's the same as the novel)",8,0,0,11 May 2020

","Summary : Hayao miyazaki wrote a story that most people say without plots, it is true that it feels like a ray of children's lives surrounded by their beautiful imaginations, nothing evil or anything to fight against in this film.A simple motion picture can reflect nostalgia through its realistic scenes. it's a movie that reminds us of what it's like to be children again, a movie that might spark the soul of children inside the body of any human being that can have a nostalgic effect.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
Spirited Away," Still A 9 For Me
","No Spoiler
But..all I can say is. It has very unique characters, it's well directed,beautiful music and don't forget the moral message it contains
Lots of iconic shots,I must be clear here I bet this movie had put a new standard for Animated Films In early 2000s (international Audiences)
Everyone considers this a Miyazaki's Magnum opus,it is iconic..Critics: it's been stuck in my mind.
Almost all his films are centered in the same zone, kids -> mystical creatures and fantasies..
Twist isn't well executed.
Full of ambiguity for a Children's Film.Is it overrated?why twitter film lovers consider this movie as masterpiece?

Princess Mononoke," Balances
","Summary : It is one of the results of creativity and genius of a Hayao Miyazaki, a truly well-constructed story, the development of conflict to a thoroughly well-written climax, crystal clear cause and effect, strong written characters, innuendo and touching moral messages.Critics: There was a slight error in writing continuity-character,a scene that felt lengthening the duration.There's a faction that felt unclear in the term of background.",9,0,0,11 May 2020
