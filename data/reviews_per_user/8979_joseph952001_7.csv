The Sound of Music," The Sound Of Cash In The Bank
","After 'Cleopatra' with Liz and Dicky Boy hit the movie theaters, the film almost drove 20th Century Fox into Bankruptcy and even their law suits against one another just added fuel to the bankruptcy fiasco of all time. So, in the meantime, while figuring out what to do to save Fox, Walt Disney had seen Julie Andrews in the stage version of 'Camelot' on Broadway and decided that she was his 'Mary Poppins' and the rest is movie history. Back at Fox, looking through their unfilmed scripts they came across 'The sound of Music'; so, William Wyler, the original director who was casting the film, asked Julie Andrews to play Maria Von Trapp, and she said, 'Of course! But what can you do with a Nun, a Captain, 7 children, and a bunch of Nuns?' So, Wyler cast the film, but he preferred to do something else, and Robert Wise took over. Wyler stated that he knew that the film would be a hit, but he didn't think that it would be THAT big a hit! In the meantime, at the Acamady Awards, Julie Anderews, the original Eliza Doolittle in 'My Fair Lady' wins the Oscar for best actress in Mary Popp;ins, and Rex Harrision, the original 'Enry 'Iggins, wins an Oscar for 'My Fair Lady', and Audrey Hepburn is overlooked for her excellent performance with too many excuses for why she didn't win! So, what made 'The Sound of Music' such a hit? Good question! Not an easy answer! All the critics hated it; said it wouldn't last, but something happened, and not only did it last but became one of the great money makers of all time to the point that it played in reserved seat first run theaters for at least 3 years, and no movie had done that up to that time, but I think I have the answer: It was just right timing. There was a lot of violence on the movie screen, no musicals, no good-feel movies to leave the theater with your toes tapping with a song in your heart! Today, it would have probably flopped on its nose! So, when Julie Andrews won the Oscar for 'Mary Poppins' she stated, 'I've heard that you Americans are known for your hospitality, but this is ridiculous!' Next year when she was nominated for 'Soound of Music', the rumor is that the Acadamy was told not to vote for her because it was unheard of for an actress to win the years in running for a musical! So, be the powers of Hollywood in those days! And in case you aren't aware of this, Marni Nixon, who dubbed singing for Deborah Kerr in 'An Affair To Remember' and 'The King and I', and who also dubbed partial-singing for Audrey Hepburn in 'My Fair Lady' can, for once, not only be heard, but can be seen as well singing for herself as Sister Sophia as one of the Nuns in the number 'How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?' So, the cash flow saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy; but it took many years for the movie public to get over that their virginal Julie Andrews was human beings, and it too many years for Jack Warner to wipe the egg off his face for making such a boo-boo about the possibility of becoming a movie star, and Julie Anderews never, but never, worked on a film for Jack Warner! But, many have made the same mistake. There were those who said that Liza Minelli would never make it in the big-time because she was the daughter of Judy Garland! Boy! Did those know-it-alls, like Jack Warner, eat crow for many years to come!",10,1,7,23 April 2006
Alexander," A Classic For The Futrue
","The reason I call this movie a classic for the future is that it will never fully be appreciated until years into the future. This happens to many movies such as Casablanca, or The Wizard of Oz. In their initial release these movies and others were never very big money makers nor appreciated for what they were until years gone by, and now they are considered classics. The same thing will happen with Alexander.It's very difficult to comment on this movie without getting too involved so let's just take Alexander's love life and comment on that. Alexander and his lover were gay. There is no doubt about that. Even though he was required to give his heritage a son, that doesn't make him straight or bisexual. Remember when the two were on the balcony, and Alexander said to the young man that it was he that only trusted and that it was he the only one that he loved, and it was vise-versa with Alexanders lover. The proof in the pudding is the tent scene where Alexander gets into bed. The look on his face and the shadow appearing to him was all that needed to be said, plus when Alexander's lover died. That was a powerful scene of one loosing his only love in the world to death! In many ways this was the same as David and Jonathan and their gay love relationship in the Old Testament recorded in Samuel I and II. Jonathan was willing to do anything for David and the both loved one another. When Jonathan dies in battle, David sings his greatest lament to this dead lover by saying that 'Your love to me was wonderful, surpassing that of woman!' Then later, just as Alexander was King, David became King David of the House of Israel! Many gay men have been forced by family and society to produce an heir, but their hearts are always with their male lover. This applies to David, Jonathan, Alexander and Alexander's male lover. This is nothing new; it still goes on today! In the future, Alexander, the Director's Cut, will be appreciated for what it truly is and always be: A classic!",10,0,11,9 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," With Apologies to Tony Bennett: 'I Lost My Heart, In Brokeback Mountain'
","I'm a romantic! Always have been; always will be! This movie was aired for the first time on H.B.O. last night. Never saw the film, but heard a lot about it; mostly damaging, so I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see, but to my surprise, I was happy that I was lied to about what the film was really all about, but the problem with people seeing this movie is that you really have to be someone other than a city-slicker and have to love and appreciate the outdoors and nature! The scenery is spectacular. The story is very moving. The performances are incredibly honest. I wasn't sure how the end would come out, but it was one of those freak accidents that never can be explained leaving all those who loved the person beside themselves except for Jacks parents. It seems like they knew their son better than what most parents know their own son and was accepting of his life-style. They also knew who Heath was even though they had never met. This was apparent in Jacks father knowing where Brokeback Mountain was, and especially Jacks mother and how she related to Heath, and I'm willing to bet that the true ending to the story is that Heath later returns to Jacks parents and lives with them, and helps them with the farm until their dying day standing in for Jack as their second son! And this would complete Heaths love and respect for Jack! Betcha! So, after last nights airing, I have to say that I loved every minute, every second, and every foot of this classy film. How can, anyone, straight or gay, if they have any love in their hearts, not have compassion, and love, for these two men? But, when you come right down to it, how many men, and I'm sure there have been more than what we realize, found then selves moved because they, too, at one time, had been somewhat, in the same situation? But, and I know I'm going to be criticized for this, this is not a gay cowboy love story! These two men are not gay. It's true that circumstances being what it was in the mountains, no women around to have sex with; well, the inevitable happened and what started out to be a rape, turned out to be a love relationship that is hard to explain. What happened to them in the mountains caused them to become very much in love with a sexual relationship that was beyond gay, but even though that relationship continued on pass Jack's death, the two men were not gay! I don't know how to explain this any better. Even they both told each other that they were not queer! Maybe, I could say it was better than gay, that their relationship was more than gay! It was higher up the ladder! I'm sure that there is someone out there that knows what I'm trying to say when I say it was higher up the ladder than just being gay. It may have been a love relationship that many gay men would love to have but have never experienced! Anyway, this movie just tore me apart, and at the end when Willie Nelson, by the way one of my favorite performers, was singing, 'He Was A Friend Of Mine', I just sat there overcome with a big large lump in my throat with tears pouring down my cheeks! Such an overwhelming, powerful, love story. Anyone who doesn't love this movie is a heartless, unloving, old Grumpy!",10,16,18,27 November 2006
Gone with the Wind," Gone with Duh Misery
","Yes, I know! Gone With The Wind is considered a classic! The first time I saw Gone With The Wind was when the wide-screens hit the theaters and they had stereophonic sound, and when I saw Gone With The Wind around this time, they advertised the movie would have a stereophonic soundtrack but, of course, it would still be shown in its original screen size. It wasn't until years later that they redid the movie in a sort of 75 mm widescreen process using this earlier stereophonic soundtrack. Very impressive, even though the heads were chopped off, somewhat, in the viewing!Well, poor Katy Scarlett had more twist and turns in her life which equaled the twist and turns of Erica Kane on All My Children, and after almost four hours of Gone With The Wind, what did Scarlett learn? Not a thing! She should have taken the prophetic words of her father when he told her that the only thing that meant anything was Tara and, especially, the land, before she went out chasing after Ashley and Rhett Butler with no success. Vivien Leigh played Scarlett like a grown up Shirley Temple who never grew up, and as far as her southern draw in the film goes, this was no problem. When the English first came to this land, they were up north and up north it gets so cold that they speak rapidly and when they migrated to the south, they spoke very slowly, and all Vivien Leigh did was draw out her English accent which made her sound like she was born and bread in the South! And what was also amusing was that after Vivien Leigh was chose to play Scarlett there were some catty remarks from southern women that at least no Yankee would play Scarlett! Can you just imagine Bette Davis and Errol Flynn playing Scarlett and Rhett? This is probably one of the greatest Soap Opera's ever put on film, and what Acadamy Award Oscar Wining lines?SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! GERALD O'HARA: It's I'm proud to be Irish! SCARLETT: War, war, war! PRISSY: I can berth babies! SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! RHETT: Has the war begun? SCARLETT: Sir, you've no gentleman! BELLE WATLING: It wouldn't be fit-tin'. SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! MELANIE: Oh, Scarlett, how I envy you! SCARLETT: Oh, Fiddle Dee Dee!SCARLETT: After almost 4 hours in the movie theater: 'Ashley, why didn't you tell me you didn't love me!' Uh! Pardon me? You mean, after almost 4 hours of movie time, Scarlett didn't know this, and decided, right there on the spot, that she really loved Rhett, but didn't know it? Well, the little user of men's flesh, just couldn't make up her mind, and it's a wonder that at that moment she didn't break into song singing 'I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No!'Now, what puzzles me, and really amuses me, is why any red-headed sexy Sounthern Belle, like Scarlett O'Hara, would want to not trap some handsome man like Rhett Butler who just happens to look like Clark Gable, and not do everything possible to trap him and keep him! Scarlett had to be nuts! Let's face it, Leslie Howard was not that handsome for anyone to want to live with forever, and besides that, he and Melanie were cousins; and they got married? Was Scarlett nuts, or not? Well, maybe a little psycho! Give up Glark Gable?I will, though, admit that the end of the first act where Scarlett vows that her kin-folk, and especially her, will never go hungry again, is a powerful scene and worth sitting through. especially since you're sitting through all the nonsense of her chasing after Ashley, ignoring Rhett, and facing the Yankees in the Civil War, plus Melanies birth of her baby, makes this scene worth it! Of course, Rhett was right when he said, 'God help the Yankees if they ever captured her!'So, when I finally saw the end of the film, I wanted o destroy the projector and the theater for such a silly ending, and there's Scarlett still living in her dream world that she would go back to Tara and think about a way to get Rhett back which at that time was really very unrealistic, but not to Scarlett acting like a grown up Shirley Temple still living on the Good Ship Lollipop! But, at the end, Rhett summed up the whole thing when he said, 'Frankly my dear; I don't give a damn!' And that's how I felt when I finally got a chance to leave the theater! Of course, before the movie ended, this would have been a great time for Scarlett to break out in song and sing 'The Man That Got Away', or maybe re title it 'The Men That Got Away'! And, of course, no one would realize that many years later, one of the Tarleton Twins, George Reeves, would end up playing Superman on the television series. He couldn't make it as an actor, but he sure made it to the top playing Superman!Years ago, the British turned 'Gone With The Wind' into a musical, and Rex Reed panned it and said that it was so bad that at the end of the 1st Act, the horse on stage did something to show what even he, the horse, thought of the production and the 1st Act curtain lowered! Remake 'Gone With The Wind' today? What a tragedy that would be! Who would they get to play Rhett? Danny DeVito?Now, years later, I have to admit that I do appreciate the movie more than I did years ago seeing it as a teenager, but these very long movies only teach you one thing: When you go to a movie that's going to run for 3 to 4 hours, make sure you take with you, your lunch, a toothbrush, and a fresh change of underwear!",7,2,6,12 April 2006
Coyote Ugly," But - Where's Rosanne?
","I accidentally tuned in on this movie on Cable over the weekend. What a pleasure this film was. This was an excellent relief from all the realism on the T.V. and in most of the movies today. Bette Davis was correct that in todays T.V. there's too much realism. I agree. Anyone can play realism in the movies or on T.V.. You see it on the streets and in the news. This is acting? Of course not. The problem with Coyote Ugly, with most people, is that it's just good old fashioned entertainment to take you out of this lousy world we live in with nothing but a bunch of psychotics and neurotics you have to deal with everyday of your life. The reason that I love the Jerry Springer show is that everyone on his program is so over-the-edge that it's entertaining, and that's what made the movies years ago so great to watch. They could take the worse script there is and make it believable because they knew their craft - acting! This film has everything in it. A girl down on her luck. Falls in love. Has a Father than doesn't like what she's doing, but comes around. Goes for the Gold in life, and finally succeeds. If you think about it, this movie is almost a modern remake, in many ways, of 'The Jazz Singer'.I loved every foot, minute, and second of this movie, but - with John Goodman playing the father, I almost expected Rosanne to show up and yell out, 'Dannnnnnn! Becky's working in a trashy bar!'",Null,1,2,14 August 2006
Ben-Hur," Ben Hur: From Prince To Pauper To Prince To Race Car Driver
","Every time I hear the name of this movie, I always think of the story about the man who had a dog named Ben, but had to change his name to Ben Hur after he had pups! Really, people! I know I could get crucified for this review, but as good as this movie is, it's just too long. A person in later age has to find time to go to the bathroom! A twenty minute intermission in-between 2 hour acts just doesn't get it! And, in Ben Hur, if it isn't one thing it's another. Poor Ben with his mishaps in life goes from Prince to Pauper to Prince and ends up winner of a race that was Rome's version of the Indiana 500! But through all the madness and miracles, no one seems to see the greatest miracle of all in the film. Here's Ben's mother and sister in that prison all those years! They know they're there; after all; the food disappears! And, how and where did they go to the bathroom all those years if that door was so small to get in and out of? Don't get me wrong! Sure, this is epic-movie making at its finest, but again, it's just too damn long, and I'm sure the whole thing could have been wound up in about two and a half hours without any trouble! Now, when compared with the silent version; sure you can see a little bit of copying from the silent version to the William Wyler version. That's very obvious if you really observe what's going on on the screen, but there is something about the silent version that makes it a much better version. The use of the tints and their version of Technicolor at the time, and the whole thing wrapping up at a descent time; time enough for a person at my age to hit the john without any mishaps!",6,2,5,21 March 2006
The Wizard of Oz," I'll Get You My little Pretty and Your Little Dog Too!!!!!!
","Recently on Turner Classics, not only did they show the Judy Garland Version of The Wizard of Oz, but the 1925 silent version as well as the 1910 silent version starring a very young 9 year old Bebe Daniels who is remembered for her role of the star who breaks her leg in 40 Second Street only to be replaced by Ruby Keeler who becomes an overnight star because of Ms. Daniels bad luck.I know I could probably get shot for saying so, but the script to The Wizard of Oz is horrible. I'm sure that the boys at M.G.M. probably thought to themselves, 'What were we thinking when we agreed to this? We must have been drunk!' But, this shows what can be done by a very talented cast with great directions. There were many films like this that the heads of the studios thought would flop on its nose. Look at the Sound of Music. No one ever expected The Sound of Music to do what it did financially which saved 20th Century Fox to go under because of the Liz and Dick version of Cleopatra.And to think that the studio bosses at M.G.M. wanted to delete Somewhere Over the Rainbow from the movie because they felt that the song stopped the film for no good reason at all. Of course, there were many headaches. Buddy Ebsen almost died from the Metalic Makeup. Gale Sondergaard want to look beautiful as the Wicked Witch much like the Queen in Disney's Snow White, but when they decided to make the Witch ugly, Sondergaard preferred her beauty - let her ego get in the way - and gave up beauty for characterization! Sad! I remember when the wide screens came out with stereophonic sound and the studios were trying to make films like The Wizard of Oz in a wide screen process. They were already recording stereophonic sound and didn't know it, so it was easy to remix the soundtracks into true stereophonic sound. There IS a wide screen version of The Wizard of Oz, but it is no longer available; the same as there IS a wide screen version of Gone With The Wind but no longer available.But the talented cast with a talented director makes the script work and who knew that in the future this film would end up being a yearly event on television for all to see. Again, it's just a shame that this movie can't be enjoyed on the big screen in the movie theaters. That's a whole different ball game for all to really see what the Wizard of Oz is 'really' all about!",Null,0,2,14 July 2006
