The Blair Witch Project," Shocking
","I probably would have appreciated this film a whole lot more if I had watched it before I watched Paranormal Activity, this is so poorly made in comparison. The scene at the end is the only bit that's even vaguely scary (and I scare easily, Coraline was pretty scary for me).I think it would have been a whole lot more tense if I had more sympathy for the characters, but I just found them annoying, though this is more the result of a bad script than the actors fault, they did a pretty good job with what they were given. I think the real issue for me was that I just couldn't get into the story, I mean how can you get THAT lost when you have a map and compass. They walked for 15 hours and ended up where they started, how is that possible when you have a compass? They even decided to walk in a set direction, SOUTH, surely to end up in the same place there would have had to have been a point where they were looking at the compass and it was pointing NORTH usually a good indication your walking THE WRONG WAY.I have two flat mates in their first semester of a media and broadcasting degree and in all honesty I've seen them produce more plausible, better edited material than this. For the last 20 minutes I couldn't wait for it to end.",1,9,16,2 December 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," Meh...
","Silver Linings Playbook is an alright film. I found it mildly entertaining, but at the end of the day it's just another Rom-com (although kinda lacking in comedy). In my opinion It's not really worthy of all the hype or the Oscar nominations it received. Particularly when compared with similar films released this year like Perks of Being a WallflowerAs for it being a great depiction of mental illness... I'm a psychologist with a best friend who has bipolar and I beg to differ! It's a little unconvincing on this front the best it offers is a slightly accurate portrayal of mild depression and anger issues that wouldn't necessarily be recognised at a clinical level overall just a little dull really!",4,3,7,23 February 2013
