The Blair Witch Project," It just creeps up on you...
","When I first saw the previews for this movie, I didn't really know what to think, but I saw the website address flashed and decided to check it out. The website alone intrigued me and I really wanted to see this movie.  I still tried to go in without a lot of expectations...I hate spoiling a movie based on what I THINK it should be.  I'm glad I was able to do that since I ended up really enjoying this movie.Sure, there are some drawbacks to it:  the annoying Heather who can't stop screaming at everyone, the overuse of cuss words (but hey, they're college kids..I know I heard a LOT of that in college, so it really only added to the overall 'realness' of it), and the unsteady camera work.  However, the unsteady camera movements I was able to deal with through its integration in the believability of the story of AMATEUR film makers out to explore the legend of the blair witch.  Anyone who makes home movies knows it can be difficult to keep a steady cam...especially when walking/running through the woods.  So, like I said, this really didn't detract too much from the overall experience.Now, all that negativity aside, I absolutely loved this movie.  The way it was done was so entirely different from the typical horror/slasher/thriller/etc movies.  Blair Witch was filmed as actual footage with little to no script whatsoever.  The storyline is slowly built up through interviews and conversations, allowing the viewer to get an idea of what is going on and what the young film makers are out to accomplish.  Once we are armed with this knowledge, creepy little inferences are made here and there building a nervousness that culminates in the final scenes.  It is incredible. 
I remember camping out in the woods of my backyard and fearing every little twig snap or the slightest sound.  Blair Witch brought me right back into those days.  Also, it was able to create a fear in me without having to hold my hand through the entire movie, and instead, letting my imagination run wild.  The best part being that fears were built withought ever having to really be shown anything.  All too often in movies the fear is lost once a film maker tries to show us what the 'monster' or 'thing' looks like...it just can't compare to what our mind's eye can depict.Overall, I give Blair Witch an 8 out of 10 stars.  If you can get past the sometimes nausea inducing camera work, you may find this is quite an interesting movie.",8,0,1,21 May 2003
The Ring," YES! Finally a GOOD 'scary movie'!
","There are scary movies that are your typical no-brainers with silly little plots that really don't drive the movie, but rather hinder it.  These movies are purely for fun and not so much for mulling over at the water-cooler on Monday.  Then there are those scary movies that make you think...question...and ponder.  The Ring is definitely the latter.The premise:  there exists a video tape that when you watch it, you have seven days before you 'see the ring' (ie: die).  Sounds silly enough...at least I thought so upon seeing the previews.  I will happily admit I was wrong since The Ring turned out to be one of the best scary movies I've seen in years.  The acting was well done on all accounts, right down to young David Dorfman as the Keller's young son, Aidan.  The imagery is incredibly freaky and was enough to make me sleep with a light on (Not something that happens very often, mind you, having seen about every horror movie I could lay my eyes on).  The plot was good enough without the standard 'cheese' associated with most scary movies.  I like a movie that can make you think!If you're into a movie that holds your hand throughout and gives you a neat, tidy little explanation in the last thirty minutes or so, this movie is not for you.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it DOES give you answers; but it makes you think for them.  With subtle innuendos, imagery, and whispers of conversation, the viewer is able to decipher Samara's message and the overall 'meaning' of this thrilling ghost story.  And while attempting to understand Samara's message, she will scare the bejeebers out of you.Honestly, a very good ghost story with few 'plot holes' (regardless of what other reviews might state...there really ARE explanations).  Overall, The Ring deserves a 9 out of 10...not quite the BEST, but quite close.",8,1,1,27 May 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Breaks through the age barriers
","I would be very surprised if there was someone out there who hasn't seen this movie already...at least someone old enough to be reading a review. Few movies are compelling enough to appeal to young and old alike and  E.T. is one of those rare gems that was able to bring an enjoyable story that spans the generation gaps.   E.T. is an incredibly touching tale of a lonely young boy and his friendship with an extra terrestrial.  Henry Thomas does an excellent job portraying young Elliot and his talent shines through in this performance.  Drew Barrymore is absolutely adorable as little Gertie and quite accurately portrays Elliot's often annoying little sister.  Robert MacNaughton plays Michael...the older brother of Elliot and Gertie and does equally a fantastic job.  The talent these three exude is incredible...leaving the viewer wholeheartedly believing they are siblings out on a quest to save E.T.Although filmed in the early 80's, E.T. has undoubtedly been able to withstand the test of time.  The effects were beautifully done given the technology at the time; and although technological capabilities have vastly improved since then, E.T. still is as beautiful now as back in 1982.This movie has all the makings of a great story:  fabulous casting, believable characters, humor, action, and the occasional tugging of the heartstrings.  E.T. is definitely one of the best movies ever and ranks 10 out of 10.  If you haven't, check this one out and fast.",10,4,8,29 May 2003
Fight Club," Somehow drew me into its clutches...
","When Fight Club first came out, I had NO desire to see it...none.  After seeing the previews, I mistakenly thought it was just another mindless action flick with little plot and lots of fighting. Don't get me wrong, those movies can have an appeal of their own, but isn't something I was on the edge of my seat to see.  Well, we had company one night and they had brought over Fight Club.  I felt almost obligated to watch it, so I did.  I was elated to find I was completely wrong and had totally misjudged this movie...it was awesome!Brad Pitt was fabulous in this movie as crazy, over the top, yet charismatic Tyler Durden.  I haven't seen him perform this well since 12 Monkeys. Edward Norton, however, has always impressed me...even in movies I didn't really care for.  That being said, it was no surprise to me that his role as the bored, nameless Narrator was absolutely fantastic.  Edward Norton is incredible...going from a man 'going through the motions' of a typical 'yuppy life' to letting loose and ridding himself of the frustrations he feels through his new found 'support group': Fight Club.Fight Club is an incredible journey into madness and destruction that draws you into its clutches and doesn't let go until the very last scene.    And Fight Club certainly isn't a 'mindless' movie. Check this one out...it earns a SOLID 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,19 May 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Special Effects Movie...nothing more, nothing less
","It rather cracks me up to see all the negative comments written about this movie regarding the ridiculous, predictable, and completely unbelievable plot.  I have to ask myself two questions: 1. did people not realize this before going to see the movie? and 2. did they not realize the only reason anyone would really go see this would be to see the 20 tornadoes overtake LA or the Statue of Liberty be engulfed in a tidal wave? Honestly.Roger Ebert normally pans about every nonsensical, mindless dribble ever made yet gave this movie 3 out of 4 stars.  Was I surprised?  Not really. The man knows his stuff and realizes that this movie isn't meant to be about a solid plot, but a big-budget special-effects driven summer blockbuster popcorn movie.  Period. As for me, I was quite pleased with the movie, really.  Was the plot ridiculous?  Oh absolutely!  Ed Wood could probably have come up with some better dialog and scene structures in some instances, but I'll tell ya, the special effects were dazzling.  And, let's face it, that's really what we're here for, paying our hard-earned money to see Mother Nature stick it to the people once and for all.  And, well, she delivers.  Now, if only Emmerich could have done this without all that pesky plot stuff gettin in the way...",3,0,1,30 May 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Great End to the Trilogy of the Matrix
","I've read quite a lot of mixed reviews on Revolutions and I'm honestly not surprised.  The moment I saw this movie I knew people were most likely going to either love it or hate it.  Personally, I loved it.While Reloaded tried too hard to be everything viewers were expecting, Revolutions went beyond that and took us exactly where the story was intended to go in the first place.  For the action fans, Revolutions has some seriously exhilarating action sequences that, while using 'bullet-time', didn't OVER use it as in Reloaded.For those interested in the story, Revolutions had the cerebral aspect so prevalent in the first film, yet missing in Reloaded.That being said, the two came together in a powerful third chapter of the Matrix trilogy.  To be honest, the first half hour to fourty-five minutes of the movie were, granted, a bit slow.  But from there it picked up the pace and kept it at an elevated level for all to enjoy...never quite missing a beat or falling back on lame cliches and Hollywood 'sunset' endings.For the most part, the loose ends from Reloaded are tied up quite well and leave the audience with a satisfactory 'aaah, I get it' feeling.  Some may find the ending a bit ambiguous, however, but if you paid close attention to the full series, it will be quite clear.Do not read further if you are not interested in spoilers or an my interpretation of the ending...
________BEGIN SPOILERS________The Oracle had stated 'all things that have a beginning must come to an end' and that Smith, basically, is the 'anti-Neo'.  He is Neo...only the opposite version of him.  At the end of the movie Smith stated the same thing the Oracle had regarding all things ending.  Neo then knew what he needed to do. He allowed himself to be taken over by Smith, thus 'choosing' (choice being an important theme throughout the trilogy) to 'end' himself.  If Neo no longer exists, than neither can the 'anti-Neo' for the only reason Smith (anti-Neo) existed in the first place was really BECAUSE of Neo.  Sounds a bit confusing, granted, but after watching all three (and, really, the Animatrix) it all falls into place.  It wasn't the machines that destroyed Smith.  It was Neo basically sacrificing himself to end his anti-self.
I have to admit I liked the way the entire series ended.  Had either side simply obliterated the other, I'd have been very disappointed.  Instead, both sides were able to live in 'peace' which was what the machines really wanted in the first place (watch the Animatrix and you'll learn this). Furthermore, not everyone was 'freed' from the Matrix.  Actually, you could miss this point since they stated it so swiftly.  Those that choose to leave, can, but those that wish to stay, can remain within the Matrix. Again coming full circle back to the point of the two pills from the first movie.The ending was a great way to allow closure to the trilogy without spoon-feeding or hand-holding the audience.  It also provided a satisfactory end to a great series without getting overly cheesy or becoming cliche.________END SPOILERS________
All in all, Revolutions was fantastic.  The acting was good (not superb, but not awful in the least), the action was incredible, the storyline was well played out and delivered and the special effects were, indeed, special.  I know there are going to be those that hate this movie for various reasons, but put aside any expectations or pre-conceived notions and let the ending take you where the storyline is SUPPOSED to go.  All in all, 9 out of 10 stars.",7,0,0,6 November 2003
The Evil Dead," Not the 'scare' so many claim it to be...
","While I can see the entertainment value in Evil Dead, I find it laughable that anyone would refer to this movie as 'scary'...especially in comparison to the Exorcist.  I remember feeling more fear during the flying monkey scene of The Wizard of Oz than any moment of Evil Dead.Now, don't get me wrong.  There were some good points to this movie.  For example, the camera shots with the 'demons' chasing and following through the woods had its potential.  Unfortunately, it was linked with a bad script and even worse acting.  Sam Raimi did well with never actually showing the demon, but spoiled this with his cheesy not-so-special effects of the friends-turned-demons inside the cabin.  It just didn't go over well. 
I've heard the 'it pokes fun at the genre, all the while taking itself seriously' argument.  That doesn't fly well with me...at least not when so many try to claim this film is 'scary'.  It simply isn't so.  Had Sam Raimi consistently used the scare-by-imagination route, this film probably would have been a more successful scare.  Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's as if Raimi couldn't decide what he wanted to do; and in the end, made an awful attempt at horror...even campy horror.  Sure there was blood and guts.  But to be successful, one has to actually *believe* that it is blood and guts we're seeing...not ketchup, corn syrup, or colored water.  Oh, and let's not forget the squirting milk that seems to be the chemical make-up of the demons. I understand this was made on a shoestring budget, but that doesn't mean it had to be horrible.  It *is* possible to create a good scare with little money and, like I said, had Raimi continued the assault on our imaginations, the Evil Dead would have been more successful in the fear department.Now, the negative aside, I can see why this movie has become a 'cult classic'.  It *is* indicative of the horror genre of the time period and does have its moments of sheer fun.  By no means would I recommend watching this if you're actually looking for a good scare.  However, for entertainment, a hearty laugh, and some good fun the Evil Dead does deliver. You simply cannot watch this movie without a sense of humor.",6,3,8,17 June 2003
Pulp Fiction," What a thrill ride!
","There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was 'in for' when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the 'f word'?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about 'gangsters' here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the 'f word' really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: 'it's ok to do drugs and kill people'.  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the 'it's the movies fault that there are problems...' tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars.",10,4,8,26 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Still captivates
","Very rarely are sequels as good, if not better, than their original. Normally we groan with mortification upon hearing a sequel being made to one of our favorite movies.  Such was not the case for Matrix Reloaded.  Now, I still thoroughly enjoy the original and hold it above Reloaded, but in no way does Reloaded fall short of the mark.The special effects are just as spectacular, the acting even better (with me growing to appreciate Keanu's talent more and more), and the cinematography incredible.  The set design for Zion was just absolutely fabulous.  I've read some weren't impressed with the storyline.  I, however, found it intriguing and in keeping with the Matrix theme. To me, anything else simply would have been a cop-out and not held up to the 'feel' of the movie in and of itself.  I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for anyone.Now, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with certain scenes.  The CG was just entirely TOO obvious and, at times, looked like the animatrix rather than the Matrix.  Had I been watching an animated version, I'd have been impressed, but since this was supposed to be 'real people', it only detracted from the experience for me...but not much.  Furthermore, some of the fight scenes WERE a bit overdone; but at the same time, I would have been seriously disappointed had Neo wiped out Smith in a kick or two.  So, again, this didn't detract much from the overall experience.  However, one aspect of the movie DID grate on my nerves...the unnecessary fight scenes thrown in just to...well, have a fight scene.  This definitely got old after a while.Aside from some of the minor flaws, Reloaded was incredibly entertaining. With humor, action, good acting, wonderful scenery, and awesome special effects, Reloaded proved it can hold up to its predecessor.  It's difficult going into a movie where you KNOW there's going to be a third one and you know who will be IN the third one...leaves little room for surprises.  Well, so you would think.  Reloaded was able to look beyond its upcoming sequel and pull you into the here and now; surprising you with its little twists and turns.Overall, this movie was just fantastic and a must see for Matrix fans, or even fans of action in general, and definitely will be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year (apart from Revolutions that is).  Out of 10 stars, I give Reloaded a 9...only taking a point away for the slight 'problems' I had with the film.  This is truly a must see!",9,0,0,17 May 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," A True and Timeless Classic. It Can and Will Endure the Test of Time.
","It annoys me to no end to see movies like 'My Cousin Vinny' depicted as a 'new classic' on certain cable stations.  I mean, no way can that movie hold up to TRUE classics such as It's A Wonderful Life.  Sure, I can understand certain films being deemed 'new classics' considering times change and so do our interests in movies and their plots.  But It's A Wonderful Life can and does withstand the test of time and will forever be a True Classic.  Very few movies can surpass generation after generation and still hold up as one of the all time best movies ever made.  This movie certainly accomplishes that...and this is after watching it 9.2 million times a year around Christmas time for the past 20+ years (only a SLIGHT exaggeration).The acting is phenomenal, and throughout the sometimes depressing story there are bits of humor sprinkled in...simply perfect!  Clarence is one guardian angel I would LOVE to have for no other reason than his humorous outlook and childlike demeanor.The storyline depicts a real man struggling to maintain his values and responsibilities all the while putting aside his own dreams, only to find that all he wants and needs he already has before him.  He is a real hero in a realistic world and can still be identified with today...even though times HAVE changed.I watched this film time and again growing up and it has become a tradition...like with many families.  Now, my husband and I enjoy this movie with our kids and they love it as much as we did.  This is definitely a movie the ENTIRE family can watch and enjoy...from the oldest to the youngest.  Few movies are able to be so profound, entertaining, and yet still reach out to all audiences.  It's A Wonderful Life has done that time and again.A definite 10 stars out of 10 and a must see.",10,1,5,17 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A wonderful journey into a world where magic is, indeed, real.
","Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be 'butchered' like most 'books to movies' are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively 'stick to the book' script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.Chamber of Secrets did this even better.As an avid reader, I am quite hesitant to see my beloved books displayed on screen only to have the directors do them no justice.  However, with both Harry Potter movies, the visuals were spectacular, the acting well done, and the characters almost perfectly matched.  The set design for Diagon Alley and the Weasley house was fabulous!  How wonderful to see these places come to life outside of our imaginations!  This stays true for nearly every aspect of Hogwarts...from the greenhouse, to the moving staircases, the dorms and Dumbledore's office.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson do superb jobs of playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  The movie undoubtedly draws you in and makes you forget that this isn't real...quite an acheivement!Of course, not all moviegoers will enjoy this one.  It is not for the die-hard action fan, the horror-only fans, or those that dislike a bit of magic, imagination, and fantasy.  But for the rest of us, Chamber of Secrets accurately depicts what until now, only our imaginations could see. Children will love this for the wizardry and magic, the struggle between Harry and his foes, the friendships that abound, and the simple fun of it all; while adults will love it for bringing them back to a time when magic was, indeed, real.All in all, I give this a 5 out of 5...fantastically done.  Of course, I would have liked to see a bit more scenes from the book added, but I understand time restrictions.  Great film and a definite must see!",9,14,16,17 May 2003
Jaws," Stay out of the water...watch Jaws instead!
","When I was about 7 years old, I watched this movie (along with Annie...what a combination!) almost every day...over and over again.  I was absolutely fascinated and captivated.  That summer we went camping and at first I had no problems going into the ocean.  Nothing was going to keep me from swimming...and certainly no shark!   Well, that is until news spread that a guy had caught a shark while fishing from the pier.  Granted, it was just a baby shark, but that didn't matter to me.  As far as I was concerned, Jaws had a baby and I was NOT going in that water again!  Many years have passed since I was seven, but this movie has lost none of its charm for me (not even in the hundreds of times I viewed it).  The sprinkles of humor still make me laugh, I still love to hate Quint, and I still find that shark absolutely thrilling.  Over the years Jaws has lost very little of its awe or fear; and even in today's overwhelming special effects, Jaws still can hold its own.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look beyond todays CG and other special effects and simply enjoy this movie for what it is and for its ability to make you think twice before swimming in the ocean again.  A truly fantastic movie earning  10 out of 10 stars.",10,1,2,19 May 2003
Bruce Almighty," Predictable but enjoyable
","Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan who is leading the average life. However, he wants more:  better apartment, better job, better car, etc. and basically blames God for his mediocrity.  God answers Bruce's call and gives him the chance to be 'Bruce Almighty', thus taking over the responsibilities of God.  It's not long before Bruce realizes God's work isn't as easy as he thought.While it's true that many funny scenes were given away during the trailers, that didn't detract from the overall enjoyment derived from the movie.  And although Bruce Almighty is not a laugh-a-minute, it does have it's hilarious moments.  However, coupled with the humor is a more serious and heartfelt message which is delivered unoffensively and without being over the top. I'd say the only real drawback for me was the predictability of this movie. But even with the predictability, the movie was no less enjoyable and worth watching.As for the acting, Jim Carrey did a splendid job as being jerky, rude, whiney, pitiful, kind and caring all in one.  Furthermore, it's quite nice to see his ability to do more serious work shine through with the necessary bits of comedic relief.All in all, Bruce Almighty is a movie I would recommend...especially if you enjoy comedy with a side of serious.  I give Bruce Almighty a 7 out of 10.",6,0,0,29 May 2003
Signs," Starts out great...fizzles in the end. Quite disappointing.
","After seeing Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I was all for Signs.  The trailers were excellent and compelling enough for me to want to see the movie as soon as it came out.  Of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, this by far, ranks at the bottom.  The story starts out quite strong...slowly building the background, developing the characters, and dropping hints for the viewers along the way. All of the actors did a fantastic job (save M. Night who really was rather flat and should stick to simply directing)...even the McCauley brother - who seems to have gotten all the talent of the family.  For the first 45 minutes to an hour the story is intriguing as are the characters.  A sort of eerie suspense can be felt building from quite early on in the movie.  Through dialogue, development, and flashbacks, you begin to learn that this is more than just an 'alien story'.And then it starts to fall apart.**WARNING** Spoilers!!  Do not read further if you have not seen the movie!I was on the edge of my seat, sharing Mel Gibson's fear of what was in the cornfield.  The newscast of the alien 'crashing' the birthday party had me scream almost as loud as Jaquin Phoenix.  I was prepared for the movie only to get better.  Unfortunately, it simply didn't hold up to the first half the movie.The aliens attacking the houses and the suspense that built up during that time as the family was holed up in the basement was incredible.  I love movies where you can be scared without having to be shown exactly what is scaring you...to me it is much more effective.  For this part of the movie, it worked.  Of course, this is also when the 'cheesiness' comes into play.  The little boy starts having an asthma attack, yet, OH NO his medicine is OUTSIDE of the room...very reminiscent of Panic Room.  However, for the sake of further developing Mel Gibson's character, I cn overlook this part to a degree. Then, just as it's getting good, it all stops.  Um, ok.  Well, I guess it had to somehow.  So basically, the aliens are defeated.  How?  Water. Perhaps the world was being overtaken by bad witches straight from Oz?  So, I have to then ask myself...why would aliens wish to 'take over' a planet that is 3/4ths water when it is water that kills them?  Furthermore, what would they do if it suddenly started raining?  Or what about the dew on the grass in the mornings?  I mean, COME ON!  This was simply a cop-out 'we can't kill off the main characters' ending that did not gel with the direction the story WAS taking us.  It was simply too easy.The story fantastically began drawing us in, living through the hopes, fears, regrets, sorrow, and hardships of each of the characters and yet ended so disappointingly.  I wanted to like this movie...but in the end, it was just, well, stupid.For entertainment value, I give the movie a 4 1/2 out of 5.  For compelling storyline, however, I can only give Signs 3 out of 5.  It really could have been better...considering what M. Night has proven he can do.",3,2,3,12 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Much better this time around!
","Although I enjoyed the first Xmen movie, I wasn't nearly as impressed with it as X2.  At times, Xmen would drag on and tried to pull you wherever it decided to go.  This time around, the script was much tighter and the action sequences so much more incredible.From the very start X2 captivates you.  With the introduction of Nightcrawler you realize you are in for one heck of a ride...and X2 does take you there.  Wolverine starts to become the Wolverine we remember from the comic books and cartoons...simply losing it at times.  Just GREAT!  The acting was phenomenal on most accounts...even James Marsden whom I typically don't like very much.  Anna Paquin, however, was a bit off on some of her scenes but not so much to ruin the movie or detract from the overall experience.  Magneto, Mystique, Dr. X, Wolverine, Pyro and even Iceman all gave fantastic performances...leaving you wanting for more.A definite must see!  Overall, I give X2 a 9 1/2 out of 10 stars...taking a half star because Anna Paquin really bugged the snot outta me in a few scenes.",9,0,0,17 May 2003
Heat," A Must See
","In the saturated genre of Action/Thrillers, Heat finds a way to stand tall above the masses, maintaining originality and an overwhelming sense of tension even despite moments of predictability. Michael Mann brilliantly utilizes both veteran actors (Pacino as Vincent Hanna, DeNiro as Neil McCauley), playing them with and against each other to the ultimate confrontation neither can avoid. There is an underlying depth to the film as the actions are incidental, its the characters that matter. While the defining line between good guy/bad guy is drawn it is equally blurred as your empathy lies with both men, understanding they're one and the same, each capable of being on the other side. Black and white hardly exists here, but rather those murky shades of gray that calls to question what matters most, what truly defines us: the motivation or the actions, the man himself or his job? Truly a magnificent cinematic feast.",10,0,1,11 October 2010
The Thin Red Line," Poetry, pure poetry
","The Thin Red Line is poetry on film: a beautiful, bitter, harrowing, thought-provoking contemplation of life, love, death, pain, loss and fear. Without playing too much to one side or the other, the film depicts each viewpoint as if it's of the utmost importance and the line between enemies is slowly blurred by common human emotion. The quiet, almost hypnotic voice overs lull the viewer into a sense of calm that is in stark contrast to the violent struggles of war splayed out across the screen. The beauty in every shot only further illustrates the tragedies that play across the landscapes. There's no typical war movie here. Instead, it's a hauntingly philosophical look at the effects of war on all involved...from the soldiers in the field, to the hardened commander, the 'enemy' and those left behind at home.",10,3,6,11 October 2010
The Breakfast Club," 80's all the way
","Ok, I must admit that I am a fan of the 80's genre.  From 'one-hit-wonders' to the 'Brat Pack' and so on, the 80's gave us a plethora of insignificant albeit esoteric trivia.  Just as those who didn't experience the 60's and 70's firsthand can never understand what living in that time meant, the same applies to those that did not grow up in the 80's.  There's a certain charm...appeal...and yes, absurdity to it all.  Often times the write-off is, 'well, it *was* the 80's'.  Indeed, it was.  And so the Breakfast Club captures much of the essence of the 80's:  teen movies with the jock, the dweeb, and the menace to society (along with some 'moral' we're supposed to walk away from the film with).  Ok, so it really had little impact on, well, anything but that doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment value of the movie itself.Breakfast Club is chock-full of one-liners you'll hear repeated long after the point of the movie has left your brain.  These one-liners make this movie (along with many others in the 80's) worth watching.  Sure, it's predictable.  Sure, it's 'cheesy'.  And sure, it's stereotypical 80's.  But dangit, it's fun!  I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie, yet it's lost none of its appeal for me.  Have fun with this one...let it take you where it goes and expect nothing more than it wants (or is able) to give.For pure enjoyment value...nothing more nothing less...I give Breakfast Club 4 1/2 stars.",9,0,1,7 July 2003
The Godfather," Powerful and incredible...
","I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this movie, especially since I love 'mobster' movies.  But, no matter how many times they showed it on cable networks, I refused to watch it when it would be edited and cut to pieces.  Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.  Although I think Al Pacino has the potential to be a great actor, I haven't cared much for seeing him in movies because he always seems the exact same. However, in The Godfather he was different (yet still the same).  I saw much more versatility in him...from young and full of ideals to finally finding his place in the family business.  He wasn't his usual over the top 'HOOHA' thug like in so many movies.  Quite refreshing.  Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorites and his performance was fantastic...fitting right into his role like a hand to a glove.The Godfather has become one of my all time favorite movies and the more I watch it, the more I discover what I hadn't noticed in prior viewings.  To me, this is a timeless piece that only gets better with each time you watch the movie.  It definitely has lost none of its appeal in the years gone by.Without a doubt, The Godfather earns a 10 out 10 stars; and of course, is a DEFINITE must see.  But please, don't watch this in an edited version...it simply is not the same.",10,1,3,19 May 2003
