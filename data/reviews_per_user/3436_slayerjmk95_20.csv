Mission: Impossible III," Lens Flares, Chases, and Ethan Hunt
","This is, without a doubt, one of the best action movies to date and just as good as the new Mission: Impossible film, Ghost Protocol (which means the best). Ethan Hunt (played by the awesome and bad-ass Tom Cruise) has just gotten married; life has never been better, until the IMF calls Ethan in on a rescue mission to secure and transport a fellow agent, whom Ethan previously trained and mentored. Before the mission is completed, things go from bad to worst; Ethan looses a friend, and a massive terror plot is unveiled for Ethan to prevent.J.J. Abrams, one of the most imaginative and intelligent directors/writers of the decade, mastered this film without breaking a sweat and took it so far that Tom Cruise was even thrown against a car by a (very) close explosion. Tom Cruise is at the top of his game here, giving not just a great acting performance, but a believable take on a man with everything to lose, and shows it in just about every action scene from middle to end. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames, the genius Luther Stickell, and new arrivals Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers play out their roles perfectly. All in all, this film is a great addition to the M:I film series and a wonderful action-packed thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final scene.9/10 Stars***",9,6,10,31 December 2011
Sucker Punch," You will be Unprepared
","When i saw the previews for this movie, i thought that it might not be worth spending money, or time, for; i was WAY wrong. Zack Snyder has finally come out with an original film from his own mind about a girl, Babydoll, who is placed in a mental asylum by her wicked stepfather to be lobotomized, but the doctor won't be there until five days later. So, in order to keep herself sane and to forget about the 'torture' done to her by the orderlies, Babydoll befriends four other girls who help her try to escape from the asylum before the High Roller (doctor) gets there.People are probably hating this movie because they don't understand the transition from asylum to dance studio to epic combat sequences. The dance studio that Babydoll pictures herself in is the asylum, just in a much nicer manner, and when she dances, she's actually being 'confronted' by Blue (Oscar Isaac) in the real world/asylum. The combat sequences that are shown to the audience when she supposedly dances is her internal conflict to stay alive and to fight the horrors that Blue acts upon her. The movie overall is a true spectacle, with incredible visuals, wonderful acting, and a compelling story that grips you to your seat as you wait to find out what happens after each fantasy sequence. This is a great movie, and people should have an open mind when watching it, or look at all the details and figure out the story through the characters. Either way, this movie will always be a favorite for me. 8/10 Stars",8,1,2,13 August 2011
Source Code," Duncan Jones
","When i saw this at a preview screening, i was not surprised to find another great film from one of the best sci-fi directors of our time; Duncan Jones, who brought us the instant classic, Moon. Source Code is in part an original movie but bears brief resemblance to Tony Scott's Action/Thriller Deja Vu. Source Code centers itself around Colter Stevens, an AFO soldier who wakes upon a train, not knowing how he got there or why and how people are addressing him as someone else, and soon enough the train explodes, supposedly killing everyone. But Stevens awakes to find himself in a kind of 'machine' called the Source Code.The whole story is fantastic, with a man (Stevens) having to go back in time and trying to find out who is behind the bombing. With even more praise is the directing, script, and the choice of actors for the roles. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect in the role of Stevens as Jeffery Wright was for his role as Dr. Rutledge who believes everything has to go his way or the 'mission' will be ruined. Overall, this is a thriller that is not to be missed. But for those who have seen this as well, i agree that if the ending was different and more powerful, the movie would be an INSTANT science fiction classic, but it falls just short of that. Still one that will be remembered for all time, in my opinion.9/10 Stars***",9,119,189,27 March 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Very Good Effort and an Action Masterpiece
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is the new movie from director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Night Watch) and Tim Burton, based upon the book by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the film's screenplay. What if Abe Lincoln was not just a President of the United States, but a vampire hunter, and that history was actually clouded by a series of lies? Bear witness to the truth behind one of America's greatest Presidents that changed the course of history and the fate of humanity.The script was well-written, bearing resemblance to the novel in ways, but never a 100% adaptation. The actors/actresses were fantastic and great for the roles they were given. Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln was fantastic; he was not only believable, but showed a certain determination and love for peace that no other actor could have shown in the role of this old President. Rufus Sewell was incredible as Adam, the main antagonist and leader of the vampires wanting to control America. Erin Wasson was just stunning as Vadoma, who never showed a single care in the world for anyone other than herself. The visual effects were not 'Avatar'-standards, but were still fantastic to the point where they worked; the one scene where visuals were phenomenal was the train sequence. The music by Henry Jackman worked great, as it blended in with the film itself, cued in for the right moments when needed.Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was a fun, well-made film that could be considered an action masterpiece as it never let up on its impressive action or suspense. The downsides were that it should have been at least 20 minutes longer to fill in gaps and prolong the story, which went by WAY too fast, and the poor script",7,13,25,22 June 2012
The Maze Runner," An Exciting, Dark and Surprisingly Good Blockbuster
","I can see how people are turned away by this film by either its similarities to 'Lord of the Flies' or to other young adult books- to-film movies like 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent,' but let me say, this is better than most of these young adult-themed movies, including the first Hunger Games movie. I won't write-up the plot, since it's been written elsewhere and on other reviews; straight into the review we go.'The Maze Runner' is a surprisingly fantastic sci-fi thriller that succeeds by having superb acting, fantastic visual effects with a stellar production design, a pulse-pounding musical score, focused direction and a well-written script that, while does have clichés, works with them in a very good and fresh way. I personally was impressed with the acting a great deal, especially Dylan O'Brien and Aml Ameen. The visual effects were awesome and never looked cheesy or under-valued, which is even cooler since the film is fairly low- budgeted compared to most blockbusters, taking the 'District 9'- route. Wes Ball's direction was outstanding, the way he captured the dark, haunting atmosphere, that sense of a looming evil and how the unknown was the biggest enemy, not just the terrifying Grievers (which were actually creepy). The script, too, was outstanding, but seemed to lack the full force the film required to be an absolute SF classic. It's here one can draw many comparisons, but even so, it was still well-written and didn't slip up once, playing into its clichés by placing them in spots you don't see coming until they happen, leaving you with the 'Ah, i should have seen that coming!'- moment.'The Maze Runner' is a great beginning to a new series of films that will probably extend outside a trilogy, with a prequel having been written and another on the way next year. Hopefully 'The Scorch Trials' step up the atmosphere and writing, and with original cast members attached and Wes Ball directing still, i have high hopes.",8,0,1,7 February 2015
World War Z," Highly Entertaining, Globe-trotting Epic
","World War Z, while based off the Max Brooks novel of the same name, is in no way a direct adaptation, and happily, this works for the film's benefit. When Gerry Lane, a former UN worker is tasked to help a scientist travel across the planet to discover a cure for the rapidly growing zombie infection, he also is troubled by leaving his family behind while the world around him collapses into chaos.Directed by Marc Forster, WWZ is easily one of the most entertaining and epic zombie films ever made. Now this being said, many zombie fanatics will disagree, I know this, as some think you need bloody/gory violence and flesh-tearing. This movie proves otherwise, and the zombies here are among the most frightening zombies I've ever seen, being very reminiscent of the 'rage-infused' zombies of 28 Days Later. Brad Pitt is at his A-Game here, being both believable as a father and an unsung hero. Mireille Enos was great as Karin Lane, being the very sensitive, but careful mother who knows how to deal with the situation instead of screaming her head off when zombies are at her back. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and breath-taking, especially after the incredible plane crash sequence. The music by Marco Beltrami is award-worthy, capturing both the horrific atmosphere of a collapsing world and human drama of what we're capable of in such disastrous times. The script, though, while well-written, went from being Oscar-material, to a normal blockbuster script that (happily) doesn't insult your intelligence, or become stupid. But there is plenty of room to make a sequel or two because the story here is much to grand for one film.Overall, World War Z is one of the best blockbusters of the year, with good acting, directing, and polished visuals that have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I would have to say, this is one of Brad Pitt's best films",9,91,189,10 June 2013
Constantine," A Comic-to-Film Masterpiece
","Coming from a DC/Marvel comics fan, I've seen the failures and the Oscar-worthy ones, and Constantine comes right up there. A man is born with the 'gift' to see demons and angels on our plain of existence. This man is John Constantine; a man with a destiny who sees no reason in pursuing it, letting himself die slowly, smoking 15 cigarettes a day and exorcising demons so he can buy his way into Heaven. But something is happening, something that is altering the balance of the world, and John is the only one who stands in the way of it happening.Keanu Reeves is perfect as Constantine, a careless but brave man who tries to keep the Earth in balance with power created by God and the Devil. Rachel Weisz is good as Angela, the detective whose twin sister supposedly commits suicide, but the plot thickens as demons try to cross-over onto our plain of existence. Constantine is a truly great comic book adaptation that has intense action sequences, great acting, astounding CGI, a phenomenal score, and a great story that should be remembered for its true creativity and take on the supernatural.9/10 Stars***",8,2,3,3 July 2011
Interstellar," An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown
","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",9,1544,2297,3 November 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," The First Avenger
","I was truly lucky to catch a preview screening of Captain America and i am ever so grateful because Cap is without a doubt one of the best Marvel-hero films of all time. Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America, having his extremely heroic tendencies and his weaknesses (you see them progress from the beginning of the movie). He has no terrible lines and, coming from a comic-book fan, knows how to fill the shoes of a superhero without any real powers, during WWII. Joe Johnston was a fantastic choice as the director, with a pretty good 'track record' behind him (Hidalgo, Jurassic Park III, Jumanji, October Sky). Joe truly knows how to show us a sci-fi story during a historic time period without having any hiccups or mistakes that could bring the movie down greatly.Captain America is one of the greatest Marvel comic-book adaptations of all time and should not be missed, even if you aren't a comic book fan because Cap has everything any action/adventure movie would have to make it great. Don't miss it 9/10 Stars***",8,114,221,17 July 2011
Oblivion," A Fantastic and Note-worthy Experience of Good SF
","In the world of science fiction, there have been many stories that have been adapted to the point where we've just grown tired of the same old stuff, but sometimes, someone comes along and re-creates that story with great vision and excellence. Oblivion is one of these movies, offering different and unique plot points, fantastic acting, phenomenal visuals and directing that is pitch-perfect. Following an alien invasion, 60 years have passed, and Earth is now a wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a member of team 49, goes around repairing drones, which canvas the planet and eliminate the aliens still there. But when Jack is captured by a human resistance leader on Earth (Morgan Freeman), he is told that everything he knows is a lie, and that something is very, very wrong. He sides with these mysterious rebels, and begins to fight for not just love, but for his home.Joseph Kosinski, the director and co-writer, as well as writer of the graphic novel the film is based on, creates a truly fantastically frightening world with Oblivion. His direction in many scenes is so smooth and crisp that you forget, this is only is second film. The acting is superb, with Tom Cruise being at the height of his game after doing the well-made thriller Jack Reacher, based off of Lee Child's novel. I can understand why people were upset with Morgan Freeman's short screen time, but at least he was in it. I still came to love his character because he was an important one; he made Jack see reality. Olga Kurylenko was great in her role as the mysterious woman who knows Jack from his past. The visual effects, once again, were stunning, with the post-apocalyptic Earth being truly remarkable and extremely detailed. But the aliens were a true treat in the film, being very unique and different. Now, while I see many people trying to find ways of lowering the rating for the film, like movie connections, I can say, the connections are incredibly vague and little. Those who claim this is too close to 'The Matrix', it's not. Humans were enslaved, and used as batteries by machines. In Oblivion, we are nearly extinct, and aliens have come and gone. Jack Harper is a curious individual, while Neo was content with 'his' reality. Malcolm Beech was a leader, but had limits, while Morpheus had zero. I could keep going, but that just takes away from the review. The music by M83 was just spectacular; a must-listen and own for anyone who appreciates musical soundtracks and scores.Overall, Oblivion is a great addition to a constantly growing sci-fi universe that has had great additions in the past five years alone, and more to come. This is not a film for everyone, being a straight-up science fiction film, but for anyone who loves action, sci-fi or good filmmaking. Now, I do see a few award-worthy things about Oblivion, including Tom Cruise's acting, M83's musical score and the visual effects, but mainly this is just one to be seen and acknowledged for its greatness for expanding the genre, and adding a fresh and creative vision to the mix, but not a contender for Best Picture, sadly, falling just short of that, but still a better film of the year.9/10 Stars***",8,91,166,11 April 2013
Insidious," Insidious Is
","Insidious is not a new idea of a horror film, but it is a new take on the subject; having a family get caught up in a horrific matter that has a wife (played by Rose Bryne) and her husband's (played by Patrick Wilson) son, who's mind is trapped in an otherworldly place beyond our realm of existence called 'The Further'. The story is great and the acting was great, no super-cheesy, one-liners or off-the-wall moments; it's just a plain and simple deliverance that achieves build-up scares, emotion, and just an overall spectacle not seen since Steven Spielberg's Poltergeist. Insidious Is a classic not just among horror films, but among the family drama. It shows that parents would do anything to keep their children safe, no matter the cost. Insidious is a theater-worthy film and a must-see. Don't think twice about seeing this movie, even if it's from the makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity, because it is WAY better than both, or if it's PG-13 because it shows the bloody, gory horror films how to make an effective horror without ripping off body parts or dismembering victims. I recommend this movie for all horror fans and for anyone who likes the actors and actresses in the film because the performances in this movie were great!9/10 Stars***",8,17,32,18 March 2011
2012," Disaster-movie 101: Blow Up Everything
","Why are so many people hating on this movie? If read up on anything about it, it's a DISASTER movie! Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE 'what if' on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.The two main actors in this movie (John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor) stole the show, portraying the two main protagonists in this story about the truth behind the Mayan calender ending on December 21, 2012 that proclaims the end of the world is coming. The one character/actor that should have won critical appraisal for his role was Oliver Platt as the main antagonist; he believes the needs of the few surpass the needs of the many, which doesn't sit well with others.Overall, with great CGI, decent to good acting, pretty good story, and some likable characters, 2012 is a fun and entertaining ride into the end of one world and the beginning of another. The big question that haters should ask themselves when reading this is, 'What would you do when the end comes?' What i know is that you don't know what others would do if it did come. Therefore, the actions of the characters in the movie are plausible (except for some of the incredibly close calls).",7,2,4,2 December 2011
I Am Legend," One of the Best Films of the Decade
","I Am Legend is a truly incredible piece of entertainment and a great achievement for the sci-fi genre. Set in the near-future of New York City, after a virus strain has basically wiped out the human civilization, a doctor named Robert Neville (Smith) does his best to survive the now barren Earth. Or so it seems. Half the Earth's human population died after infected, but a slightly lower number didn't die; they changed. People became vampire-like creatures, only coming out at night looking for food. As Neville survives with his only companion, his dog Samantha, he sends out distress broadcasts out over all radio-frequencies, hoping someone will answer.This sets the scene for I Am Legend. Will Smith is beyond fantastic as Neville, being partly paranoid as he has had no connections with any humans what-so-ever for years. The setting of New York City is astounding as they actually shot the movie there, filling in the post-apocalyptic pieces with CGI such as grass growing in the street, wild animals roaming the city, and the once-human monsters that Neville must face. The plot build-up that occurs throughout the film is extraordinary, filling in the basic details about Neville's life and how it changed for the worst, and how the world became what it is now. I Am Legend is no doubt an award-winner, and it's truly sad to see it not come to that. But for those who know how great this movie is, we will never forget it, for (in respective terms) 'He is legend.' 9.5/10",9,1,2,19 December 2010
War of the Worlds," Alien Invasion at its Best
","Steven Spielberg is well-known for his moderately-budgeted, box office hits and classics, but in 2005 he brought to the screen a new and different looking adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel that was truly an intense shocker; War of the Worlds. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, this sci-fi blockbuster revisited the alien invasion sub-genre with a vengeance; think 'Saving Private Ryan' but as a PG-13 movie with aliens as the enemy. The violence was not held back, the intensity was dialed all the way up and the performances of the two leads were spectacular. Tim Robbins' small but effective role was pleasing as well.When it comes to the alien invasion sub-genre, there have been many films released to this day that have both been great and terrible (terrible being the recent Skyline and Darkest Hour films; they had great aliens and designs, but terrible scripts and direction). Happily, War of the Worlds was kind of a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day, having the intense close encounters with thousands of people being killed off, and an emotional human story at the center of it all; a father trying to bring his family to safety. The script was fantastic, having only a couple moments where it wasn't all believable. The visual effects, top-notch, even to this day; Steven Spielberg knew how to place their money on the sets and CG. The music was as classical as ever as well, with John Williams bringing us another suspense-filled masterpiece that's also loaded with emotion and trauma. For the film itself (in running time) there were plenty of unanswered questions, but some of those questions could be answered with a sequel (which i hope Steven sees), while some questions you have to answer yourself.Overall, War of the Worlds was and is a fantastic alien invasion film that shows us that a sci-fi blockbuster can act like a powerful war drama loaded with heart and emotion. Transformers can be put to shame with this movie in mind9/10 Stars***",8,3,5,13 August 2012
Prometheus," Prometheus: A New, Certain Epic from Ridley Scott
","Prometheus was a phenomenal and intense sci-fi masterpiece from the mastermind behind the 1979 classic, Alien, Ridley Scott, who has returned to sci-fi after 30 years, and his return is a big one. Prometheus is about a team of scientists and researchers who team with Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Hollaway (played by Logan Marshall-Green and Noomi Rapace) on a search for the biggest answer to one of the most controversial questions; who created us? When they arrive at the planet of the creatures' supposed home-world, everything goes wrong and the search for our beginning may lead to our end.Prometheus is loaded with great performances and actors/actresses, with two performances standing out, one of them being obvious; Michael Fassbender as David. Michael truly captivated and stole the screen as the new android who watches over the crew of the Prometheus, and as the movie progresses, you see a very mysterious and straight-forward change in his programming, which has you on edge, it being villainous in nature. The other character many people don't recognize much was Idris Elba as Janek, the captain of the Prometheus. For me, he stole the screen towards the end of the movie, and had various scenes before in where he was my favorite, one including him trying to get Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) in bed with him. The rest of the performances were fantastic, but i must move on. The visual effects: top-notch. There was no mistake whatsoever in the visuals; they were built around a 'shock-and-awe' factor, as well as a certain beauty in creation, only explained if you see the film, as spoiling it would ruin most of the film. The directing was fantastic, with Ridley being at his A-game, capturing the moments some directors couldn't (one that was truly disturbing and grotesque involving Noomi). The music by Marc Streitenfeld was just spectacular, as it fit with every scene and the overall tone of the film, moving from an interesting, thought-provoking masterpiece to a bloody, terror-inducing epic.Prometheus was, all-in-all, an instant classic worthy of the Alien saga. But that's the first mistake made; you can't truly compare this to the Alien movies, since its story is its own, but takes place in the same story universe, involving the Xenos. I just hope Ridley stays with this new set-piece in the saga and makes a trilogy out of Prometheus, because in a way, it can work.9.5/10 Stars***",8,17,39,8 June 2012
1408," A Great Stephen King Adaptation
","Based on the short story 1408 by Stephen King, a writer named Mike Enslin, after loosing faith in basically everything, stays in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City to prove that the many deaths and accidents in it were all just mishaps, and not caused by supernatural phenomena, only to find out that the room truly is 'something.' 1408 is directed by Mikael Hafstrom, and he truly knows how to combine a horror story into a drama, adding to the emotions of the character(s) involved. John Cusack is great as Enslin, a man who has lost something close to him and now feels he has to find ghosts in order to find what he lost. John portrays Enslin so well, becoming extremely paranoid and disturbed as his character is stuck in 1408. The supporting cast is great as well, with Samuel L. Jackson filling in the shoes of Gerald Olin, the hotel manager, who knows what the room truly is, and Mary McCormack as Enslin's wife, who he is separated from. The story is fantastic, with so much background filled in about the room and how is has affected many people in various ways over the years, and as you come to see how powerful 'it' is, you also see how the room truly is a thing. 1408 is among the best Stephen King adaptations of all time and should be seen by all Stephen King fans, and anyone who likes a great thriller.9/10 Stars***",8,1,2,14 July 2011
The Iron Giant," Best Animated Film of All Time
","I watch almost any kind of movie, and when it comes to animated features, they have to be truly heart-warming to capture the real spirit of a family film. There have been plenty throughout the years that deserve immediate and all time praise; Toy Story (1, 2 and 3), How to Train Your Dragon, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Shrek, Wall-E, and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (underrated Dreamworks cartoon). But no cartoon deserves more praise and acknowledgment than Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.The Iron Giant is set in 1957 and stars Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, an alien machine that crash-lands on Earth and is soon befriended by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), who discovers that 'Giant', as Hogarth calls him, eats metal for food. Not long after all this, a government agent (Christopher McDonald) arrives and begins to cause trouble, and soon chaos as he believes Giant to be a foreign weapon sent to destroy America. I have never seen anything like this movie before; constantly heart-warming, family-fun comedy moments (which are great), and an emotionally shattering climax that is truly memorable. If you really love to watch movie and, not only be entertained, but moved, then The Iron Giant is one you have to watch. I would also have to say, Warner Bros. should be ashamed for the bad marketing they did for this movie; just like Brad Bird said, 'They had no idea what they had in their hands.' This should have won a few Oscars and Golden Globes; it deserves it. 10/10 Stars***",10,2,4,1 December 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Intense and Bombastic Superhero Blockbuster
","Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's the moment many comic book fans have been waiting for- myself included -and while it's far from perfection, it was a good, intense and bombastic ride that I won't forget, with a battle between two iconic superheroes that was actually quite outstanding in itself.I thought Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne was superb. He brought a different kind of gravitas to the role, where in this universe he's more broken, hardened and brutal in his skills, mind-set and personality. He also shows that tragic side we saw with Christian Bale's Batman, but I don't think one did it better than the other (and I do personally think Bale is still #1 for being Batman, but Affleck can be better with more time in the role). Cavill's Superman was good, but I felt he was more a supporting role before the big battle of the movie, which I didn't mind, but felt a little underwhelming, considering this is technically supposed to be the 'Man of Steel' pseudo-sequel. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, honestly, I thought was really cartoonish and, while not a complete disservice to the character, wasn't good enough; Kevin Spacey's was better in Superman Returns. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, on the other hand, was pure brilliance in her short screen time, and I'm dying to see her solo film. Zack Snyder's direction, I personally felt was better here than Man of Steel, but it felt incomplete, which makes sense since there is a Director's Cut coming later this year. The script, too, co-written by Chris Terrio, was solid, but showcased too much content. For instance, Doomsday. The inclusion of this monstrosity was completely unnecessary, as he was wasted in the final act of the movie, being 'cannon fodder' for the fight, prolonging the epic conflict. Instead, what should have happened is they should have ended the film with his creation, showing that there will be an even more diabolical and insidious threat on the horizon (even though there still is one, subtly hinted at).Batman v Superman was a solid action film with some great visuals, stunning musical score to accompany the disastrous destruction and sweeping fight that's gorgeously filmed, and boasts a few great performances amidst a few other decent to mediocre performances. I also have to say, to end my review, critics are being quite foolish and ignorant by comparing this to Marvel's MCU, being too grim and dark instead of 'fun' and a little more heart. They aren't movies, but have critics forgotten Daredevil and Jessica Jones? Marvel can do grim, dark and violent, but that's what separated DC from Marvel, the penchant to stick with the truly awful and horrifying forces in the dark. I just hope they can continue an uphill climb, because this is a marathon, not a sprint.",7,3,6,27 March 2016
Godzilla," The Godzilla Remake No One Saw Coming
","The original Godzilla is a classic, and is still an extremely entertaining movie to this day, but it lacks a certain relevance and heart seen today in other big (and small) movies. So when i heard there was a Godzilla remake happening, i couldn't not think of the disaster that was Roland Emmerich's Godzilla. Then, i saw the previews, and i was blown away. In this re-imagining, Godzilla is a terrifying force of nature that fights to defeat the MUTOs, Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms. But what really makes this Godzilla remake stand out is the 'human element,' present in the lead human characters portrayed by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Ken Wantanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen and David Strathairn.Honestly, I think this Godzilla is better than the original, and for multiple reasons. Firstly, Gareth Edward's direction. The movie feels like a Batman Begins-esque version of a Godzilla franchise, where we don't see the titular character for most of the first third of the film, but more and more as the film progresses, and it works extremely well. And the way Edwards grounds the film in reality and with the times is just amazing, and disturbing. The acting is absolutely incredible, and surprisingly enough, it's not Bryan Cranston that steals the show; Taylor-Johnson does it with his 'everyman' character, Ford Brody. The visual effects were easily the best part of the film, and some of the best visual effects of all time. There wasn't a single moment that had me thinking, 'That's definitely CG there.' I was completely glued to my seat in awe, like most of the other people in the theater and didn't think twice about what I was seeing. Even the musical score by Alexandre Desplat was haunting and epic, with the main theme being extremely memorable (I was humming it on my way out of the theater). The script was great, but there were moments where, they were fantastic and all, but felt like filler-moments; you didn't need them, but they worked.Godzilla was a superb and epic monster movie that i think is a masterpiece in filmmaking, and could be hailed as a classic further down the line. I agree with some critics in that the marketing campaign was a bit lousy in that they showed off Godzilla a little too much (since he isn't seen constantly throughout the film), but to lower the score of the film because of giant lizard's absence in the first act isn't right; it isn't.9/10 Stars",8,31,59,11 May 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Cybertron Lives On
","In this epic conclusion to the Transformers trilogy, Earth's final stand against the Decepticons is about to begin. Starting off with a fast-paced war scene on Cybertron, then switching to the 1960's when man finally lands on the Moon, only to have a secret agenda of their own, hidden from the world; to investigate an alien ship that crash-landed. With mind-blowing CGI, good to descent acting, good story, and intense action sequences, Transformers: Dark of the Moon proves itself to be the best of the trilogy. The friendship with Sam and Bumblebee is really emotional as they are on the brink of destruction and even greater tensions arise as Sam is told by Mearing, the new head of the Autobots operation, he is no hero and will not be needed in their fight. Lennox and Epps return as Sam's friends and contacts in the military, only to become more distraught over the years as the fight between Decepticons and Autobots begins to take its toll on them. Dark of the Moon really shows that after a disastrous sequel, a third installment can correct the mistakes that were made previously, except this did more than that; Dark of the Moon beats both of the first 2 movies put together, having the first film's in-depth story and characters, and the second film's incredibly intense action sequences. So, overall, Dark of the Moon deserves praise for its true effort to become something great.9/10 Stars***",7,25,41,29 June 2011
