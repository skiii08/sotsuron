United 93," A Haunting Experience
","This is a film you will not enjoy viewing. You don't watch this movie to kill time. This is not a movie you see if with your drinking buddies. This is definitely not the type of movie you see with a date. And yet, it's essential viewing for every human being on this planet.What Paul Greengrass does flawlessly is recapture the atmoshere on that fateful day in history. Confusion, lack of communication, and chaos was on everyone's mind involved. We are presented no back-story to anyone of the characters, whether it be the average people going about their business, the people working air control, or even the terrorists themselves. This effect is perfect for the story because, at it's core, it's a human story.The balance of the story is perfect. It goes from how the air control attempted to handle a situation that couldn't comprehend, to the nail-biting final ten minutes that left me breathless.I remember the first time I saw this movie, on television. I cried like a baby at the film's end, something I'm not prone to doing. It was on my mind that rest of the day, carrying over to the next. The next film I saw it - months later - I cried like a baby again. The next time after that, the same reponse. If you're looking for an easy-breezy experience, skip this film. This film NEEDS to be shown inn high schools in the future, as a reminder of the great evil that exists in the world, and the everyday heroes that stood up to it.Without a doubt in my mind: 10/10",10,0,0,27 July 2011
Argo," Vibrant blend of humor, tension, and history
","'Argo' presents maybe the greatest, if not the most absurd, account of American foreign policy espionage widely unbeknownst to the greater majority. The story, which falls perfectly into the category of you-can't-make-this-kind-of-thing-up, is based upon Tony Mendez's rescue of six isolated US diplomats out of Iran, during the time of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1980, through the means of creating a fake film production as cover.Director Ben Affleck proves here just how incredibly mature and restrained a filmmaker he's become, molding what is inherently a political story, yet wisely setting aside the politics. He masterfully handles the changes in tone very fluidly, from one moment being edge of your seat tension, to the next of inspired comic relief. It brings back memories of 70's thrillers, when craft and entertaining went together hand-in-hand.The cast of veteran character-actors is worth the price of admission alone. Nearly every speaking role is occupied by a recognizable face, with the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Bob Gunton, Michael Parks, Kyle Chandler, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and more. This is easily the best cast of 2012 and, better yet, they all brought out there A game.'Argo' is not a film to miss, its subject matter being more relevant than ever and will be a major contender come award season (and deservedly so.)9/10 -Pycs",9,108,206,12 October 2012
Knocked Up," Disappointed. . .
","<ul><li>MINOR SPOILERS (Nothing that will ruin the film!!!) - </li></ul>I had high anticipations for this film, seeing as how it scored a 90% approval rating on RottenTomatoes and a 7.4 here. Judd Apatow's first directing effort turned out to be a delightful sex comedy in 2005's 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin.' Seth Rogen has proved to be funny (in moderations) during his early efforts, could this be the staring vehicle that launches his career? The story: It follows a slacker (played by Rogen) who's one night stand with Katherine Heigl's character leads to her pregnancy. Simple plot that could of really provided big time laughs. But the narrative is so clichéd in the way it evolves. After she gets pregnant, he's shocked. Then he enters Heigl's character's life, in an aim to father the child. They (inevitably in these sort of situations) get in a fight and break up, only to reunite at the end. It's basically the formula for any Will Ferell film, just with different actors.Is it funny? Ehhhhhh. Sort of. I give the film credit for not relying heavily on crude humor, as so many comedies are these days. There were genuinely funny moments in the film. I chuckled a few times throughout. But a chuckle here and there isn't enough for me to recommend the movie.How'd the actors do? The acting was surprisingly good for a movie of this nature. Seth Rogen, while I didn't think he was excellent. proved to be just enough to carry the film. And Katherine Heigl, well, this is probably her best performance she's given (which doesn't say much when looking at her body of work.) Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give great supporting help, even if they're a little overused. Some small cameos provide the funniest moments, such as Kirsten Wiig's tiny part.The final verdict? 6/10. A slight above average film that's forgettable but a good way to kill some time.",6,0,0,27 July 2011
21 Jump Street," Worth Your Time
","'21 Jump Street' is a largely forgotten late 80s/early 90s television show, which today is widely acknowledged for helping launch the career of actor Johnny Depp, who you made of heard of. Having not seen a single episode of the program (which was before my time), could I make it through this film with a complete understanding without any backstory? Let me get one thing straight: unlike the show (which deals with such heavy issues as child abuse, homophobia, AIDS, and hat crimes), this is a raunchy comedy. And the movie's not afraid to admit it, as the first ten minutes alone provide us with a galore of genitalia and gross out gags. Normally, these would scare me away and become a liability when considering how one movie would score. Maybe it's the fact that the funniest moments stem from witty banter or creative sequences rather than gross out themselves, but it the raunchiness didn't seem to bother me (for the most part.) Then there's Channing Tatum. If you were to bring his name up anytime before this year, I would shutter.I mean, we all know he might not have the greatest resume ('Fighting' anyone?), but he's honestly one of the best things about this movie. So much so that he even manages to be better than Jonah Hill, one of the best comedic actors working today. Rob Riggle and Ice Cube each provide inspired supporting roles that are nearly laugh out loud funny each time they're on screen, never feeling forced or overused.Does the film have problems? Well...yeah. I won't deny that. Some of the jokes fall flat, while some jokes that initially worked are stretched a little too far. There's the (inevitably) love story between one of the main characters and a high school girl feels too forced and only is there to serve as a 'love story.' But, for the most part, I completely enjoyed it, though I can't ever see myself taking time to watch it again.So if turning a serious-themed show like '21 Jump Street' into a very good raunchy comedy does make me wonder if other old 80s TV shows would make a similar transition. Wouldn't Alf as a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed slacker who still lives with his mom in modern day Los Angeles be an instant classic?",8,20,39,19 March 2012
Apocalypse Now," Required Viewing
","My God this is a film. It's an adventure. It's an epic. It's a mind trip. It's a film people will be watching 150 years from now.Naturally, only a classic like this has to have a disaster story behind it. The making of this film is one of the notorious failures. Millions over budget, star suffering a heart attack at 35, and Marlon Brando showing up on set overweight. The funniest part about it, the movie was released in 1979, two years after the first (I guess fourth, technically) Star Wars. Harrison Ford is in both movies, both looks older in Star Wars, released prior, then he does in Apocalypse. That's how long it took to film this movie.What else do I say to say? Watch this movie, see what a classic really is. The fact that it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, or Director, to that silly and forgotten movie 'Kramer v. Kramer' completely blows my mind. I tried watching that movie, I swear I turned it off after about 15 minutes it was that bad. But, then again, I guess time has shown who the real winner is.",10,0,2,15 May 2011
JFK," A Masterpiece that Ages Like Wine
","This is it. JFK. Oliver's Stone masterpiece. Possibly the best work from a filmmaker who already has a track record of greatness. This needs to be mandatory viewing in every high school and extremely mandatory for anyone seeking a career in filmmaking of any department.From the opening montages presenting the back story in a rapid fire manner, JFK doesn't waste a second. And yet, somehow manages to take it's time to play out in an easily understandable, yet highly intelligible fashion. The pacing is benchmark quality for cinema, maybe the best pacing in a movie since Raging Bull.The performances are all finely tuned. It's very hard to believe that only Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category for the film. Kevin Costner turns in what is most likely his best screen performance as a man obsessed with the past, so much so that it is tearing his family apart. Joe Pesci SHOULD have been nominated for best supporting actor with Jones, he's just that electric in the short screen time he has. The late great John Candy turns up for a brief cameo that could of been played off as laughable, but he comes across in a serious way. Movie icons Walter Mathieu and Jack Lemmon were great additions that only help to make the film reach immortal status. And not forgetting Donald Sutherland, 'X,' who provides Jim Garrison (Costner)with a pivotal back story told masterfully. Kevin Bacon shows up to as a male prostitute, a man who has been deep inside the mysterious world due to his nature. The only major female role is Garrison's wife, played by Sissy Spacek, as a woman on the brink of losing due to her husband's constant absence.I don't know any other way of convincing you to see this gem. The black and white photography stands next to Schindler's List and Raging Bull. The script is top of the line quality, as is the cinematography. You may disagree with the history, but if you go in with an open mind, at least you'll have food for thought.",10,1,10,13 June 2011
The Lives of Others," A Human Story
","I'm not going to lie. I knew little about what happened after WWII in Germany. All I knew was that Germany was split in half, the West was made into a democracy, while the East was strictly Communist. And in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, signifying the reconstruction of one unified German state.'The Lives of Others' begins near the end of the conflict, where the East has maintained a very strict gripping on what the people are to read or write (just as China and Russia had.) The opening scene, one of the best intro's to a movie I have seen this decade, tells us of how the Stasi, the secret police of the East Germany, which is referred to in the film as the German Democratic Republic, obtain information about escapees (to the West) not by brutally, but by petty tortures.The opening sets the stage for what to expect throughout the movie, or you would think. Without giving any of it away, this movie never plays out in a formuliac manner. Many could inherently link this movie with 'The Conversation,' the 1974 movie by Francis Ford Coppola, but this movie far surpasses even that one.See for yourself why this movie is in the top 100 (a rare accomplishment for a foreign film.) If you are not moved by the end, check your pulse.",9,0,0,21 May 2011
Schindler's List," Left Me in Tears
","Very little films can do it. That is to leave me in tears, sharing the pain of the characters on screen. I've seen plenty of 'sad movies' and 'tearjerkers' over the years that I have left me emotion hollow. (Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler's List is different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You're not watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you're witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue his peers seem to be lacking: compassion. But, unlike many weaker efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to his factory. Over the story, his character develops more and more feelings for his Jewish subjects. He reaches the point where they aren't Jewish workers, but fellow human beings.In that, Schindler's List is a very human story. A film that every single human being on the face of the planet should sit through, not for entertainment, but to get a first person perspective to the horrors man is capable of committing on each other. Schindler's List is a beautiful film. A miracle film. A film so emotional, down to the very last scene, no matter who you are, you will be pouring tears by the buckets.",10,11,16,13 June 2011
Amadeus," Mozart Lives!
","How awesome is this movie? It's a visual feast for the eyes, a hilarious comedic effort, with the backdrop to one of the most intriguing plots of all time. In that, 'Amadeus' is a very rare film. A film that contains everything that is enjoyable about watching movies, yet is unlike any movie I've ever seen.The plot? Well, the website sums it up as ' The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told in flashback mode by Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.' But the story is as much about Mozart (played by Tom Hulce in a career defining performance) as it is about his jealous counterpart, Salieri (A much deserved Best Actor performance by F. Murray Abraham.) The root of his jealously? Mozart's musical talent, which speaks for itself. Salieri can't come to grips as to how this young man, who acts with immense immaturity, has been gifted this extraordinary talent. It's a story every human being should be able to relate to. I mean, who hasn't been envious one time or another? That's what a great film does, takes a richly exotic scenario and applies real world issues to the plot.See this movie if you haven't, I personally guarantee you will be pleased. I know I was. This film deserved every Oscar it was a given (all 8.)",Null,3,4,25 July 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick Pulls Off The Nearly Impossible
","Often times it's a smart decision read the book prior to watching the film it has been based on. It helps get a further understanding of the characters and their situations or dilemmas. This has to be one of the only films I would advise you to do the opposite.I've seen the movie many, many times. What can I say about it? Well, I don't want to give any of it away, so I'll just tell you that on the exterior of the film, it follows a rather simple storyline. But it's the interior, the part that makes you think (a part, unfortunately, that many films lack,) that makes it a required viewing for every hardcore cinema fan, or even a casual viewer.As I've stated previously, I've viewed this work of art multiple times, but haven't once read the book. I figure, it might help me find an even deeper meaning in the story, why not? Let me tell you, the book, which is written by Anthony Burgess, is one of the toughest reads I've ever had. Not because is was disorganized, inept, or illogical. It wasn't. It's because of how it's written entirely in first person, as it should be, and the bizarre dialect which the narrator speaks in, which is English with Russian and other terms you won't find in any dictionary. If you haven't seen the film before reading the novel, I can't possibly see how you could understand, or merely comprehend, any of it. How Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest filmmakers to ever walk the earth, took this very complex novel made up of what I can only explain as poetic gibberish and make such a clear and focused movie that stands the test of time as one of the greatest moments in film history only leaves me to respect the man even more.(And in no way am I bashing the Burgess novel, which deserves to be in a class of its own based on the original and audacity that author had in crafting a beautiful collage of words and thought.)",10,0,1,15 May 2011
Pulp Fiction," Some people haven't seen this movie? What????
","There's an expression called the 'sophormore slump,' or something to that nature. It deals in terms of an artists/athletes/etc. who's second effort lack's the success of their initial. In movies, many filmmakers go through this exact struggle (Kevin Smith I'm looking at you.) But, like every rule, there are exceptions. And, oh boy, is this one ever.Quentin Tarantino started his film career by penning the script to 'True Romance.' An enjoyable, yet ultimately forgettable work. He followed that up by directing his desk script, shot on a minuscule budget. That film happened to be 'Reservior Dogs,' and the rest is history. Following the success that was 'Dogs.' QT finds himself in a more comfortable position to make his second film (and I'm sure the fact that he made it independently rather than under a big studio helped.) His sophomore effort was 'Pulp Fiction' and it has changed the cinematic experience from the get-go. This little 8 million dollar film blew up to be a 100 million dollar plus investment, becoming a hit not only in the states, but internationally.Why was it such a hit? The movie speaks for itself. Don't believe me? Read anyone else review who delves into trivial details than provide much of the greatness. The acting is great. The directing is great. The writing is some of the best and wittiest dialogue I've ever heard. The movie somehow manages to be hilariously dark and an exercise in bad-assery (if that's even a word.) 'Pulp Fiction' isn't just required viewing for hardcore movie lovers, it's a required film for anyone of the human race. 'Pulp' will never get old, it will always remain timeless and my favorite movie of all time because of that.",Null,0,2,26 July 2011
Thor," Oh.....my.....God!
","Thor was simple thrust out by the studio to make a quick buck and establish the character before the release of The Avengers. And boy, does it really show here! The first half of the movie, set on Planet Asgard, was generally interesting, even if Anthony Hopkins was sleep walking through his performance. The Frost Giants of Jotunheim presented pretty scary villains and if the film had the courage to keep the setting there, with the Frost Giants as the main antagonists, they would of made the film all the better (I know the comic takes place on Earth, but c'mon, we've seen the superhero comes to earth and saves the day a million times! Try something new!)Just like The Green Lantern (which is still much worse), my biggest criticism is that they don't spend enough time in the foreign landscape of Asgard (Oa in GL), and head to dull old planet Earth in no time. The first time this was done (on screen, of course) in 1978's Superman, it was a refreshing take on the fish-out-of-water story. Here it acts like a poorly done comedy, throwing the tone of the whole first act off. There is a few laughs to be had (as when he wanders into a pet shop), but really felt forced for the most part.Then there's the love story. Look, I realize films like these aren't too concentrated on developing character bonds like a (much superior) film such as Before Sunrise would, but at least show us why the two are in love! I, of course, speak of Natalie Portman's character and Thor, and the inevitable attraction that grows between them. First off, and I know other reviewers have stated it before, but Natalie Portman is horribly miscast here. Either that, or she's giving one of the worst paycheck-performances I've seen in some time (there's one line reading in particular near the end that is so excruciating, it might as well of been nails on a chalkboard). But all the 'romance' consists of is Natale Portman giving Thor an awkward, teenage-crush like smile, for maybe a scene or two. In the climatic fight (no spoilers here), Thor takes a fall, and Portman's character rushes over to help him - in which I don't know how she doesn't get killed, but this movie's logic is not exactly present. They have a moment where we get those Natalie Portman tears and her eyebrows scrunch up (as they always do when she cries, in like EVERY single movie she's ever been in.) As the audience, we're suppose to feel an emotion connection to the two that just doesn't exist. They both could of been killed right then and there, the credits roll up, and I wouldn't of felt the least bit unsatisfied. Of course that doesn't happen, as you can surely guess what the outcome is, which only irritated me more.Tom Hiddleston is an up-and-coming actor I have high hopes for. He was great as F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and one of the best parts in War Horse, but here is given nothing to do here in the role of Loki. It's no surprise he'll become the villain, as it's hinted at constantly in the film. But when he does become the main antagonist, his motivations are very askewed. Is he an outright villain? Is he a sympathetic villain? Is he even a villain at all? The film doesn't seem to know how to handle these questions. One scene he'll act one way, the next scene he'll be a completely new person. It'll be like if the Joker from the Dark Knight tries to kill Batman, then a minute later saves his life and buys him a beer. Is character continuity that difficult of a concept? Stellan Skarsgard, one of the most unappreciated actors working today, also isn't given a chance to really make anything of his character. There's an assistant scientist, played by Kate Dennings, who doesn't really add anything to film and is only there for 'comedic' relief (I use the term very loosely.) Chris Hemsworth is a pretty good Thor, he comes off as very arrogant and strong-willed. But when he's asked to handle more dramatic scenes, well, I'll just says he's no Brando.I'm sure this movie isn't directed at me (I usually prefer, you know, movies with a brain and pulse), so I'm sure this will make money and produce needless sequels. But, for my money, I think the material could of been handled a lot better.",1,2,5,1 May 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Never Give Up Hope: A Great Message to Live By
","This wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen before this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each other. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the slightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison movies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end. That's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers, psychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more or less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be thankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not because it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a man falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep to make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to have made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and he's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this character greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more than you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based off a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well directed, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see how some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd be more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are better films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250. So I give it a final score 8/10, I think I'm being fair when I say that.",8,0,0,15 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Satisfying, it not somewhat of a letdown
","Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might Not that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.For the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.7/10",7,29,58,20 July 2012
Trainspotting," 'Choose Life'
","'Trainspotting' is a bold and audacious film by British director Danny Boyle which launched the career of then unknown actor Ewan McGregor. The day-to-day struggle of a group pf heroin addicts in Edinburgh could never be told so stylishly and clever, equipped with both big laughs and horrific images. It doesn't judge it's characters and their addictions, just portrays them as what they are: young people without a clue as to what direction they're heading down in life. There's no good guys and bag guys, it doesn't play out like a PSA, and each character is well developed and multy-dimensional. I couldn't recommend this title more - truly one of my favorites of all time.Absolutely 10/10",10,1,2,11 April 2012
50_50," Overrated, but certainly has it's moments
","Seeing this movie reverted me back to when I saw '(500) Days of Summer,' and not just because Joesph Gordon-Leavitt headlines both. When I went to see 'Days,' my expectations were inflated because of all the buzz I had been hearing, which ultimately left mem a little disappointed when it didn't meet them. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the film, but I didn't fall in love with like everyone else. The same thing happened with this film, I enjoyed it for the most part, but still had my reservations.I'll start with what I liked, mainly, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt. He really puts this film on his back and delivers a great performance. He's funny when he has to me, and believable when he's playing a dramatic role. The more I see him on screen, the more I'm convinced he's blossoming into one of the finest young actors of his generation. Anna Kendrick, who plays the naive therapist, really establishes great chemistry with JGL, and the two play off each other very well. Seth Rogen, while he really does just play Seth Rogen in every film, has his best role I've seen him in, meaning he is only he doses (one can only fathom so much Seth Rogen.) And the story, for the most part, is meaningful and realistic (the screenwriter based it on actual circumstances), never falling into Hollywood clichés and melodrama, which is refreshing.As for my criticisms, I have a few. Too much of the film's humor relied on juvenile jokes. Maybe it has something to do with the film's serious material, but no one ever seems to have a problem with the constant sex-jokes, which grew old fast. Bryce Dallas Howard's character, the 'bad' girlfriend (what else?), didn't seem to move the story further and acted very one-dimensional. Her not being in the movie at all would of been a benefit, allowing more time for the growth between the otherwise interesting characters.But the good outweighs the bad here, and it's an enjoyable, if not somewhat forgettable, little movie worth seeing if you have some free time.7/10",7,0,1,11 April 2012
The Thin Red Line," What is this great evil?
","'The Thin Red Line' is perhaps one of my personal favorite movies of all time. It marks the return of the notorious seclusive writer/director Terrance Malick, who had not completed a film in twenty years prior to this one's release.This is not your typical war drama. It is so much more. It has everything your normal combat movie would cover, excellently shot battle sequences and explores the turmoils of war. You see first hand how the characters slowly begin to lose their grip on reality, as innocence if the first causality of war.Malick handles the story by starting out with two American soldiers who go AWOL, somewhere on a small island filled with natives in the Pacific Ocean. This segment, to me at least, in the greatest sign that life really is beautiful. After the AWOL soldiers are back in the navy's possession, that's when we are introduced to Guadalcanal, a small island with a Japanese airfield.What follows are incredibly scenes of action, some surpassing the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Platoon.' The soldiers question, in great detail, why they are fighting this war (Not politically but philosophically.) The movie is long, sure, but needs to cover a great amount of information.The cast is phenomenal. Nearly every actor with a speaking role, (and a few without,) have become big name actors. The best performances comes from the veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays an aging Colonel. Who he didn't earn himself a Best Supporting Actor nod, or a win, I do not know.",10,2,4,21 May 2011
