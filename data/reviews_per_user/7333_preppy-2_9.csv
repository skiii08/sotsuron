The Blair Witch Project," Scary but stomach-churning
","Yes, this movie is VERY scary.  I don't frighten easily, but this movie bothered me unlike any film since 'Halloween'.  It manages to spook you with no gore, violence or things jumping out at you.  It just uses darkness and other things (I don't want to give anything away).  The acting is realistic and the dialogue sounds realistic (hard to believe it was all improvised). However, there's one HUGE problem with the film.  It's the jerky hand-held camera work.  By the end of the film, I was on the verge of throwing up! Imagine being on a rocking ship for an hour and a half straight...not a pleasant sensation.  The camera work does work for the film, but it's just very difficult to sit through without getting severe stomach cramps.  Well worth seeing (the final sequence can give you nightmares) but see it on an EMPTY stomach!",Null,1,2,16 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as I expected
","First off, I'm not a 'Star Wars' or SF fan (which is why I waited about three weeks before seeing the movie).  Also, I heard the movie was aimed squarely at 12 year olds (I heard this from fans of 'Star Wars'!), and added zero to the story.  So I didn't expect much.  Surprisingly I sort of liked it.  It is too long, some sections left me really confused (Darth Vader is a virgin birth?) and at the end I just felt like I had seen another movie, no better or worse than an average one.  First off, as said before it rambles on and on.  This could haven been cut short by half an hour.  Second, Lucas is not an actors' director--and it shows.  McGregor and Neeson were so stone-faced I couldn't believe it.  Portman was howlingly lousy. Admittedly, they were trying to react to something that wasn't there, but come on!  They're actors--that's their job!  As for Jar Jar Bink--he was annoying and very unfunny.  All of his lines and antics met with stony silence from my audience.  Only the actress who played Darth's mother showed any emotion.  All that said, the special effects were superb with two standout sequences--the pod race and the fight between Obi-Wan, Qui-Jon(sp?) and Darth Maul.  Those two sequences made up for the many shortcomings in the movie.  All in all see it for the special effects.  There's no good acting and the story is yawningly familar.",6,0,1,9 June 1999
The Birth of a Nation," A classic?????
","I recently saw this at Harvard Film Archive with live piano accompanying it. First off, there was a break in the middle (the film IS 3 hours) and I was never bored.  But why is this a classic?  Just because it's a silent movie that shows the Civil War and its aftermath (it won't make you forget 'Gone With the Wind')?  It was (sort of) entertaining, but there was nothing great about the picture.  The acting was horrible.  I realize in silent films actors had to show more emotions on their face, but really--everybody was overdoing it (Gish was the worst by far).  And the racial content was repugnent--when I saw it with a full audience there was a lot of shifting in seats, muttered grumbling and a more than a few bursts of sarcastic snickering and groaning.  You could FEEL the audience getting upset.  I don't care how good people think this film is, the racist content is unbelievable.  It shouldn't be banned, but it should be shown for how disgusting and shocking racism can be.  Also, if there had been just one more scene of the KKK riding along like the calvary to 'save' white people from black, I was going to throw something at the screen.  At the end, I was applauding the piano player NOT the movie.  As it stands, this could have been an entertaining (not great) movie, but the racism makes it impossible to stomach.",8,8,17,22 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Really sick and really funny
","I'm no fan of the TV series 'South Park'.  I've seen a handful of episodes and found them tasteless and stupid.  Still, I decided to see the movie just because everyone I know who saw it, loved it.  Well, I did too!  Yes, it's VERY sick and crude but I could not stop laughing.  This movie tears into everyone and everything.  How it got by with an 'R' rating is beyond me (not that I'm complaining!).  If you're easily offended DO NOT see this movie. However if you have an open mind and like raunchy humor, this movie is for you!",8,0,0,16 August 1999
The Mummy," CGI overkill
","First off, I was never bored with this movie.  There's almost nonstop action and great special effects, but I can't recommend it.  The story is ooooollllllddddd.  Expedition looking for a lost city and find the mummy's tomb---wow, how original.  The dialogue is pathetic; the acting--well, who cares about acting in a summer movie (by the way, it's lousy); and nonstop special effects.  That's the problem.  It's way too special effects heavy. You're constantly being bombarded with reanimated corpses, sand storms, locusts, flesh-eating beetles, etc. etc. etc.  It just wears you down after awhile.  At a few points I just prayed for the effects to stop and have a plot take over.  But then when people DID stop and talk the dialogue was so mindbogglingly awful, I prayed for the special effects!  So, if you don't mind a plot as old as the mummy itself, lousy acting and special effects bombarding you constantly, this is your movie.  Otherwise stay far, far away.",6,0,0,12 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," OK, but no masterpiece
","Kubrick's last film is good, but not great like 'Barry Lyndon' or 'Spartacus'.  However it's not as bad as 'The Shining'.  It's well-directed (of course), looks fantastic (although you can tell the streets of New York are sets), and has a great music score BUT the acting is bad (especially Cruise), the film is at least half-an-hour too long, and there are way too many unanswered questions (how did the masks and orgy start; why do they do it etc etc) and the subject matter seems rather light foir Kubrick. Remember this is a man who dealt with the existence of the whole human ran in '2001'!  All in all, not the disaster critics are saying it is, but no masterpiece either.",6,0,1,26 July 1999
Scream 2," Not as scary as the first one but...
","how could it be?  The first 'Scream' caught everyone by surprise and, let's face it, how can you top that terrifying opening with Drew Barrymore?  Still 'Scream 2' was very funny and it was suspenseful.  Like the first, you have no idea who's doing the killings until the end.  The body count was higher and (it seemed to me) much bloodier.  This is easily the best horror movie sequel ever.  Just one thing to the filmmakers...LAY OFF Sidney on 'Scream 3'!  She's had all her high school AND college friends killed off in the first two movies!",10,0,0,15 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Excellent thriller
","Superb horror/thriller about a little boy who can see dead people and Bruce Willis as a child psychiatrist trying to help him cope with it.  The film is VERY quiet and very dark (it's filmed with everything in shadows or darkness...everything in this film looks dark).  It also manages to scare you without blood or gore.  The film also takes time to establish characters and motivation (how many horror films can you say that about?).  It's a solid hour before the kid confides in Willis, but by then you know (and care) about him.  Then, to top it off, there's an incredible twist at the end that makes you replay the whole film in your mind.  If you like quiet, creepy horror thrillers see this film!  It's 20 times better (and more unsettling) than 'The Blair Witch Project'.",8,0,0,30 August 1999
The Matrix," Good BUT...
","'The Matrix' had an interesting (if far-fetched) story, jaw-dropping special effects and some great action, but it's not that great of a film.  Two reasons for this: the plot...it's too complex and a lot of meaningless details are thrown in and conservations are pointlessly drawn out.  The film could have ended at least 20 minutes sooner.  The second and most severe problem...Keanu Reeves.  This is a real problem considering he's the lead and is supposed to show emotions and feelings.  Instead he's totally blank, and it put me at a distance from him.  So 'The Matrix' is worth seeing for the special effects and interesting plot, but Reeves' lousy performance stops it from being what could have been a great sci-fi movie.",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
