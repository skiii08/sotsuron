Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So it wasn't perfect...
","It was still an absolutely wonderful movie. I think Lucas was faced with the near impossible challenge of making a movie that appealed both to the 12 year olds and the audience that was 12 when they first saw the original.He came pretty damned close to doing it.
