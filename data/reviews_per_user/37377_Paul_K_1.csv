Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where was the fun?
","Star Wars Episodes 3-5 were characterized by action, special effects, a readily understood plot and unique characters. An intentional attempt was made in The Phantom Menace, for questionable reasons, to make these characters robotic and removed. Each line is dead-panned and monotonal. There is little interest created in the interplay among characters. When certain main characters are in danger, become injured, or die, the characters fail to react, and so the audience too is unable to sympathize.Certainly, this movie is a visual feast. But I would have enjoyed it (or as it turns out, not enjoyed it) similarly if the movie was put to a fresh John Williams score and there was a complete absence of dialog or plot.",2,0,1,24 May 1999
