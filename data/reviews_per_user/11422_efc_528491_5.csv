The Avengers," Most Overrated movie ever. Is it bad? No. Is it amazing? No. Is it Decent? yes.
","Okay where do I beginAction: This movie has really good action sequences and its the strongest point in this filmStory: This movie is rated so highly, they made it seem like it had an out of the box story line and something more, but its not. Is the storyline bad? No. Its too simple and doesn't deserve all the praise its getting. I felt I was watching Transformers 3 again at the final battle with the aliens. There is nothing special with the plot at all, there was barely any depth and its forgettable. A mind controlled good guy on the enemy team? How many times have we heard that before? This movie needs something else in the plot that will differentiate it from the othersWriting: Writing was decent but it there were a lot of cheesy lines. Want some nachos with that? I didn't like how the dealt with the death of Agent Coulson just wasn't right and he could have gone out better. There were way too many coincidences. How does Bruce Banner get to where they were with a bike that goes 10 miles per hour? Acting: It was either decent or below. Again with the over praise it is making it seem like the acting is top notch or something and it isn'tOther stuff: I think when they do a sequel they need to improve the story, the plot, the writing, and actually make the score of the movie good and memorable because some people don't realize how important a score can be in movies, it adds a lot to them. This movie should not be in the top 250. To be fair it needs to be a 7.6-7.8 on the IMDb scale. When they do The Avengers 2 its not going to be very hard to top this one if they improve on the things I mentioned",6,7,16,3 September 2012
Batman Begins," The most underrated installment in this trilogy (Minor spoilers)
",Pros 1. Great origin story 2. Batman's voice isn't too much growl 3.Loved the memorable lines that are so true in the real world 4. Loved the villains 5. Great performances 6. Great score 7. I like the Frank Miller-esque mood to it. Hard to explain8. Love the stealthy Batman and him using fear as his weapon against enemiesCons 1. Editing of the action sequences could do a little more polishing 2. Katie Holmes was passable but the weakest linkOverall a great Batman movie to revive Batman after the tragedy of Batman and Robin. I liked the direction they decided to take with this and it worked and Warner Bros. chose the right people to revive this universe. I am kind of happy Batman and Robin was bad because who knows if this movie would still exist if that movie was a success.,9,2,3,20 October 2012
The Dark Knight," A great movie but the weakest out of the 3. Here's why...
","(I am not going to compare TDKR to TDK because it wont be fair since TDKR was after TDK.)PROS:1. Everyone had amazing acting, especially Heath Ledger2. I enjoyed the story 3. The action sequences has improved but I never had a problem with them in Batman Begins 4. Engaging movie and doesn't even feel as long as it wasCONS:1. Gotham city was alright but I before TDKR came out I preferred the Batman Begins Gotham City better.2. What happened with the stealthy Batman in Batman Begins, I felt like he wasn't using fear as his weapon at all. It felt more head on in this one3. Too much growl in Batman's voice, it had the perfect balance in Batman BeginsAnd those three things that bothered me a little but it made up for the story/action/and amazing performances. The score in this movie is great, I enjoyed the score about as much as I did with Batman Begins. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this movie a lot and have a record of seeing this 5 times in the movie theater but that record was beat with TDKR this year seeing it 6 times in the theater.I like the cool action sequences we see in this like the truck flip which I don't think has been done before and I liked that they used actual vehicles in this movie that actually moved. Its hard to say who's a better Rachel because I thought they were both passable for me so Its hard to say who is better. Overall its a great sequel and addition to the series and was a game changer for superhero movies",10,0,3,20 October 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I am surprised
","This was the first movie I really liked in this series since the first one. The 2nd one i didn't like at all, the 3rd one was eh, and the fourth part 1 was okay. Breaking Dawn Part 2 was an improvement from the 2nd,3rd,and 4th Part1 films. The first 30 minutes of BD 2 had some cheesy moments but they sharpened it up for the middle and end portion. I loved the pacing in this film and I like that they got scores from all previous movies as well as the most current ones to kind of go full circle. I think Melissa Rosenberg (sciptwriter) wasn't a good choice for this movie series because some of her writing is cheesy, but she made an improvement as well when all the cheesy moments were only in the beginning portion. I'm disappointed that the movies got better at the last one and that should have started at Eclipse.",6,3,10,22 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," TDKR Review
","Pros:1. Best story out of the three 2. Best tone out of the three 3. Best edited action sequences out of the three 4. Very quotable. Many quotes are so true that applies to the real world 5. Great writing 6. Best score 7. Everyone had great acting 8. This movie is extremely engaging for its running time 9. Loved the ending to this trilogy 10. Best score out of the three. I loved that ghostly sound you hear after the prologue, and u also hear it in the songs 'Necessary Evil' and 'On Thin Ice'. A nice blend with using the new sounds and mixing it in with the traditional sounds from the first two. I love Catwoman's theme and Bane's theme. 11. Loved all the references in this movieCons:1. They can fix the lighting better at the stock exchange scenes. When they showed a sky view of the Stock Exchange they could have made it look more cloudy by color grading it somehow to make it seem cloudy. If they did that it would be fine.Commonly asked question about TDKR I hear from people that annoys me:1) How is Batman on the ice?Response: There is a certain part on the ice where it gets softer. The guards are standing on the ice as well because they aren't walking for enough to get to the soft part. 2) Talia's death was so fakeResponse: I agree it was a little too much but she could have passed out after her body went into shock. Our body's do that as a defense mechanism. I think she passed out because you can live from that or you could die from that, so it can go either way. Your interpretation3) Bane's death was badResponse: Batman had already won that fight against Bane anyway until Talia stabbed him in the back. Now the only way to stop Bane is to kill him and thats not gonna be Batman thats gonna be Catwoman. Catwoman cannot fight Bane physically because she isn't as skilled as him so the batpod shot makes sense4) Where was Batman?Response: This movie was more of Bruce Wayne's story even when it was more focused on Bruce there was enough Batman to suffice and needed. After all they are the same person5)How did Bruce get in Gotham?Response: Bruce has been around the world a lot and knows his ways. He knows how to fly so he could have flew a small helicopter and parachuted in Gotham. If this movie explained it step by step this movie is going to run even longer, infer6) You could have cut Selina's part out of TDKRResponse: No, she kinda brought Bruce back out in the world to remind him there are people out there still to play with. She had very sly humor and wit that eas a nice touch in this movie as a whole. They both found a clean slate. Together. 7) How can Bruce be with Selina after she has done everything to him?Response: Even when he found out she was stealing his stuff you could tell he still liked her personality; that especially shows at the charity ball scene. Also when he says 'There's more to you than that', he sees more in her. You can tell Selina cared about him when she found out Bane was beating him up and when she said 'Come with me--save yourself...'Overall Christopher Nolan was able to withstand the 3rd movie curse and in my opinion, my only favorite 3rd part of any trilogy I have seen.",9,5,12,26 October 2012
