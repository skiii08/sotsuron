Mission: Impossible III," mission slightly difficult
","This movie sucks and the person who has the other review on here has not even seen it. first of all keri russell is not the one tied to the chair most of the movie, its the other actress who plays julia. Second of all julia is not a doctor shes a nurse. Plus the movie was terrible, just another ego inflater from a Hollywood has-been. There was a lot of stuff in the movie that was plain boring, its supposed to be an action movie, so wheres the action, no one who goes to see the movie wants to see ethan hunt making gaga, kissing girls, and saying wedding vows. It had many chances to save itself and never pulled it off, there was an entire action sequence that was left out in favor of at least half an hour of bore. Also the acting was sub par at best, Phil.S.Hoffman can act, but seemed extremely out of place in this movie, while all the other actors spent their time trying to hard to be on his level and be serious, and hence their acting seemed forced and disconnected. It just didn't work, it tried way too hard to be good, and turned out terrible. I wouldn't even recommend this to rent, just horrible. Don't see it. I saw it for free at an advanced screening, thats the only reason I went, it wasn't even worth the time taken to watch it, and don't listen to the reviewer above me, he/shes lying, they haven't even watched it i bet.",3,4,16,3 May 2006
