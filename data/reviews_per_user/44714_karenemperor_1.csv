Conquest 1453," Beautiful fantasy film, but not historical
","At all times, the victor country rewrites history and nothing can be done about it. 7,000-10,000 Byzantines vs 100,000-200,000 ottomans - can this be a heroic victory for ottomans? The film also does not show that in those days Constantinople was already in decline. In 1453, Constantinople was not already a great city, but was only a symbol of the former might of the empire. Basically, this film is designed for the Turks. An educated and literate person will not watch a false historical film. It would be better for the Turks to make a film about how their ancestors - Seljuks, came from Central Asia and occupied the lands of Byzantium, Armenia, Greece and Persia)",1,2,6,23 July 2017
