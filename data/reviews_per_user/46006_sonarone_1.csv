"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Great film, and a very long Nike commercial
","I loved this film, it was funny, had its nice moments, and overall represents the type of comedy which i really like in movies. It could be better, but after all the crap comedies that come out recently it is a shining diamond and without any doubt i will suggest it to all that like a bit more intelligent comedies.But while watching the film i got the feeling, that this film is a huge Nike commercial. Like in the Truman show, the moments in this movie that feature Nike, are just too damn obvious. The Nike London run, all the shoes in the film, and the scene with the engagement ring... i mean come on!",10,2,7,16 March 2008
