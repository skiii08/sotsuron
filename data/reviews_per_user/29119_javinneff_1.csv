Blade Runner 2049," Simply Stunning
","I just got back, and as many others have already stated, the film is simply stunning. Bladerunner played with the notion of life and death brought emotions I rarely, if ever, have received from a film. The way the film showcases the beauty of the human body and our behaviors was fantastic. Changes in score and aggressive tones were perfectly placed and the cinematography was top-notch. For me though, the real masterpiece here was the story. I was engaged the entire time, and at no point felt any part was unnecessary. Ryan Gosling and Villeneuve are a dangerous combo. 5/5! I cannot recommend this movie enough. I wish I could go back and see it for the first time again, it was that good.",10,7,17,5 October 2017
