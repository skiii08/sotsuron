The Ring," Scariest Movie I've seen in the past 5 years. 9/10
","I saw The Ring on the second day it came out, way back in October, and It was the scariest movie I've ever seen (other than the exorcist, but it's not scary, its nasty) in a while and I would recommend anyone that hasn't seen this movie, to watch it.Don't listen to those who hate it 'cause they don't know what they're talking about! If you really enjoy being frightened, then this is the movie for you. I give The Ring 10/10",10,1,1,12 June 2003
Jurassic Park," This movie kicks @$$!! 9/10
","The first time I saw this movie, I was eight and LOVED dinosaurs so this, obviously, was my favorite movie of all time. I've seent his movie 9 times and this is one of the greatest Speilberg classics of all time and to anyone who hasn't seen it, GO SEE IT!",8,1,3,12 June 2003
