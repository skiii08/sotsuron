The Ring," Naomi, Watts have you done? (Spoiler Alert!)
","Oh, Naomi....I fell in love with you in Mullholland Drive, saw it eight times in the theater. I desperately try to find your backlist. (most of which is Australian and not available in the USA) I sit and patiently wait a year for your next movie. AND THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN DO??!! For shame!The Ring is not a 'bad' movie and Naomi doesn't give a 'bad' performance but once you've seen Mullholland it's very hard to settle for anything less. Naomi is giving a 'workman's' effort here, not the jaw-dropping, shoulda-been-Oscar-winning performance from MHD. For all you who don't like horror films (of which I am one, I saw this only for Naomi) don't worry; the movie is NOT scary. Really. A coupla shock-cuts give you a start (such as the brief shot of the first Ring-victim's face)but that's it.The Ring is the latest in a salvo of 'where does media end and reality begin' movies we've been shown in recent years. There are some good interpretations here at IMDB that help you understand the movie, but I was still disappointed. Does Aidan become Samara at the end? Why would the appearance of Rachel freak out a horse into committing suicide? Aidan I could understand, but not Rachel. What's the reasoning for 'doomed' people getting nosebleeds? Samara's method of spreading her word seems more like some evil chain-letter scheme. I think we're being set up for The Ring 2:The Wrath of AidanPlease Naomi, don't let me down. I hope The Kelly Gang, Le Divorce, and Plots With A View are much better than The Ring.Thanks.Eric",5,0,0,20 October 2002
