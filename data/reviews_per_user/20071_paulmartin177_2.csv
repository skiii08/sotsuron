Come and See," I saw a film today , oh boy...
","I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about a film before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it's going to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As a result, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly here on the IMDb. (Imagine my 'excitement' when, having tried to see the film for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterday and... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity and unflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See' invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what a clever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like, say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which, though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov's film), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneself to. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked, wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions that have been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulled from beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, my head hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seen before but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had not experienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role of cinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what to think but to simply show us particular events and characters and allow us to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'm rambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is, with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of a visionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an important reminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see...",10,166,197,12 May 2006
Being John Malkovich," Malkovich? Malkovich! MALKOVICH? MALKOVICH!
","This is a wonderful and truly strange film, and perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it got made at all given today's Hollywood film system. The story concerns an unhappily-married, unsuccessful puppeteer (played by John Cusack), who discovers a hole behind a filing cabinet in an office block which leads 'into' the (actual, real-life) American actor John Malkovich. Those who go down this hole are then transported into Malkovich's identity and/or brain (it's difficult to explain it exactly unless one has seen the film!) for a few minutes, and then dropped out onto a nearby highway! You'd think that this would be enough to guarantee a film of tremendous originality, but there is so much more weirdness and imagination in this film that one's interest is sustained throughout. For example, the floor of the office in which this hole is discovered was deliberately built for midgets, so that anybody of normal height has to bend over to avoid hitting their head on the ceiling! The reason for this is 'explained' to the puppeteer (who lands a filing job there) in a short film for new recruits, although we (and they) are none the wiser after seeing it. Eventually Malkovich himself ends up going down the hole, resulting in one of the most bizarre and disturbing (and funny) moments I have seen in a film. What he encounters is a world (or at least a restaurant) populated entirely by John Malkovichs: men, women, babies...! This could so easily have been a completely pretentious and confusing shambles of a film, but the director (the brilliant Spike Jonze) handles things with such focus and style that one is eased comfortably into the semi-fictional universe presented. I think what make the film work is that it manages to be both surreal and very ordinary at the same time: some of the lead characters are deliberately rather shabby and dull in their appearance (Cameron Diaz in particular), and the scenes in which we the audience see the point-of-view of whoever is inhabiting Malkovich are very mundane (and strangely touching, I found), such as washing up, ordering crockery over the phone or eating toast. The whole visual style of the film is very drab and slightly under-lit, which serves to emphasise the far more bizarre aspects of the actual story. Credit must also go to Charlie Kauffman, who wrote the screenplay. Wonderful stuff.",8,1,2,18 May 2006
