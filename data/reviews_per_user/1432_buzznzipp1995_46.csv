United 93," The Second Most Powerful True Story For Me
","It's tough for me to think about this story, because it is very bitter-sweet, on the one hand, you have American's fighting terrorists, and on the other you have the terrorists who already took over the plane, with the ability to crash it in mere seconds...I went in with my wife and my 5-month old baby boy and sat and watched the unfolding of the lives of those who really did make a difference. They were real heroes. Not movie actor action hero, with special effects and as many chances to get their lines right as they needed. No stunt men, to do the job for them, Americans, no matter what color, or nationality, together, United. Don't forget 1993. The blind sheik 'Rochmon' set off the bomb that blasted the inside the Trade-Center. Not totally successful, however it should have been enough to set us on the prowl then. Afterall, that was on U.S. soil. In my opinion, we dropped the ball, big-time, when it came to a realistic follow-up investigation with a search of any and all connected to this blind and who ever was thinking like-minded with him as well. The reason that we get attacked, is that we don't properly show the 'animalistic' terrorist community, that we will not be used as toilet paper for their anti-American beliefs. This has been the second most powerful movie for me of all the true stories, that I have ever seen. It is hard to go through it again, although I love this film and the stripped down selfless acts that these people were committed to finishing, in the light and coming darkness of their own situation.This is what I believe America and real Americans are all about. Standing up for each other, in desperate times. Seeing it through to the end. However that end may be, in it's finality. That say's everything. These weren't men sitting in some dimly lit Little bar telling how they beat down a bunch other men in a bar fight or bragging about something from the glory days, this was men and women, that looked grim death in the face. And had no other choice according to themselves, but to fight....to the death. This was the code that they had and or found in mere moments. 'Let's Roll' the man said. That was his life's Tag-line. His motto. That was real. They had the look of fear in their eyes and most likely terror in their hearts, yet they sent a number of terrorists, (that were trained to kill Americans) straight to terrorist Hell!! I wept at the end, when the plane was, upside-down heading for the ground.Heart-wrenching to think this, is the reward for standing up for their country, and yet that is just like the soldiers! Doing this, for someone else. The ultimate act of Patriotism! A sobering Bravery. Heros, none can effectively argue it with me. I was yelling at the screen, at the terrorists, toward the end, like I have never done at a movie screening, ever!!!I say, thank you to the hero's that gave their lives for others and if you got a problem still, get face to face with GOD.Whew! What an experience I was drained and my voice was 'horse' at the end.I applaud Mr. Greengrass in the research and work that he conducted, to commit himself to bringing this chain of events to the forefront of our hearts and minds. I wanted to know the other story about that flight that just never seemed to get a decent news covering. I say thank you to Paul for putting this into a place that we can see and realize that sacrifice that was made. To see the tragedy of this senseless act by those looking to kill Americans, without regard to our God or us. I cannot get this out of my head the heroism that these men and women showed, in the time that we needed heroes most!! This was an incredibly moving and terrifying film...I highly recommend. God Bless America. America, Bless God (*******)",10,2,6,26 November 2006
Training Day," First day on a new job, can be stressful...
","Denzel is a real chameleon. This is a sinister and likable personality...all because of him. Enter Ethan Hawke's character, officer Jake Hoyt. With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game. The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore. Denzel Washington, should be applauded for the part that he became ' wholly ' involved in. Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk! Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, 'Just wanting to do the right thing' type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)",9,59,88,24 January 2007
Meet the Parents," My former in-laws-oye
","This has to be the most uncomfortably hilarious comedy I have seen or I should say felt involved with in years. The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). A father-in-law to be is not just an overly literal and abundantly-overbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord, and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer micro-scope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him, or about him. This reminded me of my past in-laws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips, 'looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy.' Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower, he jokes and sez, 'Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy.' And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me, movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story, this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiancée's out there.This was a one of a kind fun-filled slightly bend out of shape picture with an original feel, that makes it not equal to all the other cinema fare out there that 'comes and goes' with little staying power.Jay Roach is a cool and talented director. Keep up the great work. Recommended (****) See it with a buddy.",10,6,8,8 July 2009
The Big Lebowski," Hey! Easy does it! There's a beverage present here, man.
","The funniest part of this, 'down and outers' comedy is, that I know several guys, that if you took and rolled them into one, they would equal the Dude, Jeffrey LeBowski. that's pretty scary. I don't even think that they have seen the movie, but who cares? Jeff Bridges is so stinking versatile I can't believe it from a reel-live slacker extraordinare to (The Big LeBowski 1998) a reel-President- (The Contender 2000) with out skipping a beat. For all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time, but this was a side splitting whimsical good time!! From Julliane Moore as the egocentric, emotionally-sterile 'Maude' who was a suspicious investigator, to the best friend (Goodman) who's religious nationality 'changes' because of his 'Ex' who dumped him cold. But as long as he can 'bowl' with the Dude, all his other short-comings, just seem to go by the way-side. But through it all, he (Goodman's character) was a loyal buddy to Jeff and a decent friend, even if he could acquire 'fingers' by 3:00...with nail polish. In all fairness though, LeBowski as a 'private' investigator, reminds me of a quote from 'Dirty Harry' where Harry states (after the 'demise' of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed) 'A man should know his own limitations.' and in this case, having Jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the 'fox' guard that Ole' hen house. This was a 'slackers delight' and watching someone who is as good a player as 'Bridges' play a tremendously convincing 'Loser' is just a rare treat. In the comedy section, this one is an ever so often player. Just one that you 'havfta see' every now and again. I don't know who he studied, but if I didn't know better I would swear that he got together with my two 'old school' buds. (****)",9,4,6,28 July 2006
Unbreakable," Unstoppable, unbeatable...
","Sometimes slow moving and darkly entrenched, but here is a driven film, by a talented director and writer, with a pair of aces' . I wasn't familiar with the comic book premise that the film was built on and I wasn't really a major comic fan, however I was enthralled by this one. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are together in a not so nice role between the two. Willis' character is a slow moving, but constant and committed man. Almost passionless in his marriage, he is only living, (seemingly) for his son and his job. Samuel L Jackson's character is a wheel chair bound man that seems a bit vengeful at circumstances and the hand he has been dealt in life and (feeling 'owed') by the world around him.The journey starts and gains momentum as Bruce's security man starts to see and feel strange occurrences. Building up and up he starts to sense not everything inside him is what it seems to be. The performances by all were just as they should have been and the story is rounded out nice with a fantastic twist at the end, bringing it to an open ended close. there could be another installment to this darkly defined story, but it should be done right, or not at all.

Memento," No Statis-Quo...
","Here's an immediate classic, in the mystery/Thriller/Drama category!!! This one grabs your attention and proceeds to take you through a mesmerizing plotted-situation backwards. No doubt about this one, this is not your typical studio, big budget summer film. Guy Pierce, simply as 'Leonard' is on the trail of a killer, or is he? Maybe, what's today? Why am I here? Who is calling on the phone? There's a note by the phone that says don't answer it. But what if the caller knows, who the killer is. What if they hold a 'clue' that I need? All this and a story that grips and goes in 'Reverse'. The characters and simple, in this little tale of short-term memory loss. Yes...simply deeper and deceptive. In a word, if you have seen this one, before...see it again, to reconfigure in your mind 'whodunnit!?'The cast is all a cast of professionals, who are real killers! Joe Pantolliano (Running scared, The Matrix, (HBO's) Sopranos) shows a somewhat differing side to his acting personality as Leonard's (suppossed) friend Teddy. He and Teddy have an adventure that they are on, called find a murderer. In between, the drama that every other one in the mix is bringing on as well, just to kind of confuse the whole issue. Everyone is helping? Everyone, is in it...for themselves? This thriller will keep the best guessing, it is a solid heart pounder, of a good show. I recommend this highly if you love to keep guessing and love the mesmerizing tale that will end? (*****)",10,2,4,16 January 2007
The English Patient," 'Enthralling'...
","I won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. The awards say it all. I don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn't agree more.9-Oscars. 41-wins.37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, 'Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off of it!' In this instance, I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in 'Sabrina' Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again.

The Fifth Element," Far Beyond...
","This is both kind of out there for Bruce and yet...right up his alley. Luc Besson, I remember meeting his cousin, in 2004 I think I like Luc better, anyway this movie that from what I had received from critics for the most part seemed as I recall hating this roundly. I can't understand it. Willis as Corben Dallas is a solid chunk of man style action unlikely hero who's style as one woman I know put it is 'Sexy'. Well for all intensive purposes, I don't judge his looks like that, but I was far-out too into this space-case that Dallas was on. He is surrounded by humorous aliens and humans then pursuing the drama that he does so well. Gary Oldman is a twisted and wild criminal character, he always does a job exceeding my expectations. As a fellow viewer stated the score of the film went from Enigma to Vangelis and a myriad of other types of music followed, truly wide in it's audio path. The plot, learn not to war, a little too Alan Alda for me, I never could take too much M*A*S*H, viewing in long shut me down. However all aside, I thought the casting was right where it should be and with exception of some of the aliens being a little too 'plastic' for a feel of reality, I find this is fun and entertaining every time I watch it...Chris Tucker always kills me, he is one of a kind.For sure in the end recommended to action lovers and Willis and Tucker types everywhere.

The Terminator," The Beginning of the end. The Terminator
","Here is the real thing. This is the reason I went to see a sci-fi movie when I usually don't...The Terminator starring a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was mean and he was huge. He seamed unstoppable!! He was frightening, at very least. As I watched a low-budgeted extravaganza film, I had an altogether different emotional connection with a movie by the ending credits. The feeling of actually being in this, while I sat in a dark theater. The pounding score set the feel of the story. I swear my heart was in my throat. Horror and terror films should take note as to the effect that the Terminator had on my central nervous system. No 'pretty people' like newer movies and Television, just a concrete in your scared-face, movie event of the summer type of deal. That doesn't come from teenagers and early twenties with perfect hair and designer wardrobes, and the new MTV song-score of the most popular group or individual. I saw the terminator coming and destroying almost everything in his path. He did not feel pain, or remorse and he was 'Programmed' for just one thing ...kill john Connor. Sending a much smaller, even though he was strong, soldier back through time to protect Sarah, was interesting too. Michael Beihn, the military man that volunteered for the job was a cool and kind of guy, with a sort of numbness in his mode of operation. He was trained,smarter and faster, and still, he seemed like he was nothing for this mighty emotionless, murdering cyborg, that had a mission to bring down the entire human race.I was astounded, in high school when I first saw this film. I was very impressed as to the quality in a story from a low budgeted film. The special effects man Stan Winston was part of the saving grace of this feature. By him the story really became more three dimensional by his expert eye and ability to make real that which is not. I believe that low budget miracle films are amazing to the whole spectrum of the entertainment world. It's that freedom that allows the film makers to get something off-of-the-ground that might be stalled out in a big production studio, otherwise. So I say three cheers for the very mechanical and powerfully mastered Terminator. James Cameron has done a magnificent work with this sci-fi wild ride, that ends with many thoughts and emotions. (****) A MOVIE SIDE NOTE: The original choice for this movie to play the terminator was Not Arnold...it was set to be 'Shot' with O.J. Simpson, he was gonna take a 'stab' at Action -drama film, but that changed before production.",Null,2,3,27 June 2009
Predator," The jungle....it just came alive
","When a crew of specialists is called in to trouble-shoot a problem and fix it, nothing could prepare them for what would follow. For me this is a hard-hitting solid, cold calculated role for Schwarzennegger. Not over thrown by one liners, not lame special- effects, over dramatization of the story, just a master work, done by John McTiernan, the same director that made Bruce Willis a house hold action character name. This was astounding!! The story as it starts, when they land and go into action, taking some guerrilla fighters out. Guerilla forces that have captured some American soldiers and are killing them, attempting to take over that area and occupy the territory. As Dutch (Schwarzennegger) leads his team in with cutting skill, they find surround and move in and take out a large number of fighters that have A few American soldiers with them. Then, after they have put it together and wrapped it up, they realize something is not right. There is unfinished business. They move out again after a soldier holding a woman is brutally killed, with no explanation, and the woman has seen the attack and is not making any verbal sense of any of it. This is where the terror is just starting in!So with the native Indian guide, a 'Tracker' (Sonny Landham) who's skills are honed and highly in demand for this type of work. Leading the crew of 'Specialists' including Jesse 'The Body' Venture, and Bill 'The Killer' Duke -(from many different roles)into a mission that is not what it was 'sold' to them originally. Carl Weathers, who was not so straight with them, ends up as sort of a sacrificial lamb anyway. Very well-fit considering, he was part of the original 'information' problem.The team, finds their objective and neutralizes the problem, only to find, that there is something else waiting in the wings...for them. Hunting, the expert hunters, as if it's nothing, at all. The film, is haunting, in the daylight. But when the night comes, nothing is as it seems, for this band of military brothers...Shane Black, who wrote and co-starred in this picture was right on it, all the way. This film, grips you, and pulls you into a terrifying situation, that keeps you guessing, unsure of the outcome! I rate this a ten for ten, because it rocks you and rolls all the way through. Riveting, I recommend it highly for Arnold fans or even if you don't like him, so what this one delivers it all.(****)",10,5,6,12 December 2006
The Bourne Identity," A smash hit! No Identity crisis.
","'If you keep pursuing me, I will bring this fight to your door!!' I remember that line from the character Jason Bourne, like it was yesterday. This was a tense and taught thriller, with a solid connecting hit!! Wow! From the professional music score that rivets you into your seat and then the clash of action that comes down around you from gun fire to self-defensive technique, that is exacting and bone breaking! Jason, is a trained professional, in everything he does. He is skilled in re-con, he is a tactician, he is a warrior that is trained and molded to win. To make good, wherever he is, and whatever the assignment may be. Until the little child that he saw on the yacht, that one night that he was sent to take out Wombosic he screwed up, and it nearly cost him his life! Now, with Marie traveling with him, things are about to change...again.But now it's changed and he is on the move with a team tracking his moves. Lead by Ward Abbott( Brian Cox) he is starting to feel someone on his path, just behind him, yet he is able to maneuver out of the way, and give himself enough time to set-up camp and wait for their arrival. The best example, being, 'The Professor' he took, him down in the wide open space of a field, with a lot of cover grass. Then, that chase scene, with Jason driving into oncoming traffic, was edgy and a perfect get away! It's his war and he will bring it all out, to them. Matt Damon is on it, all the way.I recommend for people who love a fantastic and enthralling action plot in a film, with a superb cast. (*****)",10,3,4,29 January 2007
The Color of Money," 'Fast' Eddie chalks it up to experience-Newman is gold
","From the first part, this counterpart actually grips me more and takes me to a better understanding than the proceeding. I am not a Tom Cruise Fan, and I guess Paul did make it a lot better than a 'Tom movie', thank God. But This aging 'dinosaur', who is making a comeback on the pool-circuit has a new hotshot, in the picture, (that being Tom of course) that is great, but green as anything. Being and acting on the mind that he (Fellson) has...he pursues an idea to take and mentor this 'grandstander' who already has a lot of talent. If he can teach him. The jury isn't out yet on that one though. But I was in awe of this movie even before I took an interest in writing. The images of Newman, are so powerful to me, taking a hold of my mind with an encapsulating effectiveness. As I took new interest in a story that would have otherwise board me, I saw a man attempting to hold onto his own life in the process. He, a business man and a hustler, a sensitive lover and still a player, but faithful to all, how rare. There was this since of him being strong and a fighter and yet at a moment in weakness, but also reflective wiseness, that came through. He was attempting to not lose his handle on a large piece of his life. A passion, and a honed Career-hobby all in one. He loved his work, and struggled to reach a young upstart, named Vincent a rousing hot-head, with a propensity for blowing it, because of needed ego-strokes. A hard head with ability, but in need of mentoring to save him from himself. 'The Color of money' for me is a man trying not to lose himself in a vastly enveloping world. He is trying to stay alive. He's attempting to keep his life 'in play'. So that he doesn't die a career and identity 'self esteem' death on the side. The 'Color of Money' is a seminal work. It's brilliant and pleasing with a sense of accomplishment. If you haven't seen this one, find the DVD. I rate it a 10 for excellence.(****)",10,7,9,24 July 2006
Armageddon," Not Quite The End of The World...
","I'll be the first to tell you, special FX are not what I look for when I am hitting the movies, I love intelligence and acting, story, story, story, good directing at least. But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch! Recommended for action/adventure sci-fi junkies as well as regular Joe's' like me. (****)",8,64,100,25 October 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Refuse to lose ...
","Olive is a little cutie, who wants to be a beauty queen.Mr. Hoover is quite a guy, a motivational speaker wannabe, if you know what I mean. A phone call, a contest entered and a small contest contender. An irritated grandfather, with a knack for theatrics, coaching the little beauty princess. A road-trip ensues, a motel stay a dead grandpa his body lays, packed in the Volkswagen, a colorblind kid who can't fly a fighter jet!! Plenty of expletives that start with an 'F'. A freeway turn off, that makes them cut corners to bring Olive to the contest headquarters. Late by four minutes, but a nice data entry and sound man, who is wholly kinder than the so called lady , with no heart for 'them' . A contest of plastic dolls, that for the soul only robs and mauls, but then a discussion between the uncle and the son, that opens new lines of communication. A final contest a personal conquest a family uniting after all the walls with that writing, a small little winner who turns out not to be a 'quitter' and a family who joins her in it all. Strange and interesting, and heartwarming too, see it for yourself. (***)",7,3,4,28 January 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T-2 The Return of Cyborg model # 1 0 1
","This as I remember back in 91' as I watched the first few minutes of the movie take flight, was a vastly different feeling from the original.In 1984 when I sat through the first Terminator, it seems now in retrospect, a lower budget movie, however a 'gigantic' story feel. It was brand new and it was different than other sci-fi stuff that was out then. I was gripped by the feeling of an almost unstoppable machine. Schwarzennegger had captured the very element of a futuristic killer that was bigger than life. And scarier than HELL. It was an emotional thriller, with bigger than dollars outcome on how you felt when you left the theater after the ending was over. Now it seems to be traded for an over M-TV commercialized slicker packaged new Terminator. This one now is not un-conversational. He can look sideways at you and learn a joke or two. As I watched the new one I enjoyed it but realized later that, this was more like a 'drug' that would fade, than the preamble that left you squirming in your seat and thought provoked by the end.This was a new-digitally mastered machine that was not going to kill, just act as a body guard for John. Understandably. I can see the point in it and the logic behind that concept for this story. It just was not as bold and fresh as the first. It was quite a thrill-rush...but just seemed to dissolve for me after a while. I liked T-2, truly. This just is though for me not as strong and pure as the first bum-rush the conscious feeling as you watch it, best casted futuristic story, made even better by Stan 'The Wizard' Winston. I had fun with a new friend of mine that I saw this with, but in the end I didn't end up wanting to have or know more. It just thinned out for me too much.(**)",6,6,10,27 June 2009
Heartbreak Ridge," My way, or the 'Highway'... Tom
","This is a beautifully made, good old buddies in the service of our country styled story. A military movie based on a true short story, of the conflict, a 'Hostage' crisis in the faulklen Islands, directed by the man himself, Clint Eastwood. I remember, thinking, Eastwood's voice is at ground-zero, gravely and harsh, but it sure fits the hell into this character Gunnery Sgt. Thomas ' Gunny ' Highway. I watched in amazement, Clint is a dinosaur in this mean-as-nails-Marine film of hard driving male soldiers, who live on the edge. They fight for their country, beer, women, sports and of course the right to play, rock & roll. As the over the top. 'Stitch Jones' (Mario Van Peebles) and his guitar, is a cross between a rock-star and a used car salesman. It was just one of those poetic justice moments for me, when Tom Highway runs into Stitch after being left behind on the gray hound Then there's Aponte, a screwball and Profile, a slacker with a desire to take it easy. Lance Corporal Fragatti, a wise-guy with an attitude of wanting to do the army his way, then Quinones, a friend of all the above, and maybe the biggest of the instigators! The irreverent Everett McGill, as the adversary to Tom Highway, Major Malcolm A Powers, a regimented 'pain in the ass'. Thats right, a regular government mule, standing in the way of the working man's hero Highway. All together through, rain, mud hot 'LZ's' jungle fire fights , hostile terrorists and foreign lands to conquer, in the desert heat, no problem....it's Aggie, that Tom cannot make surrender to him. With, the Swede coming after him and the ever serious (Moses Gunn, as) Staff sergeant Webster they all will have to bend their 'Will' to the Highway. He is a solid old war-horse that keeps on going till it's all done doing.The action was fun, the cast of wild-dogs and misfits is a perfect fit and this is another very well crafted Clint-flick, that works for me any day. Recommended for those who enjoy Eastwood or not. (*****) 10/10Ten-hut, IMDb.com...dis-missed.",10,9,15,15 February 2007
Face_Off," Mis-fire >>> Face Off! Showin' your ...
","For a moment, picture yourself going to a movie, to relax and feeling good and just escape. Now you get through the double doors after getting your tickets and you sit down. You see fifty-seven movie pre-views before your movie starts, then the movie 'Face off' starts to play. You're happy and getting comfortable. Now, if you have seen this feature, you need to be completely honest. Even when you wanted escapism, say pure escapism, this Travolta Cage and WOo picture starts to pick up speed, way too fast and far, far too unbelievably. I know there are people who will disagree, I could really care less. There are too many movies out there that can fit the bill without pretty much slapping you in the face. This was not like a cold water rushing thrill ride as much as it is a full on frontal assault on your sense of creative intelligence. Face-Off is go, go, go but no, no show! I mean with a great cast, a poorly written action-drama, that falls flat. It made a good amount of money in the theaters no doubt about that. But then look at the voting public at large, look at some of the presidents 'voted' in by the public and think 'Okay, well just because there is a lot of money in something or with someone, it doesn't mean that it's good, or right. Alright, take for example, so many John WoO movies feature the ballet dance numbers for that wondrous 'flowing' effect. In large part in many of his features that has played out well...in this case it just got played, 'Off'. Honestly now, Olivia Newton John? In the middle of a 100-200 round per minute fire fight?? This isn't escape anymore it might as well be Barney the purple dinosaur, in action. There could be so many other tracks that they could have scored to this intense section of the movie, but they decided that Ms. John was the one. The truth is, I love Olivia, I always have. In this case for me and many others it was just wrong. The rest of this was a parade of mindless, ballet flowing dance move poorly scripted over commercialized crap, in a cinema setting. The camera shots were over done as well as the acting and thus the believability was swapped out for a heavy on image and nodda on intelligent film making. Although I have to ad that the color and camera lens filters were outstanding!! Outstanding. No lying there.And with all of WoO's talents he couldn't have set this up and executed the story without literally executing this story? The concept is interesting, it has a heart beat, and that makes that escapism is the story line, but how it was done lacked, and lacked big time. I wish I could have helped rewrite and direct this film. Oh well. (*)Not recommended for the real discriminating action film buff.",1,3,5,5 July 2009
Collateral," Tinged, Riveting, Cruise, transcends from boy actor to 'Mann'.
","I didn't rate this a ten, but that doesn't mean that I felt that this was inadequate. Michael Mann has an uncanny ability to show and tell a story, whether in speech or a quiet very composed shot, he most definitely has a gift at bringing out the interesting in his set-up style.His craft is completed it seems once he has taken you to the edge of the tale, sometimes over it...and sometimes back. Tom Cruise, has his ability, wrapped up in his own form, in other words Tom always seems to be Tom. No matter if he has a different accent or speaks plainly, Cruise is who he is. The 'Gifted' part that I see Mann perform again and again is, his ability to change and actor's regular style. He usually directs them into the character he is written them for. For example take the alleyway, where the two young street boys are looking for an easy target as they rob, Max (The cab driver) and take Vincent's briefcase too. Vincent confronts them in deafening action when threatened by them. It is a flash of deadly force! It jars your mind. Fast and final. Even down to the way the cops communicate with each other and the Feds, it looks and feels real, it's authentic.. Nothing short of amazing. I loved Bruce McGill's Federal agent character, calm collected and in-charge. Lending a good slice of style to Collateral.Though, I disagree with the ending and the office scene, from the street where you could see into the building and propel the movie's storyline on further by sight, is immaterial. I do however, think that by not seeing where Vincent was during that time at the office of the attorney, it would have brought a different element of chaos and a better serving of panicked anxiety. Sometimes the most powerful suspense you can give is by having loose ends, not seeing whats there until you're right in front of it. But, the way it was shot and the expanded audio feel that Mann gives us with the 'film-grain' is a delicious exercise for the senses.The feeling of paddling along in murky deep water, trying to quickly escape an impending disaster is what I felt in this visually pleasing story of cat and mouse. Tom, for a couple hours, with Michael's help was in fact Vincent, the killer. Wow, Mann loves to do the turn-around, and seems to always do it victoriously. Bravo Mr.Mann you did it again.I love the way, this hits you when you are watching it intently, with nothing else happening on a superior audio visual system.(***)",9,3,4,11 September 2006
Ocean's Eleven," No small riptide... Ocean's stands tall.
","After the (2001) Ocean's Eleven re-make they should have left it alone. Lightning struck, but not twice unfortunately. Having a second time around where they get 'caught' by Garcia's character is slightly more than just a little embarrassing. Get my meaning from the spelling there?! It made them look like a bunch of 'Wussies'. That is how silly this new Ocean's twelve is. The biggest thing for me about this is that I like these players. They all brought a ton of talent and pulled this thing 'off' with incredible style and ease. With the first remake, not only were the camera-film shots very pleasing and artistic in set up, but also complete in story view/telling. The lines felt as if they were straight out of 'the book of cool' from the sixties, only with a current 'pop' to them. Pitt was perfect. Always sporting a good appetizer platter with him and a well-delivered line not too much, not too little, just right. Along with Clooney and the rest, just fell solidly into place. Epic, right down to the soundtrack that blended into the foreground and back drop, bounced and moved along in and out with a silky-groove-dream sequence sensibility. The score (music) was the additional character that should have made that one 'Ocean's twelve'.The story I thought had graduated into current times and left the sixties version at a deficit. The interaction between the players from the two Utah brothers,(Caan and Affleck) who were more like elementary school kids than skilled heist men, that was obviously part of the fun! To the blackjack dealer with attitude (Bernie Mac-man) Clooney's Danny Ocean was one of the funnest characters he has had along with other good supporting guys (Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner) they all were top drawer in this hip-heist film. It was an 'edgy' story that made it out alive...Then they had to make a sequel. How many sequels truly make it. Probably less then more. Anything to make money right? Naw, couldn't be, 'We're having a lot fun!' They said. Well good deal for them, but in the mean-time write something else good, and or original. But for me this is a library addition keeper of a good time. Ocean's is tops. (****)",10,2,3,24 July 2006
Quantum of Solace," Bond in Solace
","It's lithium -like on screen appearance, I was caught up and deeply involved, there was a sort of flashing, that catches your senses, James profile and you are trying to make it all out as fast as it is happening! This almost leaving you behind in the first moments.A nameless, unknown and very important man in an interrogatory situation who exclaims in an eerie undertone 'We've got people everywhere..' And just then, one of the new world order members, the man's allie, pulls his pistol rapid fires it and kills one of MI-6. A flurry of action explodes as the criminal elements tail James sweeping through the road in and out of traffic and ultimately ripping the door off Bond's beautiful Astin-lovely-Martin! So sad I almost cried! That's no way to treat a car of that stature. Then pulling onto a rock filled side road connecting them to a Corry, James getting hammered by gunfire, finally (driving solo) takes hold of his weapon and fires back!!! Then onto two big doors opening he is able to head down that little pathway to a spot and parks. I won't tell you what happens next, I want you to be able to watch this and enjoy it. Not everyone will, but there is enough 'shock-value' for the want-on oo7 fan. James Bond no more. What you're seeing when you watch this is a splendid and necessary departure, from the predecessors of the past. Withstanding, only recently Casino Royale (2006). A box office blast, that started a new and more grown up Bond. Scaithing and gritty. A harder hitting and more real effecting Bond than has been previously seen. Brosnan, whom I have loved from the on-set has been more 'hit and miss' for me. Goldeneye (1995) was with mass appeal for me and millions of 'Bondies', made me glad Bond was back. By the end however, with 2002's Die Another Day, that episode of Bond was less then stellar in performance and by all standards I hate to admit, I was both sorry that Brosnan had left and happy that a significant change could take course...bring the New era of James Bond.I enjoyed his Frenchman buddy that always acts with his very own flavor and seasoned style. I was not happy for the last situation he ended up with. Quantum is 'manic' speed in part and massive in style and beauty of surrounding scenery. It's powerful with shock...no slick one- liners. Instead just iron gripping strength brought out by Daniel Craig's Spy hero-007. The out dated double o, as an irratant to Judy Dench's M. But Cromagnun has never been soo good, aye Miss Judi? After breaking a killer, almost in half in Haiti's Port A Prince, I was stunned , amazed at how real it felt. Simple and yet brilliant directing for me. Honest and definitely hard (smash-cut) calculated blows, I could feel the pain of every 'hit'. Even with the locking the dead bad guy in the bathroom at the party, Bond takes the handle (snaps it) off of the door and does with such calculated brute force, that it just makes you laugh because of his control. The end sequence is very serene and for me satisfied, the story ending, bringing it all - in-all. It was like a snowy cold Christmas send off without the fan-fare, just muffled and quiet, bringing it to the end. Whew! All that, and I am hungry for more, yet satisfied in the mean time. Wondering, will Craig be back or...who would be next???I was thoroughly impressed with 'Quantum' and even though not all will, I say, Recommended Highly for the Bond fanatic.

Batman Begins," Gotham Divine...BATMAN matures..'campy' turns to concrete
","With all obvious accounting, the Batman Magic' is back! Not since Michael Keaton, when the first modern and great, big screen Batman appeared in 1989, has there been such a commotion made about a new Batman movie. I had not seen this in the movie theater, but as with the first I started seeing bumper stickers and baseball caps and posters of the Batman Begins logos and the like, that's what let me know this was different, than the others. The first Keaton one, I saw it right-off-the-bat! No waiting, with this there had been so many in between, that seemed to be slipping more and more with every new installment, that I simply 'balked' at the thought of Batman 'Again'.Well after I had caught my breath I was astounded at the beauty of the first scenes and how this film instantly whisked me into the whole story. Amazed, as I watched 'Bale' brought on the 'Knight' with a new era of and a fresh-feeling crisp new character/hero. Liam Neeson, enters from out of nowhere and he is a thing of beauty. A solid-cast mentor/trainer in the fine art of crime fighting. Neeson is a pillar in the 'Begin' set. As the grueling training comes to a successful end, there comes the time to re-enter his broken life, complete with his estate and butler. Michael Caine is delightful as the classy care servant 'Alfred'. There was some real genius, to place Caine in this position, he fits to a 'T'. Rutger Hauer, is an acting hero of mine from way back and this was just an unexpected treat of a performance that he had in the story. Gary Oldman, is versatile, Tom Cruise wishes he was as good as Old' Gary. Oldman is inspirational with every labored breath that he took. I was amused too, at one point as the Batman made a surprise appearance at Gordon's (Oldman) home, on the steps Batman informs him of the situation and as he answers Oldman is doing a perfect 'Christopher Walken' styled delivery, just in those few sentences. That gave even a wider performance overall. In the hotel, I laughed as Bruce Wayne having friendly dinner conversation with colleagues from his company when asked about the news of the Batman, says 'A man dressed as a bat clearly has some issues to take care of.' Schluffing it off, as just another crazy man in the dark city. Pure gold.I must say, that Katie Holmes seemed a little too young for me in the beginning, albeit she came through toward the end with a satisfying role. Tom Wilkinson, playing the big crime boss, was reminiscent of the days of Nicholson (the Joker) with the late great Jack Palance,(Boss Grissom) but surely didn't reach the criminal element that these two gave off in stellar performance's in Burton's 89' Batman. At one point in the prison holding room, Wilkinson seemed to be acting much like Dan Hedaya, as he was speaking to counsel as the crime lord.Morgan Freeman is wondrously refreshing, and apart from other roles he has played, I enjoyed Lucius Fox for everything that he (Freeman) gave it, simple, easy and likable. The other players all found excellent fitting surrounding our main names. There was a lot put into this one no denying it, I was overtaken by the classic yet new styling of the camera shots and the places that the story took us to, and last but not least that Bat-Vehicle is something that every Hummer 'wishes' it could dream, wake-up and become. The Bat-S.U.V. for all your needs.Thoroughly penetrating in delivery, this has a strength and smoothness in it's style, it is a solid tailor-crafted action/drama ...a sure fire hit.

2012," Mayans can be a lot of fun, huh?!
","I had seen the previews, believing that this epic film was going to set the rules and rock like a barge full of bricks...and it did!! Wow, victorious! Yeah, right. I remember a time when I was in the made for cable T.V. program Young Indiana Jones Chronicles in California in 1994 working with John's Brother Bill Cusack. That was a lot of fun, to be with a professional man who has a family of talent. I have always liked John's delivery. It always seems to run similar from movie to film. Whether good, great or bad, he just has a mode about him, that is indeed John. I was truly, well let me say that even in disappointment there can be hope, but not for this. Let me see, and I am very much not alone here, when I say count the movies, epics and bombs about saving the world, or the ending thereof. Even if it was ending my lawyer would still want to collect on the bill! At any rate, by and large we've seen Armagedden, which I liked, Independence Day, which I thought was a 2 hour movie built around a gigantic explosion accompanied by a few more, and recycling and organics and coke and John Lennon, with some holes that were the size of the grand canyon, but not to stray here. There was also Deep Impact-good and on and on many to list. The situation was that there were far more 'holes' in this, that made it far, and above too unbelievable even at the 'suspended belief' portion. The biggest thing amongst all the poorly executed 'Special Effects' first was the airplane taking the slip-thru the falling buildings and the shakiness of the plane on the screen!! I laughed, because it looked so ridiculous, the falling embers that were striking everything except the pro-tags in the movie, was flat-out unreal. It looks and is, Phony! It did not even have the ability to make me believe that it was happening, even with the millions of dollars that was spent on the making of this faking the world's end movie. Then, amongst all the other stuff I won't waste time on, there was John's character, at the air field, after they refueled the plane, and he took, Woody Harrelson's R.V., and the ground opened up to HELL, he, as the airplane is leaving in a much needed get away for the 'newer' husband of the ever hot Amanda (baby-love)Peet, John climbs out from the pit which probably had enough HEAT to skewer him like a pig-on-a-spit!! Literally. He made it out from the R.V. dropping and onto the side of the whatever-opening and climbed out. Ho-boy. I got up and walked out at this point, mind you I love John Cusack's ability. The other point of default for this over done world-ending disaster picture was the bad-dialog, of foreigners and even at the market within that conversation standing by the fruit Loops cereal and he says there is always something getting between us and then the earth opens up in the supermarket isle. Please! I can't take it anymore, the formulated 'Hollywood Formula' crap factor that most movies have these days and it is only getting worse. I have an idea, just get rid of most of these over the top, Hollywood exec.s and their 'out of touch' ideas and go to more a purist formatting. Not the over lighted, MTV music played out music over-score, hair, make-up always seeming a little too perfect, no acne, clothing never really getting dirty, that goes on and the stupid, obnoxious one-liner poop, that they totally rely on to catch people's attention during the fifty-seven movie pre-views that they show before your movie starts. And in all of this... why can't kids just be kids? They don't have to be super heroes, super- smart or always have a 'snappy' script written 'come-back' that sounds more adult than their own age group. Ah, hell, we need some fresh good ideas. Not just more over sexed and over-done liner movies that rely on cool images and dialog than story and gradual building to a coherent climax that satisfies, not lets you down in the aftermath.*Not recommended by me anyway. It truly is a disaster movie. Huge disaster. Thanks IMDb.com, it's not the end of the world yet. Revelation.",Null,2,3,8 March 2010
Good Will Hunting," First Script, Brilliant, the wonder-boys, Ben and Matt.
","I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'. I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word. These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground. They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly. When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself. This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.They deserved every award that they received. This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened. I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly.

Gran Torino," Forget retirement...
","With silence and then, shock. Clint is still making the grade. Even for his critic's out in the back that think he is a dinosaur, that has passed away from the next generation of important subjects and left the arena of solid ideas, again he has in fact not left, he has never left the place of importance in cinema. This heart felt all-banging climactic box-office success has shown that the 'clatter' from the cynic's, believing that he is too old to continue bring to the forefront new and exciting material for the mass audience to experience, enjoy and even learn from. I had seen the Dirty Harry dynasty years ago and watched it again. It is for a certain generation, that will really enjoy it. However, the 'justice' part of the series, is for everyone that hates crime and injustice. Gran Torino, Though, I hate Clint for naming it that, because I have been trying to find one since the eighties to buy. In addition to this, the recent resurgence of interest for the auto from the Starsky & Hutch movie with Ben Stiller, hasn't helped me find or buy one, even yet. So with that aside, Torino, was an old school dive into the modern day updated 'jungle' of the hood. Where things are scary Walt here, is angry about that. He wants justice, but they think he is too old and in effective to make a difference...they were wrong too. This story warms the heart and stirs the mind. Walt got an education in this after all was said and done. It surely was not what he expected either. I know that Walt the old iron-man was shocked and changed as well. I was deeply satisfied by the close of the story, with the exception of the car going to the kid. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad he enjoys it but I'd love one or two, too. Enjoy this one makes sense. For those who like Eastwood, or not, there is something interesting and deep here. 4 stars (****)",Null,2,7,18 June 2009
Rules of Engagement," An injured Marine and an injured Marine
","It occurs to me after seeing 'The Rules of Engagement' how one thing can lead to another. 'Point'... things are not always as they would seem to be. For Hayes Hodges,(Tommy Lee Jones) a sort of 'underdog' lawyer, who is taking a case that, he feels he has been pulled into. You can see the doubt in his eyes. National Security Adviser Sokal, played by(Bruce Green)a great 'pick' for that role!! Sokal, is viewing an American embassy security video tape, wants to bury the copy, for his own career appeasement. Sokal offers no help, and seems in all sense to be anti-military as his actions show that he is not there to find the truth, rather to get an answer that will sit well with his boss and in the public's eye.This shows the lack of backing that the government will sometimes give to the troops, or some military situations that tend to be to 'politically hairy', when the media takes over, bringing heat and starting to paint a picture about a story that is not fully accurate. That will get some people in harms way, fast and to some certain death! Samuel L Jackson(Childers) and Tommy Lee Jones' (Hayes Hodges) characters, are close friends. When Terry Childers approaches Hodges, with a crisis on his hands, it makes his friend that has 'chewed jungle' with Terry before, very uneasy and of of center. Hayes in his quest for answers takes a plane trip to the embassy and the surrounding city to investigate further, but ends up not liking what he is learning. Furthermore, Terry looks as if he has painted himself into a corner, by the story he has given to 'Hodge' and with Ambassador Mourain (Ben Kingsley) who Childers was coming to take out (rescue) from a fiery situation, is not any help at this point at all for Terry's defense. Guy Pierce plays an upcoming and hungry prosecutor, (Maj. Mark Biggs) who wants Jackson's character, to do nothing less than prison, for a middle eastern incident at an American base in Yemen. With Hodge getting upset and the upsetting turning to anger, things are starting to get done.This is an excellent military drama that ranks with 'A Few Good Men' only prefer this one, over, 'Santiago had no code!' as far as an enveloping action drama story. Some will disagree, but this one doesn't let you down. Recommended highly!(****) Great direction, William Friedkin",10,9,15,13 January 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Show Me The Monkey
","You lost me at , ' If you fail, the secretary will disavow all knowledge' Let's face it here, this was a 'Tomcat' Inspired second installment of the first film, which was that, a film, not a 'Sequel' not (of course) that there is anything wrong with two' or even three's, if they are done right. This second was a fun jaunt down memory lane, but never the less it doesn't hold a candle very well to it's predecessor in 1996. There was a whole cast with him that worked. He is not superman, he can't leap tall buildings on his own! He like others needs a good team backing him up, bigger than he had in this one. The fights were pretty good as was the chase scenes were a bit fresher than last, but a couple of the fighting segments were in fact over done. Then with that same old John Woo special dance number that he puts in everything he directs. I enjoyed Hugh Stamper and the arch-bad guy Sean, referring to Hunt's love interest as a 'monkey' also the incredible coast line in Australia. I did not however enjoy the very ending with the 'Chimera' effecting her body that not only did the good guys fix her with no seconds left on the clock but, that whole park carnival scene at the very ending. Just a bit like attending the Disneyland in Sydney...seemed an inappropriate end. The biggest blast for me was, when I learned of what Cruise made on this one... $75 Million and a 10% take on the gross. I thought, gosh, he only made $70 Million for first and no gross-points, and I like that one better. 5/10 is all this sequel yields for me. Thx - IMDb.com",5,4,7,23 February 2007
The Dark Knight," 'Number two of all-time' for a reason.
","It all started with the entrance of 1989's BATMAN directed by Tim Burton. I was an instant fan and lover of the story of the night city dweller, Batman. And justice for all that he fought for. I read the 'USA Today' newspaper box back then with the headlines popping Nicholson's 'Joker' steals the show! It made something like 240 million in the theater, domestic! I saw it on a huge screen, it was phenomenal. Saw bumper stickers and tee-shirts and everything Batman in 89, that's how you knew it was great. When the fourth installment of Batman had surfaced with the 1997 'Batman & Robin' I had lost all hope in the enjoyment of another episode on the big screen for a returning Batman. So did a lot of other fans from what I had heard, even from a friend who had been an 'extra' in Batman & Robin. The beginning of The Dark Knight was perfect, simply put... perfect. The overall good news is that the film continues to sore. From the onset the Joker sets foot inside the Gotham arena and all Hell breaks loose. This gives new meaning to the word 'bank job'. There is a battle between the crusader for justice and the lunatic fringe. I was or should I say we collectively, my wife and I were both not only shocked at the performances but mesmerized. Let's face it, it would be hard not to be very impressed at the hard work put into this comic hero piece. The audio score seems to go from pulse pounding good background music to a spine tingling hissing scream. It was one of those additional characters (the music) that drove you to the edge of your seat and propelled the scenes farther, from curiosity to an utterly enthralled state of being. It is intense. Hans Zimmer,is again right in place for this big and sometimes scary story of Gothic proportions. From the change of the make-up style and attitude, Nicholson's joker was a lot of fun, and crazed, but Heath's was played to a menacing height. He was Jack's joker-in high definition, on 'Crack'. POW!! He just hits with a G-force that doesn't stop! Heath Ledger, I did not realize was so versatile. He powered through and just when you think he's down and ready to go out, he is back out on the street again in full array. Bale's Batman was strong as ever and gritty when on the prowl. He was growlingly low-voiced and driven, with a more serious performance than others that had preceded, but with fun lines here and there too. Not campy however, but kick-ass! Batman has grown up and should be taken seriously. The cast including Gary Oldman as 'commissioner Gordon' and Arron Eckhart as 'Harvey Dent' the roundly known 'White Knight'of Gotham city are a perfect match and brilliant performances. They shined in this follow up to the 'Begins' chapter and I am so thankful that Christopher Nolan had brought the dark knight to the serious forefront again. This needed to happened for the series to 'survive'. I was or rather 'we' were blown away by the rock solid job of casting, shooting, acting, directing and the writing that made this a real epic film, not just another Batman movie. I look forward to buying this one on DVD and the next adventure beginning in the (hopefully) not too distant future for the Batman dynasty. These last two films in the series make it all worth while to any discriminating action /adventure comic book fanatic and or the regular film buffs looking for a film to get some real satisfaction. The Dark Knight delivers powerful performances from all aspects...even my wife who doesn't have a tendency to reminisce about pop film and cult films was amazed at how much she enjoyed as did I this scorcher. The grand entrance at the mob meeting was superb! Then, his pencil 'trick' set the stage for the rest of the story. - The Dark Knight is a highly recommended watch it again and again super hero epic, that shines like gold! **** Enjoy T H X >>> IMDb.COM",10,4,7,27 July 2008
Chariots of Fire," A Powerhouse!! Eric Liddel, is the example
","Back in 1981, when this came out I was not only unaware of the story, but as a kid I was just not interested in viewing this. My parents took me to the theater with a bunch of Church friends and I sat, and part way through, I remember asking my mom sitting in the next row forward, ' When is the good part coming? ' I was really perturbed, I'm sure I made my mom more so. She was a good sport however and said, just keep watching, be patient. I sat and waited some more until the final race came. The runners were out and it was full on, everyone showed determination and vigor everyone wanted to 'win' ! The men were sweating and you could see in the slow motion of them in full throttle every muscle in their legs and arms as they moved together. The faces sweating and breathing with that precise air -flow pattern that it takes when you work-out in an extreme method. The story got stronger. Every eye was now on these men as they ran for whatever their desire was for, but all in it were there to get the 'prize'. The music theme song that scored the film, was outstanding and started to grip me as if the power of the example of Eric Liddel had come through to me at my young junior high level. My throat kind of tightened and I recall being in a 'pulling' mode for the main character....a hero of sorts. An athletic Scottsman that had conviction, the kind that changes lives. He was strong in his views and it showed. It wouldn't quite be the same if he had waffled and made excuses, the power of his conviction and moral compass would have become truly 'weak'. I recognized. (looking back in time) the performances of the actors who, when it comes to the names I can't remember off hand, but they acted convincingly and stood out even to me then as a young man I felt that the direction and the story along with those depicting the real people in the story were amazing.I recommend this story of inspiration and faith, highly. I only wish to rate it a twenty out of ten. See it, and be inspired!! (*****)",10,5,6,18 March 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes closed open
","Kubrick's last endeavor, very strange. Kubrick is a very unusual storyteller, albeit he always brings on a host of varying elements that add flavor and usually makes the story transformation into a strange and different world. Cruise is interesting, eerie, as he wades through this tale of an icy and ever so-slightly 'twisted' married couple. I think that Nicole Kidman is beautiful. She seems to bring out more graciousness and expansion to most of everything that she has been cast. She was but a zombie in 'Eyes'. I still believe that she was picture perfect as the wife of the man. From the activity that quietly took place it seemed as if you are on the inside of a private 'members only' life. That this is in a secret place even though you are watching it all happened on the big screen. It takes a lot to bring that sort of experience to the individual viewer. I was in deep and then came the 'party' civil and wild and strange all in once. This film was in the tradition of Kubrick's brilliant vision, although it lacked what much of his other films carried, a certain ingredient. A feeling, even if hopeless, a kind of all encompassing greatness. This didn't have all that sort of Stanley Kubrick's splendor as his past list of work's did. This left me feeling cold at the end, I still had a certain amount of enjoyment from this however.Three out of four stars. (***) RecommendedThx--IMDb.com",Null,3,5,22 February 2007
The Untouchables," Before there were Good Fellas...
","From the get go, I was amazed at the gangster-hold that Capone had on the Chicago land area, in this DePalma Mob masterpiece, I took notice for the first time of the talents that Robert Deniro uses. What a pulse-pounding, and astounding big-gulper. I sat in amazement realizing, that again every movie is not of equal standing. The moment that it started I was into this, moving all the way into the story, following everything. The night of the dinner that Al put on, and began to talk about baseball. I was enthralled, then...as he took and spun the bat around in one flowing movement, changed the 'destiny' of one of his own, that had employment with him, as the bat fell across his skull I felt it through me, like shock-waves!!! I was very alert and on edge at that place in this classic picture. Then later on I heard some 'critics' talking about how Connery was the worst accent, and bad acting etc. Then I saw that he not only won an 'Oscar' for the roll, he won four more awards as well. The critics, weren't all right, because one of the awards came from the Kansas City Critic's circle. Enough said.The directing and camera angles and the score for this film made it all happened in the perfect order. The acting performances were stellar and through it all, there was Sean. A quintessential actor bringing a larger than life character to the front. The Story of Alphonse Capone and company played out for the rest to see. I really enjoyed all that went into the production of this drama.The mafia and all the crime drama and violence has never been an interest of mine, but this was different and it was a big part of History. This is a mile stone in organized crime drama, that every American should see and understand.(****)",10,5,7,4 July 2009
The Departed," 4 Oscars, 47 additional wins and another 50 nominations
","Whether he knows it or not, Scorcese, has a God-given talent for bringing out stories, with an 'intellectual' twist (Not Last Temptation however). THE DEPARTED, showed the hard-boiled side of Boston that is in need of repair. The whole 'Grit' of the officers and the jobs intermixed, from the criminal element right over to the 'Staties'. There seems to be quite a bit of sludge, in the Law there, as many places, (just about everywhere else in the world) unfortunately. But these investigators, with a real 'leak' Handy-capped department, were everything I would have thought this would be, and I am happy to report even more so. First off the Captin Queenan's office, the interview with one, oh-so-nice conversation with Statie 'Collin Sullivan', to the interview/interrogation of DiCaprio's character, showed the uneven operator's working on the inside. All the while, just doing their job of course. Breaking in the newbie's, getting into their heads, to see what they are made of, especially under pressure. Right off-the-bat, you got the higher up's in your face, when you pass the class and that's just to get things started. It starts to get more interesting, just after that. The good man got beat down from the beginning, then that man took action and in that course of, he started to make real waves. Almost invisibly. Enter (first) Jack Nicholson's 'Frank Costello' who Billy Costigan has nicely 'Siddled' up on, and fills a needed position in Frank's business operations his 'Irish' Mafia. This put's Frank's son, who is feeding a criminal from a federal building into a place a crook should never be...'informed'. I was drawn deep into the storyline, from the first few scenes on screen. I was in shock, first when the Captain (Martin Sheen) was standing in for Leo's character and was unable to make it out alive, thus was cast head-long off the meeting place (building) to his,(bloody) end. But as it went on, the story and the shifting of information, back and forth from criminal (Nicholson) to cop (Matt Damon) it became, with the help of Costigan, a lot more complicated, even as it was sifting downward ultimately time would run out and someone from one of the sides would find out, just who the hidden identity was in fact. You know, that Frank's losing his cool and ability to think as he smashes a fly on the table then proceeds to eat it in a bout of anger! Costigan, went on to drop the hammer on Collin, (Matt Damon) he was almost there. The biggest shock was the elevator, after opening and losing the star player. This was a great film, in that some of the players like, Damon and Wahlberg, would use a differing formatted character, than what they usually play. I truly enjoy, Matt Damon's work and yet I perfectly could not stand his character, in this. Superbly done. And as in the end, as the elevator door opens and Collin walks out to head to his door with groceries in arms, as he opens his own front door, he receives the very shock, of his life!! I was blown away at this point, because he (Damon)utters, 'Okay.' Dignam (Mark Walhberg) would be the dispenser of 'ultimate justice' here in this equation. Yet, Sullivan still requested the metal of honor for William Costigan, that was a perfect treat for the ending shot, in this story. This for me was beside 'TITANIC' the most memorable Leo, deep, hungry, passionate, fierce. He was raw and yet refined in his 'mode of operation' investigating, i.e.,cousin Sean, smartly deceptive on the job. Calculated. I enjoyed Stephen Balwin's older Bro in this as well. (****) I recommend, but bring some ear plugs we got some scurrilous verbiage in this one!",9,2,2,7 November 2006
Die Hard," Went to the theater 'thinking' 'This might be stupid.'
","I was not a Bruce Willis fan per say. As a matter of fact, I thought what is this guy from Moonlighting gonna do? Is he gonna make them laugh to death with stupid comments and jokes? I was not a fan of 'Moonlighting' then either, that would come later. In addition I was not thinking, 'John McClain' 'Hans Gruber' or 'John McTiernan' that was my first error.As I took in the very first minute of the film, I knew, this was going to be radically different than I had imagined. This movie and John McTiernan's directing (Also 'Preditor'-1987 'The Thomas Crown Affair'-1999) (The Hunt for red October) (Medicine Man)The way I felt from his genius directing style, that gets you fully involved, stomach wrapped in knots, pulse pounding. He brings out the whole story, not just a 'clot' of mindless action and or violence. He actually led up to the stories climax and didn't blow it when he got there. I was shocked at this movie, which gets 'compared to' all the time with other action and drama movies! Still, after two decades. Needless to say, it changed the way I felt about movies and film making. From Willis's flawless performance to master terrorist Hans Gruber, (Rickman) what a truly superb 'Villain' & (James Shigeta, Holly's Boss) the emotion and heart-thumping fear that lead up to the demise of James's character. The scenery of the towering building and the city itself after dark, under the threat of terrorist activity. Don't forget L.A. P.D.-in charge 'DeWayne T. Robinson', (Paul Gleason - God rest his soul -Died May 26, 2006)I truly looked at film with a whole different view point. I got a copy of the original script, well the 18th re-write or something like that and went, line by line, through the story. It was unbelievable how this movie changed my mind on Movies...as well as Bruce Willis. I just can't say enough about Die-hard, but I will come to a soft close...but before I do, here is a 'spanner' of a thought, originally Willis was not first choice, it was Stallone that they wanted and he turned it down, think on that one! This would not be what it is this way, it would be wholly different with 'Sly' at the helm. I will even venture further out, do you know who this was originally written for? -Answer: Burt Reynolds. No kidding.This is on my all-time list of the best of the best films, bar-none.",10,27,36,12 July 2006
Man on Fire," Searing devotion in the end and to the end...
","Creasy, a security professional. A man who's not, at the top of his game now. Finds himself in a place that he didn't think he would be in. Denzel, is too close to call for me in this movie. I don't believe this is his best of all performances, but he is on top of his game in his acting. He plays it close, keeping his cards closer to his chest. The more he learns, the more he realizes,his clock is ticking...eventually if things don't change, he will have no more time. In this battle to stay alive and dealing with 'the devil' so to speak(his addiction to alcohol)he is brought into a place that is tender and caring. The only perplexing part for him being that this is not the sort of relationship, he thought that he would find himself being swept into.All of a sudden, the alcohol and the losing his grip turns to holding on to the last shred of control and dignity. To protect and serve this little one, that his life is now in the middle of. Pita,(Dakota Fanning) the young girl is coming to a place of need, for Creasy. He for her too in a different way. He gains control long enough, to protect Pita. He gives all he has.This is a touching story of sacrifice and realization...(*****) Recommended, overall deep touching story.",8,3,6,29 January 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Hard, Does it Again... in New York City!!!
","WOW!!! Bruce is back baby!! Talk about that 'lightning' striking again!! It's Powerful stuff! He starts out in a slow and 'sober' manner literally and catches his first, second and then third 'Wind' through out the movie. As he crosses paths with a kind Samaritan, from Harlem... what a team! He (McClain) didn't even need a partner, but it works, explosively well, I think. The first 'Die Hard' was amazing, the second was better than a lot of other movies at that time, but not as great as the first, however, this one blows-back onto the scene. From the beginning, it grabs anyone with a 'pulse' and then works the story through and through, tightly weaving it and bringing wild-action and of course that famous-made McClain- 'attitude' by Willis and McTiernan the original directer and the best suited for this crack-action New York centered drama. Transferred from L.A. of course.With the pressure coming down all around them, McClain and Carver(Willis & Jackson) stumble around, back and forth a little and get their footing, (barely sometimes), but keep their 'Wits' about them and a sense of humor, just to survive and deal with the cuts, bruises and then find their strength and deliver some deadly blows to their adversaries, with razor sharp accuracy! This was better than I had hoped for, considering dreading most sequels. Abandoning my thought for them as just Hollywood 'looking for more money' in most cases. This series has come really far for me, considering that I thought the first Die Hard was gonna be just a 'senseless', maybe even stupid undertaking. Man, was I wrong! I enjoyed the respect for good original story and plot, that John McTeirnan -Director and the novelist Roderick Thorp had in working to make this one stay in the best of the best category of FILM. The only part that I would have omitted was the water in the tube pushing that 14-ton dump truck along and John, surfing it then grabbing that drainage grate cover. He would of had a crushed chest cavity! Altogether, that would have to be 'GOD' helping John through that one, because I think that would be at the very least, a very complicated feat, even for the 'Terminator'.To any and all Willis fans even those who don't care about him...see the film! If you want the edited version to remove curse-words etc watch it on T.V. or you could go to 'Cleanfilms'.com and exercise your 'freedom of speech'(****)",10,5,6,27 July 2006
American Gangster," Harlem Harlequin...almost
","Denzel Washington and Russell Crow. What a seemingly odd coupled-arrangement for a casting, yet they soared together. I sat and watched the story wind-up as the power Lucas (Washington) had learned and then collected, taking 'Bumpy's' place in the middle of Harlem. He practically lived a sort of gangster's romance novel. Seeing the woman, (Miss Cuba)that drove him wild inside, he had to have her...and he did, for a time. This being a true story, was a real American crime family saga, from a black man that learned from the Italian mob and his former boss. There was a killer cast of characters from Brolin what a superb hard ass cop, to John Ortiz (The Job- 2001, Miami Vice- 2006) who, as his partner was fantastic as a seventies Latino cop. His problems grew and eventually when Crow's character confronted him, he cut and ran and eventually paid...with his life. Sad, you like Ortiz's police officer and rooted for him, yet you knew, that he was going down, almost midway through as new information about him surfaced. It made me angry and ashamed to see him like that. There is an officer that is good and smart and couldn't stay on the outside of trouble. Crow's character, was on a mission plain and simple, he is dedicated to his work and doing it efficiently and as directly honest as possible. He is hard driving, but someone you could count on if you were an officer needing back-up. I really enjoyed his portrayal as that officer. I also had it in my heart for the casting of Clarence Williams III as 'Bumpy' the Harlem gentleman gangster, who ran Harlem. The rest of the cast shined, right along with Crow and Washington. You could feel the authenticity and purity of their characters playing out their respective roles in this fast climbing and ever faster descending rise to power drama of a drug lord in Harlem. Crow's cop puts his own task-force together, with a handful of hard street wise and very savvy undercover officers. They were not perfect, but they did their job and performed it to the letter, not letting up, until the case was completed. He (Lucas)had a style that led him into the spot that he would fill until his ultimate demise. Denzel was a wonder. Crow was a strong and concrete, believable force in American Gangster. They were a marvel as the mob-man and the motivated cop. Ted Levine, I can't get by without mentioning his brilliant addition to this spectacle in New York blue. Ted played the Commanding Captain to a 'T'. Levine at one point or maybe two looked and seemed to have 'Martin Landau' down cold. Ted looked like him and sounded very close to Landau as well, I laughed out loud, it was smashing, I couldn't help but be amazed by Ted in this. What a positive casting pick for this True Story drama. The final Church scene that came following the 'raids' was haunting, the gospel singing with the police in the streets outside of the church, as the cold burrowed through and the rain fell the gospel singing in the midst of a criminal finally, was something I had not quite seen and felt before-gripping, chills down the spine. The two sitting in the interrogation room, taking information from Frank the gangster, was quite a heart-enthralling event. What I mean in this is that he or rather 'they' Crow and Washington's character had a definite connection to each other that worked and encompassed. I didn't quite know what I would take away with me, upon viewing the trailer, but I watched a classic story unfold with hammer hitting conviction and concrete reality. There was different events that Lucas attended with boxers like Ali and seeing Sammy along with the celebrity spectators, he saw a lot and as Sammy often sang to a packed audience... 'If you can't do the time,then don't do the crime.' The ending was a perfect one for an ex-gangster with absolutely nothing left, no wife, no money, no family, no friends, no business....not even a ride home...that is if he had one. That's that....Recommended Highly (****)",10,3,8,10 November 2007
The Green Mile," True to the book, true to brilliant cinema.
","I recall in 1999, seeing this and how fresh it is for me, still. I think The Green Mile is an amazing cinema experience, for me and for those with heart. I was into the story watching these guards doing their jobs, going through the telling of this and then enter, prisoner John Coffey,(Michael Clark Duncan) with this power for healing. This was a real true to form tear-jerker. Hanks, playing Edgecomb, the guard that you couldn't help but care about, was made outstandingly well, by Tom's work in this one. What a terrific pick, for that role! I just get this different feeling of vulnerability, when I watch 'The Green Mile', I wasn't familiar with the book as many others were. I just don't think that has any effect on my understanding or coming to better grip with the storyline. I wish that I could go back and see it again, in that movie theater, go back in time (so to speak )because it seemed to speak to me then. About doing for others I think, that was the biggest thought that I can bring away with me. The healer, (Duncan), John was huge and intimidating, yet he was a very important element in Paul's life and his wife's especially. If not for Paul taking the chance, nothing would have changed for Jan most likely. I enjoyed Warden Hal, ( James Cromwell-'Babe' 1995) his part was just right, the direction and the cinematography was very simply perfect for this prison drama. Delacroix, (Jeter- now deceased) was a great side character, and who can really forget 'Wild Bill' Wharton, (Sam Rockwell) who ed all over the place in there, what a demon that guy was.All that aside though, this was a 'thought-provoking' wonder on film-stock. It leaves you feeling and thinking more than anything else. I recommend highly for those who love a grand story with an incredible ending. Thanks to Director, Frank Darabont. I also am amazed at the fact that Stephen King wrote such a touching and fair work like this. (****)",10,2,4,6 January 2007
The Cannonball Run," 102 Octaine hilarity
","Starring Burt Reynolds and company. I couldn't agree more that Burt is at the top of his game. He had the best 'laugh', in Cannon Ball Run. Whenever J.J. and Victor ( Reynolds and Delouise ) would get into it and be crackin' -up, everyone else would too. Now here is the original, we are all on strike (The actors) and this is where we are gonna hang out and party while being in this movie! The actor's strike, what an uprising! This is one of those non ' Politically correct.' you gotta love this one, type of movie. Jackie Chan in his early days before many knew who or even what he was....talented. From Roger Moore, playing himself, (no identity crisis there) you gotta love him, to the tree loving-Farrah Fawcett and her new beau, the 'Wild Bull' marching on Washington D.C. to ban the sale of colored toilet paper, due to irritation! But the best being, all the speed hungry degenerates looking to qualify and get into the race. The major major running cross-country from sea to shining sea, in the shortest amount of time. The cast is heavily-packed with old-school 'giants', that came together and made the race more fun altogether. Two priests in a Ferrari 308. An English agent in an Astin Martin. A big man and a suave guy with a crazy-eyed doctor in an ambulance, along with a female -hostage passenger from an auto wreck, to an all female team in a black Lamborgini, that can get to a sailing pace of 220 miles per hour! Whoa. A Japanese racing team with night scope glasses and a rocket powered Subaru. This band of un-policed road-range nuts are out in full force and flying down the highway!! If you catch a glimpse I'm sure it will be accompanied by a deranged smile. Forget Jimmy Carter and sky-rocketing gas prices, this feature delivers more laughs per mile than a hybrid gets good mileageIn the whole simple plot-based laugh road rally, this is a fun and intoxicated comedy for the undiscriminating comedy viewer. The fun and hilarity is infectious!! The actors, since being in the middle of the actor's strike, had time to hang out and through-out the movie you see the uninhibited lunacy that putting all these personalities together, with a lot of alcohol will do. Then at the end credits its role 'Bloopers' more enjoyment with the ones who couldn't keep their lines straight! This is a staple comedic kill the 55' mile per hour speed limit and blow away the other racer out and out good time! A classic for decades to come. Sheer madness, but all in good company!Recommended, oh yeah... ()***()",10,9,13,17 March 2007
Tombstone," No awards, just rewards to cinema patrons.
","God bless George P Cosmatos. To anyone who is a fan of the old west genre, holy smokes!! This little piece of western history hit with a thunderous explosion. Tombstone, was in theaters around the time that Eastwood's-- 'Unforgiven' was just heading out. That (Clint's western saga) won a lot of awards, but to my dismay, it seems as though ' they ' missed this one. To me this is what Oscars are made of . Steely-performances that bring the viewer to a place of awe. Simple. This film of the old west, that some will quibble about the fact that they didn't go into further detail on the lives and events that were part of each character here. Or that some of the facts were traded or missed all together in Tombstone. The director had set this western up and many others on their heels. Everybody mentions Val Kilmer in this as the incomparable 'Doc' Holiday. No doubt that he was indeed just that. But add to it the way that Russell and Elliot with Paxton were the brothers that fell right into cinematic place. They were picture- perfect in their places. Then you bring in Dana Delaney, who is made for this part of the love opposite Wyatt, feisty, smart, educated and beautiful. and Stephen Lang another 'Pro' in about anything he takes on. I think he has multiple acting-personalities, his range is as broad as lake Superior. From a confident Jewish Lawyer David Abrams in 'Crime Story' (1986-88) to a quivering voice scumbag criminal outlaw in this, he has all the talent and a few other actor's talents too! Along with him, Michael Biehn, who was prime as Ringo, oh yeah! Charlton Heston as ' Henry Hooker' the solid standing rancher, who aides 'Doc' in a time of trouble, to Powers Booth, as the smart-Aleck's, oddly likable but equally slimy instigator 'Curly Bill' . The guy you love to hate. There was many moments that were the blocks that built the story, the one in particular that seemed strangely authentic, was when Wyatt and Virgil (Russell and Elliot) walked with Allie and Mattie, from the train after meeting up, and stopped at that storefront window and stood there, as if posing for a portrait. Wyatt sort of directed them to take a moment and take a picture of it to remember in their mind. That was a pause for reality in this for me. This had both tragedy and hard fought victory. The Arizona sky and scenery was dreamy in some sequences and the camera crew and sound was top-notch. I still can't really say there is another 'West' picture that stimulates my senses better than Wyatt and the whole gang, with 'Doc' the wild huckleberry, at your service....The crew that played together in this film, helped make it a smash hit!! There are the other actors that took part as well, too many to list with the 'word' limit on IMDb, but, it was so good, you could feel it even after the movie was over! I highly and gladly recommend to western lovers and action movie seekers. Tombstone...Justice is coming.(*****)",10,16,21,4 February 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," The Fourth One Cometh!!!!
","'One' 'two' 'three', and finally four. I waited a long time for four too! Bruce Willis, well what can you say about Bruce that hasn't already been said? You're fired? Maybe although you know that no right minded director is most-likely going to have such a huge creative difference with an icon like Bruce that he would fire him from a project. This was a fun chapter back into the life of John McClane, again. More than I can say for other movies that have done four it's tough to keep bringing pure magic to the game like this though. Bruce has energy to burn it seems like. He just rolls and you want to follow him through the whole thing wherever he leads. He definitely has more cool than even a lot of the younger actors that are coming up today or have been around for a while even. He's like old school cool with a steely-edged and unpolished finish. I enjoyed the story, it was faster paced then even the preceding chapters, although the first for me will always be the ground-breaking best. The characters in 'Live Free' seemed pretty polished, all except for McClane of course. He just is, what he is...on the job, rough, ready to fight and committed. There was enough to keep you on the edge of the seat, more than enough. The only bone that I had to pick with this high rated action extravaganza is the fact that it didn't need all the special effects that it contained. That's the only reason that I didn't rate it a perfect '10'. I liked the added new talent (as of lately) Cliff Curtis as Deputy Director Bowman. He is really outstanding as a straight-good guy role as well. I admit he is a savory villain, a fun to hate type, or a bad guy that you want to blast! Curtis is a great cast member. Truly, Die Hard the first and third to me were the essence of what a tough and well-mapped out story is all about. The original changed the way that I looked at cinema from that point out.McClane was deep, even with his quick witted come-backs and snappy retorts. He was still, cool as one could be in that situation. It was gritty. It was brutal, and sophisticated, yet funny and simple. It really had it all. So when two came out I saw it and said, 'I liked it but not as much as one.' Then three arrived and I felt good again. Four made me cheer for John McClane all over again...and for that I can't complain!You can't beat the feeling of exhilaration that comes from the 'Die Hard experience'!!!! Bruce Willis is John McClane. I am so glad that it was Willis that got the part and not Burt Reynolds as they had written the original script for the first film, with him in mind as John McClane.Try it for yourself, if you haven't seen it already. It was best on the big screen. 'Live Free Or Die Hard' >>>> Recommended for a great time.(***)",9,3,5,17 March 2008
The Sixth Sense," And all nine lives...Willis delivers again
","By far this is my favorite Haley Joel Osment role that I have seen him play. M.Night is sensational directing this onion-skin of a thriller story, but who doesn't realize that? The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again. I only had one question that I would like to ask 'M' about the plot. Other than this, I am well pleased with 'The Sixth Sense'.For what a superb thriller should be, this one is a top pick. It's 'incredible' the success that The Sixth Sense has had, it is no wonder to me and millions of fans, and in that, Willis with his contract and profit agreement took away with him One Hundred Million Dollars. Some might say that he isn't one hundred million good. Some might say, the Razzies gave him three awards for worst actor just the year before, I say, none of that 'banter' will change a wit about Bruce in this film. Recommended for M.Night Shyamalan and Willis fans, even if you aren't it really makes no difference in the end you will know why. (*****)",9,4,6,25 October 2007
Heat," Intuitive. A feeling of reality, sobering, with no silly special effects.
","'Edgy' story, dangerous crew, tries to out maneuver, the Major Crimes Unit, (M.C.U.) You could get lost in the scenery. As this story starts out with a bang! I felt, that I was there in the midst of the drama. Not every movie has the power and ability to bring you to a place of longing. The characters, and the people playing the parts, where pieced together just right by casting agent Bonnie Timmerman. Then as far as it goes for Mann, he knows what he wants!1995, Heat hit the theaters and a man I knew, who was 'Special Forces' weighed in with his thoughts on this before I even had a chance to see this. He said' 'When you're in the middle of a firefight, any of them, you practically need ear-plugs. Just like it is in reality. All the other activity, was real believable.' He was impressed, even as a military man in special forces. I went and caught it, when I had the time and from the onset, it opens up and lets you glide into the story. I pretty much could get lost in this one. I don't mean, not understanding the story and so on either. It's just an incredible trip for the sense of suspense and intrigue. It's spellbinding in effect. The 'Mann', telling the story draws you in by the activity and spreads out a silence around in various parts, causing you to think and feel through the absence of 'speech' or talking. Just by the essence of the scenery, unfolding the story and using more elements than, just dialog. My thoughts become a lot more enthralled when the story is so smart in it's execution, using your mind, instead of just giving everything through the 'characters words'. A drawing in of your feelings as you watch a scene get set with a somber building of drama, leading up to a climax that doesn't get blown, the wrong way. Through the 'Crew's' activities and the murders on the streets, the M.C.U. is getting stretched, but hasn't snapped. Vincent is on the 'case'. Kevin Gage (Waynegro) was a special kind of 'scumbag' for me. He was an authentic criminal. A precise coward, an ego maniac and a 'life' story loser! Perfect. There are other good and great directors out there as well. However, it seems that Mann rarely misses. (*****)",10,3,5,9 September 2006
Hart's War," Has heart, loses the battle, fortunately not the war...
","Typically Bruce Willis brings a bunch to any movie part and this is no exception, however from the director that brought NYPD Blue (1994-2005), 'Fallen'(1998) w/Denzel Washington and 'Frequency'(2000) w/Dennis Quaid two well set movies and a 'Hit' T.V. series, that are great additions to any entertainment library, I felt that this director, had one or two things missing from 'Hart's War'. I would have been more interested if it would have been 'Hart Bochner's War' where Hart could have played the arrogant 'Ellis' and then the least end we could have had a few good laughs. Please don't take me wrong, I love and I mean love a good drama any day, but Hart's was just one of those maybe fall by the wayside in the movie arena type films. I enjoyed the activity and confinement, the trial and court drama that was the main push in this WWII story. but something didn't seem to draw me into a place that I could feel that I was sold all the way, as many Willis films are for me. I don't balk at much that Bruce Willis has made because he exudes that charm, style, strength and aloof that makes his character an essential part of American cinema. Hart's War, was almost there for me but I remember walking out, thinking about the story and the scenes therein, but not fully making that real connection that I have come to expect in a well done Willis Drama. I will watch it again at some point probably at a holiday, as some movies age better that others, some don't age at all. That is the test I have used most effectively for my final judgments on it. Worth a look, yeah, why not, but going out of your way to see this, may not be what you're looking for. See for yourself anyway. (**)",7,5,8,26 October 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," God bless the man who takes good care of his family...
","No matter what color you are, or where you are from, anyone can appreciate Chris Gardener's trials and tribulations. As many have said you can't help but to be inspired by this true story of devotion.Sitting in the theater with my wife, I (not only) like Will Smith teared -up I was simply worn out, 30 minutes into the movie! The things that Mr. Gardener suffered all in the line of his life's duty was more than some people could bare. There's no doubt about that. Will was outstanding as the father of the small child and the husband who's wife couldn't wait another minute. Think about what she just gave up. Not only her son, a good boy, but a good man who ultimately would not quit. I understand from his interview that he is a multi-millionaire now. After all that. In the light of many circumstances that would depress the hell out of any normal man or woman. He was evicted, jailed, hit by a car and lost a shoe, while on his lunch break and on and on it went. As I watched him I was inspired greatly! As my wife said 'Look at his attitude and the way that he 'carried' himself through all of it. He didn't bring on the fell sorry for me thing.' That truly he would have had every right to disclose his problems, but he simply kept on keeping on, until....-he won!! I think every good American should watch and get inspired by this story. It makes you think and feel, it changes perspective. Bravo Mr. Gardener. Recommended highly You'll learn a lot, this story is priceless. (****)Thx--IMDb.com",10,10,18,17 February 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Third is 'charm' -Ford & Connery do damage!
","I remember the Pepsi ads on T.V. for the upcoming 'Last Crusade' Being that I had seen the previous, sequel, Iwas not looking forward to another 'Adventure' . I was really put-off by the whole 2nd because the original Raiders had such a concrete effect on me for positive film learning and gripped my creative mind.As I hesitantly went and saw Crusade with friends, I was shocked at the improvement that had taken place with the third installment. It had literally been great and then very kid-like in number two then three seemed to have a more grown up story that was now in league with the original. There was a broader appeal to me and millions with Last Crusade, and on top of this all the casting of Sean Connery, I was a big fan of but unsure of his placement. As the father of Jones, Connery was sensational! You couldn't get past the accent and his humor, they were genius in that character's development. The line that really was a laugh-maker was when the two Jones's were taken hostage by the Nazi's. Standing looking the bad-guys in the eye... Indiana delivered a 'smasher' ! This was about one of their two other friends, 'Brody' the older Englishman. Indiana stated when the Nazi inquired of Brody's whereabouts,- 'You'll never find him he knows five languages, he will blend in with the crowd, adapt. He knows all the local customs and he will disappear.' Then as we see Brody in the next scene, he looks about half drunk standing in the middle of a crowd, looking perplexed he inquires, to anyone...'Does, does anyone speak English?' The theater roared in laughter. The best for me about this explosive adventure, is that Lucus and Spielberg, again used 'Biblical' story lines. A theme that was tied into the plot that made it even deeper, like the first ' Raiders ' . This one was a vastly different Indiana Jones than I had expected, I love when Lucus and Spielberg put their creative brains together, it works! This is a favorite on my top picks list of all time... see it too and see why (****)",10,3,5,14 March 2007
The Proposal," An unexpected pleasure...Ooh Ms. Sandra
","Hey now! I picked this for my wife tonight. Though, it seemed that the pre-views somehow, didn't look that appetizing. I couldn't have be more wrong. And what a sweet surprise! This Sandra Bullock produced little diddy had her in what I say is one of her smartest roles/characters I have seen so far. Aside from the dancing with Gammie over mother earth, even with that she still was hot as can be, all the while shaking' her groove thing. I didn't quite get it other than comic relief I'm sure, but it didn't seem to fit the story, although it was kinda cute anyhow. I never payed attention to anything other than Sandra's acting before now. She played this rich witch executive to the edge. I was proud of her performance, she is amazing like never before. She had a rigid sexy grace about her that just makes you CrAzY!! She, not to get off on a 'rabbit trail' here, but she seems to have nice aging process. Some people get older, some look more and more wonderful as they age, thus Sandra. She is stunning...I am shocked that I am writing this, because I have never felt this way about Ms. Bullock. Ryan her secretary assistant is quite the right man for the job. He brings with himself an ability for on the line delivery. He is totally believable. He was the perfect opposite to her sexy, steely eyed lady boss. The story takes Sandra's character by surprise to Alaska, to get her out of trouble, she doesn't want to take the trip at second thought, but has to end up following through, or she could lose everything. While on this little adventure and cover-up mission to save her ass, they take in a few different situations that teach them some different things about themselves and some life lessons that they won't soon forget.I have to admit that amongst the beautiful Alaskan backdrop, this family of Ryan's character are sort of like the Kennedy's of Sitka, Alaska. They were very outgoing and happy and totally engrossing to this duo. They really didn't have a chance when it came to trying to pull off what they were trying. I must say though, through the laughs and all else I was shocked at seeing Sandra in just a wash cloth covering her tan bod. She is fit, she's hot. No debate there. I saw more of her than I ever have, or though I would and what was more, the pre-views don't do the bedroom crossing scene any justice, at all. When the two crossed paths naked and basically met sticking together standing up before they hit the floor, like that, it was not something that you are gonna soon forget either. I was dumb-founded. I never knew that Sandra was that way. Jeez Louise!!Well this one with the astute Madison avenue frigid queen of cold had me at the proposal on the street corner. They made this one with love you can see, some lust too just to keep the guys on the edge of the seat so to speak and a fun story about a couple that were not supposed to fall in love, but did anyway. Betty White was a wonderful addition to this by the way, here's to you Betty for putting something smart and comedic into this feature of love from New York to Alaska. I recommend to the girl and guy date night type stuff it's a winner.(****)",10,4,9,25 July 2009
Beetlejuice," Beetle-J & two more,=Three's company!
","When this first came out, I couldn't believe how different it was from other horror or comedy movies, or the combo of the two, which obviously is what it is, however, I have been amazed at it's simplicity of special effects in regard to the movies now. Yet it has a real artsy-goth appeal. I have thought about the movie on and off for years, then wrote what my version would be as a sequel installment on the original and expanded on the characters with a few new ones. The only real problem with this is, I am not contracted to write for Warner Bros., or Mr.Burton. But would it not be great to see a whole other chapter in the BeEtLeJuicE library, the original writers (Both late) would have probably wanted another as well.I would love to see, Keaton reprise his role as the royal, ghostly pain in the afterlife. He was the voice, the posturing, the whole attitude that made this one such a winner. He is young and strong character builder, besides who else is gonna be 'BeEtLeJuIcE' anyway? To me this is a quirky-comedic horror-romping treat, with a spanking-good cast, that would be excellent in this world of 'Re-makes' to produce a second-time around original. I say, the scenery and sets were great, I really did get enthralled with the visual and audio set up. But, due to the occult 'references' (sayonce etc) and semi-poor scripting, the lack of music in spots causing some audio dry spots, that needed more scoring from 'Elfman' than what was originally dubbed-in. My rating for this dropped down. the sequel that I copywrote into the writter's Guild I also handed a copy to the youngest Baldwin, Stephen. I had hoped that if anyone could push it that I knew that it would be him. He just looked at me and said 'This is gonna be hard to do.' Keaton stole this show, he is the ghost with the most babes. You know what one of the funniest unknown facts about this movie was? Not many know this but this was written for one of the original Rat-Pack members from the 60's fame. I wonder how many people would guess, that the first written script pick to play Beetlejuice was ......Sammy Davis Jr. No kidding. (I'm still crackin' up over here!!) I gave it an 6, because Michael Keaton is only in it for a total time of about 19 or 20 minutes. (**)",6,4,8,12 October 2005
