The Equalizer," Totally Denzel!!!
","I was never a big fan of the original TV series with Edward Woodward (RIP), but Denzel Washington in lead here brings a totally new and added dimension.With enhanced skills and a huge element of mystery, the new Robert McCall is just what this piece needed to give it a formidable 'reboot'. This movie will either lead to more sequels, and/or updated TV series.If you're looking for great action with a rich flavoring of character interest, this movie is for you. However there is an element of this character that somewhat reminds me of Denzel's John Creasy in 'Man On Fire' (lots of body bags needed here).This was one of the very few films that I can say that I enjoyed every minute of. What I also really liked was the fact that McCall was involved in helping several people in this film in addition to Chloe Moretz's character. Denzel was in stellar form, and I hope he can continue with this franchise should it remain on the big screen.",9,3,10,25 December 2014
The Expendables 2," The Expendables Franchise Becoming An In-Expendable Action Buffett
","Yes, 'All You Can Ask For...' in an action movie with the biggest action stars and breath-taking action scenes. What I found most priceless was seeing Arnold, Bruce, and Sly walking together side-by-side as the gunned-down the bad-guys. In all honesty this edition was slightly better than the first. Now you can't forget JCVD! His performance as a bad-guy traces right back to early film roots (No Retreat, No Surrender, and Black Eagle). Needless to say, JCVD plays a much better 'Villian' than a good guy. His French accent and cold demeanor gave him a powerful presence in each of his scenes. The writing had it's inevitable weaknesses, but displayed some keen wit at times as well. One brilliant stroke was having Chuck Norris reprise his major film debut role as CIA Black-Ops Agent John T. Booker (Good Guys Wear Black) with a touch of J.J. McQuade (Lone Wolf McQuade).Stallone has been known to have a phobia of letting someone else sit in the directors seat in His films, but that may change after this outing. Rumor has it that a 3rd movie is in the works using the same writer as #2 in Dave Callaham. Rumor also has it that Nicolas Cage may be entering the fold of what is becoming an action all-star retreat.Once again Stallone has amazed us with his brilliance in originality as well as his well-known 'never-say-die' approach which gives him 'the- edge' among film makers. This film (along with film #1) is a must-see, and/or a must collectors item in your film library. Expect #3 to be out in 2 years.",9,1,7,3 September 2012
Dawn of the Dead," Excellent Updated Illustration
","I don't think you could've asked for a better remake. This version had a lot more than just 'the dead are coming to get you'. In fact, in this film the dead are literally chasing you with a vengeance. This remake gave you everything that the original was lacking; 1)It gave you more action with zombies more mobile & possessing more strength. If you were to encounter 5 of these creatures your only hope of escape would be the use of a rocket launcher or the ability to fly. 2)You had less gore in terms internal body parts being exposed. Even the cannibalism was curbed. 3)You had a more extensive & more interesting crew of characters, even the bit part of Kenneth's roof partner was nicely done. 4)You had a more plausible and even frightening premise on which the 'Deadish' came to being. The possibility of such a disease agent overtaking our society does exist with the deteriorating conditions of our environment. 5)You definitely have all the components for a sequel with how it ended. The performances of the entire cast were great, and the chemistry was there as well. This was more a Sci-Fi speculative film rather then a horror movie. 10 out 10",10,0,0,25 July 2004
World War Z," Not A Zombie Film, But What 28 Months Later Could Have Looked Like...
","This was not a Zombie movie, plan and simple. If Danny Boyle and the Fox Atomic folks ever got their act together, then we'd have perhaps what was illustrated here, but far more superior than this weak presentation.There were some things about the film that I liked, but there were a lot of missing elements that would have made it much better. For starters I think they could have used a much better director for this project than Marc Forster (who's only noticeable film was a very forgettable yarn called 'Monsters Ball').Forster has never even seen, much less know what a zombie/pandemic film should look like. This showed in how the zombies became more and more less threatening, and more comical looking as film went on. Max Brooks wrote a masterful piece in the original novel, but this film was less- than faithful to the source material.The characters were very transparent to almost lifeless in the film. Yes, things got off to a relatively quick start, but there was no character development to speak of. As far as this being a WAR, that lacked considerable punch as well. More attack scenes, and just a 'little' gore would not have hurt. Most of the action seen in this film was in the trailer.Now we know, that whenever we see a so-called zombie film with a PG-13 rating, movie-goer beware. Nonetheless, I did find the film somewhat entertaining, but I still left the theater with a feeling that something was indeed missing.We never found out where the pandemic originated, or what it really was. The pandemic spread to quickly almost to the point that the film immediately fell into a chaotic frenzy. If something was to spread that fast, we could have at least got the benefit of knowing where it started like in 28 days later. This made the film look even more unrealistic.To wrap this up in a nutshell, what I saw was a film that suffered from a lack-luster director who had no vision or concept of what a zombie/apocalyptic film should look, or feel like. Max Brooks should give his money back, remove his name from this film, and reboot the project keeping the cast, but getting another director, perhaps Danny Boyle. This film will have a very brief stint in the theaters, so wait-for-it on video or cable.Blu-Ray 'unrated' edition is much more intense with 7 additional minutes of footage.",8,3,6,7 July 2013
Fast & Furious 6," The Fastest, and The Most Furious!
","This edition 'took-it-all'. Fast car chases, furious fight scenes, and an engaging story-line with a nice 'twist' in the end. I am convinced that they'll have a 'very' difficult time following this act. However, when you see the end, you'll without-a-doubt conclude that a 'Fast 7' is already in the works.The villain in this film has many tentacles, and a family of His own that could lead to even more intrigue in a 7th film. Michelle Rodriguez was amazing in the reprisal her role as Letty, and her fight scene with Gina Carano would make even Chuck Norris smile.Overall, it was Tyrese Gibson's character that added the most significant amount of laughs. What I did find amazing about this franchise is that each film seems to out-do it's predecessor. Should there be a 7th film (and there will be), the film-makers will have their work cut-out for them, because this movie out-did the others by light years.... Go see it in the biggest screen possible.",10,6,9,25 May 2013
The Expendables," That's What I Call 'An Action Movie'
","For those who b-rated this movie, it's apparent that what we call An Action Movie these days, is achieved more by CGI. This film takes us back to the days when business was literally BOOMING! The story line (for those who did not understand it) was a well thought out approach to what really takes place in the dark halls of the CID and the Intelligence Agency. The Garza character was a Noriaga prototype. However the interesting twist was Garza having to choose between money and power vs. the love of his daughter. This was a great element of conflict in the story. There were other small elements that merely gave you a glimpse into the lives of each character. So what else could you ask for? The fight scenes where superlative, and the weaponry was outstanding. Stallone has once again stumbled upon yet another potential franchise that could be good for 1 or 2 more films. In retrospect, Van Damme & Seagal would not have been a good fit for this project. I really liked each actor in their respective roles, even 'Stone-Cold' as a bad guy & Lungren as a drugged-out psycho. Sly still has 'The Eye Of The Tiger'.",9,1,7,6 September 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Magnificent, and Potent Sequel!
","This was an action film that delivered on 'all' levels. We also got an even closer look at the main characters (namely Steve Rogers, and Nick Fury). The action and fight sequences were even more breath-taking than those of both the first Capt. America film and the Avengers combined.I was also greatly surprised by the performance of Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson AKA The Falcon. Mackie looked well suited for the role, and put in a great performance as an authentic action hero.This film was well written, well designed, well directed, and well executed. It's amazing to see how far Marvel Studios have gone from where they started as a small film company. It's also quite obvious that with great writing, casting, and great directorship a small film company can compete and out shine many of the major entities.The story line of the film is one that not only connected to the first movie, but also effectively introduced new extensions which should lead to a 3rd edition as well.Captain America II is a story of patriotism, honor, sacrifice, and friendship. For those who've had negative things to say about this film, are simply clueless, and have no understanding of the above mentioned 4 elements that makes this movie a must-see...",10,2,4,19 April 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Capt. America: The Ultimate Hero, Avenger, and Patriot
","Over the years I've seen 2 other film versions of the super hero wearing the red, white, and blue. The last version was the 1990 UK feature film starring Matt Salinger and Ronnie Cox. Ironically, Stan Lee was one the executed producers of that film as well.This current version took some of the elements of the 1990 rendition, but for the most part is much closer to the original comic book source material. However, what impressed me the most was not just Chris Evans amazing performance of the main character (Steve Rogers), but how this version reflected the character and spirit behind the man Captain America.In this film, the writers, producers, on down to the director successfully showed how the Hero in the red, white, and blue was not just any guy the government chose as a subject for their experimental 'Super Soldier' program, but that the success of the program depended on the inner qualities and character of that guy.Steve Rogers/Capt. America, was not just an enhanced super-human, but a man 'committed' to the service of his country, and comradeship with his fellow soldiers. Rogers was fearless even to the extent of given his life if need be to complete his mission. This is what Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Jack Simon and everyone involved in the creation of this great hero envisioned. A hero who 'earned' the respect of his fellow servicemen as well as the adoration of his country.The quality of the film making was second to none as well. The visual effects, production design, and wardrobe for this masterpiece which spanned over seven decades was simply magnificent. The combat action and fight scenes where breath-taking as well.This is a film that can be appreciated by every American regardless to your party affiliation, and whether or not you've served in the military and/or any branch of public service. This is a film that embodies every positive value that we all hold dear.Captain America is truly the first Avenger...",Null,2,6,29 October 2011
Man of Steel," An Amazing Achievement In Film Making
","What Richard Donner wanted to do with his vision of the film (that was split into 2 films by the studio at that time), Nolan, Goyer, and Snyder brought it home.These comparisons are what stood out the most to me: <ul><li>A complete film bringing together the arrival of Superman, and the arrival, and all-out conflict with his most fierce rival General Zod, instead of the first film which got off to a great start, but ended as a sappy love story between Superman and Lois Lane</li></ul><ul><li>A General Zod who's motive appeared to 'somewhat' altruistic, verses the other Zod who only cared about his god-like complex in the 1981 film.</li></ul><ul><li>Antje Traue's Faora-Ul made Sarah Douglas's Ursa look like Olive Oil.</li></ul><ul><li>The inevitable 'death-match' between Zod and Cal-El which could-not have played out any other way, verses the 1981 confrontation which led to the arrest of the super villains.</li></ul><ul><li>No Kryptonite weakness, but a man of steel who supposed to be virtually invulnerable.</li></ul><ul><li>The realistic approach to mankind's reaction to an extraterrestrial on earth with unlimited powers, verses a society that readily rolled-over to the caped hero.</li></ul><ul><li>An intelligent explanation as to 'why' the demise of the planet krypton occurred. </li></ul><ul><li>Why General Zod sought-out to over-throw the kryptonian hierarchy, in opposed to what 1981 film illustrated as a random act treason by the military commander. </li></ul><ul><li>A film score by Hans Zimmerman deserving of a Grammy award.</li></ul>The list can go on and on. Needless to say, this illustration was much more enjoyable and entertaining than the film series of the late 70s and early 80s, and even the 2006 version. I am also convinced that a sequel is already in the works. This film has, and will continue to have people talking and debating as to the contrast between this superman, and all the others we've seen along the way. This movie also moved much more efficiently than the 1978 version which went a bit stale after superman emerged from his fortress of solitude.Lastly, based on the effectiveness of this film, a 'Justice League' film is certainly within the realm of possibility. However the studio may find itself in a bit of quagmire due to the fact that they did get the jump on bringing the main characters together in the way marvel did. Marvel cleverly coordinated the assembling of earth's mightiest heroes by bridging together each film from Iron Man, The Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor, and Captain America.",10,1,6,23 June 2013
Jarhead," A Pathetic Mess, and A Disgrace to The USMC
","I usually only write a review when I really have something to say. This film at first left me speechless, then made me angry. Our troops have enough to deal with in the desserts of the middle east then to be portrayed as a bunch of mindless animals. We know how things can get for the guys out there when they're a long way from home, but we don't need to go through their intimate issues chapter and verse.Why didn't the filmmakers take Stan Kubrick's example of how a war film should be done. 'Full Metal Jacket' along with 'Apocalypse Now' are among the best illustrated war films along with of coarse 'Saving Private Ryan'. This was garbage on display. The infantry soldiers of the USMC are about far more than what was seen in this film. Marines concentrate and engage their attention to one thing most of the time, which is to kill the enemy. I was disappointed to see how the filmmakers opened the film with one racy scene after another.The bottom line here is, for the people who made this film they should be ashamed of themselves for disrespecting the branch of our armed forces which deserves the most honor, the USMC.Jarhead is a exploitive stereotype of what Marines strive NOT to be. For any one reading this review, if you love the corp and your country, don't see this film.",1,9,16,6 July 2006
Creed II," Among The Best of the Series!!!!
","I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!
Creed 2 encompasses what the Rocky/Creed saga is all about!. This film was not just about boxing, but it involved the the human relationships that built a friendship between Rocky, Apollo Creed, and his son Adonis Creed. You will be on the edge of your seat for this one. And, Michael B. Jordan was magnificent. You will also see a side if Ivan Drago you may not expect. Yes, there will be a Creed 3.....",10,1,5,1 April 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn Of The Justice League!!!
","First off, for those 'critics' who cut-down this film, I will BOLDLY STATE, you don't know what you're talking about...I will also state that apparently what most 'critics' look for in a super- hero movie is 'camp' and over-exaggeration. This film dealt with some very serious contemporary and social issues. When 'critics' come across a super- hero film like this, they don't know what to do with themselves...This is probably why the critics raved about 'Dead Pool'. In Batman v Superman we see an evolution of characters like A-Lex-ander Luthor, and the introduction of Diana AKA 'Wonder Woman'.What I also LOVED about this movie is how several mysterious elements crucial to the stories mythology come to light. The film was filled with plenty of action, intrigue, and relationships which formidably stages things for following DC films to come.Ben Affleck (with the odds stacked against him in the shadow of Christian Bales Batman) did a very admirable job as the new caped crusader. I also believe that movie-goers will love the new Alfred played by stylishly by Jeremy Irons.Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was well worth her characters death in the Fast/Furious 6 film. Gadot plays the WW we've all dreamed about. This WW truly KICKS-ASS like in the comics and the animated series.From here we should expect DC to thoroughly compete with Marvel in the Cinema. There are 10 more films expected to be released by this production team, and they all should be worth the price of admission. Long Live The Justice League!!!",10,5,9,27 March 2016
X2: X-Men United," A Sequel Second To None.
","This installment out shined the first film on many levels, especially from an action stand point. We are beginning to see the X-Men 'Evolve' into true crime fighting super heroes. The latest additions of Pyro and the Ice man are just the beginning to this franchise. I am also quite sure that we have not seen the last of William Stryker.This group of heroes continues to display great chemistry as well as an engaging illustration of their respective characters. I especially liked the way they went about illustrating the seduction of Pyro. It is also noteworthy that Singer did an excellent job in the area of balance romance and sex in this sci-fi action feature. Bryan Singer has hit a home run with this body of work. However his true test will be life after the X-Men. 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,28 July 2004
