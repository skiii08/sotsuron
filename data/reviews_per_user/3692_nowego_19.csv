The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not a good adaption of the best book in the series
","Up front I will say that I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga. Breaking Dawn being the last and IMO the best of the books in the series. I have read the book 6 times so far and will be reading it again.While the film follows the book reasonably closely I was disappointed with some of the license that was taken with the adaption. The most disappointing were the fight scenes between the vampires and the wolves, anyone who has read the book will know exactly what I mean. No further needs to be said here.The acting that has been remarked on by other reviewers in this was no different to any of the previous movies in the series as far as I was concerned and I was happy with most of the movie. People who remarked on the woodenness of the acting do not seem to take into account way Edward reacted towards Bella in the book and I was not overly concerned with it at all. The only things that brought the movie down for me were the changes that were made to the story, these spoiled the movie for me.The movie ended at the point that I expected it to end and I look forward to the next and last installment. I only hope they do not change too much from the book, as I believe the next part is the best of the lot.Grudging 5 out of 10 for me. I would have given it a 6.5-7 but for the changes that messed up the movie.",6,5,7,8 January 2012
50 First Dates," One of Adam Sandler's Best
","This is a movie I never get sick of watching and have watched it far too many times to keep count. 
If you are into romantic comedies this is a must see, there are so many funny characters in it you will just have to laugh out loud at some point.
Rob Schneider's character is just hilarious and if you don't laugh at him, well........
As always Drew Barrymore's acting is sublime and the movie is worth watching just for her.
Not really your typical over the top Adam Sandler movie, but most if not all Adam Sandler fans will love this one.",8,13,15,20 April 2018
Passengers," Definitely Worth Seeing
","I think it take really good actors to be able to carry a movie as basically the only people in it. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do just that...really well.This might have been billed as a Sci-Fi as other reviewers have stated, but it is definitely romance, adventure and drama, with a little suspense thrown in.I saw this without reading any reviews and loved it straight away, so much so that I watched it again within a few days. It is one of those movies that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.When I read some of the critics reviews after watching it, I really thought they had the wrong movie. My recommendation is if you like romance movies you will like this one, it is that simple.8/10 for me and it could easily score higher, but I am being conservative.",8,11,19,10 May 2017
The Hunger Games," I've Read the Books, This Hits the Spot OK
","I finished all three books a couple of weeks ago, so they were pretty fresh in my mind when I saw this movie at the cinema. While it is not a perfect adaption of the first book by any means, if you have not read the books you will still be entertained and dare I say it be less critical of the things that were left out.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is pretty much as I pictured her while reading the books, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was solid and here I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was nicely done and he fit my image of him from the books, again I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character as well. Liam Hemsworth was terrible as Gale, not totally his fault though, another character with way too much cut from the book, not that I cared too much, I didn't have much time for him throughout the series.A few reviewers, or more than a few compared this to Battle Royale. I can see where they are coming from, but this not comparable, they are not the same. OK fine they both involve teenagers fighting to the death, but that is where the comparison ends for me. Battle Royale is in a class of its own and has a story of it's own, this movie should not be compared to it.I am not a teenager, but I went to see this with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it and thought it was money well spent for 2 hours of entertainment. I would have liked to see it quite a bit longer just to do the book justice, but I can see that when catering to the teenage market movies have to be cut short. Or do they? Hopefully there will be an extended version ala Avatar, which explained so much more than the theatrical cut.7 out of 10 for me, I would have given it an 8 or a 9 if it had kept more of the depth from the book. Looking forward to the next one.",7,3,10,27 March 2012
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A very funny movie with a serious story
","While not really billed as a comedy this movie had me laughing on so many occasions it was hard to realise that it is about such a sad situation.Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are outstanding and Frances really did deserve the Best Actress Oscar. Being a big fan of all three top billed actors made this a very easy choice for a movie to watch and repeated viewings are almost essential.While the story and some situations are heart rending, very sad and in some cases brutal, the subtle comedy still shines though. This would have to be, for me the best movie of 2017 and I will be watching it again and again.",9,4,8,20 May 2018
Grease," Brings Back Memories
","Every time I see this movie it brings back memories of the first time I saw it. It was my first year away from home at boarding school. Most teenagers loved Olivia Newton-John, well I did anyway being a 13 year old Australian.It was probably one or the first movies I saw away from my parents and it has stuck with me ever since and I am by not stretch a fan of musicals at all. In fact I rarely ever watch them, but this one I have seen more than a few times.There are few films that have had such a lasting impact on popular culture and it is one of the few films, that are parodied and remembered as well.John Travolta and Olivia Newton John were in my opinion very good portraying the cool, streetwise 1950's teenagers, although both at the time were well into their late twenties. While neither are the greatest of actors, but they don't need to be. Grease is all about the song and dance.Some of the most memorable songs ever to be put on film are here. 'You're the One that I Want' 'Grease' and 'Summer Nights' are songs that are unbelievably catchy and songs that are known by pretty much everybody from the first line to the last.This movie always makes me smile and at the end of the day that is all that is important to me, I enjoy it each time I see it.",7,3,3,19 June 2018
Twilight," Loved it but had to see it a few more times.
","I have to say I went to this blind with my 12yo daughter and had no idea what I was going to be watching, and I was very tired so I didn't really remember it well the first time round. My daughter had already read the book and she has a habit of telling me what is going to happen next which can be a bit of a pain, but hey, she is 12.We went and saw it again a week later after I had read the book and I have to say it was a very well done adaption of the book. Some changes were made but in the most part it followed the book very closely and that was pleasing. I read the book in just over a day and had trouble putting it down. I have to agree with other reviewers that the actors in this were extremely well suited for the parts.Keep an open mind and be entertained instead of looking for flaws and you will really enjoy this movie.I am an over 40 male so I could not be called a teeny bopper, which the book series is aimed at I believe.I hope that the other 3 books are also made into movies of the quality of this one.I give this one an 8.",8,4,7,5 March 2009
The Hurt Locker," War can be Absolute Hell
","This was not a movie that I really went out of my way to see and while I did notice the hype when it won an Oscar I still didn't try too hard to see it. Having said that The Hurt Locker really is a very good movie. It tells the story of a US Army bomb squad team in Iraq in 2004. The movie is very well acted and overall very good, even to the point of being fantastic. Unfortunately, it was filmed documentary style with hand held cameras. Something I am not fan of at all.Jeremy Renner is Sergeant James, a bomb technician and unlike his easy going predecessor, he is a wild man. He seems not only indifferent to the dangers of his job, he absolutely revels in the dangers. It is the ultimate in thrill seeking behaviour, getting that dopamine surge in his brain. Near the end of the movie, he gets accused of being an adrenaline junkie, but by then we know that the neurochemical at work here is dopamine. Bomb disposal is not just a job for him, it's his passion, his addiction, his reason for being in the Army.
While watching The Hurt Locker, a scene from G.I. Jane comes to mind when Demi Moore's character is questioned about her motivations to continue to struggle through SEAL training. She responds by asking how males in the program answer the same question. The answer being 'Cause I get to blow things up.' In this movie, Jeremy Renner in the role of Sergeant James antes up by placing his very existence into the mix.A movie well worth seeing, but not one I would go back to over and over like I have done with G.I. Jane.",8,1,1,22 June 2018
Logan," Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine what Colin Firth is to Mr Darcy
","I am proud to call Hugh Jackman an Aussie and he does his Wolverine character to perfection. While I haven't seen all of the X-men movies, I have watched almost all of Hugh Jackman's movies. This one is right up there with the best of them.This has all the elements that superhero movie lovers want with a few added bonuses. Unlike other reviewers I am not going to give away any of the plot or gush over all the good bits. All I am going to say is, if you like superhero movies that are realistic and have emotion mixed in, go out and watch this one.",9,5,11,1 May 2017
The Dark Knight," Mind Blowing
","I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now. You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10.",10,3,4,16 May 2017
The World's Fastest Indian," A must see gem
","The rating on here should tell you a lot about whether this is a good movie or not. If you miss it you will regret it.All motorbike fans and fans of any motor sport should love this. Anthony Hopkins' acting range has no bounds, he even surprised me in this little gem.Funny, heartbreaking, a bit rude, riveting, nerve wracking and heartwarming. Ultimately one of the most uplifting movies I have had the pleasure to watch more than once and each time feels like the first time.It really pulls you in and you become invested in the character Anthony Hopkins is portraying. Also loosely based on part of the life of Burt Munro.Highly recommended.",9,2,2,7 June 2018
Avatar," Different Versions Get Different Ratings
","This is one of the few movies that I have actually paid to see in a cinema more than twice, that for me says something about how good I think it is.The first time I saw this move I sat in a row very close to the screen and it was in 3D. It blew me away. This was the cinema release which was 162 minutes long. It felt like 5 minutes and held my attention from start to finish. I came back the next day and sat through it again, this time a little further back and again in 3D. After about a 3 hour break for lunch and other activities I came back to the cinema and watched it again, this time in 2D. All three times the movie was 162 minutes long and each time it felt like no time at all. My immediate rating after each viewing was 8/10.Months later this came out on Blu Ray with the extended cut available at 178 minutes. 16 whole extra minutes added, wow, so cool were my thoughts before watching it. After I had watched the extended cut the first time my immediate rating was 10/10, those 16 minutes for me changed the whole movie and made it so much better.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Wes Studi and CCH Pounder, just a few of the name actors in this masterpiece and they all contribute and add to the experience of a great movie.James Cameron hit the ball out of the park with this one as far as I am concerned. I loved Titanic, but this just goes to the next level. Probably the best movie I have ever had the privilege of watching many many times.This movie has everything, action, romance, drama and comedy. Anyone who did not see the funny moments must not have watched the same movie.If you haven't ever seen this movie yet, get the extended cut copy and view it, avoid any other copy, you will not be disappointed.",10,8,11,4 June 2018
How to Train Your Dragon," Hard to believe this is Animation
","In my opinion the best animation movie I have ever seen and it could easily score 10 out of 10, silly as it sounds I only gave it a 9 so I had wiggle room for the sequel.Jay Baruchel, who has done some decent movies, does the voice of Hiccup to perfection. The whole movie really revolves around Hiccup and Toothless, his young dragon. As one other reviewer stated, Toothless exhibits masses of personality and is like a huge lovable puppy. Being able to display this level of personality without uttering a single word is beyond impressive.The addition of romance, comedy and action galore makes this a movie for all the family as I assume was Dreamworks aim.This is truly a fun movie that has to be seen to be believed.9/10",9,2,3,17 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Didn't Deserve Best Picture, but Still Worth Watching
","With all the quality movies at the Oscars this year this would not have got my vote for best picture, Three Billboards would have been my pick, but even so this was still up there with the good ones.Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins put in very good performances with another fine backup performance from Octavia Spencer, who I have never seen put in a bad performance.I enjoyed watching this more than once and goes on my list of movies to watch again in the future.I will never understand why reviewers on IMDb seem to flock in droves to rubbish movies that are not really that bad, almost like tall poppy syndrome, lets rubbish the winner, most have probably never even watched it, but want to be on the bandwagon.An easy 7/10 for me.",7,4,8,20 May 2018
30 Days of Night," A Good Watch for Vampire Fans
","Surprisingly good, but not a movie that would be considered a classic. However this does stand above a lot of the more mediocre Vampire movies that have been made.It almost entirely relies on atmosphere, the coldness of the nomadic vampires is only matched by the Alaskan wilderness. The story works quite well, especially as there is never really any back story to tell where the vampires actually come from. The ending is quite well done and because it isn't really a happy ending I count it as a plus. Happy endings seem to be the go and having one that is not so happy is a welcome change. The movie is let down by some of the acting, which, if better might have made this a classic.Very much worth a watch if you like Vampire movies.",7,1,1,21 June 2018
Joker," Depressing and HIGHLY OVERRATED
","After watching this movie with my wife we both came away feeling rather depressed and unsatisfied.Joaquin Phoenix is without a doubt a brilliant actor and his performance shone though in this, but other than that it was very much an average movie for me. It just does not live up to the hype and if I was given a choice to see it again I would have no hesitation in declining.Heath Ledger if he was alive today he would not have a worry, he is the true Joker and will always be in my eyes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is the only reason this gets a score higher than a 5.",6,6,22,17 December 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Eternal Hope
","I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10,92,104,15 June 2018
Sully," Brilliant and worth repeated viewings
","After I watched this the first time I gave it 7/10, after the second time 8/10 and after the 5th time I now give it 9/10, probably worth 10/10 for making me feel so good after watching each time.This really is one of the most uplifting movies I have seen in a while and I really do like uplifting movies. I am a male and unashamed to say that the tissues are required ever time I watch this movie.Tom Hanks is just one of those actors who just is the best, add Clint Eastwood's direction and you have a really good movie to watch. All of the actors in this do a fantastic job.Highly recommended if you are feeling down or just want a lift.",9,7,10,9 June 2018
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton is perfect as the perverted Creepazoid
","How can anyone who has seen this movie not like it. Michael Keaton is perfect perverted creepazoid Beetlejuice who lives in the attic of a house along with a heap of other ghosts who have difficulty adjusting to the fact that they are dead. Beetlejuice is one of those characters in film you are either going to love or hate.I've long been a fan of Tim Burton. His movies are almost always weird, but there is almost always something endearing about his work. His films are almost always entertaining, and Beetlejuice is probably one of the more obvious examples.If you really think about it absolutely nothing happens in this movie. For those of you who've seen it, think about it. If you haven't yet seen it, just watch it for Tim Burton's really weird and wonderful imagination. It really is what makes the whole movie. This movie is a big departure for Michael Keaton. I found it really hard to believe he was actually a comic actor, but he is hilarious here and he is another thing that makes it worth watching.Just be aware this movie's story is almost nonexistent.",7,1,1,19 June 2018
