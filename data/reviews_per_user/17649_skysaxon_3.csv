Black Swan," Torture
","I suppose it is Aranofsky's artistic temperament, but this movie is torture to watch. The first half hour goes beyond torture. Portman gives a one-note performance that is difficult to watch. A little variety in tone might have made her character a bit more sympathetic. We're supposed to feel for her. Aranofsky's ineptitude ensures we don't. She is a blank slate, filmed upon a black canvas. The look of the film is that of a rainy day. There is no colour here. Filmed through a bowl of pea soup, the life is drained out of every scene, leaving one robbed of emotional involvement. There is little beauty or elegance. Vincent Cassel, so wonderful in the Mesrine movies, works overtime to pronounce each word, lending to the overreaching artiness of this still life. I suppose the ugliness of the film, the performances, the cinematography are all intended to alienate and cause discomfort in the audience. People love this movie. I guess some of us have a streak of masochism in us. Some of us don't.",5,5,8,19 March 2011
RED," Solid entertainment but only entertainment
","I enjoyed this movie from the first frame to the last. The performances (save for the miscast Pigeon and giveaway phony American accent of Urban) are all superb. Willis has rarely been better. Malkovich, Cox and Mirren show their comic sides with nuance and humor. Most surprising of all is Parker whose self-assured comic timing and warmth enhances the rugged cynicism of the retired CIA agents. Expertly edited, sharply directed, with a tight script, 'Red' has nary a scene or word wasted. Of course, it's all make believe and almost cartoonish but that's what makes this film a delight. Add to this cake of delights a tasteful score with appropriate musical tracks so rarely used in the correct way any longer in modern cinema.This is a fine popcorn movie that won't change you but will entertain and bring a smile to your face.",7,0,0,19 January 2011
The Social Network," Wildly overrated, shot in yellow/green pallor with unlikeable characters
","This movie seems to be the critics' darling of 2010. Yes, it has a brilliant script. That is until the end, when one of the main character's legal staff absolves him of all guilt. Aaron Sorkin, I bet you didn't write that in the script. It was obviously put in later to make Zuckerberg not appear to be as much a monster as the rest of the script paints him to be. It's appropriate a legal person speaks those words because it is nothing more than a device to absolve the filmmakers from any legal recourse the real Mark Zuckerberg might take against them.But that little bit of convenient cheating by the script is nothing compared to the vile yellow/green pallor that envelopes the film. David Fincher hates whites and blues. He refuses to use them. I scratch my head that all these high falootin' critics never mention that this film looks like it was shot on Mars. It looks horrible. My advice when you watch this at home is to remove the color and watch it in black and white. Along with the one-dimensional characters and flat acting (especially from the one-note Eisenberg), what you will get is a decent old-fashioned black and white movie. But not much else. What really hurts is that the yellow/green David Fincher is currently spoiling the gorgeous earthbound whites/blues of Niels Arden Oplev's masterful 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and placing them onto the lifeless surface of Mars.
