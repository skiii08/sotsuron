The Monuments Men," Great topic completely clooneyed
","As often happens with good actors they are terrible as directors - this is another example of it. The mission of saving art during the war deserves a tribute and it could have been as powerful as Schindler's List. There is no need to invent anything, just a loving close to documentary retelling of the true story, assuming that your viewers are not dumb, would suffice. However the opportunity was completely wasted and spoiled by this light-hearted and factually wrong collection of feel-good anecdotes which fall apart as a plot. It's a pity that great cast was wasted. It also has a lot of cold war stereotypes written and often even driving the script, which is impossible to imagine in the actual relations between the allies in 1944-1945.",3,6,7,22 December 2018
To Rome With Love," Allen's irony enjoyable as usual
","This is a lighthearted, enjoyable film full of humor and irony over human condition. Typical Allen in what he always excels. Don't expect from this film great philosophical and existential dramas. People who leave bad reviews either don't get the irony or maybe it resonates with their personal similar experiences. It is a bit like relatives of Antonio writing some of the reviews. The current 6.3 grade undervalues the film, in my opinion it is a firm 7.5. IMDb in general undervalues European-style films. Watch Allen's film, enjoy the walk through Rome, derive moral lessons at your will. This film is on par with his late films (obvious comparison with Midnight in Paris, Magic in the Moonlight and others). Midnight in Paris probably has a bit more depth,just due to the script. This film consists of four stories developed in parallel, with only the city of Rome joining them together.",8,1,3,5 June 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Much ado about nothing
","This film has excellent cast, costumes and decorations. However it has a very weak and unconvincing plot and fails at storytelling. It feels like wandering through and exotic clothing shop or costume ball with carefully chosen grotesque characters. You await to see a great story but you get a banal and predictable plot. So this film is some kind of baroque, decorative piece which is supposed to amuse and entertain but never goes deeper than that.I was also surprised that the picture of a boy with the apple which is the center of the plot was so poorly executed. It is supposed to be a very valuable renaissance-like painting and they hired an artist who worked some months on it. The result looks like a cheap prop for a film, which does not look convincing at all. It is weird since there exist plenty of artists who could produce an excellent classic portrait in just 1-2 weeks.I grade this film at 6/10, so it is not a total waste of time, but you can find better films to watch.",6,1,3,4 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Repetitive
","I've seen a discrepancy between the grade of 8.4 and the mass of bad reviews but still decided to go and watch it. Should have donated to wikipedia instead. Just trust those who tell it feels like a weak remake. There are almost no new ideas here just the same rehash of the good ideas and visually very similar shots from the first two films which becomes now a clich√©. Bad father - good son or vice versa, death star but bigger, scenes in an alien pub, scenes in the desert, scenes in the mountain terrain with snow. Lots of explosions and flying, special effects OK as usual. Very few jokes, one or two good ones. The acting is wooden. All the gender, race issues checked in but with weak acting do not look believable. There is something fishy with the 8.4 grade, even assuming the wave of fans.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Video game clip
","A trash movie which tries to resemble Dune and Metropolis. There is no plot except for a car chase there and back. No acting is needed either. All the good guys survive all the bad guys die. Filmed around beautiful desert landscapes with snapshots carefully planned by graphic designers. Feels like flipping a comics for teenagers or watching someone playing first person shooter or racing video game. As usual on IMDb the current high rating is due to flow of fans of the earlier movies (who would probably be disappointed), comics or games. I wouldn't recommend it to any serious SciFi lover. To fill the needed 10 lines: The only thing that is worth praise is the stunt team, some motorbike shots are excellent. Graphic designers also did their job quite well but their skills could be put to better use.",1,18,37,3 October 2015
