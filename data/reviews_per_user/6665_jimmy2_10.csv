The Incredible Hulk," Not the best film of the summer, but pretty darn close!
","I must say that this film is exactly what a Hulk film should be. It should be a mix of 'The Fugitive' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. The last film wasn't like that at all. Matter of fact, the plot plodded in places, ruining the momentum. None of that here.Having said that, it's still not the best film of the summer. Why? Well, there's not enough emotional investment into the relationship between Bruce and Betty. What's there on film is great, but a bit more back-history would be nice as well. I wonder if that's what Edward Norton was aiming for before Marvel decided to truncate the film. Regardless, I can't wait to see the additional footage in the Blu-ray and DVD version. If that relationship is fleshed out more, it would almost be the perfect Hulk film. As such for the theater release, it's very strong, but more could have been done.There are some very jaw-dropping scenes in this film, but at the same time, this Hulk seems more human somehow, compared to the last film. This Hulk can actually be hurt, and there's real pain that shows on his face, especially when he fights Abomination. This adds a depth of character to this normally one-dimensional portrayal in the other film. I don't recall any particular moment where the Hulk in the other movie was in pain, or even if he bled. Good move by Marvel to make him a more human monster.If anybody was concerned about whether or not this movie is better than the last Hulk film, rest assured that Marvel learned their lesson. The only complaint I have is what I said before; I believe Marvel wanted a film to so totally not be like the other one that they removed a good portion of the pathos from it in order to move things along. However, any complaint about that will have to wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release. I can't wait! Meanwhile, go watch the film and enjoy what's there.",8,3,5,15 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Plot and animation combined into one sumptuous film
","After watching this film, I was amazed.The first thing that grabbed me when the film started was the animation. It's yet another showcase of Blu-ray technology for those who have it. If you have Blu-ray, don't miss out! What rivals the animation is the plot. It's very tight, and is very fast-paced. It respects the kung fu genre and doesn't make a mockery of it. The humour is fast-paced as well, with oodles of laugh-out-loud moments. It's been a while since I laughed so much watching an animated film.The voice acting is high caliber, with Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman having great chemistry together. The other voice acting is very nice as well, with Angelina Jolie adding gravitas to the proceedings as Master Tigress, and even Jackie Chan cast as Master Monkey just shows the respect that the movie has towards the kung fu genre.This film will be regarded as Dreamworks Animation's first real competition for Pixar Studios. Dare I say it surpasses Pixar's current offering WALL-E based on plot structure alone. How this film rates less than WALL-E is beyond me. Are people that blinded towards the Pixar brand?",9,0,1,8 March 2009
About Time," A light and forgettable film.
","There are a number of times while watching this film when I wondered what the point was. When it was finally spelled out to me, then I realized we've reached the end of the film. I find the best films have subtext that isn't spelled out to us or aimed to hit us on the head like a hammer. I find that the latter as a heavy-handed way of portraying a message or emotion, and that's what the powers that be decided this film to be, which is a shame.That's not to say that the acting was awful. I believe the acting was, in a lot of scenes, heartfelt and sincere. That likely has more to do with their strength as actors than the actual script, however, which I thought was rather weak. Bill Nighy channels his Billy Mack character from 'Love, Actually' (by the same director), this time as a father figure. Not much of a stretch for his considerable acting chops, but he manages to sell it nonetheless.The whole affair is light and breezy. Not particularly memorable, which brings me back to my original point about the message being sledgehammered to the head. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that the film-goer would feel the same way I do, and decided to force the message in order to provide some sort of moral that is supposed to bring all this forgetful affair together and therefore make it memorable. The message itself, while commendable, is fairly underwhelming.I had a somewhat pleasant experience watching this film, don't get me wrong. However, I have no desire to see this film again, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see it.",6,15,33,1 November 2013
Spider-Man 3," Too many glaring inconsistencies
","I watched this film a second time this evening, and am just as dismayed by it as when I watched it in the theater. The film starts off great, but just sort of becomes unwieldy towards the end. One can almost tell when the film takes a turn for the worse.The appearance of the ooze didn't seem to make much sense in the context of the film. Okay, I know that it was supposed to create a doppleganger effect with Peter, but at least they could have done it consistently. In the comics, the suit had a mind of its own, and that really wasn't fleshed out here until the suit attaches itself to Eddie Brock. In the movie, it was almost like Peter had a black suit fetish and turned bad because of it, versus the suit exerting its will on the host. This should have been made more clear in the film. It also would have warranted more sympathy for Peter if the film performed this differently. As it is, Peter is just someone pretending to be bad with a suit fetish.This inconsistency among others (the general lack of spider sense throughout the film, for example) is what took me out of the film. I'm not against adding villains if it means that it enhances the drama, but in this case, adding the villains didn't do much but overwhelm the film to the point where it's almost incomprehensible. I find the last hour of the film almost unwatchable because of this.The next Spider-man film will no doubtedly have Marvel Studios in full control. I wish they would do what they did to the Hulk, and pretend the Venom never existed in this one. A Venom reboot, if you will. I truly believe that if you dedicate your movie to just that one character alone as the villain, it will have more dramatic gravitas than all three villains have garnered in this film combined. Make it so, Marvel!",4,0,1,15 May 2008
The Dark Knight," Darker than Burton's?
","I would have to say that Nolan has done something that no other Batman film director could ever do - make a darker film than Tim Burton. Tim's over-the-top circus-like direction, while albeit dark, isn't anywhere near as dark and gritty as this film is.Let's start with the Joker first off. Ledger has outclassed Nicholson in this role. This isn't the prim and proper Joker that Nicholson displayed - this Joker is a force of nature that plays by absolutely no rules except his own twisted moral code. He cares more about chaos and mayhem more than he would ever care about money or fame. He lives off the fear of the populace. Nicholson's obsession with the Batman had more to do with him creating the Joker, versus a twisted and depraved fascination with Batman being the symbol of hope for a doomed city. Turning the Joker into a bona fide terrorist fits today's post-911 world like a glove in terms of creating a visceral reaction within the audience. Nicholson's Joker was more preoccupied with settling personal vendettas than being a terrorist, which means that his Joker isn't near as fascinating.Likewise, Two-Face in this film is more in line with Nicholson's Joker this time around. His existence in this film is purely about personal vendettas, but if there is one complaint I have about this film, is that he's largely overshadowed by the Joker. Again, someone who has personal vendettas unfortunately isn't near as interesting or compelling as someone who's unpredictable and destroys things just for the hell of it. While I do agree that having Harvey Dent in the film was a good idea to move Batman's story along, I would be loathe to say that Two-Face is the star attraction here.All the stars here seem to know what's at stake with this film, so they give it their all. Even with Heath Ledger out of the equation, the performances are fine. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman really do take advantage of their supporting roles in the film, and use the limited screen time they have to make an impact. Christian Bale does another fine job as the freewheeling playboy as well.Lastly, one cannot say enough about the special effects. The effects in this film rival all other superhero films. An IMAX camera was even used for certain scenes, heightening the impact even more.Even if you like the 1989 Batman film, I highly recommend you see this one. It out-Burtons Burton.",9,7,13,2 August 2008
Super 8," A film with an identity crisis
","I saw this film at a screening tonight, and I must say it's the most disjointed film I've seen so far this year.First off, I have no complaints about the actors. In fact, the actors kind of reminded me of what Goonies could possibly look like in the 21st century. Okay, the actors are fine. So far, so good.The movie goes off the rails midway through it; precisely when the alien storyline comes to the fore. While this particular storyline isn't that bad initially, it wears out its welcome in a hurry, especially when it all comes together. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that there isn't much to it.Quite frankly, I think that Abrams' love of Spielberg's previous films has prevented him from actually making this his own film. It could also be because Spielberg produced the film, meaning it would require his stamp of approval in order for the movie to be released. A shame really, because if Abrams did it his way, he would have made a better movie than 'Cloverfield'.Don't expect to have the same wonderment that you get from Spielberg films, however. You can tell those moments were merely tacked-on to fit the 'Spielberg' mould. Anyone who's seen the early 80's Spielberg movies knows what I'm talking about.So, with all that being said, what are we left with? The closest analogy would be a chocolate bar with layered and soft caramel on the outside, but a rough, hard to chew toffee middle. As good as the caramel is, the toffee sure makes it hard to swallow.Wait for it on Netflix or your local video store. You'll thank me later.",7,9,18,8 June 2011
WALL·E," Good, but over-hyped
","If I had the opportunity to, I would have voted this 7.5 out of ten. I don't think this movie deserves an eight, though.The animation on the Blu-ray is simply stunning to say the least. There were times that I could hardly believe I was watching an animated film. As such, I highly recommend anyone who has a Blu-ray player to use this as a demo disk. This alone highlights the merits of the format.Unfortunately, the plot isn't as great as the animation.Andrew Stanton took considerable risk when devising the plot; of that I have no doubt. Boy, wouldn't I want to be the fly on the wall in the Disney corporate office when Andrew was proposing this story to the big wigs. Seeing how much pull Andrew has within Disney itself, it's not too surprising that they gave the green light for this film.The movie starts out well enough. There's just enough going on in Wall-E's hum-drum existence that entertains us for the first twenty minutes. However, I believe the worst part of the movie was the middle portion.I'm sorry, but I as an audience member can't get worked up over some plant. Yes, I understand the significance of it, and how it can wake up mankind from the restful slumber of laziness and complacency, but it still doesn't grab me in the plot department. I found the whole human race subplot rather forgettable in general.No, the plot highlights were the robot interactions with each other. Those were the highlights of the film, but one could get the feeling that you could get just as much enjoyment out of that as watching a short film about them. Speaking of which, the BURN-E short almost outclasses the main film in this regard.So, the bottom line is I don't believe that it deserves credit for the best feature film of 2008, as there are much better-plotted films that were released that year. However, as good as the animation is, I'll reserve judgment until I've seen Kung-Fu Panda, which apparently has animation at least as good as WALL-E, according to what I've read and heard.",7,2,7,8 March 2009
Prometheus," Doesn't quite pass the smell test... fails it abysmally.
","When I saw the trailers for this film, the premise of the film intrigued me, just for the mere fact that the trailers were following the same beats as the Alien film trailer from 1979. The use of music in it was quite amazing; the screams added into the trailer soundtrack were particularly off-putting.The film itself failed to live up to expectations.The reason why 'Alien' worked was not just because of the xenomorph introduced, but the believable way in which the characters interacted with one another. Of particular interest was the class system, where Harry Dean Stanton's and Yaphet Kotto's characters (Brent and Parker respectively) expressed consternation at the management of the ship (Tom Skerritt's Dallas character in particular) because they often dealt with the dirty work the other crewmembers didn't want to do, and often complained about not getting their paycheque. The director's cut of the film highlights this aspect even more, which makes the characters more real and thus more relatable.The same dynamics are hinted at in 'Prometheus', but where this film fails is on the 'believability' factor. Weyland is inadvertently portrayed as an idiot, because there's no possible way he hired the best 'money can buy' for this multi-trillion dollar voyage to nowhere. Or is it merely senility? One of the first characters we're introduced to at the onset is David. David seemingly does his best to portray humanlike behaviour despite the fact that he's an android. However, I have issues with people who say that Michael Fassbender deserves an Oscar for his performance. The character is seemingly random and illogical in his actions. Quite frankly, I found him quite annoying, especially when he was specifically told not to open the gate, but attempts to do so anyway. I didn't find him to be a particularly likable character, or even a good one.Speaking of which, there are no characters that have any redeeming qualities to them whatsoever. Scientists act unscientific; like a character removing his helmet in a foreign alien environment just because there's breathable atmosphere inside. Or probing an alien head without doing proper scientific procedures first, or even wearing proper clothing. Any kid who has taken high school science courses recognizes this. Why doesn't the writer, unless they had to find a way to somehow advance the plot through stupidity? There are many more examples of this type of stupidity, but I won't put them here for brevity purposes.Overall, a highly disappointing film that more often than not enters 'Friday the 13th' territory, which is quite disappointing for a film that purports to be high-minded. And that, fellow filmgoers, is the greatest crime that this film has committed. Rent the film for $2 when it comes out on video, because that's about as much as it's worth.",4,0,0,15 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," X-cellent prequel
","Ladies and gentlemen, I present one of the best films you'll see all year. 'First Class' is, indeed, first class, and returns the X-Men name back to cinematic glory.One of the key ingredients for this movie's success is the emotional resonance that the audience gleans from the characters. The screenwriters, producers, and director seem to fully connect with the X-Men mythos, and while this movie is not 100% true to the events in the comics, the emotional resonance is intact, and that's really what matters most.Another key ingredient is the cast, which is practically devoid of A-list actors. These actors put their best foot forward, even at the risk of being typecast, which in my view, is very honourably. It goes to show how much respect the material is garnered.As an example, Michael Fassbender has to be the most intense actor in recent memory. His performance in Inglourious Basterds only hints at the intensity that he displays in this film. His Erik is at times sympathetic, other times morally reprehensible, but we as an audience fully understand the reasons behind his actions, almost like we can put ourselves in his shoes if we experienced the same trauma he experienced. This creates as close to an Oscar-worthy performance as one can possibly hope to achieve. To not get a nomination would be a crime.James McAvoy's excellent performance as the future Professor Xavier is the other side of the coin to Erik's intensity; he initially represents conformity to the homo sapien ideal rather than homo superior. He uses his gift as more of a means to pick up women rather than more noble and heroic pursuits. It's not until Moira McTaggert enters his life that he acts on those pursuits, even if he's initially compelled by the CIA to do so.Xavier's initial meeting with Mr. Lehnsherr is a life-changing moment; he went from being pacifist to activist after knowing first-hand what Erik went through during the Holocaust. This, in turn, leads to an understanding between the two that develops into a deep friendship that will be tested later in the film.The accompanying cast holds their own; Jennifer Lawrence as Raven makes a complete character metamorphesis from someone who's eager to please in order to conform, to someone who's fully comfortable with who she is. Conformity vs free-will is a component that is examined time and again throughout the film at pivotal moments to great effect.I haven't even touched on the time period when the movie takes place, which has about as much to do with the plot as everything else. Another well thought-out component.I highly recommend this film if you are into the X-Men, or just into really good movies. You will *not* be disappointed.",9,3,7,15 June 2011
Iron Man," A thrill ride tour-de-force
","I was commenting about Spider-man 3 earlier, and this film is almost the antithesis of that. It's lean, slick, smart, and it only has one villain, and a really well-fleshed out one at that! This is what every Marvel film should be like.Robert Downey Jr. puts so much heart and soul into this role that I believe it's one of his best roles since 'Chaplin'. He really nails the character well, and his comic timing is absolutely perfect in this one. He realizes that it's his time to shine, and he uses the opportunity immensely.Gwyneth Paltrow takes one of the more shallow characters in the comic and makes it her own. The chemistry between Stark and Potts is undeniable. She's so much more than a damsel in distress in this one. She plays a pivotal role in the film and is just as important as every other character in it.Jeff Bridges raised my eyebrows when I heard the casting, but he works perfectly within the context of the film. His change in look is drastic enough to easily make him the defacto villain in this film. Having said that, I didn't quite buy into his turn later in the film, but that's just a minor quibble.Terrence Howard knows full well that he will get his opportunity to shine in the sequel, but that's not to say that he phoned in his performance as Jim Rhodes. His concern about Tony will start to become more and more a center point in the story as time goes on, and it seems that Terrence knows he has a role with meat on it to keep him interested for the long haul.The special effects of this film are absolutely amazing, and I didn't feel this way about a man flying since the first Superman way back in 1978. We are taken on a ride with Iron Man, and I must say it's quite exhilarating.I believe that this will be one of the huge Marvel hits of the summer, with the Incredible Hulk showing great promise as well. Marvel Studios is very deserving of each and every dollar spent to see this film, and I believe that the future looks bright for future cross-overs/appearances of other Marvel superheroes in other films. Make Mine Marvel!",9,2,4,16 May 2008
