Mission: Impossible III," Best action movie for immature minds but still good!
","The movie is full of action-suspense-tension-nervousness. It will truly impart the idea of impossibility in achieving a mission. Tom cruise is the best choice in this franchise. He successfully delivers the love and interests towards impossibility in achieving a mission. He superbly performs about thinking 2-3 ways at the same time and taking tensions multidimensionally. This is really praiseworthy performace. Tom is just superb even in climax of the movie where he says 'I love u' before allowing his wife to kill him!. Restless storytelling is needed in this particular movie in order to impart the feeling of rush to the audience. The characterization, story-line, believability will be shadowed by the adrenal rush of the presentation. Definitely not for matured minds. You will need a different perspective to like this movie. If you need relaxation or tired of steadiness, and you want change this is a must and it's also a good choice.
NOTE----Just think once, not all people are selected for such a dangerous mission. Those people with intelligent and restless minds falls under this vicious circle. The makers of the film thought flawlessly about this concept.",7,2,2,17 October 2019
Dangal," Pessimistic representation but .......ðŸ¤”
","The movie is sound from technical sides. Good story,performance, music, direction etc. Few good depictions of events. But it is depicted with restrictions and openness is halted. Moreover its theme and motive is unaesthetic /unenlightening / kind of gloomy and pessimistic. I feel this would work well with the feminist or with the pessimist people.
The movie I feel, is a sports movie which is inspired by real life story of the players. But it doesn't correlate well with the real life characters. Though real events inspired it, it didn't have the catch of realness in its representation.
Well for me it's a movie not meant for all and best suited for special situations only. I would watch it in special occasions where it parallels my gloomy mood.",6,0,0,12 February 2020
Alien vs. Predator," Well executed !!
","Interesting storyline. Between it there are many thrilling-actions and antique related information's. The visuals are mysterious gripping. The storytelling is not restless that is also good. But marked by nil characterisation. This part is replaced by the interesting elements throughout the movie. Theme is thought provoking. Paul Anderson did a good job in creating this type of imaginary movie. Though unreal (unproven yet) the theme is very interesting. Just well executed. This is one of his best movies -the other in the list is Death-Race 1.
AVP deserves inspiration for its creativity.",8,0,0,1 March 2019
Clash of the Titans," Fun and entertaining!
",I think the story makes total sense. Man fighting against God's is similar to man rebellion against religion in modern history. It is analogous to this point. Apart from it the movie will deliver many interesting elements about greek mythology. And that too framed with a good story. Marked by positive theme and great special effects and good casting it's really entertaining. Entertainment lovers must give it a definite watch. Also its watchable with parents.,8,0,0,20 June 2020
3 Idiots," 3 Idiots: Innumerable Errors and Hollow Theme
","Well this is disappointing. The film's a whole major part is fake and based upon fakeness. The story is about three friends 2 of whose lives were heavily influenced by 3rd one. And that's no doubt will be AmirKhan. The film is irritating in matters of its content. I mean all the false understanding are displayed so confidently and that too with standard technical's that people will believe them to be true esp. the young people. I feel this movie should get out of IMDb top 250 list. This movie proves that INDIANS are still yet to be matured in understanding things. If you don't believe me just look at its number of voters.
The movie doesn't inspire education or any related matters. It inspires blindness and loose moral values. Amir Khan is an expert in cheating the world about his identity and he is the hero of the movie!!!!!. Guess about the rest of the movie. His friends were good at first but in meeting Amir they too were influenced by him and turned to loose minds. This type of loose attitude is not good for education and the director is serious about giving the message through them!!.
The comedy is not at all good I mean it's low standard. Low state minds will keep laughing at that. Raj Kumar Hirani disappointed me in making this because it reflects the negative-devilish-immoral aspect of the society. He spent millions of rupees in this for no good reason. I mean if he wanted to display the true Nature of the IDIOTS he would showed the characters in villainous ways or the dangers idiots lead society to. But he misunderstood the right from wrong and he showed just the opposite. There is no truth in this movie. Sometimes negative Characterization is also displayed in the movie and that is also acceptable but it must be shown in right way just like The Godfather, Requim for a dream, Arth, Legend of Bhagat Singh. Etc. They all depict the negative sides of society and still they reflect the truth. I think 3 IDIOTS is a type of fantasy movie but STILL if it is a fantasy one then there must be some type of beauty or aesthetic sense in its storytelling or in its presentation or in the story-line etc but that is 100% absent. 2/10 is for BomanSir who played Viru Sahastrabuddhe.",2,0,6,9 October 2019
The Da Vinci Code," A classic in Christian apocrypha
","It's one of my favorite movie. The movie touched my soul so book adaptation is left out by me. The movie is like an ideal for me. I think about it, watch it whenever I needed to get in touch with western 'mystical- spiritual ' world. This movie just never fails. Well done Mr Ron Howard.The movie has the elements of learning history and analyzing spirituality. This is the best thing that a movie will ever give.
Its story is of course controversial. And in short is about quest for the sacred Holy-Grail . Excellent climax about the truth of Holy Grail.
Serene pace of the movie is impressive. Faith and knowledge are portrayed very well including responses of different characters. The characters are believable. The movie explicitly shows that evil and good also prevails outside the church. This is an important point regarding humanistic approach to religion.
The movie is superb but only a few flaws remained which doesn't really disturb the theme I feel. Many about the life death situation at the beginning that it could been better than that. But it doesn't really matters to the entire themeI would highly recommend this to anyone with Omnist views and of course to those who haven't read the book yet for I have found many negative reviews regarding its adaptations. And by the way if this movie is blasphemy then what about 'The GodFather I'.(Church scene). For anybody in apocryphal interests this is a must watch.",10,0,0,11 February 2019
