Angels & Demons," Adequate & Dull
","You just can't keep a good symbologist down, apparently, no matter how hard the religious ne'er-do-wells try. Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is back to decoding religious symbols in an attempt to save the world, or some aspect of it at the very least. This time he is helping the Vatican decode a plot hatched by the Illuminati against the Catholic Church (timed with the Pope's death) as retribution for the church's mistreatment of the secret society centuries ago. Now they are wreaking their revenge by threatening the lives of four cardinals, and ultimately, blowing up Vatican City with a nifty little stolen gadget called anti- matter and it's up to Langdon to find and solve the clues in a four hour time span. With all due respect to the millions of people who read this book and went nuts for it, there was absolutely nothing about this story that I found interesting. Though I actually really enjoyed reading The Da Vinci Code (and this is the first and last time I'll compare the two novels/movies) and had high hopes for this book, when I tried reading Angels and Demons I couldn't get through the first 30 pages without giving up because I found it to be incredibly boring. I can barely even keep my eyes open reading the synopsis I wrote about the movie and that's my own writing. I didn't buy that they were working urgently (it seemed like an hour was more like a 'movie hour' of about an hour and a half at least) and found the developments and 'twists' so obvious that I entertained myself by pretending I was as smart as Langdon and could figure out the riddles just because the camera pointed out the answer to me. ('Of course it's under the floor – one of the three dozen angels' arrows is pointing right at the spot!') And speaking of predictability, I was once again intellectually offended by a filmmaker forcing several possible villains down my throat in a bid to be suspenseful. Honestly, good writing and direction is all you need, not five people giving furtive sidelong glances like the shifty-eyed dog on The Simpsons.The acting in the film was decent, though certainly not inspired. Tom Hanks always seems very natural in his films, and I was pleased to see one of my favorite contemporary actors, the under-valued Stellan Skarsgard in the film. Once again, however, the female lead (Ayelet Zurer) was completely ineffectual and Ewan McGregor simply chewed scenery without a lot of panache. I also don't know when Armin Mueller-Stahl become completely unintelligible, but I couldn't tell you most of what he said in the film because I couldn't understand a word he said.Having completely bagged on the story and an elderly German actor, I do now have to admit that the movie was actually somewhat easy to watch, if only in an 'I don't feel like I'm completely wasting my time' way, the same way I will watch a Lifetime Movie Network flick to fall asleep. Realizing this sounds fairly negative, one has to look at Ron Howard's films in general: They are always easy to watch but not challenging, and adequate but not exciting. Unless someone is really interested in a subject matter that he covers, I think that his films tend to be the culinary equivalent of a Little Debbie snack cake. They are good when you're hungry, but other things are so much better; yet, you know what you're getting into when you take a bite. I really enjoyed Frost/Nixon after seeing it, but I'm also a history nerd, and the interesting thing about that movie was after seeing all of the other Best Picture nominees of last year, it quickly fell to a definite last place in the running for me. On a definite positive note, however, I can say that, whether the locations were simulated or not, as an art and architecture lover I thought the location shots were great, and my experience was further enhanced by my parents leaning over occasionally to whisper, 'We were there!'I can't completely pan Angels and Demons, but I also don't have a lot of good things to say about it either. The best thing I can truly say about it is that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, which is sometimes all you can ask for in a summer popcorn flick.",5,4,8,23 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A beautiful continuation of the first volume
","What can I say?  I'm a hard-core Tarantino fan and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was just as excellent as I thought it would be.  Vol. 1 was my favorite film of 2003, and I think that Vol. 2 compliments that film beautifully, while having the substance to be a stand-alone film.  The various forms of cinematography that Tarantino employs are just as fun and stunning as Vol. 1, but this time we have a fantastic and hilarious homage to kung fu films of the seventies during The Bride's flashback to her training with Pai Mei, her master.  The cinematography/photography was straight from the old Shaw Bros. films, and the slightest details show that QT is a huge fan, and knows some of the audience may be as well.  I can't say I was less entertained during this film as I was during the first, but I was entertained in a different manner.  The non-stop action is not here, and the gore is significantly lowered, but the story is excellent and has a heart.  Uma Thurman is once again absolutely radiant in this role  the role of The Bride was written for her and partly by her, and she is incredible.  I've never been a fan of hers personally, but I really admired her work in this film.  I gave Kill Bill Vol. 1 a `10' rating on IMDB, and I would give Vol. 2 a `9'.  And together, I would give them a 10.  This was QT's opus, and I'll deal with not having a movie from him for several years if this is the material he will be putting out.--Shelly",9,0,1,19 April 2004
Vertigo," Hitchcock's psychological masterpiece
","Possible spoilers`Vertigo', Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film starring James Stewart and Kim Novak is a psychological thriller in which Scottie Ferguson (Stewart) is a retired detective hired to track the daily activities of Madeleine (Novak), the wife of an old college friend who has been exhibiting some disturbing behavior. The problem lies in that Scottie has the medical condition `Vertigo' due to a recent work recent work accident, so anytime he ascends any kind of height, he gets dizzy and ill.  This doesn't appear to hamper his investigation until a crucial moment in the film, but is present throughout. The situation is further complicated when he falls in love with his subject, and the situation eventually spirals out of control, causing permanent damage to everyone involved.`Vertigo' is said to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, and his most personal film. Judging by the disturbing psychosis of the main characters, this would be a pretty interesting thing to explore.  The film could be construed as slow for the first hour or so because there is a lot of character and story development, which leads to a pretty bang up ending.  James Stewart, as always, is excellent, and he certainly breaks type from his `aw shucks' type of role by portraying a severely flawed `hero', but I have never been a friend of Kim Novak's work or herself personally, so I could see just about anyone else in this role and think it would be fine.I'm not entirely sure why I've always had a soft spot for `Vertigo'.  It is vastly different from all of Hitchcock's other films, and therefore quite different from my personal stable of Hitchcock favorites.  Perhaps it is because the film is so dark, and therefore risky for its time.  It could also be because it IS different from his other work, and therefore it requires embracing.  Regardless of the reason and despite its flaws, `Vertigo' remains a beautifully filmed psychological thriller that is timeless in its themes of obsession and betrayal.  Be sure to pick up a copy of the restored version of the film if you are renting, because the restoration is absolutely gorgeous.--Shelly",8,3,7,1 September 2004
Love and Death," Witty Woody
","Right off the bat, I personally melt with glee whenever someone manages to pay homage to Ingmar Bergman, particularly when it's done irreverently, so there was already one huge 'plus' off the bat for Woody Allen's 1975 comedic masterpiece 'Love and Death'. Boris Grushenko (Allen) is the weakest and most cowardly brother in his Russian family. He falls in love with Sonja (Keaton), his 'twice-removed' cousin who is his intellectual and spiritual equal, but is actually in love with one of Boris' brothers. When Boris is forced to go to war during the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, he still pines for Sonja, who in turn ends up marrying an elderly gentleman who she isn't in love with, but becomes the village tramp by sleeping with most of the men in it. Through an act of serendipity (he hides in a cannon and ends up killing a major figure on the enemy side) Boris becomes a decorated hero and marrying Sonja, whose husband has died. Together, the two plot to assassinate Napoleon in order to rid war from their country.The plot summary sounds fairly straightforward, but of course, being a Woody Allen film, (particularly one of his 1970's films) it was utterly hilarious. It is so hard to describe why Allen's comedy is so endearing and successful, but I know that a big part of it is its intelligence  even when we are experiencing slapstick humor and seemingly lowbrow moments, there is still an enormous amount of cleverness to it. Allen peppers the film with homages to various Bergman films, which seem so arbitrary to anyone that doesn't know their source that it's almost like a delicious inside joke. Keaton and Allen are an amazing on screen couple who have such stunning intellectual chemistry that it kind of seems a shame he had to go through his whole Mia Farrow 'phase' in film-making. (Though 'Hannah and her Sisters' is probably his best film of the 80's) Granted, I am a Woody Allen fan, but I also know when he has made some crap films. Luckily, he didn't make any of those in the 1970's, and 'Love and Death' in particular is one that should definitely be seen. Any film that contains the line, 'Granted, I have a few eccentricities. I won't eat any food that begins with the letter F. Like chicken, for instance' is comedic gold. 8/10 --Shelly",8,0,0,23 March 2005
Requiem for a Dream," A Frenetic, Visually Stunning Addition to Film History
","I have to admit, I have wanted to watch RFAD for a couple of years now. However, I let other people's opinions keep me from seeing it, which is something I don't normally tend to do.  Everyone who has recommended it to me has said, 'You will LOVE this movie, it is so dark and heavy.  It's REALLY dark and REALLY heavy.'  So for a couple of years, I've had it on the back burner but hadn't actually picked it up. RFAD seems to have become a staple on some of the 'pay' movie channels on cable, and on Friday night it was a choice of one of my DVDs, Swingers on HBO or RFAD.  I chose RFAD and was cautiously delighted.I will preface this review by stating that I have not yet seen Aronofsky's first film, 'Pi' so I am uncertain if the visual style in RFAD is his normal M-O, but I was thrilled.  The use of color, vibrant during the character's high points during these months, and sallow during the more prevalent low times was subtle yet stylishly done.  The frenetic cinematography is something that has been used often in the last couple of years and is becoming more and more mainstream, but I believe at this time it wasn't as overused as it is today.  Even if it is not original, it's effect is very heavy on the viewer. The use of drugs was primarily limited to very quick montages (similar to ones done in Snatch) that got the point across without being too graphic. Additionally, the scene with Ellen Burstyn waiting in the doctor's office in the last act of the film was extremely frightening, due in large part to the brilliant camera work and the sound.In regard to sound, I am very picky when it comes to music use in films. Being a product of an MTV generation and having studied video production I am sensitive to when music is appropriately placed in films.  The effective use of techno music in films is rare, Run Lola Run is one of the few films that come to mind, but I can add RFAD to this list.  The score is also extremely haunting; it compliments the action and the characters.Which brings me to the acting.  This movie would have simply been stylish with a decent story without the incredible performances of the four principle players.  Jared Leto was very good as Harry Goldfarb.  He conveyed the struggle between his reality and his drug-enhanced reality very well. I wasn't expecting much from the 'cute guy' in My So Called Life.  And Marlon Wayans.. talk about not expecting much.  I'm not a big fan of comedic films unless they were made before 1960 generally, so I am not well schooled in the Wayans Family.  Marlon Wayans'character was less dimensional than Leto's but sympathetic nonetheless.  I've never been a fan of Jennifer Connelly. I remember sitting through her C-grade films in the 80's and early 90's with boyfriends who would readily admit she was a terrible actress but that she was a goddess because she was beautiful.  Of course, none of these films included a gorgeous male co-star (Frank Whaley? I think not.) so I couldn't dip into that superficial fantasy world that would make those films more endurable.  This movie was definitely a welcome change.  Whereas I was rolling my eyes during her early performance in the film, her acting drew me in to her character and eventually made me both pity and feel repelled by her.And finally, Ellen Burstyn.  This woman is not used enough.  I remember when she was nominated for an Oscar for this role, they showed her clip, then they showed her in the audience and I was literally shocked by both her beauty and the transformation into abject dowdiness in this role.  It is Burstyn's performance in this film that terrified me.  Perhaps it was because we actually see the origins of her addiction from beginning to end. Nevertheless, her performance made me ache.  It made my heart hurt.  I've seen Burstyn in several other films, but based on this film alone I want to see more.  She was amazing.For two days after I watched this movie, I sat back and had to figure out whether I liked this movie or not.   I knew that I liked the technical aspects, and having attended film school that's the first thing I base my opinion on.  During the weekend, the movie was always in the back of my head, but I still was sorting out whether or not I truly liked it.  Then this morning I came to a realization.  I liked this movie in the same light as I liked Schindler's List.  Both movies are brilliantly directed with excellent performances, and they were both extremely thought provoking. However, they are so heavy and compelling that one can't take it out to watch it on a regular basis without climbing into your own Bell Jar.Bottom Line:  A must-see.  Just make sure you don't watch it before you head to work at your gig as a Clown for Hire at little Susie's birthday party.",7,4,7,7 April 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining and fast paced
","Catch Me If You Can, the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is compelling from the stylish opening credits to the very satisfying ending.  I'll be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio  I want to hate the guy, but once in awhile he comes out with a performance like the one in this film and I have to admit that he really is a good actor.  He convincingly portrays Abagnale, a teen who managed to outrun the FBI for years - all the while writing over 4 million dollars in bad checks, posing as an airline co-pilot, a physician and an attorney.  Throughout the film, he is pursued by Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent played by Tom Hanks with whom he develops an interesting relationship. 	 While I admit to enjoying Spielberg's action and effects-driven films, I also enjoy the smaller pictures he produces as well.  This film is a prime example.  I completely forgot this was a Spielberg picture, something I consider to be a great compliment.  When a director doesn't have a defining style, it shows an immense amount of talent, and more importantly, lacks the predictability that we see all too often in Hollywood today, especially in the case of someone with such a storied and lengthy repertoire as Spielberg. Granted, Spielberg had the good fortune to have an excellent script and three fantastic actors (DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken) to work with, but the direction is practically flawless in that there are no slow moments; everything happens for a reason and is integral to the progression of the plot.  It goes without saying that a film that is close to two and a half hours in length can have lulls, or seem to be too long, but I found that I did not consider the length once while viewing it.  Perhaps I've become so jaded after seeing so many movies, but I find that more often than not that I go into a film thinking that it isn't going to be as good as I had heard or expected.  Once again, I've thankfully proven myself wrong with this film.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.--Shelly",8,0,1,5 June 2003
The Ring," A sufficiently scary and disturbing film
","I'd like to preface this review by saying two things:  Firstly, I have not yet seen Ringu, yet I understand that it is superior to the remake, The Ring.  Secondly, part of the reason that I have not seen that film is because just the trailer for Ringu terrified me while watching the DVD of The Ring.It took me a long time to see The Ring.  I am notoriously a lightweight when it comes to horror films, a trait that still baffles me as I was a horror film junkie when I was in my teen years.  Having heard the premise of the film, I was intrigued - I thought it was an interesting idea, an urban legend in the making.  However, finding someone to watch this film with me proved an impossible task - they had either seen it and were freaked out enough by it to wait awhile, or they were so offended by it's very audacity to try to compare itself with the original.  But, see it I finally did, and I'm glad that I did.From the start, Gore Verbinski directs the film with immense style.  The cinematography is the visual embodiment of despondency, and it works.  The atmosphere is incredibly dreary (you never see the sun shining, and rain is the forecast for much of the film) but it *should* be as such.  These elements, added to some incredibly disturbing imagery made me feel like I was in a dentist's chair waiting to have a tooth pulled:  The tension was palpable.**Spoiler Within**This is not a `fun' horror film to watch, however.  Perhaps if I had watched it in the theater it would have been different, but I remember seeing House of 1000 Corpses and having a great time because the audience was getting into it.  This was a horror film that kept me at rapt attention, and I didn't laugh once, even nervously.  It did, however hold surprises for me: There were not a lot of `BOO!' type scary scenes, I can actually only think of two where I jumped, rather the imagery itself was extremely disturbing. The actual `video' is comprised of several frightening images with jump cuts that at first made me harkens back to my student film days, but became more disturbing as I thought about said images.  Additionally, the movie was a surprise to me in that it wasn't just a horror film; it actually could be deemed a mystery/suspense film as well - with life and death depending on its resolution.  It also contains one of the scariest sequences I have ever seen, when Samara is crawling out of the well and out of the television. This was the second time I saw the film, and I was just as scared during this part, if not more. There are few people I have encountered who saw the film who did not acknowledge that this scared them, just a little.The Ring is far from a perfect film.  The acting is wooden, the characters have no substance and I'm getting a little tired of the cliché creepy kid with a `sixth sense'.  It also had a pretty weak ending.  However having said that, I feel that some of the most common complaints regarding The Ring are a bit unfair, and most of those complaints are those that say that Ringu is the better movie.  My thoughts on this?  Then watch Ringu.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with remaking a film that has been recently produced.  It is obviously a good story that Hollywood deemed worthy to put their own spin on, like it or not.  I can't make my own comparisons until I have seen Ringu myself, and I won't deny that I relish in the fact that foreign films are more liberal with `unhappy endings' than Hollywood films, but I feel that The Ring was a decent film on its own merits.  If anything, Ringu loyalists should be delighted that The Ring gave Ringu so much press that it is now available to buy or rent just about anywhere.  I heard rumor that a sequel to The Ring is in the works, and if it does half as well as Ringu 2 and Ringu 3 did in Japan I think we are looking at a franchise here. Hopefully it won't follow in the tradition of most franchises and sacrifice quality for quantity.",7,0,0,13 July 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A perfect action/adventure film
","The last time I saw this film was about twenty years ago when my Dad and I went to see it about four times in the theater.  When it came to the local classic movie theater it was a must-see for a friend and I, and I was completely delighted with how it translated into my relatively `adult' life. I use the term `adult' loosely for many reasons, but primarily because while sitting in that dark theater watching this movie, I was suddenly 10 years old again.  The outrageous action sequences, the wry comments by Indiana Jones that were probably lost on me when I was a child and the interesting comparisons between what I thought was terrifying as a child and the reality of its present impact on me was very fun to experience.  (I remember almost losing control of my bowels at the end of the film when I was a kid.)
Another thing I realized after watching this movie was that Spielberg cannot write or direct proper roles for women in his films.  Karen Allen was almost (but not quite) as irritating as Kate Capshaw was in the second (and vastly inferior) installment.  The only allowance I can give is that the film in itself is so over the top that perhaps the whiny damsel in distress is appropriate, but that's about the most positive spin I can put on that element.  I'm definitely looking forward to the Indiana Jones trilogy being released on DVD so that I can hopefully gain a little more insight into the production of the films, although perhaps the reality is that it's best to leave the films alone and let them stand on their own merit as fun, action packed films.  --Shelly",8,0,0,22 September 2003
Finding Neverland," Okay, I'll admit it  I got sucked in
","Never having been a fan of 'Peter Pan' and therefore ambivalent to J.M. Barrie himself, I wasn't in a big hurry to see 'Finding Neverland' despite the many accolades it received. However, since it showed up on the IMDb Top 250 list and as a Best Picture nominee I figured I'd better check it out.To my surprise, I found the film to be extremely beautiful and charming. 'Finding Neverland' chronicles the creation of Barrie's play 'Peter Pan' and its profound effect on the lives of the people in Barrie's life as well as theatergoers in England. Barrie, (Depp) a mediocre playwright who is not able to reach his audience and is therefore beginning to bankrupt his faithful producer Charles Frohman (Hoffman), is writing one day in the park when he happens upon the Llewelyn Davies family. Sylvia (Winslet), the mother (and a young widow) is trying to corral her four young boys and when they run into Barrie they immediately become friends. Barrie begins to spend increasingly more time with the family, much to the chagrin of his wife Mary and Sylvia's mother Emma (Christie). It becomes clear that the Barries' marriage has been slowly falling apart for some time now, but because of their time apart and his obvious adoration of the Llewelyn Davies family, the deterioration becomes more rapid. Emma, on the other hand, is the typical overbearing mother who disapproves of Barrie, mainly because he is ruining Sylvia's chances of 'landing' another man. When a crisis strikes the Llewelyn Davies family, Barrie grows closer to Peter, the second youngest son, who is still grieving the loss of his own father, and the loss of his imagination; something that Barrie tries to help him through.The only other Marc Forster film I had seen prior to 'Finding Neverland' was 'Monsters Ball', a film that I really didn't like, but more for its actors and story than for the production of the film. I was therefore intrigued by what his treatment of this film, a completely different subject matter, would be. I found this film completely and utterly aesthetically beautiful. Even before the 'Peter Pan' and Neverland scenes, I was struck by the gorgeous Victorian sets and costumes, and the interesting way that Barrie's imagination was expressed. (Opening up his bedroom door and seemingly walking into a green meadow is just one of the many examples) The Neverland scenes were simply stunning, so much so that they were profoundly emotional. I particularly loved a scene when 'Peter Pan' was premiering, and orphans that had been invited by Barrie to watch the performance experienced it for the first time  I can't stand children, but the looks on their faces and the reactions of the aristocratic members of the audience to the children was so very touching. There were things about the film that I did not care for regarding the film of course; without giving a lot away, I thought that there were a few moments of easy resolution (particularly involving Barrie and his wife) and I think that the relationship that Barrie had with Sylvia was a bit TOO subtle, because when he discloses his feelings for her I remember thinking, 'Oh. Really?' Obviously there was great affection, but not to the extent that was realized. I also noticed that the alleged pedophilia was obviously not addressed; something that I expected but was hoping wouldn't be glossed over.I've come to expect top-notch performances by Johnny Depp at this point, and he absolutely did not disappoint in his portrayal of Barrie. He was utterly charming, and without the use of makeup or Tim Burton, really became somebody else that was not recognizable as 'Johnny Depp playing (fill in the blank)'. I'm not a huge fan of Winslet, though I do recognize her acting ability, and I thought she was very good in this film. Certain actresses do period pieces well, and she is definitely one of them. She was entirely believable as the mother of the boys and exuded warmth and protectiveness, yet showed that she is still young and can horse around with her sons and Barrie because she enjoys it.I was kind of expecting that I would feel this film took the place of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' as a Best Picture nominee, but after experiencing the film I feel it is very deserving of its nomination. Those who know me will probably be shocked that I enjoyed this film so much because I normally have no interest in cute sentimentality (and furthermore, children) in film, but because Forster created such a beautiful film, I have to give it a solid 7/10.--Shelly",7,2,2,23 February 2005
Chinatown," Great noir
","I've often said that if I had the use of a time machine that probably the first place I would go would be California in the 1970's, when filmmakers like Polanski, Altman, Spielberg and even George Lucas were in full swing in their crafts. The 1970's was possibly the last fantastic decade of cinema, where the films were adventurous and the directors were iconoclastic. One of the most revered and famous films from this great decade is Roman Polanski's 1974 crime thriller 'Chinatown'.Set in the 1930's, 'Chinatown' stars Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, a private detective who with two associates, seems to specialize mostly in adultery cases. When a woman comes into his offices and introduces herself as Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray, he initially turns down her request to tail her husband. He finally gives in, however, and begins to look into Mulwray's deal. It turns out that he is the chief engineer of the water department, and times are tough right now because of a drought. Jake is confused when he sees Mulwray looking at several parcels of land, but finally meets his objective when he is able to photograph Mulwray with another woman. When the story breaks that Mulwray (currently a controversial figure because he refuses to build an unsafe structure that the public at large thinks is a good idea) is stepping out on his wife, Jake gets a visit from Evelyn Mulwray threatening to sue. Except this Mrs. Mulwray (Dunaway) is completely different, and is the 'real Mrs. Mulwray'. When Mr. Mulwray turns up dead shortly thereafter, Jake finds himself in the middle of several mysteries, all which seem to point toward the direction of Evelyn and her father, one of the city's richest and most corrupt businessmen, Noah Cross. (John Huston) The greatest element of 'Chinatown' is in my opinion, also something that could serve as a deterrent to some. I really liked the slow, drawn out plot. Polanski and Towne did not seem to have a problem taking their time with the pacing on the film, something that I personally found to be refreshing. Instead of rushing to the conclusion, or having fantastic fillers, it is clear how comfortable Polanski is with the material and his actors in that he takes as much time as needed to provide pertinent backgrounds and details. The decision to remove Nicholson's narration and simply have the audience discovering all of the clues along with him was brilliant. Though narration can be a very effective tool, unfortunately it is a device that was done to perfection in the 1940's (and some of the films of the 50's) and emulators don't always do the best job with it. Anyone who is looking for flash and rapid-fire cuts are not going to get that with this film. What one gets is a bright and colorful California setting, where some scenes look like Hockney paintings if they were set in the 1930's. It is hard to describe how lush the cinematography is, but if I had to put it into words, non-sensically I would compare it to butter; that everything looks velvety and soft. Only at night does the scenery turn sharp and slightly harsh.The acting in 'Chinatown' was as good as I expected, and that is to say superior. Nicholson, one of the greatest actors of the past four decades, put together a low key, almost introspective performance as Gittes. Though he is indeed mischievous (how could he not be with those eyebrows and that grin, used to full effect in this film) Nicholson seems to temper his normally explosive style. Faye Dunaway, an incredibly talented actress, who, even if she hadn't played her in an infamous film, evokes the memory of Joan Crawford before she started doing her weird films in the 1950's & 1960's, was the perfect counterpart to Gittes. At times icy enough that you would expect her to spit cubes, and other times violently passionate, she shows some of her best work in this film and is achingly gorgeous to boot. The third main figure is probably the best because his performance was most surprising, and that was John Huston's. He not only directed one of the greatest early noir films ('The Maltese Falcon') and is one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, but he really puts in a dark and gritty performance as Noah Cross; and he's REALLY convincing. I was absolutely delighted in the choice to cast him, because while there are admittedly a lot of actors who could have done this role, it was still really cool to see Huston do it.All of this is not to say that I adored 'Chinatown'. Frankly, I thought it was a good movie, but probably in the same way that people scratch their head at why 'Citizen Kane' is often called the best film of all time, I kind of did the same in terms of why say, Entertainment Weekly would name it the #4 film of all time. However, even though I definitely liked it, despite not loving it, I can see its importance in film history and I can really appreciate the technical aspects that made up the film. That is why I have no problem rating it a 7/10.--Shelly",7,3,7,8 August 2005
The Big Lebowski," A Hilarious Offering From the Coen Brothers
","There are very few comedies made after 1960 that can make me chuckle, much less laugh out loud but The Big Lebowski is one of them.  While I've owned the DVD and have seen this film many times I was able to catch a midnight showing last week at a local art house theater, and it was a hilarious experience.  The high hilarity was enhanced by the crowd literally chanting the lines (or that could have been the White Russians we all drank were flowing as freely as water), and the audience's obvious appreciation for this clever film.While the Coen Brothers deserve a lot of the credit for the direction and the brilliant script, a special mention should be made regarding the performances.  I would say that Jeff Bridges completely breaks from his `regular guy' type roles, but Lebowski *is* a regular guy, if you are a pot smoking, unambitious shlub.  Both Bridges and John Goodman turn out performances that are so colorful and hilarious that their mere presence on the screen sparks laughter.  The always fantastic Steve Buscemi also joins Goodman as a Coen Brothers repeat performer, and carries on the typical `Buscemi Coen Brother Character fate'.  This is a hilarious, surreal and brilliant film that should not be missed, especially if you are a fan of the Coen Brothers' work.  It has been criticized by die hard fans and others for not falling into their typical genre, but all of the elements are the same, and while for me choosing a favorite Coen Brothers film is like choosing which child is one's favorite (it can't be done!) this is definitely one that I can watch repeatedly and not have it lose any of it's charm.--Shelly",9,1,2,8 August 2003
Fight Club," Visually Stunning
","Being a certain kind of film geek, I don't follow actors and actresses' films as much as I am a Director Groupie, and David Fincher is one of those directors whose films I will always watch, sight unseen.  One of the reasons for this (from me) high form of esteem is the film `Fight Club'.  There has been so much written about this extraordinary film, that I'm not going to go into anything specific about it, certainly not the `message', or the great acting by Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, or the brilliant screenplay.  What I am going to vehemently aver is that `Fight Club' is one of the most visually stunning films produced in the last two decades.  Fincher displays top visual form in this film and creates such brilliant and disturbing eye candy that it is almost impossible to absorb in one sitting.  There are many individual scenes (for one, the entire first 15 minutes) that are so great that I will just grab the DVD and pop it in to the player to sit and watch for a bit, trying to see what I've possibly missed the last twenty times I've seen the film in the last five years.  Like the time I saw `Gladiator' and got quite upset over some of the in your face, non-cartoonish violence and a friend of mine chided me with, `Um the name of the film is Gladiator', what did you expect?', `Fight Club' is a violent, disturbing film  the title, after all, is `Fight Club'.  However, disturbing and violent never looked so cool. Until Quentin gave us `Kill Bill'.  Fincher's slick video direction past is glaringly resplendent in `Fight Club', and while I don't recommend it to all, I recommend it to those who don't look for a structured film.  However, above all recommendations, I recommend that you read the book by Chuck Palahniuk first  it is a definite enhancement to the film viewing experience.--Shelly",9,1,3,21 July 2004
Citizen Kane," The greatest film of all time - for many reasons
","`Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time'.  How many times has anyone who watches films or follows films heard that phrase?  The question is, do people who actually tout this oft-repeated phrase actually believe it?  Or have they ever even seen the film?  Arguably, there have been some truly great films that have been released since Citizen Kane, in fact, most of the `great films' have been released since Citizen Kane, but there are many factors that support the assertions that A) Citizen Kane is indeed the greatest film of all time, and B) Citizen Kane is uncontested as my favorite film of all time.Citizen Kane is of course, the story of Charles Foster Kane told through the eyes of those who loved him, hated him and idolized him.  It is also a famously thinly-veiled telling of the life of William Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate.  Welles, at 25 and already being touted as a genius, had enough of an ego to tackle this subject.  Unfortunately for Welles, and his ego, Hearst was still very much alive and very much in control of various media outlets, movie studios and their executives, all of which demolished the film's release and hype.  It wasn't until decades later when people realized the incredible visionary aspect and technical genius of the film.
Citizen Kane was released in 1941  the same year as such films as The Little Foxes, Suspicion and Sergeant York  all three great films, all three big competitions for Kane.  And actually, `How Green Was My Valley' won. But what Kane had that these films did not, was passion.  Technical mastery. Ground breaking camera work and blocking techniques that paved the way for the way films would be made, even today.  Thought-provoking symbolism, and defiance.  Welles knew that he had a time bomb  he was warned by industry insiders, friends, maybe even Hearst himself.  But whether it was ego or feelings of entitlement for his own work (or, most likely, a combination of both) the film that he poured his entire life into remains the standard that films made 60 years later with remarkable technology are held against.  One looks at the deep focus and isn't fazed because it is now standard.  Welles created that.  The camera angles, the symbolism that is so creatively used, (watch for faces that become shaded and draw your conclusions as to why that is) the blocking that tells a story without actually saying, `This is what we are trying to convey here'.  (Out of about twenty scenes where this occurs, you can specifically invoke the `breakfast table' scene between Kane and his first wife, or the scene between Kane and Davies where the shouting is almost irritating, but is executed to provide a demonstration of the vastness, grandeur and loneliness.Some friends and I recently decided to start an informal `Movie Club' and for the inaugural night, I wanted to screen my favorite movie of all time, `Citizen Kane'.  We discussed why that is a dangerous statement, and why calling Kane the `greatest of all time' could be construed as intellectual irresponsibility considering the stories that have been told since Kane in 1941, and the technology that has been invented since Kane graced the big screen for the first time.  I agree that the point can be argued.  Someone can argue with me that George Lucas, director of that `other' groundbreaking film(s) is improving upon the original with his extended versions.  Yes, you can argue with me, but you will not change my opinion, and in that same vein, I will never find a film that has affected me more than Kane has.  It is for that reason alone that films that I have seen since compete for slots #2  Infinity.  Citizen Kane's historical importance and innovative technique give it an automatic pass to #1  the beauty, the story, and the acting are just wonderful extras that truly make this film the `Greatest of all time'.  --Shelly",10,7,12,11 February 2004
Monster," Mediocre, but a decent acting job by Theron
","'Monster', written and directed by Patty Jenkins is based on the true-life events surrounding the life of Aileen Wuornos, (Charlize Theron) deemed the United States' first serial killer. The film briefly shows her childhood and adolescence, but soon focuses on her adult life, when she became a small-time homeless prostitute. One night she makes her way into a gay bar for a beer and meets Selby, (Christina Ricci) a young, insecure lesbian who spends the night buying Aileen drinks, which begins an intense, dysfunctional and passionate relationship that ends in the murder of seven men and the death of Wuornos in the electric chair.Theron is really quite good in 'Monster'. In addition to her highly publicized transformation from a gorgeous woman to a fairly ugly one, her acting chops are quite significant. Ricci, who started as such a cute and precocious actress decades ago, is just okay in her role as the naïve and whiny Selby; her performance is nothing better or worse than anything she's done in the last fifteen years. Removing the performances, 'Monster' is just an okay film that leans dangerously toward provoking a feeling of sympathy for Wuornos, a character that really isn't very sympathetic. Therefore, because of this slight bias, I was instantly ambivalent to the film as a whole. Other than this, there isn't anything seriously wrong with the film; it's just 'okay.' 'Monster' certainly wasn't a waste of my time, but by the same token, it's not a film I would seek out again any time soon, nor would I recommend it with any real enthusiasm. 5/10Shelly",5,2,5,6 November 2004
Memento," Innovative, thrilling and brilliant
","-Possible spoilers-I will admit to having seen Memento several times before, but every time I see this film (this time with my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it) I find yet another thing I didn't `catch' upon previous viewings.  Memento is about Leonard, a man on the hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife, only he has a pretty big wrench thrown into the whole plan  he has no short-term memory because of injuries he sustained during the attack.  He may talk to someone and then two minutes later still be standing there, but have no idea who he's talking to anymore, so he employs the use of Polaroid pictures, body tattoos with clues, and many notes.  The story is compelling in itself, but the way it is told is fantastically brilliant.  Instead of a regular linear story that has a start and a beginning, Memento is essentially told backwards.  While the obvious thought would be that knowing a film's conclusion five minutes into the film would be anti-climatic, the screenplay and film are so well done that this only makes the film more suspenseful and thought-provoking, and of course, puts the viewer in a similar mental situation as Leonard themselves.There are absolutely not enough good things to say about this film  even the acting is top-notch.  Memento was Nolan's breakthrough film, and it really showcases his incredible talent.  Shortly after seeing Memento, I watched `Following' his debut film, and was not disappointed.  While I haven't yet seen `Insomnia' (which is on my short list to watch in the near future) I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his vision for the next Batman film because I think he is one of the very few filmmakers who could possibly compete with Burton's two installments.  Most have seen Memento already, but if you haven't yet, take two hours, don't allow interruptions, and enjoy.--Shelly",9,0,2,24 May 2004
Shaun of the Dead," A comedy you can take a bite out of
","'Shaun of the Dead', directed by Edgar Wright presents us the tale of Shaun (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the script) who is an Average Joe, living in London who has your normal, run of the mill problems. He has an unsatisfying job, girlfriend troubles, no one gets along with his best friend Ed (the hilarious Nick Frost) and zombies are hunting him. He not only has to try to survive the day being surrounded by them, but has to protect his friends and some of his family while trying to defeat the living dead. For a guy who is very content to live his life in a rut, this proves to be quite a challenge.Luckily the jokes in 'Shaun of the Dead' are a hell of a lot funnier than my summary line for this review. I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard and so much at a film that didn't have anything to do with the Coen brothers. Not only is the humor in 'Shaun of the Dead' about as dark as it gets, but there are such witty moments that I was left shaking my head at the brilliance of the script. There are several moments where the humor is subtle, yet uproariously funny. A good example is when Shaun wakes up the morning the zombies have taken over, and, incredibly hung over, walks in a daze to the corner convenience store, he doesn't notice that there are huge bloody hand prints on the cooler door then suddenly slips on something the audience doesn't see, but assumes is some kind of blood or gore. This could have gone two other ways  either he wouldn't slip at all, or we would see what he slips on, but the way it was presented made it one of the many times I found myself crying from laughing so hard. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are also absolutely brilliant as best friends and our main protagonists. Their fantastic and natural acting, coupled with the 'real' feel of the dialogue made for some truly standout performances. I am not familiar with either actor, but if they are not already stars, this is surely their breakout film.The only criticism I have of the film is something that I may have even missed with all of my laughter  I have no idea why there was this sudden plague of the living dead. For a film as entertaining as this one, however, that kind of explanation is something that really isn't necessary; something that I am normally a stickler for. There were also some unexpected poignant moments that seemed out of place, but none of these criticisms diminished the overall effect the film had on me. I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that it is disappointing to say that this is not a film for everyone. Make no mistake, 'Shaun of the Dead' is at times extremely violent and quite gory, and it's blackest of black humor is not going to appeal to many, but if you want to see a brilliant comedy that is going to make you cringe while making you laugh out loud, this is your movie. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.--Shelly",9,2,5,27 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A decent action/adventure film that has a secret weapon
","I have never been to Disneyworld or Disneyland so going into this film I had no idea what this movie based on an amusement ride was going to be about except for the fact that it was going to have pirates in it.  And lots of them.  After seeing this film, I still have no idea what the correlations between the ride and the movie are, but I did come to one solid conclusion: Johnny Depp is an unbelievable actor.Without Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow, this film probably would have still done very well.  It's a fun, reasonably well-done swashbuckling film that has a `cute' lead actor (Orlando Bloom), a `cute' lead actress (Keira Knightly) and Geoffrey Rush, a very good actor (who has unfortunately made some, shall we say, `interesting' career choices in the last few years) as the main villain.  Plus we have a lot of sword fighting, perilous moments and an undead monkey  all elements that will bring the kids in droves to the multiplex.  Myself, I had no interest in seeing it really  mainly because I figured I would either A) embarrass myself by laughing at the pirate-speak, which never fails to set me off, or B) engage in said pirate-speak myself, thereby embarrassing both myself and whoever was unlucky enough to drag me to see the film in the first place. 
I could not ignore the buzz surrounding Johnny Depp's performance however, which ultimately is what got me into the theater in the first place.  He is *so* incredible as Jack Sparrow that even a subtle facial expression or use of body language was enough to make me laugh out loud.  I have long respected his career since he eschewed the mainstream `hunk' roles that he seemed to be genetically predisposed to doing after his stint on 21 Jump Street in favor of more avant garde fare, but this particular performance solidified my opinion that he is one of the best actors we have in the industry right now.  I remember hearing that he had taken this role last year and was disappointed that he seemed to be jumping from his independent/obscure film repertoire in favor of commercialism, but his inspired performance will without a doubt get me into the theater to see the sequel(s).  In terms of the direction, I had absolutely no problem with Gore Verbinski's approach.  I found it to be atmospheric and evenly paced, and the special effects were impressive as well.  Conclusively, a good movie  with Johnny Depp, a great movie.--Shelly",6,0,1,19 October 2003
12 Angry Men," Effective and gripping
","It takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times, or at the very least, knows the outcome of the story. Sidney Lumet's 1957 film '12 Angry Men' fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when I watched it again last night, I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film.The story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. The boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by Henry Fonda. At first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. Because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man.The brilliance of '12 Angry Men' can be explained in three parts. First time director Sidney Lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. The setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the United States. But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension: He makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. He also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort.Secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. Not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. There is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly 'sees the light'  every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. In other words, no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort.Finally, '12 Angry Men' features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Henry Fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. He doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say 'I don't know.' His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. The antithesis of Fonda's character is Lee J. Cobb's juror. He is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors.There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film '12 Angry Men', a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list (I believe it was #20 the last time I looked), which is extremely encouraging to me. When the movie going public is rating films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy over films like 'Seven Samurai' and 'Citizen Kane', it is great to see that a 'small' movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition. '12 Angry Men' definitely holds a place on my short list of 'Films I Think Everyone Should See' because I think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice, not from a lawmakers standpoint, but from the perspective of public in general. 9/10 --Shelly",9,0,1,23 May 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," A good conversation piece
","Jim Jarmusch, one of the most innovative directors of the late 20th century, brings us 'Coffee and Cigarettes', another addition to his long line of minimalist comedies/dramas that include 'Dead Man', 'Ghost Dog' and 'Mystery Train'. 'Coffee and Cigarettes', a film 17 years in the making, is broken down into 5-7 minute short stories that involve both iconic and eclectic musicians and actors having conversations over cups of coffee while smoking cigarettes. The only static factors throughout these segments are the cigarettes, the coffee (though in a couple of cases, it is tea), and a checkered tablecloth/table top. The conversations in each segment are as random and eccentric as some of the stars having them. In one segment, RZA and GZA are having tea in a diner when their waiter turns up and it's Bill Murray. Only, it's actually Bill Murray, and it is completely unexplained as to why he would be waiting on them. Meg and Jack White appear in another, with Jack showing off his Tesla Coil to Meg, only to be bested by her in scientific knowledge. In my personal favorite segment, Cate Blanchett plays herself while having a conversation with her slightly trashy, certainly envious cousin Shelly (also played by Blanchett).Filmed in gorgeous black and white, Jarmusch filmed these vignettes over the last 17 years, beginning with the opening scene between Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni in 1987. Some segments work better than others (a couple of them were merely aesthetically interesting as opposed to intellectually compelling) but overall, the film really is quite good. It is probably a hard sell to a mainstream audience because nothing really 'happens', but this dialogue-driven film is so intelligent and at times so hilarious that there wasn't an occasion where I was concerned about the pacing. I wish that Jarmusch made films with more frequency than he does, but if the time he spends on the production of a film is a factor, then I'll look forward to films like this sometime in the next ten years. 7/10 --Shelly",7,2,4,20 December 2004
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first Spiderman, but still fairly unimpressive
","Spiderman is back and he's kicking butt. Unfortunately, his alter-ego Peter Parker (Maguire) is having a hard time multi-tasking and everything in his life is suffering. He is failing in college, he can't hold down a job, his aunt is losing her house, and (seemingly most important to Peter) while he's Spiderman he can't romance Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). To make matters worse, Harry Osborn, (Franco) Parker's best friend, keeps harassing Peter to tell him where he can find Spiderman so he can avenge his father. When Parker's school career comes down to a paper that he is writing on Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), Parker is delighted when Osborn offers to introduce the two, since his company is funding Octavius' research. The two strike up a repoire, but unfortunately, the next day an experiment in fusion goes horribly wrong and Octavius ends up with four metal limbs with minds of their own fused to his spine. Because he has lost everything, (including his mind) Octavius (now known as Doc Ock) goes on a mission to redo the experiment, wreaking havoc on the city along the way. Meanwhile, Parker has decided to give up his double life so that he can concentrate on his life, so he has to make some tough decisions about his future, and the future of Spiderman.When I saw the first 'Spiderman', I was entertained but I wasn't amazed. I found the effects to be too cartoonish, and the story to be pretty lacking. In the case of 'Spiderman 2' I found the story to be better and more compelling (the amount of conflict that arose was decent) and the special effects were definitely better, but again, I was less than amazed. I certainly didn't see the need for it to be on the IMDb Top 250 list, and it doesn't surprise me that it has fallen off, but from the reviews (both professional and from friends) I read and heard I expected a lot more. The acting was about on par with most action films; meaning it was okay but not great. (Although I still can't stand Kirsten Dunst.) Unfortunately, the best actor in the film was woefully underused, which was a disappointment mainly because he was the villain. Alfred Molina is a fantastic character actor and I think that he could have really made the role of Doc Ock great if he had only been given a sufficient amount of screen time. He didn't get to chew the scenery as much as Dafoe did in the first 'Spiderman' film, and I think the movie suffered for it.While the story was better this time around, and the special effects didn't make me cringe at times, I'm still unimpressed by this franchise. Considering I'm a fan of Raimi's other work, and I used to read Spiderman in comic form I think I should be a little more excited with the film than I am. It gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",5,1,3,23 February 2005
The Fifth Element," From the mind of a teenager
","About 250 years in the future, ex-soldier Korben Dallas (Willis) is working as a taxi driver when a woman comes crashing through his roof. It turns out that this woman, Leeloo (Jovovich) is actually the Fifth Element, a supreme being who, when joined with four ancient sacred stones representing wind, fire, water and earth, can fight evil. Which is lucky, since Evil is coming their way in the form of a big pulsating planet, assisted by the impossibly rich tycoon Zorg (Oldman), who is trying to locate the four stones so that Evil can prevail. After teaming up with a priest named Father Vito Cornelius (Holm) to find the stones, they travel to another planet on behalf of the Federation of the United States, where they meet up with various alien life forms who want to help or harm them, and their most frightening encounter of all, radio DJ Ruby Rhod. (Tucker)Truthfully, I am conflicted when it comes to my ultimate outlook on this film. Visually, it was completely captivating. The set designs, (layers of air traffic in the streets of New York, going up hundreds of stories, a floating Central Park) the costumes (Gaultier, with his usual S&M-looking couture) and the colorful hair and makeup were fantastic. A lot of the contraptions (a mask that instantly does your makeup, a cigarette machine that dispenses cigarettes with increasingly longer filters for those who are trying to quit smoking) were clever and entertaining, and the overall style of the film was impressive. There were certainly some things that were really odd to me that don't really warrant explanation, I still scratched my head about, (like what was the deal with Gary Oldman sounding exactly like Billy Bob Thornton>) but ultimately chalked up to eccentricity.There wasn't even anything universally wrong with the script; I thought that it was a very basic, but fun story, and I liked the fact that notorious badass Willis wasn't so much living up to his reputation until we approached the end of the film. Unfortunately, I became more and more irritated with some of the 'humor' (mostly slapstick type things; people saying, 'W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what do you mean, a BOMB?!' and the like I think I heard 'W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w' at least thirty times throughout the film) that was being presented. After viewing the film, I discovered that Besson had actually written this screenplay when he was in high school, something that is slightly impressive, but actually explains a lot in terms of the goofiness, I think. The other major irritant was Chris Tucker. I completely understand that his character was supposed to be way out there (kind of a cross between Prince and Grace Jones) but I think that the weird costumes, hair and mannerisms could have sufficed. Instead I had flashbacks to sitting in the theater watching 'Star Wars: Episode I' and literally wanting to get up and hit something after listening to Jar-Jar Binks screech and prattle on. Tucker's high-pitched voice and utter lack of charm did not win any points with me, and if anything, he made the film lose at least one point on my ratings scale. Other than the aforementioned things, there wasn't a whole lot to dislike about 'The Fifth Element' but there wasn't really anything to get excited about either. If this film didn't have the obnoxious Chris Tucker in it, I would consider it to be a great popcorn flick. Instead, even while just mentally flashing back to some of his scenes, I begin to feel like a drill is nearing my ear. However, because the film was fairly enjoyable other than his scenes, I give it a 5/10.--Shelly",5,7,13,7 July 2005
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo fascinating
","As a traditional `kids movie Scrooge' with a couple of exceptions, no matter what people said about this movie, I wasn't going to watch it without a fight.   I finally realized that people were not going to give up trying to convert me until I had watched this film, so I eventually gave in and went into it with a surprisingly open mind.*Spoilers within*True to form, there was a reason that seemingly everyone on the planet saw this film, and not only saw it, but liked it.  I thought it was a really cute and touching story.  Not many kid films start out with the death of one's almost entire family, but this film did, therefore setting up the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) whose son Nemo is suddenly snatched out of the ocean and place in a fish tank in a dentist's office.  Marlin must find Nemo before he falls into the hands of the dentist's horrible young girl whose last pet fish went belly up pretty quickly under her charge.Not only is the story rich, fun and cleverly written (at times with adults in mind) but the voice talent, most notably Ellen DeGeneres' work, is fantastic.  Probably the most striking feature of Finding Nemo however is its beauty Â– it is so sharp and colorful that I actually half-regretted not seeing it in the theater.  While Finding Nemo did not make me a Pixar/Disney disciple (pretty much an impossible task) I think that its sure Oscar win for Best Animated Feature will be as well-deserved as the win by `Spirited Away' last year.  Spirited Away was far superior in my opinion, but both films transcend the generic `animated feature' label.--Shelly",7,0,2,28 December 2003
Blade," Amazing  a 'comic book film' done reasonably right!
","I have no idea why I had never seen the 'Blade' films before, especially since it is based on a comic book, (Marvel at that) and a relatively obscure one from the 1970's/80's at that. However, it was decided by my boyfriend and one of his friends that since 'Blade: Trinity' was coming out this week that it was about time to get up to speed. Generally, it was a pretty good experience.Directed by Stephen Norrington ('League of Extraordinary Gentlemen') and starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff and Kris Kristofferson (did I ever think I would be saying those words?), 'Blade' involves a vampire hunter (the title character, played by Wesley Snipes) who has a little of the vampire blood running in his own veins. His mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant with Blade, who was subsequently born a 'half-breed'; half vampire  half human. He has the strength and thirst of a vampire, but he is able to walk around in daylight and ages like a human. Together with Abraham Whistler (Kristofferson), a fellow vampire hunter who took Blade in when he was 13 and raised him/trained him, they a pitted against Deacon Frost, (Dorff) a 'young' vampire who is not only super cool, but super ambitious as well. He needs Blade's blood to summon La Magra, the blood monster, which would enable him to reign over humans, rather than exist among them, as vampires have been doing for centuries.I was pleasantly surprised by how stylish and fun this film was to watch. It was slick and Blade is a cool character. The techno score was very appropriate and added to the great action scenes. I particularly thought the early scene at the rave/bloodbath was great. It really kick-started the fast pace of the film and gave us enough background without spelling everything out for us. The only real criticisms I had were in the CGI area  the whole blood monster/antidote thing was pretty over-the-top and should have either been scaled down a bit to work within the production's ability, or handled in a different way completely, because the result was very cartoonish, but not in a positive way.See this film if you like action films. I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to horror films (read: wuss) and I wasn't scared or startled once. This is a fun, sleek film that was definitely worthy of a franchise. 7/10 --Shelly",7,0,1,10 December 2004
Constantine," Not great, but entertaining
","John Constantine (Reeves) is a thirty-something detective who hunts a certain type of criminal; they are demons from hell that are now on earth. As a teenager, Constantine tried to kill himself, was declared dead for two minutes, but was brought back to life by some pretty good doctors. Since it was an attempted suicide, he is technically destined for hell right out of box, so he has dedicated his life to trying to get back in the good graces of god by hunting down demons and saving lives. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite cut it because Gabriel (Swinton) is not very impressed. Meanwhile, Angela Dodson (Weisz), a police detective (of the 'normal' variety) learns her mentally disturbed twin sister has just committed suicide, and when it is suspected that she was under the influence of a demon, Constantine gets involved to help Angela solve the mystery of her sister's death and to possibly get her out of hell.The plot to 'Constantine' is actually kind of complicated, so hopefully I managed to encapsulate the plot enough to give a hint as to what is going on with the film. Frankly, I wasn't very impressed with the story, but I pretty much enjoyed the characterizations and the visuals. Constantine is a great, complicated character; it is really easy to tell that the film is derived from a comic. His constant search for redemption based on a mistake he made years prior lays a great foundation for a tragic character. Throw in the fact that he has cool metrosexual hair, the always hip white shirt and black suit combo, is an unabashed chain smoker and has such wonderful toys only adds to his appeal as a good character. Reeves actually did a pretty good job in this role; I was really expecting a 'Neo II' based on what I was seeing in the trailers, but he managed to distinguish this role well. Weisz's Angela was not bad as far as heroines go, but some of her acting bits were kind of funny, particularly after she 'crossed over' in the tub. I really liked the character of Gabriel  Swinton has always been able to play androgynous well, and she brings a lot of class and intrigue to the role. The mirth that she obviously feels when she is dealing with Constantine is obvious, and enjoyable to watch. Though their scenes together are short, they definitely had a decent chemistry. There were other small roles (Shia LaBeouf as Constantine's apprentice/whipping boy, Chas, Djimon Hounsou as Midnite, an intermediary between heaven and hell, and Peter Stormare as a very memorable Satan) that made up a pretty interesting cast.The only other Marc Forster film I've seen is 'Monsters Ball', and though I was less than impressed by it, I was interested to see what he would do with a film that is of a completely different genre. Stylistically, 'Constantine' was pretty cool. There was nothing very futuristic involved, but his shots of Los Angeles - both the shiny skyscraper areas and the back street underground-type areas  were pretty stunning. The film itself was actually pretty religious, (and sacrilegious depending on who you talk to) but there was never a time when I felt this theme was becoming overbearing or obnoxious. Unfortunately the film was rife with pacing issues (there was one time when my boyfriend asked me if I was sleeping. I wasn't, but I sure could have been) which really dragged the film down, and frankly I felt some of the intricacies of the story a little complicated for what was, technically, an action film. There is also a moment when Constantine flips off someone (I'm not going to spoil it here) but instead of laughing, which I think was the intended reaction, I wanted to get a big IL' foam finger and flip off the film for stooping to such lameness.When you mix the good with the bad, you get so-so, and that's how I felt about 'Constantine'. Actually, time for rumination has probably raised my opinion on it because I was pretty disappointed when I first left the theater on Friday. But upon further reflection, I do think that it is a pretty decent comic book movie, and that overall it was less, rather than more painful than it probably could have been. If I could rate films with a half scale, I would give this one a 5.5/10, but since only whole numbers are allowed, I'm going to give it a 5. If the film continues to do well, watch for a sequel, it's inevitable.--Shelly",5,0,15,21 February 2005
The Others," A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films
","Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly",7,76,103,6 November 2004
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's best film may be his most subtle film
","Ed Wood, Tim Burton's biopic of the `worst film director ever' is a masterpiece.  Not only does it feature an amazing cast, headed by Johnny Depp (doing a dead-on impersonation of Wood), but it more importantly does not mock the filmmaker himself.  Burton obviously has a deep respect for Wood, because he is portrayed as what I personally have concluded him to be after much research about the man  an earnest filmmaker who would do whatever he needed to in order to have his films made.  No, he was not a technically proficient director, but he had more heart than a lot of directors who are much more commercially successful and reputable than he.Burton's stylish direction and gorgeous black and white cinematography perfectly compliment the subject matter.  Minor touches, from Elfman's Theremin-laced score to his end credits (`Filmed in Hollywood, U.S.A.'  something that Ed Wood added to every one of his pictures) make this film a true tribute to its subject. Having seen this film a minimum of 45-50 times, there is one scene in particular that is directed so beautifully by Burton that it bears mentioning.  After a particularly stressful day of filming, Wood suddenly stomps off the set and goes to a local bar.  What makes this scenario different from most is that he is also wearing an angora sweater, skirt, heels and a wig.  Wood then runs into his film idol, Orson Welles who proceeds to actually give him a pep talk and essentially say that in a basic sense, there are not that many differences between the two men.  This scene could have been humorous, getting a laugh at Wood's expense, but Burton makes it so touching that it affects me every time I see it. 
The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant, especially Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.  It was this film that really opened my eyes to what he could do, before he was awarded accolades for his roles in Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums.  But the real jaw-dropping character was the much-deserved Oscar winning performance by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Barely recognizable under the makeup, he is both humorous and heartbreaking as the washed-up, heroin-addicted horror film icon that everyone assumes is already dead, or they mistake him for Boris Karloff.  His friendship with Wood is absolutely touching and very and sincerely portrayed. 
Ed Wood is by far my personal favorite among Burton's repertoire, which is relevant since I am a fan of most of his films.  It is a technical masterpiece and a masterfully told story of one of the most bizarre and earnest filmmakers of the last five decades.--Shelly",10,1,2,2 December 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," A film that makes me long for the great disaster films of Irwin Allen
","It's sad enough when a grown woman goes to see a film with the fallback plan of having Jake Gyllenhaal as eye candy in case the movie sucks.   It's even sadder when she soon realizes that A) He plays a high school student in said film, and B) That even the eye candy can't make up for the fact that the movie really does suck  badly.  That was the situation I found myself in after seeing `The Day After Tomorrow'.The only saving grace for this film (besides the aforementioned eye candy) was some pretty impressive special effects.  Unfortunately, there was about another hour and a half of celluloid to account for, which was comprised of ridiculous plot points, horrendous dialogue, (somehow I don't think I was supposed to laugh out loud when the rich kid tells Gyllenhaal, `Tell her how you feel' seemingly out of the blue) and some really, really lame timber wolves.  The resurfacing of the (completely ineffectual) wolves marks the end of any hope that this movie even deserves one and a half stars. Unfortunately, there's another half hour to go from there.Some needs to tell Roland Emmerich `Hang it up son'.  Like `Independence Day', the special effects were good, but also like ID4, a nearly two hour film cannot revolve around about ten minutes of destruction sequences, and `The Day After Tomorrow' tries this, leaving me as cold as that frost monster that Jake & Co. evaded by simply shutting a door.  `The Day After Tomorrow' is not worth seeing unless you're into some hard-core boredom with a few cool digital effects.  The only thing the film really left me with was regret  regret that I had waited in line to see this film and regret that the Fox News reporter that was mowed down by the flying debris in Los Angeles wasn't Bill O'Reilly.  I did learn something, however  I learned that if another Ice Age occurs, apparently the only satellite channel that will work will be The Weather Channel, so I thank you, `The Day After Tomorrow', kind of I guess.--Shelly",3,0,1,8 June 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Excellent and emotionally devastating
","'Hotel Rwanda' gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.From about fifteen minutes into 'Hotel Rwanda', I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and 'Schindler's List', but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.As a film, 'Hotel Rwanda' was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the 'reasons' for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, 'Gee  that sounds too depressing for me'. 'Hotel Rwanda' is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. 'Hotel Rwanda' is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly",8,4,5,28 February 2005
Crash," Nothing light about this film
","First time director Paul Haggis takes on the powerful subject of race relations in his film 'Crash', set over the course of 36 hours in Los Angeles. Featuring a large and exceptional ensemble cast, the characters in 'Crash' all have something to do with one another, even if the familiarity is slight, and most of them have serious racial prejudice issues. Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is the uptight wife of Los Angeles D.A. Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), who become victims of a car jacking. The perpetrators, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) are habitual criminals who, when they aren't stealing cars for profit, are waxing philosophic on the state of discrimination for African-Americans, though generally it is Anthony who is expounding while Peter negates some of his theories. Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillon) is on the LAPD and quickly establishes his opinions on race when he pulls over African-American television director Cameron (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) and proceeds to feel her up, much to the horror of his partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe). Det. Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are lovers who have to deal with their differences as well as the family baggage carried by Waters. Iranian-immigrant, Farhad (Shaun Toub) has to deal with break-ins at this small store, his sole bread and butter, as well as race-related attacks, while his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), who is more Americanized, tries to keep him hinged while struggling with the racism herself. Finally, there is Daniel (Michael Pena), a locksmith who looks like a gang member, but is actually the most peaceful and 'nice' one of the bunch. He is struggling with keeping his family safe, particularly his young daughter, after having lived in a neighborhood in which a stray bullet ripped through her bedroom.Obviously, the cast list is huge as is the scope of the story, but the bottom line is that everyone is brought together by a series of events that causes each of them to either have their lives physically changed, or causes them to reexamine themselves. Racial prejudice are the two main words to describe the theme of this film, and no race is left untouched by Haggis. I think that this film toes a very narrow line between heavy-handedness and abject relevancy, but the script is so damn good that it is more the latter than the former. I heard a review of this film by Henry Rollins who said that it was a really good film, but that 'he knew all of this already, so he didn't learn anything new'. I agree with this to some extent; anyone who is not racially prejudiced could conceivably find the film a little much at times, as I did. However, Haggis' writing is fantastic and thorough. There are few, if any loose ends, and any kind of 'redemption' of any of the characters isn't handled in a cheesy manner befitting an old-time radio show or something. ('I know I was wrong, but dagnabbit, I see the light now!') Nothing like that. Everything that happens has been solidly established and is very believable.The cast is, quite simply, brilliant. There were people whose acting I didn't have a prior opinion of just because of lack of exposure, who made me sit up and take notice, (Ludacris, Howard) there were actors who are always good that continued to showcase their talent, (Cheadle, Fraser) and there were actors who I really don't like at all who surprised me with their range (Bullock, Phillippe). Haggis' direction is stylish and a little grainy, but it is clear that he is more of a writer than a director; this is not a slam on his directorial style, but the film's style was subtle and more befitting of showcasing the script and action. Haggis, the writer of the Oscar-winning film 'Million Dollar Baby' is not going to win any honors for being a writer of upbeat films, but his films, while usually pretty heavy and a little depressing are not of the same caliber of pain as say, the work of Todd Solondz. I definitely would recommend this film because I think it is an important societal commentary, I just suggest that the viewer give the film a chance before declaring it to be too heavy or preachy, because I think you may be pleased with the final result. 7/10 --Shelly",7,1,4,20 June 2005
Snatch," There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can
","`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:Turkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.  While this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because..'  While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.  Sorry Madge.--Shelly",9,115,138,24 August 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A visionary and daring anti-war film
","There have only been a couple of Stanley Kubrick films that I have not seen, and Dr. Strangelove was one of them.  I'm not entirely sure why I never got around to seeing this one, especially since it is deemed such a classic, but nevertheless, until two weeks ago despite the fact that I have had this DVD in my collection for five years, it had not yet hit my viewing queue. Perhaps I had some preconceptions that it would be a war film I wouldn't be interested in. Of course, as what happens with most films I nonsensically and irrationally (and sometimes unintentionally) avoid, I ended up absolutely loving this film.Peter Sellers is a triple threat in this satire about nuclear war in the face of the Cold War.  He plays a British military officer under a maniacal United States General who decides that he wants to wage nuclear war on the Russians without anyone's approval.  Sellers' role is to find out the code that will end the attack, but military bureaucracy makes his job that much more difficult.  Sellers also plays the President of the United States, a calm, but fairly uninformed fellow who relies on his strategists in the War Room to work out this crisis.  In the War Room is Sellers' third role and the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German scientist with an alien hand that has a mind of its own.  Joining him in the War Room is George C. Scott, who plays another top military official who is trying to talk some sense into the President while spouting his anti-Russian sentiments.  To throw yet another wrench into the mix, we have an airplane carrying a nuclear bomb that has no radio contact and is ready to drop the second they reach their target.The film itself is excellent  the script is biting, very sarcastic and disdainful of politics.  It is no surprise that the names of characters are such like 'Jack D. Ripper'.  The shining trait of this film is definitely the acting  while we naturally come to expect that Peter Sellers is going to frighteningly good in just about anything he is in, I was most surprised and delighted to find myself in tars laughing over none other than George C. Scott's performance.  My friends and I watched this film as one of our `film club' selections, and I think we watched the scene when his mistress calls him in the War Room at least three times.  As someone who has only experienced Scott in such films as Patton and The Changeling, this was a hilarious change for me.Dr. Strangelove immediately became one of my favorite Kubrick films with only one viewing, and I think that the visionary approach and the unabashed social commentary in the face of the Cold War is what put it there.  Make no mistake, this is not a war film- this is an anti-war film.  Dr. Strangelove is definitely a must-see for any Kubrick fan and film lover alike.

Blade II," Not as good as the first, but still a decent flick
","As Scud (Norman Reedus), an armory expert who Blade has employed since we last saw him in the original 'Blade' says, 'Lock up your daughters boys and girls, the dark knight returns.' Blade (Wesley Snipes) is back, and this time, he is forced to form an uneasy alliance with the Shadow Council, the elite group of vampires he normally is fighting to eliminate. The reason is that there is a new mutation of vampire in the population that is spreading rapidly, vampires called 'Reapers' who feed on other vampires. Blade is talked into helping the Shadow Council find and kill the Reapers because once they run out of vampires, the logical progression would be to move on to humans. Blade is assisted in this endeavor by The Bloodpack, a group of highly trained vampires employed by the Shadow Council who have ironically been training the last two years solely in the art of killing Blade himself. We also see the return of Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson) and the introduction of the aforementioned Scud.In terms of story, 'Blade II' is pretty good. The constant tension between The Bloodpack and Blade provide both dramatic and hilarious moments alike, particularly between Blade and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). There seemed to be more humor overall in this film, and it was done well. Director Guillermo del Toro ('Hellboy') gives us a film that is full of style and some pretty cool monsters, (and great makeup) but some of the special effects used during the fight scenes in particular were mediocre at best. Perhaps, being a film fan who doesn't put action films at the forefront of her film preferences, I am being a little simplistic in my views, but I often question why, if something just doesn't look good on the screen, an alternate method of presenting that scene isn't used. I'm referring mainly to the fight scene between Blade and one of the Shadow Council messengers that takes place in front of a wall of lights where the CGI figures looked ridiculously cartoonish. Again, I am merely an observer of action films, not a lover of them, so perhaps my view is too plebeian.'Blade II' was another enjoyable popcorn flick that falls into the usual sequel category  not as good as the original, but in this case, it is at least an enjoyable, fun movie to watch. 6/10 --Shelly",6,1,4,10 December 2004
Alien," It's a classic for a reason
","What an experience. Although I had seen Alien before, I was 12 years old and the nuances and suspense was apparently completely lost on me because I was terrified at several different moments while viewing the re-released Director's cut in the theater on Halloween.  I actually compare the experience to having seen Jaws again 15 years after I originally watched it. I knew I was scared, but I didn't realize how good the film was until I watched it again with more educated eyes.Alien succeeds in its ability to take something as simplistic as the `searching for the intruder/foreign element/monster' plot device and turning it into both a horror film and psychological mind game.  We are more frightened *before* we see the Alien, but it is certainly no slouch when we *do* finally get to set eyes on it.  The acting is simply passable, but it was not necessary to emote much more than panic and screams in this film. 
My recommendation is to see the film and then do some research.  Simply by checking IMDB trivia facts I learned some fascinating background information that actually endured the film to me even more.  This is one of those films that people should see at least once, if anything, chalk it up to one of those films like The Godfather where having seen it will at least give you something to talk about at those pesky cocktail parties. --Shelly",8,0,1,8 November 2003
The Best Years of Our Lives," An interesting look at what happens when GIs return home
","It is no surprise that William Wyler's `The Best Years of Our Lives' earned the Oscar for Best Picture in 1947.  It is a study of what happens to three GIs when they are shipped home after WWII, and how their home lives have both changed and adjusted without them.  In this case, we have a soldier (played by Harold Russell) who lost his hands in the war and now must use hooks. Despite his incredible attitude and the skill with which he uses the hooks, he finds himself the object of pity among his family and some friends, and is uncertain about his longtime sweetheart's level of commitment, now that his handicap will affect them the rest of their lives. There is also a soldier (Dana Andrews) who married his wife 20 days before he shipped off overseas and as a result, never really got to know her or start a life with her, and finds that she has done just fine without him. Finally, there is the middle-aged soldier (Fredric March) who returns to his wife and two children, and back to his life as a bank executive.This was probably a really meaningful and relevant film in 1946, when it was released.  And if you look at it now in that light, then it is more impactful.  It is definitely timeless in that the sense of isolation and detachment could be universal for anyone in any situation.  The film is a little dated in that there are stereotypes (the floozy-esque and shrewish wife Andrews, who then transfers his love to a pure and kind younger girl), and also some plot pints that are given to us in glaring form, yet they went nowhere (most noticeably, the whole issue with March's drinking problem, which somehow miraculously heals itself  unless I missed something).While The Best Years of Our Lives is certainly an excellent film as a whole, probably the most amazing element is Harold Russell, the real-life ex-GI who really did lose his hands and therefore really does utilize hooks in order to function.  He went on to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this film, which was probably based on political and social reasons as it was merit, but his performance really was inspirational and heart-felt and effective sixty years later.  The next time you are in the mood for a three hour melodrama, this is a great choice.  I had wanted to see this film for over a decade and when I finally watched it, I was not disappointed.

Closer," A searing drama that made me want to shower afterward
","Mike Nichols' film 'Closer' is simply a study in human relationships. Other than the four main characters, everyone else is an extra, with minimal dialogue, if any. Jude Law is Dan, a struggling writer who is a member of the Obituary staff at a London paper. One day he catches the eye of Alice, (Natalie Portman) who is walking down the street toward him, newly arrived from the United States. They lock eyes (in the film it seems like minutes, but is probably seconds) before she steps into oncoming traffic and gets hit by a car. Her injuries are not serious, but they are the beginning of a long and painful relationship. Some time later, Anna (Julia Roberts) a photographer, is snapping a photo of Dan for his upcoming debut novel when he promptly hits on her. The attraction is obviously mutual, but she manages to hold him off since he is involved with Alice, and she is newly separated from her husband. Some time later, he is messing around on the Internet, pretending to be a woman and chatting with a completely clueless doctor, Larry (Clive Owen). Dan arranges to meet Larry at the aquarium and tells him his name is 'Anna'. Of course, Anna is sitting there, Larry thinks she is the one he talked to, she is clueless, but figures out that Dan played a joke on both of them. Soon, THEY begin a relationship. Throughout the next year or two (the passing of time is so off-handedly managed that it is hard to determine exactly what time frame we pass) relationships get blurred, soured and, I hate to create a pun here: closer.The tagline for 'Closer' is 'If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking'. According to the action in the film, truer words were never spoken. The moral of the story is that everyone cheats. And if they don't, they are excessively co-dependent. (And actually, there are some cheaters who are excessively co-dependent.) While the story was very intricately woven, impressively so, it was still hard to take, particularly during a scene in which Clive Owen confronts Julia Roberts about her infidelity. The pain that these people cause one another is so pervasive that it becomes almost a character itself. And while the sleaze factor was so high I wanted to shower with a particularly abrasive soap the second I got home, the film's story was actually extremely thought provoking and discussion-worthy. Just driving home, my boyfriend and I got into a discussion about the characters, and he said that Anna was the most despicable character Julia Roberts has played, while I thought that Clive Owen was a bit much. I think the film acts as both a solidifier and divider between men and women on a few different levels, a sign that the film obviously succeeds in proving its thesis.The acting in 'Closer' is first-rate. I have never seen any of the characters in better form, quite honestly. Portman, an actress that I have marginalized as mediocre since every performance after her stunning debut in 'The Professional', also impressed me; she subtly exhibited both weakness and slyness in a manner that made her character purposely hard to read. I actually consider Jude Law's performance as Dan to be his best since his role in 'Road to Perdition'. (Certainly a feat considering he was featured in no less than 653 films in 2004.) Roberts was actually mesmerizing (she's come a long way since the insipid 'Pretty Woman') and I look forward to seeing Owen have a well-deserved prolific film career. As for the direction, Mike Nichols is flawless. He has really become a master at his trade. This doesn't necessarily mean that he is ceaselessly compelling, though he made all the right decisions in 'Closer' from the pacing to the soundtrack, particularly the Damien Rice track that plays a couple of times throughout the film, (though I would have liked to have heard the Suzanne Vega song that is featured in the trailer) I would not go out of my way to see a Mike Nichols film based on his name alone, but I put him higher on the cred ladder that Ron Howard is also on; the films are usually good, but they don't always completely enthrall me.This was not the case with 'Closer' however. I walked out of the film not liking it at first, but I think that was because it was such a depressing commentary on relationships. The more I realized I was thinking about it even days after seeing it, the more I realized that it actually was a good movie with an unpleasant theme and some great acting. Whereas I would have given it a lower score right out of the box, I give it a supportive 7/10 now.--Shelly",7,5,8,3 February 2005
Taxi Driver," What hasn't been said about this film already?
","I have started this `review' about fourteen times, fourteen different ways, because there isn't a lot that can be said about this film that hasn't already been said.  The plot is fairly well known:  Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi cab driver who works long hours because he doesn't sleep, and lives a life of near isolation.  When he does attempt to reach out to others, it becomes near-obsession and eventually ends up almost killing him.  (Or does it?)  I cannot fully express the impact this film had on me at an early age.  When I first saw it, in my very early teens, I was transfixed with Scorsese's direction, the gritty atmosphere and the unbelievable acting by DeNiro.  It was after I watched `Taxi Driver' that I decided to attend film school because I saw something different in this film, something that was gritty, dramatic and exciting.  Until then, I had pretty much seen films that had fairly happy endings, or at least had endings that were sewn up fairly tightly.  `Taxi Driver' turned that whole mindset completely upside down. 
The great thing about `Taxi Driver' is its compelling nature.  When I recently watched it, it was probably my twentieth (or so) viewing in my entire life.  Even after reading books and articles on the film and even studying this film in film school there are still elements of the storyline that are left up to interpretation, and while I thought one thing years ago, twenty years later, I think something completely different based on my own life experiences and elements (I try to) have learned about human nature since.  Since I first saw this film, I have developed a very deep respect for Martin Scorsese as more than a filmmaker, due to his unbelievable series `A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American film' and the various documentaries/essays he has participated in. To me he has become more than a brilliant film director; he is a film scholar  he lives film, and breathes film and seems to relish sharing his superior knowledge of film, a level I can only dream to achieve.  I was 13 years old while I first sat wide-eyed, watching `Taxi Driver' and two weeks ago I was 31 years old while I sat wide-eyed, watching `Taxi Driver' and the impact, while of a different kind, was just as strong.  --Shelly",9,0,0,21 June 2004
Lost in Translation," Great second effort from Coppola
","Sofia Coppola quickly went from being fodder (Godfather III anyone?) to garnering a lot of my respect after seeing `The Virgin Suicides' a few years ago, so before all of the hype about `Lost in Translation' surfaced, I was interested in seeing the film.  Unfortunately I didn't get around to it until recently, but I already had my doubts.  When there is a lot of hype about a film, I immediately doubt it until it changes my mind, so I wasn't even sure if it should have been a Best Picture contender.  Of course, after now having seen the film finally, I am positively certain of its merit.One thing about the film that I have heard more than once is that the viewer `didn't get it' the first time, and didn't understand the big deal, but when given a second chance, the film was fantastic.  After seeing the film once, I'm not sure why it leaves that impression on some because I found it to simply be a charming, romantic and thought-provoking little film.  The characters are extremely well written, and the Tokyo backdrop is at times both lonely and vibrant.  After seeing the films of Wes Anderson, I was not surprised by Murray's sincere and brilliant performance and I cannot imagine another actor playing that role.  Johanssen's casting was not as inspired, but she did a great job nonetheless.  While there is nothing overtly offensive about the film in terms of content, this film isn't for everyone, although the people who didn't like the film threw me, and surprised by those who did, so it's hard to pin down the `ideal viewer.'  I would suggest giving it a shot, regardless because it is a superior film.--Shelly",8,0,1,20 April 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Best. War film. Ever.
","When Stanley Kubrick directs a war film, you know not to expect the normal elements that make up the classic war film genre.  Full Metal Jacket takes us from Marine boot camp to assignment in Vietnam while exposing the raw nerves and emotions that most war films do not explore. 
There really is no typical Kubrick genre  his films span forbidden desire, (Lolita) horror, (The Shining) and farce (Dr. Strangelove) but his films can never be mistaken for anyone else's.  It's hard to put a finger on what that style is, but it is clearly present in Full Metal Jacket:  The brilliant use of lighting in battle scenes to make what would normally be a horrific scene almost beautiful.  The point of view shots of actors addressing the camera directly, not as an aside to the audience, but as more of an intimate gesture to draw the viewer in.  The wide range of characters involved  you see the `fighting machines', the conflicted soldiers  both terrified and excited to be involved in the fight.  The most important element to this film is the straight forward method of storytelling and the reality that is brought to the table.  While the Drill Sergeant is probably one of the most quoted characters in film history (at least among some of my friends) the reality is that this actor was indeed a drill sergeant and many of his lines were improvised and drawn from his own experience in the marines.  The main character of the film (Modine) is a complex and conflicted character, one whom I would imagine was more typical in spirit to some real soldiers in Vietnam than a lot of other roles we have seen in the war genre.  Full Metal Jacket remains my favorite war film because it is one of the few combat films to not only make me cry, but to shock me with images and situations that have nothing to do with actual typical combat.  Just one example is the hazing of Pvt. Pyle, which is often construed as funny; it is also incredibly gut wrenching below the surface.  While there are war/fighting scenes, this is not a war film that relies solely on battle to tell its story, which is perhaps the best exemplification of its excellence.--Shelly",9,0,1,22 September 2003
The Godfather: Part II," One of the best sequels ever made
","An excellent follow up to the original, The Godfather Part II continues where the first film left off and explores the rise of Vito Corleone in a series of flashbacks that, for the most part, correlate with what is presently happening to Michael Corleone (Pacino) his son and successor. This is a beautifully produced piece of film, and while I still prefer the first installment, simply because of the story content, it is every bit as good.  This film is best when watched together with the first film Â– if your body can stand it.  Even better, watch the third one as well for a little closure and so you can argue over whether it's a good film or not.  (I myself personally like the third film, but not as much as the first two.)--Shelly",8,5,8,8 April 2004
Fargo," The Coen Brothers' masterpiece
","How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top Three of all time since the second I left the theater back in 1996? I guess that has always been one reason that I've avoided watching this film in the past year and a half that I have been reviewing every film that I see. The best thing to do, as I did with my other two favorites in my personal cinematic trinity, is describe why this movie is, in my opinion, incredible.'Fargo' is, like many Coen brothers films, the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. In this case, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable, scary and share a half a brain among them, and what was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama, and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow-white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking, and harkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'. One of the funniest things I remember about this film was actually an unfavorable review my parents, who are both movie lovers themselves, gave it before I saw it for myself. It was, verbatim, 'We saw 'Fargo' and it was REALLY dark. We hated it. You will LOVE it.' And indeed I did. I walked out of the theater eight years ago on a cold, snowy night and literally thought to myself, 'THAT is how films should be made.'That really sums it all up in simple, non-flashy terms. And because of my very true adoration for their work, I have described how choosing my favorite Coen Brothers film is like a mother choosing her favorite child. It takes a film that is a step above 'phenomenal' in order for it to shine above all of the other fantastic films they have made. In my opinion, 'Fargo' is and always will be that caliber of film for me. Every other film of theirs have varying degrees of 'great-ness', because I truly love and admire all of their work, but because of its standout performances, intelligent and compelling script, and it's beautiful presentation, 'Fargo' is a four star film, and will always remain on my personal 'favorites' list.--Shelly",10,3,5,7 September 2004
The Aviator," It may not be his best, but it's damn good
","Despite its many Oscar nominations, I hadn't heard a lot of great things about the film prior to seeing it. That is why I was very pleasantly surprised when, while watching 'The Aviator' I was met with what I feel is a truly great film. There are so many things involving the film that could be construed as personal negatives for me: (and more about most of these later in the review) I am not a DiCaprio fan, though I do recognize his talent, I can't stand Kate Beckinsale, and frankly, a 3 hour biopic on someone like Howard Hughes is not a very compelling subject for me. What got me into the theater was that it was a Best Picture contender and ultimately, it is a Martin Scorcese film. I was recently criticized as someone who would only dislike a film by a director I appreciate and follow if it was sheer crap, basically suggesting that I am such a fan girl that I can't discern whether something is good or not, simply because I may idolize a particular director. This is categorically untrue, but a good test of this would have been 'The Aviator'. I am a Martin Scorcese fanatic, and though I have not seen his entire filmography, there are certainly some films I like better than others. 'The Aviator' was a film that I was afraid was going to be in the 'others' category, but more importantly, I was afraid that it was going to be nothing more than mediocre, and that Scorcese who is LONG overdue for an Oscar (one of the only things that keeps this in check is that neither Kubrick nor Hitchcock won one either) was going to finally win recognition from the Academy based on his work for this film. About an hour into the picture, however, my fears were assuaged because 'The Aviator' is truly a great film.Scorcese's direction is brilliant; he captures the spirit of the time, from the vibrant colors to the lush costumes, to the garish and (almost scary) club performers. 'The Aviator' is as close to an epic as one can get without donning a gladiator helmet or parting the Red Sea. Scorcese messed with some special effects in 'The Aviator', something that he hasn't played with too often. One scene in particular, where he is in a plane filming scenes for his film 'Hells Angels' is absolutely breathtaking. The sets in 'The Aviator' were huge, the party and premiere scenes were electrifying, and the cast (literally a cast of hundreds, if not thousands) was headlined by some good actors. DiCaprio really was fantastic as Hughes; physically, he didn't seem to embody Hughes until his later years, but I personally don't consider that to be a necessity  look at Hopkins in 'Nixon'; he looked nothing like the man, but his mannerisms spoke volumes. Particularly when DiCaprio was able to chew some scenery during scenes involving Hughes' mental breakdowns, I felt that he not only didn't overact, but he solicited a distinct air of sympathy for the character. (Except for the few people around me who found his episodes humorous, apparently.) 'The Aviator' is headed by a great actor, and features many excellent performances by supporting actors, but the real standout for me was Cate Blanchett in the role of Katherine Hepburn. Having been a lifelong fan of Hepburn's (particularly of her early work) it took about a minute of Blanchett's performance for me exclaim, 'She's fantastic!' Contrary to an opinion of one of my fellow theater attendees, Blanchett doesn't just mimic Hepburn, she literally becomes her. If she doesn't win the Oscar for this role (after having been so deserving for her role in 'Elizabeth' as well) I will be shocked and dismayed.Of course, there are no perfect films, and 'The Aviator' is far from perfect. I have never been a fan of the vintage-sounding nasal voiced narrator who appears to be reading items for a news brief on the radio, and Scorcese uses this a lot in the film. By about the third use (out of about 30 uses) I was getting pretty irritated. Though I realize that this is a pretty standard technique in period pieces, it still is annoying and derivative. I also was particularly dismayed by Beckinsale's depiction of Ava Gardner. Beckinsale, who is a homogenous and mediocre (at best) actress in the first place, managed to mess up her really small role by giving Gardner a weird Hungarian sounding accent. Perhaps I am not fully schooled in Ava Gardner's history, but I don't recall her sounding like one of the brides of Dracula. If I'm wrong about Gardner, I'll be happy to retract that criticism, but the performance was still lackluster.Sure, Scorcese should have won the Oscar for 'Raging Bull'. Probably for 'Goodfellas' as well. But as easy as it is to want to give someone an Oscar based on their past offerings, it isn't fair to that person or their peers if this occurs. (It would be like if Kubrick got an Oscar for 'Eyes Wide Shut'.) Thankfully, 'The Aviator' is deserving on its own, and if Scorcese gets the statue (finally) he will have earned it fair and square. 'The Aviator' is a long film, but with its great pacing, it didn't seem like it. I give the film a very solid 7/10, possibly subject to change if the film holds up in the ensuing years.--Shelly",7,6,11,17 February 2005
Léon: The Professional," A very different film from the 'original' cut
","Possible SpoilersHaving seen `The Professional' enough times to be able to not only recite the dialogue from memory and pretty much act out the scenes, watching `Leon', Luc Besson's director's cut is like experiencing almost an entirely different film  and a better one at that.  While there was a hint of infatuation for the French professional hitman by his young protégée in the first cut, it's way out in the open here.  Matilda's role as a protégé is also expanded when she not only learns more about his business, but participates and assists in the hits as well.  The acting, which I found impressive originally, is obviously equally good  especially with Oldman  he chews the scenery so well you can't help but smile, even though he's terrifying.  If I had to choose which of these two excellent films is the better, I would have to choose this director's cut, merely for the chances it takes, but I would recommend seeing both because the additions and subtractions make them two very different films.--Shelly",7,0,1,8 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A strong introduction to the trilogy
","The first time I saw this film, it was unfortunately on a smallish television, and I was so ambivalent about it that I was perfectly content to sit and preoccupy myself folding laundry while doing it.  Even with these obstacles and the fact that I really don't care for the fantasy genre, I could recognize that it was a decent film.  So when I actually viewed the film as it SHOULD have been seen from the start Â– on the big screen and in the theater, I found myself completely enchanted. The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent introduction to the trilogy in that it cleverly and comprehensively introduces the many characters and their missions/backgrounds without becoming too heavy, boring or banal. Admittedly, not having read the books, and not knowing the story I was dismayed by the sudden end of the film, but I would have been a lot more irritated had I seen the film when it was released in the theater initially, then had to wait another year to see the next chapter.  I guess my ambivalence and natural aversion to hype worked in my favor this time. 
From a non-Lord of the Rings Geek perspective, I can safely say that this is a film that has enough to offer just about anyone, even fantasy film haters like me.  The direction is smooth, the action is steady and the story is intriguing enough to keep even jaded film lovers satisfied.--Shelly",7,0,0,28 December 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Everything that has a beginning has an end... thank goodness
","This trilogy started out so promisingly; a fact that makes its demise all the more disappointing.  When I saw the original Matrix, I was blown away; I had never seen anything like it and therefore was excited to see the next `chapter'.  Reloaded was actually a passable film, but more for its flash than its substance.  But, I decided to reserve full judgment until I saw Revolutions.  Now I can very succinctly describe my reaction: Disappointment.  How can a film be histrionic and convoluted with sufficient amounts of action and yet still be incredibly boring at the same time?  See the film and find out.  Love scenes that I should have found endearing instead elicited snickers instead, and the action and plot progression was handed to us in an orderly manner that betrayed the films that came before it. 
Was there anything good about this film?  Sure.  The end result was mildly satisfactory and the special effects were tight, but probably the most gratifying and beneficial thing that I personally felt that came from seeing this film was the strain it put on my brain while trying to figure out why this film was such a bummer.  In honor of the reverence I hold for the first installment, I tried to make allowances.  One example:  The effects have been so overdone since the original Matrix and there have been so many copycats that we have become desensitized to it.  The more I think about that statement, the less I believe it is true, at least personally, because I was impressed by the effects and action sequences in Reloaded, which I just saw less than 6 months ago.  I also second-guessed my decision to reserve full judgment of Reloaded based on the conclusion in Revolutions.  I recently saw Tarantino's Kill Bill twice and loved it so much without seeing Vol. 2 that I realized that my hesitation with Reloaded could be construed as a cop-out, simply because I wanted so much to enjoy the film based on my admiration for The Matrix.  Bottom Line:  Go see it if you want to `complete' the trilogy.  But don't expect anything because you won't get it.--Shelly",3,0,0,9 November 2003
Footloose," At least we get to see Chris Penn dance
","I used to LOVE this movie, and I remember I got the soundtrack for Easter when I was like, 11 or something. It really is a crummy movie, but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.*Possible Spoilers*I remember even as a kid, I thought 'Holy cow, for a town that didn't allow dancing and music for years, these kids sure can dance well.'  What are even funnier are the people who are in it - Lithgow did this film two years after Garp. Did he think that this was going to be a meaty role? But then again, he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun. And Dianne Wiest - Woody Allen staple and Oscar winner, who has about 4 lines in the movie. Her job is to pretty much look pensive and pious. I don't think I even need to bring up Mr. Kevin Bacon and his goofy dance through the grain mill.
While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously. Of course, it has its moments, especially the part where the dance is beginning and no one is dancing. Why? Let's pretend it's not because Kevin Bacon isn't there in his stupid outfit to scream 'Let's Daaaaaaaance!!!!!!!!', (rather, is outside getting his ass beat down by the head redneck until he somehow manages to pull out of it and kick said redneck's ass. How the hell did THAT happen?) But in reality because the song playing is the Loverboy guy and Ann Wilson's 'Almost Paradise.' I think that as kids if we were sexually oppressed and sheltered and that song came on we wouldn't have danced to that crap song either.  Yes, this was the 80's, and mid-80's to boot so the clothes, dancing and dialogue are hilariously dated.  These kids must have somehow obtained pirate copies of Radio Free Solid Gold Dancers or something, especially the skinny white kid doing 'The Robot'.This movie is up there with 80's `classics' like `Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids, we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought:  `What a crap movie.'  The difference being, our nostalgia sometimes compels us to avoid averting our eyes, like a train wreck.--Shelly",3,8,27,20 November 2003
The Village," Beautifully filmed, with an interesting story
","I sometimes wonder if M. Night Shymalan has directed himself into a corner after a strong start.  Since `The Sixth Sense', audiences have been expecting his films to all be of the same genre, and while his succeeding films have had an underlying theme of the supernatural, he seems to have lost the confidence of the general movie-going public.  I think that this is in part due to this nagging feeling I get that he has a lot of self-satisfaction with his work, essentially saying `Look how clever I can be see it? See it?'  But even more so, I firmly believe, with all due respect to said general movie-going public, that not every film of his is going to have a huge `twist' in the end, or `Boo!' moments that are going to scare us into nervous laughter  and most importantly, he doesn't purport to do this with all of his films; it is simply the vast chasm between audience expectation and director's intent.`The Village', Shymalan's latest offering, is the tale of a small 19th century village whose residents live with the daily threat of the unknown creatures which dwell in the woods that border it.  There is a `truce' between the residents of these two areas; as long as the villagers don't breach their border, the creatures will leave them alone.  One day, however, after the death of a young boy, a young man from the village, Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix) after many pleas to the village elders to go through the woods to one of the surrounding towns in order to get medicine to prevent future loss of life.  The next day, red marks appear on the door, and the village's animals turn up dead and shorn; presumably, the creatures in the woods are not happy and are declaring `war' on the village. 
Shymalan favors a sullen, emotionally pained and quiet protagonist, and `The Village' follows this trend.  Phoenix is all large eyes, slightly stooped and silent, while maintaining a large amount of strength and character.  His love interest, Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the unofficial mayor of the village, (Bryce Dallas Howard) is probably the most heroic figure of the film, however, and is definitely the most compelling character.  Much has been said of Howard's performance, and the accolades are most definitely warranted.  Adrien Brody has a small but important role as Noah, basically the village idiot, and while he speaks very little, Brody's acting is once again unreal.  I have admired him since seeing `Summer of Sam' years ago, and he his talent has only strengthened.  I didn't even hate William Hurt, which I fully expected to do, just because I find him to be so unbelievably bland.  The films he appears in are generally good, but his lack of any kind of dynamic is disappointing.  As Edward Walker in `The Village', however, he is not horrid.    The production values and cinematography in `The Village' really are quite good  Roger Deakins, who I have greatly admired since his first collaboration with the Coen brothers on Barton Fink, really is a master in his field.  His lighting and photography are fantastic in this film, and, as a friend said to me on the drive home from the theater, `the film was really beautiful.'I went into this film having seen some really bad reviews, but the ones that gave me pause were positive reviews by other critics that I highly respect. I noticed that several of the negative reviews disdainfully compared `The Village' to Shymalan's earlier film, `Unbreakable.'  I'm sure it was not the reviewers' intent, but this actually made me want to see this film more, because I think that `Unbreakable' was a fantastic film, but that it was a box office disappointment because it was not a clone of `The Sixth Sense'. Mainstream audiences were expecting another scare-fest, and they got Bruce Willis again, but this time as a sad, beaten-down superhero of some sorts. I found `Unbreakable' to be a very personal and endearing film, and I attribute a lesser degree of those adjectives to `The Village'.  It was not a phenomenal film, but it was certainly not a disappointment.  The story was solid and kind of left me with the `Hmmminteresting' sentiment that I take away from good episodes of `The Outer Limits' or `Twilight Zone'.  The now-expected `twist' was visible by about 2/3 into the film, but who cares? It was still a good story, and the film, while more of a drama than a thriller/horror offering is a solid movie that I feel deserves a lot more credit than it has been given.  I'm glad that I didn't let some bad reviews mar my viewing experience because I went into the film with an open mind and came out generally satisfied.--Shelly",7,0,0,1 August 2004
Pitch Black," Sci-Fi for the regular guy
","Spoilers Sci-Fi films are pretty much anathema to me with a few exceptions (Alien & Aliens are two films that immediately come to mind), but I watched 'Pitch Black' anyway because it came highly recommended by several people. Directed by David Twohy ('The Arrival') and starring Vin Diesel, it was a film I ended up enjoying with little criticism.'All you people are so scared of me. But it ain't me you got to worry about now' is pretty much the understatement of the year, uttered by Richard Riddick (Diesel), a prisoner being transported with 39 others to New Mecca, another world that is in the process of being settled. When the ship crash lands along the way, leaving about ten survivors, Riddick manages to escape his captor, William Johns (Cole Hauser) sparking a manhunt on an unknown and unusual planet that has three suns. What they soon realize is that they have landed on a planet that is about to undergo a total solar eclipse which will bring thousands of light-shy man eating flying creatures out into the darkness. When Riddick soon resurfaces and agrees to help them try to restart an abandoned ship (from the last human feast that landed on the planet) it becomes a race against time before all of the lights go out. Unfortunately, time runs out before this happens, and they find themselves prey for the creatures as they try to make it off the planet.Stylistically, 'Pitch Black' is pretty slick. The use of the color filters was great, and the editing, for the most part, was pretty good. The only thing I thought got really old were the stupid quick edits of two people looking at one another (it was very reminiscent of bad Japanese television shows) or when someone would turn around to look at Riddick and it would be a quick edit of 'Riddick is there to the right! Now quick to the left!' Those were supposed to be arty shots, and they fell flat  but the basics were good. I thought that the events surrounding Jack were completely ridiculous; I felt suddenly transported back to a Judy Blume novel, but again, it's Sci-Fi  I give it a little more latitude. The CGI was surprisingly good, and the actors (being throwaway characters anyway, this is a Sci-Fi movie after all) were decent. Unfortunately, a big deterrent for me is that I can't understand a damn word Vin Diesel says, so I found this completely annoying, of course. Keith David of course was totally underused, but I'm used to that by now. The shot near the end of Paris spitting alcohol onto his torch, creating a momentary large fire that lights up the dozens of creatures that surround him is the money shot of 'Pitch Black' and is a shot that I've been told was actually an ad-lib by the actor, but it was a hit when used in the trailer and just as effective in the film. It's almost worth seeing the film just to see that cool shot and the events leading up to it.Overall 'Pitch Black' was a good film, and I would of course recommend it to any Sci-Fi lover who hasn't already seen it, and assure most Sci-Fi haters (like myself, for the most part) that it is worth seeing, and not too 'out there'. 6/10",6,1,2,10 December 2004
North by Northwest," A Hitchcock classic, but not among his best
","`North by Northwest', written by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself embroiled in a particularly nasty case of mistaken identity. He finds himself being mistaken for a gentleman who is wrapped up in some dirty dealings with Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) and various other unsavory thugs under Vandamm's employ.  He also meets up with Hitchcock's requisite blonde femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and surrounded by this cast of characters makes a cross-country adventure where his life is threatened several times; all the while with Thornhill having to depend on his wits to keep him alive.
While `North by Northwest' is a good film, I don't consider it to be one of his best, which, at least in my small circle of rabid film friends/relatives, is fairly sacrilegious.  I enjoy the vibrancy of the script and the lush cinematography, but there are a couple of things that cause the film to fall short of excellence on my personal Hitchcock scale. Mainly, there's the matter of James Mason as the villain.  Mason is a great actor, and has been in some really good films, so his talents were wasted as the tepid Vandamm.  There simply really wasn't a part for him in the film; rather, most of the relatively `juicy' bits were relegated to Martin Landau. It seemed that the concentration was solely on Grant's character, which in most cases is adequate, but in a suspense film, I personally like to see the villain have a more pervasive presence.  Of course, there are some masterful elements to this film.  The infamous cornfield scene is truly masterful.  It isn't even the shot of the crop duster chasing down Grant  the image that gets me every time is the very quick shot of Grant standing across the dusty road from the gentleman waiting for the bus.  As he is sizing him up, trying to figure out if he is the man that he has traveled a long distance to see, Hitchcock frames the shot much like a classic western.  There are many shots like this that, if frozen, would make a compelling photograph.  I can also acknowledge, while I am not as much a fan of Hitchcock's comedic moments as I am of the more dark or horrifying ones, that the comic timing with which Grant delivers his lines is excellent.  His charisma certainly adds a spark to the film, and there are times when he is so smooth that even if something was completely unbelievable I had to laugh and say, `Hey, it's Cary Grant  what do you expect?'`North by Northwest' was made in 1959 and is more akin to the whimsical and much-eschewed `The Trouble with Harry' than his more story-driven films of the 1940's and his horrifying masterpiece a year later, 1960's, `Psycho'. While I acknowledge that `North by Northwest' is a good film, it doesn't even make my personal `Hitchcock Top Ten' on which his darker films dwell. However, it's kind of the way I feel about the Coen Brothers  even a simply `good' film of theirs is usually much better than the average film, so a slightly above-average Hitchcock film like `North by Northwest' garners at least three stars from me.--Shelly",7,5,9,25 August 2004
Doctor Zhivago," The greatest romantic story of our time? I don't think so.
","I expected some pretty great things from the film Doctor Zhivago; not only is it on the American Film Institute Top 100 Films of all time, but it has a pretty solid reputation as a good film.  Unfortunately, I have to vehemently disagree with this opinion.Doctor Zhivago is set during the Russian Revolution, a time when Socialism was rising and personal freedoms were diminishing.  This alone would be a fairly interesting topic, if it was done well, but this was a sweeping epic of a love story instead.  Zhivago (Omar Sharif) takes a wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and they have a child.  During these formative years of their marriage, however, Zhivago meets Lara (Julie Christie) who enchants him.  After `resisting the attraction' for a while, they meet up a couple of years later when Tonya is pregnant again, and pretty much fall into bed within five minutes of reuniting.  Their affair is so obvious that when Tonya is looking for Zhivago at one point, the members of the village where Lara lives all point her to his mistress' house.  Charming, yes.I could have merely disliked the film because of the horrid `romanticism' if the rest of the film had any merit, but everything else is just as bad.  I have now seen three David Lean films, and have really enjoyed two of them: `Bridge on the River Kwai' and `Lawrence of Arabia'.  For this reason, I was just stunned at how horrible this film is.  The scene changes in `Zhivago' are positively laughable  many scenes are about thirty seconds long, and end abruptly, prompting me to internally (and eventually externally when it became apparent that we were all exasperated with this film) say, `That was a great scene' in the most dry manner possible.  It got to the point where we were expecting someone to walk in the door and say, `Hello', and promptly have a quick fade out.  There are too many things to support the ridiculousness of this film, but one more notable moment was a scene in which Sir Alec Guinness, who was sporadically narrating the film, was talking about a moment when he was speaking to one of the characters.  He was narrating the scene, and we are watching the action on the screen, with the narrator in the scene.  It ended up looking absolutely absurd and seriously laugh-inducing.  Why Lean couldn't have just, oh, say done the scene without narration?  I will never know because there is no way, after writing this review I even want to mention this film ever again, so I am certainly not going to read about it.  I've passed the stage of morbid curiosity and have gone right to the denial stage.  I want to deny this terrible movie ever passed over my retinas.  I even indignantly confronted some family members at a recent family gathering who actually really liked this film and demanded they tell me why this is a good film, and the first thing every one of them said was that it was `romantic'.  Unfortunately, I was almost thrown out on my ear when I said, `Romantic? Romantic?!  It's SLEAZY!!!'  Before anyone accuses me of fanatical piety, let me remind any gentle readers that my favorite film of 2003 was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and I laughed until I cried at the `bang-up' ending of `Intolerable Cruelty', so the moral police I certainly am not.  Dr. Zhivago was just ridiculously bad melodrama disguised as an epic because of its dramatic backdrop.  I expected a lot and received worse than nothing; a loathsome story and really bad filmmaking.--Shelly",2,26,56,21 June 2004
The Shining," Suspenseful masterpiece
","There are so many films that I have reviewed for the last year and a half that are such classics that there isn't a lot more to add to the mix. Another of these is a film I caught as a midnight showing at a local movie theater, 'The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Stephen King's classic novel of the same name. 'The Shining' has become such a pop culture phenomenon, parodied by everyone from Saturday Night Live to The Simpsons, that it is easy to forget to look at what a fantastic film it really is.Set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, 'The Shining' tells the story of a small family who are hired to take care of a large hotel/resort during the off-season. This is an ideal situation for the father, Jack (Jack Nicholson) who plans to spend the time working on his novel, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) if not for a couple of key factors. Firstly, the hotel gets snowbound in the winter, so leaving isn't an easy option. Secondly, the family has its own problems; Jack is a recovering alcoholic who has been abusive in the past, Wendy is fragile and nervous to the point of near-collapse, and Danny is a borderline schizophrenic whose alter-ego Tony manifests himself as a barking voice coming from Danny's right index finger. Oh yes, and the hotel is haunted by the spirits of guests, servants and their families who have died there in the past. All of these factors make up a spooky story that, when coupled with Kubrick's exquisite direction and cinematography, makes for a pretty creepy little film. His use of light and color (always with the red), unconventional score (always with the jarring piano) and serious creepy imagery are as amazing as always. The flashes of the twins, even after seeing the film many times, still make me shiver, and the tracking shots following Danny as he rides around in his Big Wheel still make me cringe every time he takes a corner. What Kubrick does best with 'The Shining' however is the slow pace he makes us follow until the action story crescendos near the end. Rather than construing this as a pacing issue, this is more of a simmer, then a slow boil, and finally a boil over. As I said earlier, this isn't a very compelling review because there has been so much said about the film that I can't possibly add anything in the way of significant interpretation and exploration in a forum this short. What I can say in testimony to this film's relevance, appeal and ultimately, longevity is that the theater I screened 'The Shining' at was packed with people, from adolescent to middle age, which I personally found pretty neat, being such a fan of Kubrick's work. 8/10Shelly",8,1,2,6 November 2004
"I, Robot"," I, Reallydidn'tlikethismovie
","'I, Robot', directed by Alex Proyas takes place in the not so distant future, specifically 2035 Chicago. Del Spooner (Smith) is a police detective who has a prejudice against robots, which is kind of an issue since they are basically everywhere. Robots have replaced humans in doing manual labor jobs (garbage men, etc.) and have become personal assistants and even companions to many people. On the eve of the release of the latest model that will not only replace the old models but will be featured in one in five homes, the chief scientist and inventor of the robots allegedly commits suicide by throwing himself out of his office window. Spooner is the detective on the case because the scientist has left a holographic message for him that leads him to believe that there is more to this death than a suicide. The head of the company the scientist worked for is Lawrence Robertson (Greenwood), who appoints one of his primary employees, Susan Calvin (Moynahan) to assist Spooner with his investigation. When Spooner discovers the crime seems to have been committed by a robot, Sonny, one who seems to have feelings (and more importantly) disregards the three laws of robotics, he and Calvin find that there may be much more on the new robots' agendas than they thought.Boy, where do I start with this one? I really intensely disliked this film as a whole. There were so many clichés that were invoked, from the 'cop that everyone thinks is crazy', to the 'evil corporate magnate who may not be so evil'. The script for 'I, Robot' is rife with bad puns 'Sorry, I'm allergic to bulls**t', and at least ten 'Oh, hell no''s from Smith. There were several completely inane plot points (Shia LaBeouf's role, which was essentially a walk-on, where Smith repeatedly tells him not to curse was baffling, for one), and frankly, Smith's argument for his prejudice against the robots was not remotely convincing to me, something that was a pretty big deal since it was a big part of the plot. The acting in 'I, Robot' was absolutely reprehensible. Will Smith, has proved with his non-action films that he can act. Although he has done mostly action-oriented films and therefore can't really show too much talent in that genre, his performance in 'I, Robot' just plain sucked. And shame on the casting directors for picking Bridget Moynahan to co-star in this film. In fact, let's go back farther - shame on her agent or whoever decided that she COULD act. Her role as a scientist was about as believable as Denise Richards was in whatever Bond film she was in, only she was somehow worse in this movie. I kept asking when she was going to reveal the fact that she was actually a robot because that was the only thing that would have explained her wooden delivery. If they simply wanted someone with a pretty face, they could have at least gotten a marginal actress like Kate Beckinsale or something. They would have just had to make the character Hungarian since she can't seem to shake that accent.Meanwhile, Proyas' direction was rife with 'groaner' moments. Anything that was supposed to be a 'surprise!' moment (Sonny surviving the chair after a scene where he was supposed to be killed that I dubbed 'Dead Bot Walking', or after his car was totaled, Smith cracking out the trusty motorcycle) was just a big letdown because it was unfortunately apparent these things would happen long before the reveal. I also question the decision to make Chicago look virtually unrecognizable a mere thirty years from now. I guess the Sears Tower was spotted, but other than that it could have been any city. (Other than the vague reference to a dried up Lake Michigan, which I still don't get  perhaps I missed something when I was trying to burrow into the couch to escape this movie.) Honestly, I didn't think the movie could actually take a turn for the worse three minutes until the end, but it did, with something as simple as a really stupid and corny handshake between Smith and Sonny that was inexplicably in slow motion, invoking my memories of other films of the same mettle who also enjoyed unnecessary slo-mo, like 'Glitter' or 'Battlefield Earth.' The only thing that saved this stinker of a movie from a spot in my coveted dungeon of films I loathe with great malice that include 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and 'Escape from L.A.' was the fact that the special effects were indeed fantastic. The entire reason why I watched this film at all was because of its Special Effects nomination for an Oscar, and after seeing the film it was clear that it was far superior to its fellow nominees 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Spiderman 2' (which it eventually lost to). The CGI work is top-notch, particularly anything to do with Sonny. Even the scenes when 'reality' and CGI mixed were fantastic. Not enough to save the film, not by a long shot, but definitely the only positive thing I can say about the film.Other than the Special Effects work, 'I, Robot' is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't watch it again on a bet. Knowing that in an action film, the story and acting are usually put on the back burner, I will generally give some leeway that I don't allow for regular dramas. But there is no excuse for the deplorable, appalling and abominable product that Proyas churned out and expected us to watch. I couldn't tolerate it, must less enjoy it, and now I plan to try to forget I ever saw it. I'm giving this film a 4/10, only because of the superior special effects; otherwise it would have gotten no more than a 2.--Shelly",4,9,14,3 March 2005
Duck Soup," Gut-splitting
","They say that in the world there are two kinds of people: Those who like Elvis, and those who like The Beatles. (Don't ask what category those who don't like either fall into.) A similar analogy that I like to use involving classic film comedies is that there are Marx Brothers people and there are Three Stooges people, and ne'er the two shall meet. Being a Marx Brothers person myself, I watched Leo McCarey's 1933 film 'Duck Soup' with great delight.Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is named the president of a small city/state called Freedonia, which has just been hauled out of bankruptcy by the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (longtime Marx Bros. foil Margaret Dumont). Firefly has been appointed the president because of Mrs. Teasdale's devotion to him, much to the chagrin of Ambassador Trentino (Calhern), a man who wants control of Freedonia and the hand of wealthy Mrs. Teasdale. He hires Chicolini (Chico, natch) and Pinky (Harpo) to spy on Firefly so that Trentino can not only become Mrs. Teasdale's husband, but president himself. Because they are the Marx Bros. alliance lines are blurry, and Chicolini and Pinky end up on both sides of the fence. War breaks out and hilarity ensues.Nope, there's not much to the plot, but 'Duck Soup' is an absolutely riotous film that was almost as surreal as it was funny. Enormous musical numbers that seem to come out of nowhere certainly contribute to the bizarre theme, and this film is even more manic than other Marx Brothers films. Part of the appeal of their brand of comedy is their rapid-fire delivery, sometimes so fast that you don't realize that you've actually heard what you just heard. Teeming with double entendres, (' ') and featuring the wonderful 'mirror gag' that somehow gets me every time, I find that there isn't actually a lot to say about the film because it is truly a simple little gem. Barely an hour long, I suspect it contains the most gags in ten minutes that are truly funny than an entire two hour comedic production from the last twenty years. And this comedy is whip-smart and damned funny. This may not be the best Marx Bros. film to initiate someone with, ('A Night at the Opera' may be just a tad less manic and a little more 'user-friendly) but it is a bona fide comedy classic that exudes relevancy a whopping 72 years after its original release. 7/10 --Shelly",7,0,0,6 August 2005
Apocalypse Now," The horror. The horror
","'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations. 'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible usage of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes, and come across a tiger. The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted grey, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'. The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this, he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now' so I cannot compare it to this newer cut, but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10--Shelly",8,124,178,4 October 2004
Van Helsing," Unbelievably awful
","-Spoilers-Where do I begin?  Besides currently entertaining a class-action suit to sue for my time back, I'm compelled to paraphrase Homer Simpson and just write `Screw Sommers' for the next twelve lines, but I suppose I need to try to put into words why I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire LIFE.  It wasn't the fact that the CGI (with some slight exceptions of the work on Dr. Jekyll  but only slight and fleeting) was terrible.  It wasn't the fact that there was a plethora of plot holes and loose ends (even allowing for a franchise).  Nor could it simply be explained by the fact that the story progressed as quickly as your average daytime soap opera.  (You mean that they are STILL at the same party and I missed six months of the show?)  This movie was horrible because it tried to be something it just absolutely couldn't  a coherent, action-oriented popcorn flick.  I was aghast within the first three or four minutes, and quickly felt like Malcolm McDowell in `A Clockwork Orange' being forced to watch horrible imagery on the screen. I tried my damndest, but I couldn't even take the opportunity for a two hour nap because this film was like a bad accident  you want to look away, every fiber of your being is telling you to look away, but you just can't because you are so astonished at how horrible the display before you is.  I can't remember exactly when, because I think my body went into shock halfway through as a defense mechanism, but I was so appalled by the corniness and sheer awfulness of a particular scene, that I actually turned to a complete stranger next to me who was alone and completely slouched down with a look on his face like he had not only just run over his dog, but was forced to do it again, and said, `Okay, seriously?!' and garnered a sympathetic eye roll in return.  -Definite Spoilers Ahead-I'm not even going to comment on the acting because there WAS no acting, except that Kate Beckinsale had an accent which ranged from Count Chocula to something completely indistinguishable, and made for some pretty hilarious viewing. Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to laugh at that  I was supposed to laugh at Igor walking around muttering under his breath how it's always, `Do THIS Igor, do THAT Igor.'  I also don't think I was supposed to be laughing when Beckinsale was telling people to run inside to protect themselves from Dracula's brides, yet she and everyone else ran circles around the town square for about five minutes  I was supposed to find the fact that the Friar, when asked by a townsperson what she could do to make up for him saving her life, ends up calling in his favor by sleeping with her.  (Not after reminding us for the 100th time that he's not yet a monk he's a FRIAR.)  And I certainly don't think I was supposed to laugh at the Frankenstein Popsicle (why the hell was Frankenstein in the film in the first place, and secondly, why was he frozen in a block of ice?!)  I was supposed to be worried that these jokers were going to get out of Dracula's Castle alive.  Unfortunately the only thing I was worried about was whether or not I could control myself long enough to sit through this piece of garbage without trying to sabotage the film and end the misery.  The fate of Kate Beckinsale was promising for about a tenth of a second, until Sommers apparently not only decided to attempt to channel the 30's monster films, but The Lion King as well.  The touching and tender moment which was probably supposed to illicit emotion definitely created a reaction in me  something akin to a stomach flu or acid reflux.  I've never seen `The Mummy' or `The Mummy Returns', so I can't compare it to his other work, but Van Helsing makes Stephen Sommers look worse than an amateur  he comes across as an amateur who thinks he knows what he's doing. In reality, what he's doing is ruining the promising career of good actors, Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxborough.  Rich.Hugh, seriously  leave this potential franchise and run towards the light.  Based on the ridiculous presentation of this film, the next one will have Van Helsing getting stuck in a cage match between the Easter Bunny and Snoopy  and we'll be encouraged to find it awe-inspiring because it will be from `The Director of The Mummy!' I can see the trailer now:  `Odie.  Peppermint Patty.  The Wicked Witch of the West.  All fear one man.' And hopefully we won't then be seeing Hugh Jackman look up from under his hat this time, but Corey Feldman.  This `film' will do nothing but waste your time.  If there was a grade lower than a `1' on the IMDB voting list, I would classify it as that instead of reluctantly giving it a positive number.  I wouldn't wish this thing on my worst enemy  I can't muster up enough hate to inflict this tripe. It wasn't long before I was jealous of the vampires' victims, because I wanted to be put out of my misery as easily. Van Helsing is nothing but a huge disappointment, and will only drain any strength of will or intelligence from you.  When the film ended, I was left completely defeated and struck dumb.  Drop the popcorn and slowly step away from the movie.--Shelly",1,26,47,10 May 2004
Collateral," Excellent thriller
","Sometimes serendipity can be a blessing, and other times a curse. Max (Foxx) a Los Angeles cab driver, finds that serendipity isn't going his way when he picks up Vincent (Cruise), a seemingly normal looking man in a suit who asks him to become his personal chauffeur for the evening while he makes some business calls. Max is reluctant, but the $600 he is offered makes it a lucrative evening, so he agrees. Unfortunately, while sitting and waiting for Vincent at the first stop, a body comes crashing down onto his cab, and Max realizes that Vincent's blasé and no-nonsense approach to dealing with this certainly unusual situation isn't just good coping skills. This is just the first stop of five, but other people either become involved, or get in the way, of Vincent's spree and essentially become collateral damage. All the while, Max is trying to not only save his own life, but when he figures out who one of Vincent's future victims is, he has to try to save theirs as well.I absolutely loved this film. I am naturally drawn to films where actors take on roles that are set against their regular 'persona', and since I am generally ambivalent to Tom Cruise to begin with, I was anxious to see him play a bad guy. He did an excellent job portraying Vincent. With his gray hair and sort of ill-fitting suit, he looked like Jeffrey Wigand, a character from one of Michael Mann's earlier films, going medieval. His lack of emotion and constant drive reminded me of Yul Brunner's role in 'Westworld'. He gets knocked down; he gets up and continues after you without hardly breaking his stride. Cruise was intense and frightening, and I thought he did some fantastic work. Jamie Foxx also was very good as Max; he was able to do something very important in his role (at least for me since his roles in every other film and television show I had seen him in up until this point other than 'Any Given Sunday' made me cringe) and that is make me forget that he is Jamie Foxx. I am not so shallow of a person that I will not like someone no matter what role they play, but I kind of had Jamie Foxx in my 'Jim Carrey Category', where I won't watch his comedy, but will give his other roles a shot.Michael Mann's direction is just excellent. The slick colors, sleek digital cinematography and urban settings were just perfect for the script. The pacing of the film was perfect; there was not one moment where I felt like a scene dragged, particularly toward the end of the film. He also worked in some great subplots without drowning us in exposition (the stories of the cab driver from a couple of years ago, Max's mother, his business) which made the film entirely believable. (Which is kind of frightening.) I had to kind of figure out how the ending happened the way it did, but it wasn't so outlandish that I was irritated or anything. I also was kind of questioning the use of the hard rock music in the soundtrack, but in my opinion there's a silver lining to that as well; how often do we hear music like that during a film like this? I wish I had gotten around to seeing this film on the big screen because I think that on the big screen, with digital sound it would have been breathtaking. With a script this good, direction this dead-on and performances that are this strong, one can see that it is a strong Oscar year for the major categories since this one did not garner any major award but a supporting actor nod for Foxx, but I guess that says something for both the offerings we had in 2004 and subsequently, the strength of this film to stand out as one of the best among many great works. 'Collateral' gets a very strong 8/10 from me.--Shelly",8,0,2,17 February 2005
The Machinist," Dynamic and depressing
","Boy, there is so much to say about 'The Machinist', and it's hard to do it without spoilers, so I'm not even going to try to keep it spoiler-free. The story is excellent; confusing at times, but intellectually stimulating. I loved that there were several Dostoevsky references (Trevor is reading 'The Idiot', a sign in a funhouse reads 'Crime and Punishment', an integral character's name is Ivan ('The Brothers Karamazov') and the film itself smacked of 'Notes From the Underground'). What I admired most about the film, however, is that I had absolutely no freaking' clue what was going on until the end, and even then it took about three hours of reflection to really form solid enough thoughts to even begin to think about composing criticisms. Films like this come along far too infrequently, and I'm sure that there have been inevitable comparisons to 'Memento', I think both for its cleverness and for its originality. The film, while staying linear (for the most part, a few flashbacks occur) is scattered and obtuse, but that is because we are experiencing everything through the eyes of Trevor, as he sees and discovers things. There are several clues that lead you to find out what the solution to the mysterious visions and notes are about, but truthfully, they are only effective after the reveal, and only then do you see the genius behind them. Most of the clues lie within a nightmarish carnival ride sequence that, once dissected, make complete sense. Also impressive were the subtle ways that Trevor's 'conscience' is revealed; whether something as bold as a physical manifestation, to a book dropping to the floor  any time Trevor tried to sleep, something would quickly happen, and the agony is almost tangible.The cinematography in 'The Machinist' is dead-on and fantastic. Everything having to do with Trevor in his apartment, or in his car is in muted, blue-gray tones. The machine shop is dark, and certain key moments of the film are brightly lit, most notably the aforementioned carnival sequence. It's almost like, after having seen it, the scenes were screaming 'Pay attention to this!' Anderson also does a great job of giving just enough in a scene to make you believe one thing, until you see the actual events later; there were several times where based on one snippet of information, or one image I was given, I was convinced of the circumstances until I was (every time) shown the 'real' happenings. (Example: the yellow flashlight) It is only at the end, when Trevor discovers the truth, and becomes unburdened, does his world become light; and this is evidenced by the gleaming white of the room he ends up in. Much has been made of Christian Bale's physical transformation from 6 feet, 180 pounds to 120 pounds, and indeed, it was definitely an amazing (albeit dangerous) endeavor, but I went into the film telling myself that I wouldn't mention it in my review. Quickly, however, I realized that it wasn't just a gimmicky thing, this was the real deal, and the weight loss was an important part to the character. When we realize that it's not just 'simple' insomnia, but torment that is plaguing Trevor, that makes his appearance all the more meaningful and pitiful. Bale was indescribably good in this film. I have enjoyed a couple of his other roles, (most notably, as American Psycho, Patrick Bateman) but his performance in this film completely blew me away. I really wonder where the nominating committees for various awards were (I'm mainly looking at you, Independent Spirit Awards) when this film was released, because it was certainly nomination-worthy, and one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Also good was John Sharian, who played Ivan. He was one eerie motherfarker, and even when his true nature is revealed, you still want to shower after watching him. Frankly, there is not a lot of negative criticism I can attribute to this film; it is confusing, yes, but at the same time it is incredibly thought-provoking and intelligent, so being someone who (for the most part) respects challenging cinema, any confusion only meant that there were more puzzles to solve, puzzles I'm STILL working out in my head. This is going to be a turnoff to a lot of mainstream audiences. Also, because the film as a whole was extremely creepy and sinister, when the actual reveal occurs, it is a tad bit of a letdown because I expected something even more terrible than the events that actually occurred. (And anyone who has seen the film or sees it after reading this review is going to think I'm a pretty terrible person for saying that, I'm sure) but there were just so many other horrible scenarios that could have happened, that I almost felt the ending was a tad bit mild. Film endings can make or break a film for me, and though this has a (mostly) happy ending, it was really the best ending I can think of for this film, so because of this, for the reasons I've mentioned, and for many that I can't fit into this review, 'The Machinist' is a film that I would highly recommend to Independent cinema lovers and to film-goers who love to chew on a film for awhile, turning it around in their minds until they come up with several different theories. That is what I have been doing since I saw the film last night, and even as I write this review I'm still coming up with other thoughts. See this film; you're probably going to see it on my Top Ten 2005 list in December. 8/10",8,4,6,27 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Near perfection
","Everything that I disliked or criticized about the previous two Harry Potter films (which I absolutely didn't like) were masterfully done in the third installment of the series, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is a triumph  even scenes that I was cringing in anticipation over based on earlier CGI work, (the Quidditch match, the werewolves, etc.) were brilliant.  Overall, the film was a lot darker, a lot meatier, and had an exponential amount of style over its predecessors. Among the many amazing techniques that could be mentioned, Cuaron briefly introduces hand-held camera work, experimental use of color in various scenes, and best of all, not being a fan of the fantasy genre, steady pacing that never once allowed me to be bored.  Possible spoilersOf course, making this next statement is dangerous because I may eat my words after seeing the fourth installment, but it is encouraging to see that as Harry Potter gets older and edgier, the films do the same.  This could solely be attributed to Cuaron's direction; only time will tell.  The best assessment of this film is that coming from a highly critical, general hater of fantasy film viewer, there were only two miniscule criticisms I had regarding this film.  One of them was the cheesy way the film ended, (meaning, the last three seconds) and the other is quite possibly my own fault, and that is the very neat and quick turnaround of Sirius Black.  I was a bit confused as to how in one moment, Harry was in peril and the next, everything was cleared up rather easily, but again, that may just be a misunderstanding on my own part.The bottom line is that this is a first-rate film that (again, not an easy thing for a cynical viewer like me to say) truly is a film for any generation to enjoy.  There are many other films that are accredited with this distinction (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Disney cartoons) but this is one of the first times I actually agree with them.  The aforementioned films that I have seen, I feel, do not translate well into adult viewership; the most that can be said is that the film is `cute'.  `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is not `cute', it is a bona fide good film and it has done what the first two films of the series couldn't do  not only thoroughly enjoy myself, but give me a reason to see the next installment.--Shelly",8,2,5,21 June 2004
The Exorcist," Interesting & compelling for its time
","One of the films that nobody can believe I hadn't seen until recently is 'The Exorcist', William Friedkin's screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel. Starring a young (and pretty weird looking) Linda Blair as Regan, the unfortunate 12 year old who Satan decides to possess, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who attempt to exorcise Regan's demons, the film has been called 'The Scariest Film of All Time'. I think that in 1973 it probably WAS the scariest film of all time. Unfortunately, as with so many films that hold any substantial amount of notoriety, the film has been so pervasive in pop culture that nothing is up for grabs as a surprise anymore for anyone who genuinely hasn't seen it. We know about the 360 degree head turn, the pea soup, the vulgarities spewed from the mouth of this little girl with a Mercedes McCambridge voice (probably one of the most frightening aspects of the film). What I was prepared to base my opinion on was the actual film. How did the film progress from one shocking scene to another? Unfortunately, I found that it is pretty weak. Friedkin's jump-cut scenes are almost as startling as anything else in the film. There are many things that go unexplained, or are at least barely weakly supported, (for example, why Regan ended up in the hospital going through testing in the first place; all she had said at that point that she had felt her bed shake) and plots that are built up go nowhere. (I'm still confused as to what the excavation in Iraq had to do at all with the end results) The acting is decent in The Exorcist; Burstyn is always good, and Blair is good enough to see that she was probably completely miserable for the duration of the filming. The version I saw was fortunately the director's cut, which featured the very effective 'spider walk' scene that Friedkin had removed for thirty years, and some really great flashes of what I kept calling the 'zombie face', which turned out to be extremely effective in terms of scare value. Every time there would be one of these 'subliminal' shots, you could hear people in the audience ask one another 'Whoa! Did you catch that?' The print was also stellar, which allowed us to see Friedkin's excellent lighting in this film.I caught the midnight showing at a locally owned theater on the eve of Halloween, and the crowds 'The Exorcist' drew is a testimony to its long-standing reputation and its inherent appeal, even thirty years later. While the film itself is just okay, and the actual 'horror' portions are almost passé in this day and age, the film should certainly be remembered for its impact thirty years ago, and in reality, because 'The Exorcist' raised the bar for horror films, the eventual emulation by future directors of horror films probably caused its own impact to be lessened. I also believe that once the dust cleared on the shock value, it is clear to see that the rest of the film is not as strong as it maybe should be. Still, the film is an important one, even with its shortcomings. 6/10",6,1,4,6 November 2004
Gandhi," Solid, but a bit unevenly paced
","Attenborough's `Gandhi' is a solid biopic about the slain human rights leader, and Kingsley's acting job is unbelievably good.  There were times when I would be watching the film and would completely forget that this was an actor portraying the man, based on the few times I had seen film or photographs of the real man.  The cinematography is exquisite on this film, and reminiscent of David Lean's work, and the music is excellent  so much so that after sitting through over three hours of film I kept the credits rolling to hear the score.  However, even allowing for the sheer amount of information that had to be put into one single film, I feel that there were some important things that were glossed over, and other scenes that certainly could have been better edited.  Understandably, we first glimpse Gandhi as an attorney traveling to South Africa, where he first experiences the inequality that he chooses to spend the rest of his life fighting, but soon after, when he arrives in India, he is suddenly in the current dress of the poor.  Until then, he had certainly sacrificed, but he had gone from insisting that he `always travels first class' to this manner of self-sacrifice after he is released from prison without any background.  Perhaps surprise was Attenborough's intent, because that was my reaction.  On the other hand, there was a lot of time spent on moments that could have been pared down a bit in order to produce a more even pace  for example, some of the many meetings amongst Gandhi's `co-leaders'.  It was moments like these that made the film less compelling than I expected it to be  I am normally glued to my chair during just about any film, but I had no problem getting up for a moment or two because I suspected I wouldn't miss anything, which turned out to be a true assumption.These criticisms are fairly minor in the grand scope of the film  I knew nothing of this period of history and I felt like I learned some incredible facts and was able to of course correlate these with other historical events.  This was obviously a completely selfless man who died in an ironic manner after the sacrifices he and his family made in order to preach the virtues of non-violent protest.  While I admit that I was a little under whelmed because I perhaps had grand preconceptions, Gandhi is definitely a solid and important film.--Shelly",7,5,10,27 May 2004
Spirited Away," Miyazaki masterpiece
","I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it. Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.  The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly",9,9,16,9 November 2003
The Usual Suspects," Fantastic Crime Thriller
","Possible spoilersNo matter how many times I see this film, (and this was about the tenth time I believe) I still look for clues to the final outcome, and I still have a smile on my face the last five minutes of the film.  The first time I saw this movie, it was by myself at the theater, and I could not help but exclaim, `Holy CRAP!' (to the delight of the people around me) and that effect hasn't lessened much in the ensuing decade because this film is so well done.There are not many films that I would recommend to just about everyone, but `The Usual Suspects' has always been one of them.  There is intrigue, great dialogue, a brilliant screenplay and some top-notch acting, especially from Kevin Spacey, who earned a well-deserved Oscar.  In terms of the direction, there aren't a lot of stylistic similarities between this film and say, Singer's X-Men series, but because they are of different genres, they are impossible to compare.  Every time I watch this film I focus on something different to admire, and this time it was the incredible musical score - it is a great intensity builder and is the perfect accompaniment to a near-perfect film.--Shelly",9,0,1,20 April 2004
Alien vs. Predator," What made me think this film would actually be worth the time I spent in the theater?
","*Spoilers ahead  like they are going to be any surprise*I should have known this film would suck as thoroughly as it did, so why was I surprised at how bad it turned out to be? Paul W.S. Anderson outdid himself with 'Alien Vs. Predator', a 101 minute crap-fest that had me struck dumb with its idiocy. The alleged 'story' is that there is an archaeological expedition of a pyramid that is 2,000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. No, its okay  you read that right. A billionaire, played by Lance Henriksen, (oh the irony!) has commissioned a crack team of explorers, archeologists and scientists to 'discover' this pyramid  because we find out after he conveniently starts hacking up a lung that he wants to 'make his mark before he dies.' Luckily, that happens in the near future, along with pretty much every other sap that goes along on this bogus journey. Back to the original 'plot', however  buried deep within this pyramid are the legends of two great movie franchises of the late 1970's and 1980's  the Aliens and the Predators. Little did we know, after sitting through a handful of their respective films, they turn out to have a history together, and it's a little embarrassing, in that the Aliens, thousands of years ago, were basically bred to be the Predators' cannon fodder  they were hunted by these great dread-locked beasts who have masks like Silons, only without the cool red light moving back and forth. The humans become the bait in order for the Aliens to come out and play with them, and they in turn are then hunted by the Predators. The tagline for this film is 'Whoever wins We lose.' Truer words were never spoken. I found myself, within the first minute of the appearance of the Aliens/Predators not even caring who won or lost  I wanted every human on the screen dead, and I wanted the movie to be over as quickly as possible. There isn't even a point to listing why this film was so crappy, because I somehow don't think that the studio will pay for my carpel tunnel surgery. I would have even been satisfied with some good fight scenes, but the one and a half scenes that actually gave the title of the film any credence were so jumbled and shaky that I was longing for a battle between Gamera and Baragon or something. Japanese guys in rubber suits would have been more satisfying than anything this film had to offer. The only thing that 'saved' this film from getting a tepid three millimeters incline of 'thumbs up' and instead got it a whopping four millimeters was the fact that I got so many laughs out of it. Unfortunately, they were not during the moments that Anderson wanted the audience to laugh, (I think during the ceremonial rite of carrying off one of the fallen Predators while one of the remaining humans that teamed up with it to fight a big Alien looked on (yes, you read that right too) was supposed to elicit a more serious thought than 'At least they could offer to drop her off  they have a spaceship and she has no way to get home.') Because I howled in some spots, the film gets maybe one star as opposed to a half star. MAYBE one star  I'm feeling a little nostalgic for Mystery Science Theater 3000 at this point and am therefore a little softer.",2,0,1,25 August 2004
Batman Begins," A good start
","Going into Christopher Nolan's latest film 'Batman Begins', I asserted that my favorite Batman film thus far was Tim Burton's original 'Batman', featuring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. After walking out of 'Batman Begins', my opinion did not change, but I was left with a lot of hope for this franchise.'Batman Begins' basically takes the story of Bruce Wayne (Bale) and starts from scratch; pretending that the other Batman films didn't exist (which, after seeing the third film, is probably a wise thing to convince yourself of). Taking cues from the original Bob Kane story, our new Batman still has some of the same background as the Burton/Schumacher offerings, (the essentials, like how Wayne's parents die, etc.) but we now have a truly dark knight. The guilt with which Wayne is wracked regarding his parents' death is so pervasive that he puts himself through grueling and potentially life-threatening events. While in an Asian prison, he meets Ducard (Neeson) who works for Ra's Al Ghul (Watanabe). Ducard convinces him to join their cult, which teaches him the way of the ninja, only their motives and honor are questionable. Returning to Gotham City, Wayne begins to seek his revenge on the mob boss who runs the city, and was behind the killing of his parents. While doing this, he discovers that there is another dangerous villain, Dr. Jonathan 'Scarecrow' Crane, who drugs his patients and eventually, his enemies, with a hallucinogen that turns them psychotic. Helping Wayne are his trusty friend and butler Alfred (Caine) and Lucius Fox (Freeman), a former employee of his father who creates Wayne's weapons and gear. Since there inherently has to be a love interest, Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Holmes) acts as both the object of his affection and a source of grounding.It was unfortunate that I went into this film having read a lot of reviews, something I generally don't do, because pretty much every review I read or heard was a rave, and called it the best Batman film ever made, and even one of the greatest movies of all time, period. Therefore, I had high expectations going into this film, but came out of it feeling slightly under whelmed. I think I was expecting to do what I did after seeing 'Kill Bill' on opening night, and was jumping around, I couldn't contain my delight over the film, whereas I walked out of this one and said, 'It was a good movie, but I still liked the first Tim Burton film better.' Perhaps it's bad taste or something on my part, but I really liked the art deco and Gothic setting of that film, but more importantly, I relished the character of The Joker. I have always been one to root for the villain (a recent example of my hero worship of the bad guy is my assertion that the coolest character in Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' was Kevin, a guy who had maybe five minutes of screen time) and Ra's Al Ghul and particularly Scarecrow just didn't do it for me. Cillian Murphy is a great actor, and it was fun to see him chewing up scenery after having only witnessed him in '28 Days Later', but overall I was pretty disappointed in the villains of this film.Having said that, I think that the character development of Bruce Wayne and his cohorts was definitely superb. By now, it's cliché to say that this was the vision that Bob Kane had of the character of Batman, but it really is appropriate to reassert this. I was a casual reader of the comic as a child and in my teens, so while I really like Burton's style, I can really appreciate Nolan's creation and Bale's depiction. Christian Bale is the best Batman we've had so far, hands-down (sorry Adam West). He brought believability to the tortured and conflicted Wayne, as well as a sense that this could be a real guy. There was nothing cartoonish about his performance; rather at times I was reminded of an earlier role of his, Patrick Bateman of 'American Psycho' in his understated ness in certain situations. Rachel Dawes notwithstanding (sorry, Katie Holmes may be cute and all I guess, but she can't act her way out of a paper bag) Nolan creates an excellent supporting cast of characters that will serve the franchise well, including Gary Oldman as a not-yet Commissioner Jim Gordon. Caine and Freeman are both as good as they usually are, and it is great that they are lending their talents and some class to the series.Understanding that one of the main themes of the film was to create groundwork for future endeavors, 'Batman Begins' is a very good film. If you look at it from the perspective of a stand-alone film, it could be lacking some key elements (like the aforementioned villain thing). Then again, I could just be completely picky and I rely too much on certain things to make a film fantastic. I just know that if there were a bit more dynamism in our bad guys I probably would have given the film an additional point on the ratings scale. But in bottom-lining the film, it really is a good movie and it makes me look forward to the next installment, which means that the film did for me exactly what it probably intended. 7/10 --Shelly",7,1,2,25 June 2005
Before Sunset," An interesting romance film
","I didn't remember seeing the first film of this series, 'Before Sunrise' until some of the footage from that film was featured in its sequel, 'Before Sunset', also directed by Richard Linklater. The premise of the story is that in 1995, Celine (Delpy), a young French woman and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are two young strangers that meet in Vienna and spend the kind of night together anyone with half of a brain and an ounce of romance in them would envy. They walk, they talk, they sit, they talk, they have sex, they talk. And throughout the evening, they realize that they are probably meant to be together forever. She has to leave, but they tell each other that they will meet in Vienna in six months. 'Before Sunset' picks up 9 years later, and Jesse is on the last leg of a European book tour, in France. The book is based on his experiences that night, so it of course shocks and awes him when he looks over at the patrons of the bookstore and sees Celine. They proceed to spend the next 75 minutes or so walking, talking, sitting, talking, and figuring out what 'could have been'.The story is so much deeper than I actually portray it, but the film is indeed a simple one. Essentially done in real time, the camera never leaves the two characters as they walk around Paris, sit in a coffee house and ride on a ferry boat. Because the film is so simple, the story has to be substantial, and it is. Even if one has not seen 'Before Sunrise', it is easy to not only figure out the back story (thanks to the use of clips from that film) but to become emotionally invested in the characters of Celine and Jesse. The chemistry between these two actors is substantial, and the characters themselves are so likable that even though I normally have a complete disinterest in either actor separately, together I find them charming. The actual conversations (ranging from the regular 'catch-up' stuff to existentialism) are really so natural; they did not seem forced or staged, an easy hole to slip in to with such a dialogue-heavy film. I'm sure that the incredible backdrop of Paris didn't hurt the romantic undertone of the film. There were a couple of conveniences that seemed to betray the otherwise intelligent feel of the film, namely the fact that Jesse's marriage story is a complete cliché, not unlike any number of stories someone hears at a cheesy pick-up joint. Fortunately in that instance, (though I can't completely forgive it) the connection between them is so obvious that it somehow (though not completely) seems a little less sleazy.'Before Sunset' is nominated for an Oscar for its screenplay, a choice that I find very interesting and agree with. It is worth of its nomination (though will doubtfully win), and it's also one of the few romance films made after 1968 that I actually enjoy  because it has a brain. 7/10 --Shelly",7,1,3,13 March 2005
The Pianist," An astonishing film
","The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, 'What will happen to us?' and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's 'Summer of Sam' and Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly",8,284,343,28 April 2003
Seabiscuit," A decent, `feel-good' film
","Just about everyone has their own personal corny `feel-good' movie, regardless of their level of cynicism.  For 90% of the male population, that film is `Rudy', starring Sean Astin.  My sole feel-good film up until a couple of days ago was `Erin Brockovich'; I always thought it was a `feel-good movie with an edge'.  However, after seeing `Seabiscuit', directed by Gary Ross and starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels and Chris Cooper, I can add it to my personal short list.  Possible Spoilers`Seabiscuit' is the true story of a racing horse, its jockey, trainer and owner, all who overcome some form of adversity in order to succeed. Seabiscuit himself was a horse that was `trained to fail', a horse that was of small stature and, when we first see it, highly temperamental and walking with a slight limp.  Tom Smith, (Cooper) who becomes Seabiscuit's trainer, is a failed rodeo show performer who is naturally a loner and prefers the company of horses to just about any other human.  Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, (Maguire) is taller than the average jockey, blind in one eye, and during the depression, was basically sold into the horse training/jockey life by his parents, who saw a gift in him.  Finally, the eventual owner of Seabiscuit, Charles Howard, (Bridges) is a former failed business owner who finds success in the automotive industry, and after experiencing personal tragedy, finds a faith in this motley group that he may not have previously had. Under Ross' direction, `Seabiscuit' is very well done.  While nothing is overly dynamic, there are no glaring errors or rough spots either.  The film is well paced from beginning to end, and the production values were quite good.  All of the principals are good actors, so there were no surprises there.  Probably the neatest thing that I personally found about the film was the narration by David McCullough, the great author and unmistakable voice of PBS' wonderful `American Experience' series.  While `Seabiscuit' is obviously a dramatic representation of the true story, and liberties were probably taken in order to `Hollywoodize' the script, McCullough's voice-over by virtue of reputation lends a credible documentary feel too the film.The strongest aspect of the film `Seabiscuit' is certainly its inspirational story, whether it is completely factual or not.  It is a film that the normal, cynical me would normally grow at and immediately eschew, were it not for its simplicity and genuinely good spirit.--Shelly",8,0,0,2 August 2004
28 Days Later...," A Zombie Movie... With A Brain!
","There was so much hype about how scary this film was that I had reservations about seeing it, being the fraidy cat that I am.  However, my much younger sister begged me to take her, and I ended up thanking her for it afterward.I should have known that I would like 28 Days Later from the start.  It was directed by Danny Boyle, who has provided us with the great Trainspotting and Shallow Grave among other films.  All of his films have a great frenetic style to them, and 28 Days follows in that tradition.  Shot with digital film, this medium provided a grittiness and realism that could have been too slick if it had been filmed on traditional celluloid.  This is pure speculation, but regardless, the digital format added an almost documentarian feel to the film.  In addition to the fact that the main character, Jim has been hospitalized for a month after an accident and wakes up to find London virtually deserted, he has some zombies that have been infected with a virus called RAGE to contend with.  These are not your late sixties Romero zombies that walked around slowly and moaned for brains - these are new and improved zombies who move at mind numbing speed, vomit blood constantly, and aren't necessarily concerned with turning you into one of them - they don't mind killing you, quickly and painfully.  But don't go into this movie expecting a simple slasher/horror flick. Unlike many horror films of the last forty years, 28 Days doesn't rely on a thin (if at all existent) storyline, teen hotties, and corny humor to supplement its non-action oriented sequences.  This is a film that explores family, utopia and most notably, survival among other themes.  Having said that, it is not the least bit preachy or pretentious, and certainly does not take itself too seriously.  What 28 Days does provide is two hours of disturbing yet compelling imagery, an intelligent voice that will have you deconstructing the plot for hours, even days after you see it, and of course, fantastic zombies. If you don't want to see a horror/suspense film that transcends the plot devices of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street films, don't bother with this one.  But if you are looking for something with a little more mettle, definitely check this one out - even my sister, a die hard slasher flick fan loved it. --Shelly",8,0,0,29 June 2003
City of God," Phenomenal
","There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation. See this film. Now. 9/10--Shelly",9,13,22,4 October 2004
Hellboy," Not worth the time
","Not having read the comic book Hellboy is based on, I went into this film with no preconceptions.  I even went in thinking that the film would be a success if I at least was entertained.  Too bad I was more solicitous than I should have been, because this film was a complete load of crap.  One doesn't expect a lot of depth when it comes to comic book/action films, but the story was just lame.  The Nazi angle could have been interesting, and the first ten minutes of the film were decent in an Indiana Jones kind of way, but the film quickly spiraled into complete tripe.  Ron Perlman as Hellboy, who somehow still managed to look like Ron Perlman was just ridiculous.  His corny remarks every five or ten minutes wore thin within ten minutes.  I also don't think that one is supposed to fall asleep multiple times during a loud action film, but I was so bored (or perhaps it was a defense mechanism) that I did just that.  I try to find one thing good (or bad, if it's actually a positive review) about a film, and Hellboy's good thing was the Nazi assassin.  Had the film centered around him a bit more, I would have at least taken a bit of delight when this creepy monster was on the screen, but unfortunately I was forced to just listen to witty bon monts from Mr. Hellboy and try to figure out how much the fish guy was influenced by Greedo from Star Wars.  Don't waste your time.  This film isn't even remotely entertaining, and is beyond redemption.--Shelly",Null,0,1,13 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Jaw dropping special effects and cinematography
","The second film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy literally starts where the last film ended, but provides a slight amount of subtle exposition so that the viewer can remember who the characters are and their mission, but not so much that insults the intelligence of the serious fan. 
Not being a fantasy film fan or a Lord of the Rings fan per se, I felt the same after this film that I did after the first installment.  While the story may not be in my chosen genre, the production of the film is absolutely amazing.  I kept thinking to myself, `Where did this guy come from?'  The other Peter Jackson films I have seen other than the Lord of the Rings were The Frighteners and Heavenly Creatures  both good films, but not remotely in the same category or class as LOTR.  The special effects were jaw dropping, particularly the presentation of Gollum.  I am critical of CGI because it is often done so poorly, but it was hard to believe that his character was not real due to its seamlessness.  Additionally, the spectacular fight scenes and images of thousands of men and beasts alike were astounding.  Unfortunately I can only really speak of the technical merits because there are so many characters involved in so many different plot lines that I found myself asking the friend I was with, `Now is that the guy who.' And `Oh wait, they were going to.' Constantly.  However, this should in no way be construed as a negative to the film, as it is simply a matter of my general disinterest in the actual plot in favor of the spectacle itself. 
Having said that, I definitely look forward to the final installment, after which I will make a day of it, sit down with all three and have a LOTR marathon:  Best case scenario, I will actually get into the plot.  Worst case scenario, I will experience excellent filmmaking.--Shelly",7,0,1,22 September 2003
The Incredibles," It's got something for everyone
","Generally not being a fan of Pixar animation (or most American animated films for that matter) I admit that while I watched 'The Incredibles' with some trepidation, I was optimistic because of a couple of factors: First of all, I'm a comic book/super hero geek from way back and will see most of the films that fall into this genre. (I even endured the horrid 'Hellboy' because of this ugly fascination) Secondly, Sarah Vowell voices the character of the Violet, the daughter, and pretty much anything that Vowell touches turns to darkly humored intellectual gold. And finally, the writer and director was Brad Bird, one of the original guys behind 'The Simpsons', one of the greatest television shows of all time. So I asked myself, what could possibly go wrong? Thankfully, not a whole lot. From the action-packed beginning of the film where we are introduced to the majority of the characters, it is clear that this is going to be film that is going to appeal primarily to adults, with enough sight gags and silliness to keep the kids entertained throughout. Chronicling the lives of a family of superheroes, 'The Incredibles' manages to create a plausible family story (though the family is certainly different from most). After a series of perceived screw ups, the government has cracked down on super heroes and have placed them into the witness protection program. Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is now an overweight claims processor for an insurance company who is unsatisfied with his humdrum life and longs to relive his former glory. Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Hunter) is his wife, and seems to have adjusted to her suburban life nicely and enjoys taking care of the home and being a mother to her children Dash, Violet and baby Jack Jack. Sometimes at night, however, Bob has been sneaking out with his friend Lucius Best/Frozone (Jackson) to listen to police scanners and, when a crime or emergency occurs, answer the call of duty before anyone else arrives. When Bob receives a mysterious package from someone asking him to become a 'contract super hero' and do various tasks for them, he jumps at the chance, a decision that puts himself, his family, and the world in peril.Throughout my viewing of 'The Incredibles', I frequently found myself forgetting that the film was technically a children's film, and also that it was even animated. The animation was nearly flawless and the presentation had many elements of a celluloid, live-action film such as various camera angles, etc. One thing that most impressed me was the voice talent; being a fan of some genres of anime, I find myself only watching the show/film in the original language because the English dubs are just mind-numbingly awful. So even though this was an American-produced film, I was still wary of that aspect. Early on it became clear that there was no reason to be concerned, because all of the voice talent (particularly that of Hunter and Nelson) were truly great. As I mentioned earlier, I was very excited about Sarah Vowell's involvement, because this is not something she normally participates in. She did a good job, but it turned out to be almost distractingly strange to hear her voice in this context; normally I'm hearing her reading one of her essays on PRI's, 'This American Life'. Obviously this isn't a criticism for the film itself, however. The story was remarkably compelling and clever, and there were a couple of good laughs, though not as many as I expected. Still, I would consider this film, rather than a comedy, more of an action film with some comedic elements thrown in, so I wasn't expecting a rip-roaring laugh fest.Overall, I enjoyed 'The Incredibles', a critique that is all the more meaningful when one realizes how little I like or tolerate films that are aimed at kids (my disturbing obsession with Disney's 'The Little Mermaid' notwithstanding). As to whether the film deserves its current slot in the IMDb Top 100? That I'm not so sure about, particularly when I look at some of the films that are edged out when new films enter the list. But generally, 'The Incredibles' is a decent film that was very enjoyable. 6/10 Side note: I rarely mention DVD extras in my reviews, but I kind of have to in this case. 'The Incredibles' is really heavy on the extras, but the two that I happened to watch were wonderful, and shouldn't be missed if possible. The first is the Sarah Vowell video essay (it was absolutely hilarious and really does a good job of showing who she is) and the second was the short film that showed a scene between Jack Jack and his babysitter that was not a part of the film. The person I watched the movie with and I both agreed that it contained some better laughs than even the movie itself.",6,0,3,17 May 2005
Hero," A film so beautiful it literally took my breath away at times
","Before I delve into this review/random maniacal comments about the film 'Hero', directed by Yimou Zhang I want to make one thing clear. YES, I realize that this film is two years old. I have mentioned to several people that I saw this film, and upon mentioning the word 'Hero' I am interrupted with, 'You KNOW it was up for an Oscar two years ago, right?' For me that's like asking, 'You KNOW that Citizen Kane was in black & white, right?' As a matter of fact, a friend of mine had the DVD of this film over a year ago, when I sat and watched a good twenty minutes of the footage. Taken out of context, I found the scene that I watched to be ridiculously dramatic. A year later, I sat in the theater and was enveloped in one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my life.Having never been a fan of Jet Li's work, at least his American films, I wasn't sure what to expect of the performances in 'Hero', a story told mostly in flashback form, of a nameless man who defeats three assassins in order to protect the most powerful warlord of ancient China. I needn't have been concerned, because while Jet Li's performance was average, his supporting cast was wonderful, particularly Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, both of whom I recognized from another great Chinese film, 'In the Mood for Love'. Both actors are able to speak volumes while saying very little, and sometimes, unbelievably, while keeping their faces frozen in one expression or another. The story is deceptive; what you think is simple really isn't, and therefore made 'Hero' stand a bit above other films in the 'samurai' genre. What is truly the star of the film is the unparalleled beauty of the film itself. The use of color is astounding; vivid blues, reds, greens, and stark white  every color is intended to mean something different; it is up to the audience to discern their significance. Fight scenes are more like intricate ballet dances than the classic definition of 'fight scene'. The actors fly through the air and fight in improbable positions, none of which is new; we've already been intricately schooled in this technique since 2000's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' (and probably before), but the difference lies in the presentation and class with which these scenes are presented in 'Hero'. Zhang was able to employ a technique that is teetering on the brink of overuse and give it freshness by providing such beautiful surroundings: The water soaked fight between Nameless and Sky is a study in Honor. The duel in the forest between Flying Snow and Moon is so lush with its vivid red costumes and thousands of bright yellow swirling leaves that I literally gasped for breath because I had been holding my breath in awe. Maggie Cheung is the other standout in terms of breathtaking beauty. There were many times, particularly during the scenes at the calligraphy school, where I was held absolutely captive by her beauty and grace, something that I rarely even notice in actors during most films because I'm paying too much attention to the production values. Again, this is Zhang framing his subject masterfully. I also noticed a heavy anime influence in 'Hero', mostly in the fight scenes; a person is pushed into a wall and the wall crumbles but the person is fine, and particularly one scene involving a duel between Nameless and Flying Snow  there is a shot of Flying Snow that is pure anime; I have seen it in several series and it is compelling and beautiful. I have managed to ramble haphazardly about the things I loved about the film 'Hero', but haven't said anything about what I didn't like about it. That's because there isn't one thing that I didn't like about the film. Honestly, not one single thing. After I saw the film on Friday night, I turned the film over and over in my head, inside out, all weekend and the beginning of this week. I came up with nothing that I can lodge a viable complaint about. 'Hero' is obviously not going to be for everyone; die hard action film people are going to find it too boring, and it's going to be too much of a samurai film for those in the romantic comedy crowd. All I can say in summary of 'Hero' is that I've rarely had tears streaming down my face so often during a film, both because it is rare that I see anything so beautiful presented to me on film accompanied with a wonderful and emotional story. Do yourself a favor and see this film on the big screen  it shouldn't be missed.--Shelly",9,0,0,1 September 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Visually Stunning
","In an age where there are so many movies provided for us, it's easy to subscribe to the cookie-cutter films that Hollywood turns out.  It's also easy for a jaded old salty dog like myself to find tedium in a lot of what is offered to us today.  A movie that makes me feel like I am about 8 years old because I am excited and enthralled at what is happening on the screen is therefore, a rarity.  This film is a rare gem that made me feel that way.Moulin Rouge is the story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most popular courtesan in Paris and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), her lover.  It is an unlikely romance between an unattainable woman and an impoverished writer, which must be kept hidden because Satine has been essentially betrothed to the man who is financially backing the Moulin Rouge, The Duke (Richard Roxborough).  Before this film, I could tolerate Kidman, but never thought she was anything above a mediocre actress.  She always played a kind of 'ice queen' in her films, with average results.  In Moulin Rouge however, she literally blossoms.  She proves that she can play comedy, tragedy and even sing fairly well in the course of one film.  I've always liked MacGregor, who has shown a lot of versatility in his films which have been of the independent genre for the most part.  Roxborough is both hilarious and frightening as the controlling Duke, and Jim Broadbent is absolutely amazing as Harold Zidler, the Emcee of the Moulin Rouge and father figure to Satine.  Other than Kidman's performance, I would wager that John Leguizamo as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is the best example of casting against type.  Historically, Toulouse-Lautrec was an extremely tragic figure, and the film, while giving us the free-spirit elements to his character, also subtlety explores his darker side as well.The biggest star of Moulin Rouge however is the director, Baz Luhrmann. While I did not particularly like his first film, Strictly Ballroom, I did appreciate the colorful set designs he employed.  I feel he sharpened his vision in his second film, Romeo & Juliet, and then achieved perfection in this film.  There is so much to appreciate:  The use of sharp colors, the fantastical elements, the innovative cinematography and slick camera angles. The use of modern music to tell a story of life 100 years ago was daring, but I feel it fit into the film amazingly well.  Luhrmann has become one of those directors that I will definitely seek out, regardless of the subject matter because I know that the production values will be more than worth the price of admission.**Possible Spoiler Alert**I watched this film with a friend who was really into the movie but ended up assessing that she didn't like it because she didn't like the ending since it bummed her out.  You are told the ending within the first 5 minutes of the film, but that doesn't prepare you for the scene when it is actually acted out.  In his last two films, Baz Luhrmann has pretty much made a habit of riding you on an emotional roller coaster - you feel happy when the characters are happy and even a cynical person like me was into the romantic story because it was so convincingly played out.  I like to liken what happens next with his films as 'getting hit by a truck, then run over repeatedly.'  He brings you to an emotional high and then pretty much crushes you, even though you knew what was coming.  I have seen this movie about 5 times now and I was still bawling at several points in the film. 
So if you're looking for a pick me up and you want to see a great romantic comedy, this one is probably not the one you want for that mood.  But if you are looking for a well-rounded film that is visually shocking and brilliantly enacted and directed, this is a must see.  It is definitely one of my favorites of this century and still my pick for Best Picture of 2001.--Shelly",9,1,2,5 May 2003
Patton," Excellent historical epic
","Unfortunately, I had the disadvantage of seeing this film in two parts Â– half one night and the other half about a month later, however this did not prevent me from making the assessment that it is an excellent film.Obviously, George C. Scott makes the film as the General.  Additionally, the scenery and epic production values handsomely compliment the excellent script.  I've heard reviews and recounts of the film describing it as a `war film'.  After finally seeing Patton, I would consider it more of a biopic than anything.  We come away from the film with enough understanding of the man to see why he was great, but also leave with enough of a sense of mystery about him that makes the viewer want to do some additional research should they be so inclined.Patton is definitely one of those films that should be seen once in one's life.  Patton lived up to all of the preconceived ideas I had gleaned from the reviews of others.  --Shelly",7,1,4,2 December 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Another solid and gut-wrenching film from Eastwood
","It is an interesting phenomenon to me that some actors, regardless of their popularity, are much better directors than actors. Sidney Pollack and Ron Howard come to mind immediately, but I feel that the personification of this idea is Clint Eastwood, whose film 'Million Dollar Baby' is absolutely wonderful.'Million Dollar Baby' is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank), a waitress described as 'white trash', who is in reality, everything her reputation is not. Born and raised in the deep south and raised in a family of lazy, horrible people, she turns up at the training gym of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), begging him to train her for the women's boxing circuit. When he repeatedly says no, she continues to train furiously, until he relents and the two (plus Frankie's right hand man Eddie Dupris, played by Morgan Freeman) strike up a working relationship that quickly develops into a deep friendship. When Maggie is injured during the most important match of her life, their relationship reaches an even greater level, where they both have to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.I went into 'Million Dollar Baby' with a couple of preconceptions, something that I try not to do. Luckily, they ended up working in favor of me enjoying the film. Firstly, of the Eastwood-directed films I have seen, (namely 'Play Misty for Me', 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River', I acknowledged that they were good films. In the case of 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River', they were really good, if not great films. 'Million Dollar Baby' falls squarely into that category as well. The film's story is compelling (and somewhat controversial, at least for some people) until its conclusion, a very refreshing thing to behold, particularly nowadays when twenty pages of script seem to constitute a feature length screenplay.Regarding the script, there was not a moment when I didn't buy what was being presented to me, and I think that this is partly thanks to the superior performances of the three primary actors. 'Performance' isn't even a fair word to use in this case because there was never a moment where I felt that they were 'acting'. Despite the heavy dramatic themes, histrionics were not present. Hilary Swank is simply amazing, and shows that given the right material, she will take the role and make it hers alone; I cannot fathom anyone else doing her complicated role any kind of justice. Morgan Freeman  someone give this man an Oscar. I'm not entirely sure how many times you can be consistently excellent in a role before they are actually given public recognition for their talents, but once again, he pulls out a great supporting role as a variant of his 'Shawshank' character, only with a lot more vinegar in him. The biggest surprise for me, however, was Clint Eastwood. As I mentioned earlier, one can appreciate someone for being an icon, but an iconic status does not make one a good actor. (See John Wayne, or more recently, J.Lo for other examples.) His performance in 'Million Dollar Baby' however, was sublime. Frankie's character is a study in dynamics; he is curmudgeonly yet generous, fierce but tired. He attends church daily, but on some level questions his faith. Perhaps it was the role that he gave himself, but he was a perfect fit. Previously, I'd only seen Eastwood as a squinting, growling man in his roles; and frankly, he does the same thing in this role as well  but in this case it works wonderfully.As far as Eastwood's direction, it is once again dead-on. The film, despite its violent and emotional themes is very warm, with its lighting and cinematography. The pacing is also excellent. Once again, however, while I feel the film was very good, and I certainly wouldn't be staging my 342nd boycott if it won an Oscar, there was nothing about the film that excited me. The story and the performances grabbed me, but I didn't feel 'excited' when I left, as I have with about a half dozen other films I've seen in the past year. I mentioned Ron Howard earlier in regard to acting, and I feel compelled to invoke his name again in this instance. His films are good, solid films. But (and not to personalize this too much) when, for example, I saw that 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Moulin Rouge!' were both up for Best Picture, I was disappointed when the former won because it was a 'safe' choice. A good movie, but nothing dynamic about it. And that's how I feel about Eastwood's films; they are good films, I can't find a lot of things wrong with them, but in general they don't excite me.I still give 'Million Dollar Baby' a 7/10, however because it is a very good film, and I think it is very deserving of its Oscar nomination and of the many accolades it has received, both from film critics and regular theatergoers like us alike.--Shelly",7,1,3,17 February 2005
Garden State," Not a bad first effort
","Zach Braff's directorial debut, 'Garden State' gives us the story of Andrew Largeman, a thinly employed L.A. actor whose mother dies, leading him to visit his home state of New Jersey to attend her funeral. Soon after he arrives, he falls back into his friendships with people he went to high school with, most notably Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard and continues in the barely-there and shallow relationship he shares with his father. (Ian Holm) From there he encounters Sam (Natalie Portman) a girl who is off the scale in terms of quirkiness. He spends several days hanging out with his friends and avoiding his father, all in search for deeper meaning in his life.For a first time directing effort, Braff did a pretty good job with 'Garden State'. Two things were glaringly obvious to me from the onset; most striking was that he has obviously been heavily influenced by the music video age. The use of slow-motion for dramatic effect, various film speeds, etc. all show direct influence. The other thing is that he is not afraid to let the camera focus on his face  he was very comfortable to give the camera many long, languid looks; so many that the thought popped into my head that he probably practiced these looks in his bathroom mirror or something. Certainly both of these points did not take anything away from the film, indeed the dynamic cinematography was an asset. Unfortunately, the film was higher on style, but the story lacked real meat. There were several times where I found myself looking forward to some plot points (particularly the one involving Andrew's father) being expounded upon, but they just kind of fizzled with a little metaphorical sigh. Having said that, there were several plot elements that didn't pan out in the manner in which we've become accustomed to with Hollywood films, so that was certainly refreshing, and stood out as a definite positive. Also, I appreciated the 'real life  real speak' aspects of the film. It's obvious that the film was written by a Generation X-er, inspired by pop culture, because there were many times during the film where I would chuckle to myself because I'd had an almost identical conversation with someone in my life at one time or another.Unfortunately, the biggest negative in the film was probably the biggest name of the film- Natalie Portman. Her character, Sam, is quirkiness personified. She says pretty much anything she possibly can, and contorts her body into goofy positions to scream 'I'm different and perky!' as loud as possible. Whereas I found Kate Winslet's 'quirky girl' character endearing in another independent film from earlier this year, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Portman simply grated on me more and more throughout the film. Rather than thinking she was special, unusual and deep I found her to be a negative component of the film. Conversely, Peter Sarsgaard, who has been REALLY good in the few films I've seen him in, kept it up in 'Garden State'. His obviously intelligent and well-spoken Mark is a solid, believable and complex character and Sarsgaard embodies this character brilliantly.I've never seen the show that made Braff 'famous', 'Scrubs', so this was my exposure to him and his talents. 'Garden State' is certainly flawed, but it is quite good for his first work and I'm looking forward to his future writing and directorial career. I enjoyed 'Garden State' on a basic level enough where I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates independent cinema, but I didn't get the emotional, intellectual or spiritual impact I was led to believe would occur based on word of mouth. Braff is a long way from Hal Ashby-caliber writing and directing, but this is a decent start. Still a good film nonetheless, 'Garden State' is definitely worth a look.--Shelly",7,4,8,20 September 2004
8 Mile," Not bad for a first-timer
","I had heard so many times already that Eminem had done a great job in this film which is loosely based on his life, so I wasn't entirely surprised that his performance was very good.  The story itself is fairly formulaic, but Hanson directs it with sufficient style that somewhat enhances a very basic plot.  There were several `throwaway' characters, and a pretty derivative conclusion but it definitely is worth a viewing even if you don't appreciate rap, because despite being a central plot point, there is actually not a lot of performance involved.  I'm certainly not hating myself for having finally watched it.--Shelly",5,0,1,4 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The wait was more than worth it
","Being a Tarantino fan going way back to the early 1990's, I probably was more cynical and critical going into this film than those who may have discovered him during his Pulp Fiction heyday.  From the first seconds of this film however, you know that you are in for a wild ride, and I fell in love immediately.Admittedly, this film had a couple of strikes against it before I saw it.  I am *not* a fan of Uma Thurman, and I was not crazy about the Tarantino/Miramax decision to turn his one film into two.  Now is my time to (delightedly) admit that I am wrong.  Thurman's `The Bride' exudes so much strength and power that I could almost see the testosterone dripping from her.  Not only did Thurman handle this multi-dimensional role, she *owned* it.  I want a `Bride' action figure for my car dashboard.  I want to be `The Bride' for Halloween. My adulation of this character is unprecedented since the age of oh, 4 years old when I wanted to be Princess Leia.  I found myself emulating Uma with any stick or vaguely sword-like object for the next week like some kind of drooling fan-girl.  Additionally, the decision to turn this into two films was indeed a wise one.  As a three hour film, this film would have caused spontaneous combustion of random movie goers due to sensory overload.  While watching this film, I still had a nagging feeling of dread that the ending would be unsatisfactory, but without providing a hint of a spoiler, you can trust me that it was *very* satisfactory and clean.As for the direction itself, Tarantino proved his mettle as a master.  Kill Bill is stylish, action-packed, humorous and intelligent.  Above all, it is just plain *cool*.  Once again, Tarantino provides us with a film laden with pop-culture and a killer soundtrack that accompany the scenes brilliantly. While the entire film is superb, the last final major scene in the House of Blue Leaves is like a 30 minute orgasm.  The various trailers and television commercials feature certain parts of this scene, but blessedly do not give away the full impact the entire scene has on the viewer.  The incredible blocking and the rapid fire change in cinematography are two elements that make this scene so good it is literally shocking.  An honorable mention for the un-win-able fight for greatest scene in the film is the anime sequence: a remarkable, shocking and most of all, creative method of telling O-Ren's back story.There is so much more to applaud about Kill Bill, but it is truly a film that needs to be experienced in order to understand why it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  It is easily my favorite film of 2003 and finally brings back masterful imagination and fun to cinema.  Kill Bill is like a love poem to the great martial arts movies of the 60's & 70's and it made me fall in love with Tarantino all over again.--Shelly",10,0,1,23 October 2003
The Last Emperor," A sweeping epic
","Every time I mention to someone that I hadn't seen The Last Emperor, the first reaction is disbelief, and the second is `It is such a good movie'. And indeed it was.  I'm not sure what the non-director's cut was, because the version I saw was the director's cut, but it was absolutely fantastic. Not once did I think that the nearly four hour run time was too long because the story was so compelling, the direction brilliant and the acting engaging.  I find it hard to believe that it took me this long to see this film, and I also find it hard to believe it is not in the IMDB Top 250.  Its Best Picture and Director honors were well-deserved, and the Oscar-winning score is amazing.  I'll admit that I was left hanging a bit in regard to the Emperor's wife, but that is the only thing that I can remotely find slightly lacking in this film.  An outstanding film, The Last Emperor is entertaining, informative and important.--Shelly",8,4,5,12 April 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A worthy remake
","Much has been made about whether or not 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', directed by Tim Burton, was even necessary. The original film about Willy Wonka, Mel Stuart's 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (1971) is a bona fide classic, so it was inevitable that there would be some trepidation in the wake of a remake. Fortunately, Tim Burton not only is the best man to helm the project, but the film, while having many similarities to be sure, does differ substantially from Stuart's.There are going to be inevitable comparisons to the original film, and whether or not this is entirely fair, one cannot help but look at some main similarities and differences. Both films certainly have fantastically odd set designs, though (perhaps being a product of its time) the original is pretty psychedelic. It is hard to describe Tim Burton's sets in most of his fantasy films, though he has made enough of a name for himself in that he's probably been used as an adjective (A set being 'Burton-esqueÂ… I know I've personally used this phrase). The Bucket's house is impossibly slanted and the 'garden' in the beginning of the factory tour is not just colorful, but looks like Dali designed it. Burton has traditionally made some really slick looking films, and his style is just as present in this one. One of my favorite scenes in particular was in the sterile room where Mike Teevee meets the end of his tour. The stark white is the same from the original film, but there was something about the presentation, from the lighting to the funky goggles they were wearing, that made me really take notice. The many different Oompa Loompas were replaced with the hilarious Deep Roy (superimposed on many bodies), with songs that were not only updated and more contemporary, but ones that were mostly written by Dahl himself. Unfortunately I am at a disadvantage in that I have not read the book and therefore am not certain which script changes (from the original) can be attributed to Burton's production or to the book itself, but I really enjoyed the background information on Wonka; it not only gave him a more human appeal (despite his bizarre appearance) but really gave the production more depth than I felt the original had.When I first heard about this project last year, and learned that Depp had signed on as Wonka, I was really excited because I firmly believe that not only is he one of the greatest contemporary actors working, but he and Burton are the greatest actor/director team in decades. Both people, while they have shown their versatility (mainly Depp) are better known for their creativity, and as a result, every project they have done together has been nothing short of spectacular. There is no way to compare the performances of Gene Wilder, the original Wonka and that of Depp because they are very different and both great, but I can aver that any trepidations that some may have about whether he can do the part justice are quashed in about 30 seconds. Made up with ghoulishly white face makeup on a chiseled face that looks like it could cut stone, with a toothy grin and a shiny straight pageboy hair cut, if Depp were about two degrees more frightening-looking, he would be nightmare fuel. His portrayal of Wonka and his ironic dislike of children is less sarcastic and more phobic. He clearly doesn't feel anything but disdain for most of the children, but deals with them on an almost childish level himself, spouting out 'Ew's' and bickering. His equal dislike of the parents is just as funny, but it all comes together, psychologically, with the inclusion of his own back-story. Freddie Highmore is, frankly, adorable. Emitting SO much more charm than Peter Ostrum, the original Charlie Bucket, he not only shows that he can act, (though I discovered this while watching 'Finding Neverland') but he can charm the pants off an avowed kid hater. (That would be me) When I saw this film, I was with my boyfriend and a friend of ours, and I believe that we were the only 'adults' in the theater who weren't accompanied by kids. Yet, I found that while everyone in the theater seemed to be enjoying the film, it was the three of us who laughed the loudest. The original film was wicked at times, but I think that 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' had moments where it was downright evil, and I thought the whole film was (no pun intended, really) simply delicious. There are few films where I sit through them with a big dumb grin on my face throughout, ('Moulin Rouge', any Coen Brothers film comes to mind) and this one definitely goes on the short list. There are so many appealing elements to this film that make it, in my opinion, an instant classic, and a film that is as kid-friendly as the original. That is to say, the kids will like it, but the adults watching it with them are going to pick up on how twisted it really is. 8/10 --Shelly",8,1,4,5 August 2005
Big Fish," Maybe not his 'masterpiece' but a film with real heart
","There has been so much hype regarding Big Fish:  `It's Tim Burton's masterpiece', `Tim Burton finally grew up', etc.  Apparently I'm unclear on the concept of `growing up' since this film is a fairy tale from start to finish, even the scenes set in `reality'.  Not only that, it is difficult for me to put a finger on what is the `best' Tim Burton film.  If I had to make a movie reference to illustrate the difficulty of executing this task, I would have to call it my `Sophie's Choice'.  So while I cannot call it `his masterpiece' in the context that it transcends his earlier work, I can definitively assert that it is indeed A masterpiece.Big Fish is the story of a man coming to terms with the impending death of his father, and his desperate attempt to find out who his father really is  a task he has been trying to complete for most of his adult life, as his father has told him nothing but tall tales about his life since he can remember.  It is a touching and exhilarating story  masterfully told through the eyes and ears of our actors.  We are not told these stories in a simple narrative, we hear it for the first (or, sometimes depending on which family member is in the room, not the first) time, and experience it along with that character.  The acting in Big Fish is remarkable.  Most of the characters, with the exception of the other members of Finney's family are eccentric and exciting.  Circus folk, giants, Siamese twins and residents of a fairy tale town are all enacted delightfully.  Lange, as Finney's wife exudes a calm, sweet and quiet Southern charm, despite the fact that we know she is actually emotionally wracked.  And Billy Crudup, who plays Finney's son, is both passionate and angry  an adult, yet possibly hoping that the stories he has heard ad nauseum that he is hopelessly irritated by are actually true.  The character we see the most in the film is Ewan McGregor, who portrays the patriarch as a young man.  He did an absolutely amazing job of it  his energy, innocence and passion are all apparent with something as simple as a gesture or facial expression.Possible SpoilersWhile the story was good and the acting was as wonderful, what really made this movie an instant personal classic was Burton's imagery.  The rich circus scenes, the little town in the middle of the treacherous forest that slightly harkened back to his Edward Scissorhands set  these were scenes that were expertly set and blocked.  Then add in Burton's flair  the bright colors, the improbable beauty of Carnies, and a field of golden flowers. These are visual moments that are virtually unforgettable.  Even the now famous image of time stopping for a moment when one discovers their true love, where he has to wade through suspended popcorn to see that person  Burton has taken the feeling that some of us have and visualized it for us, creating an incredibly touching moment.  I challenge anyone to not even get a sniffle at the end of this film. Sometimes a filmmaker will tug at your tear ducts for the sake of drama and emotion, (Read: Titanic) which usually irritates me because it is usually superfluous in my opinion.  I genuinely bawled and felt my heart ache at the end of this movie, and was really wanting an emotional release of some kind, barring full-out blubbering in a packed theater, and not once did I remotely feel manipulated.  If people think that Big Fish is Tim Burton `all grown up', that's fine  then I just really hope that he continues his growth and continues this trend.  I like his fun movies, and I like his intense movies, but this was a masterful blend of both.--Shelly",9,0,0,11 February 2004
The Insider," Perfect pacing makes this a great film
","There are very few films that last over two and a half hours that can keep my attention from waning even just a bit.  Sometimes it will just be a two second `what time is it?' check, sometimes a more involved interruption depending on the quality and pacing of the film.  `The Insider' is so well done that had I not been interrupted a couple of times, I would not have strayed from the film for even a moment.  Its perfect pacing takes it from `really good' status to `great' status.Russell Crowe is unrecognizable as Jeffrey Wigand, a middle aged, pudgy and graying former tobacco industry scientist who, after being fired for expressing an unpopular opinion of their procedures, is harassed to the point of near insanity by said company when he threatens to tell all on `60 Minutes'.  Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, a senior producer on the show who fights to get the story, then finds himself in the position of having to deal with the fact that CBS won't air the show for fear of retribution.
If this film were not a true story, it would be incredible, but the fact that it is based on true events is both mind-boggling and compelling at the same time.  Wigand is an almost Shakespearean character in that he has to make some unbelievably difficult decisions, where the results aren't going to necessarily be good for anyone, and Crowe is masterful in this role. Pacino is always good, but he is all energy and fire in this film as we see him struggle with this incredible string of events.  Michael Mann can't make a film under two and a half hours, but that isn't even a factor in this film because the pacing is perfect and without any dry moments or gaps.  The cinematography is interesting in that the lighting almost has a blue haze to it, yet it maintains its sharpness.  Unfortunately, the film has a cheesy soundtrack since Mann can't get out of the 80's, but it is a minute criticism because no film can be perfect.  Watch this film when you have a couple of hours where you are not going to be interrupted, because this is one movie that is going to hold your attention for its entirety.  With tour de force performances, a compelling plot and excellent film making, `The Insider' is a film that deserves all of the accolades it received when it was released and since.--Shelly",9,1,2,14 July 2004
Quiz Show," Fantastic film, phenomenal performances
","It would be pretty surprising if Quiz Show, Robert Redford's film about the 1950's quiz show scandals was anything short of excellent.  The principal actors give phenomenal performances:  Fiennes' Van Doren is usually unflappable and cold, but manages to allow vulnerability to surface at times, and Turturro's Stempel is a study in almost sociopathic and manic behavior.  What allows both actors to transcend mere greatness is their ability to make the viewer both admire and detest their characters with something as subtle as a glance or body language.  Morrow's character of the `whistle-blower' is there as the moral fiber; the outsider who looks upon the situation both with objectivity and as the devil's advocate. 
Redford's direction is rich and well-paced.  There were not any slow moments in the film, and he did not have to adhere to rapid-fire editing to achieve the momentum of the film.  Perhaps the subject matter is a factor, but I have found that with the exception of `Ordinary People', the films I have seen under Redford's direction have been good in a technical respect but lean toward the maudlin.  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions. Quiz Show is an excellent film that I highly recommend, especially to see the razor-sharp performances of Fiennes and Turturro.

Annie Hall," A perfect romantic comedy
","`Annie Hall', long thought to be Woody Allen's opus, is perhaps a perfect romantic comedy because it not only shows the happy, touching moments of relationships, but also displays the reality of coupling  the occasional waning of interest in one another, the hypercritical moments, etc.  It is absolutely brilliantly written; Woody Allen exhibits his usual dry humor and self-deprecation, but also his sensitive, passionate and romantic side.  It was because of this film that I fell in love with Woody Allen at the age of twelve (take your cheap shot here) and almost twenty years later he still is that intellectual, bookish and humorous ideal.  Diane Keaton was his muse and co-star for this film, and they are perfect counterparts  so much so that their interaction onscreen doesn't seem like viewing two actors in a film, but is a much more voyeuristic experience.  Watching `Annie Hall' is like sitting at a bistro table and observing another couple a few tables away, and that is just one of the elements that make this film so endearing. Most people can relate to at least some aspects of Alvy and Annie's relationship, which helps make this film a timeless one. 
However, `Annie Hall' is not just a good romantic comedy; it is a film that engages some unusual storytelling techniques.  Actors speak directly to the audience, characters interact with strangers on the street who just happen to know the answers to the personal questions posed, there is a brief animation scene, etc.  While none of these approaches were new in 1977, their execution was inspired.  `Annie Hall' is like a fond memory, or a favorite old song  anytime I have discussed this film with others their smiling expressions are usually tinged with a hint of nostalgia, because one can look back on either their past or current relationship and do what precious few films allow us to do  relate on a personal level.--Shelly",9,159,210,16 May 2004
Singin' in the Rain," How rare! A thoroughly enjoyable musical!
","Not being a fan of the Musical genre, when I come across a musical film that I enjoy, it's pretty much an anomaly.  `Singin' in the Rain' is one of those exceptions, because it is not only immensely enjoyable, but it is sarcastic and intelligent as well.  `Singin' in the Rain' stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and is a romantic comedy about the advent of the talking picture in 1920's Hollywood.  While a lot of the jokes are over the top and biting, one can't help but imagine that this is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the hysteria over talkies and the scramble by the studios to compete.  Probably the most striking thing about `Singin' in the Rain' is the unbelievable talent, particularly the performances of O'Connor and Kelly. When they start dancing and doing their shtick, I'm suddenly ten years old again and grinning like a fool at the screen.  There are few films that make me laugh out loud, and often, but this film is one of them.  One of the very few criticisms I would have about this film is the scene with Gene Kelly (`Gotta Dance!') toward the end of the film that is about twenty minutes long and pretty much grinds the film to a screeching halt for me.  Until this (unbearably long) musical number, the film is moving at a really quick pace, but it takes a few minutes after this scene for the film to pick up steam again in time for the hilarious conclusion.  I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind the decision to put such a long and displaced number in the film, but if the intent was to show the irony of Hollywood, etc. I'm sure they could have been a bit more concise about it.  (And still showcase Cyd Charrise's amazing legs!)It takes a lot for a comedy, and especially a musical comedy at that, to turn me into a drooling fangirl, but `Singin' in the Rain' does that every time to me.  This is a feel-great movie that is truly a fantastic classic.--Shelly",9,3,7,14 July 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A haunting, lyrical and overall fantastic film
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is so visually exciting and intelligently written, that I felt my mind working in overdrive after seeing it in the theater a couple of weeks ago.  I craved conversation, and I wanted to sit and discuss it with anyone I could, and immediately wanted to watch it again.  It was touching, smart, funny, and mind-bending.  I know that a lot has been made of Carrey's performance so I won't belabor the issue, but let me just say that I completely forgot I was watching Jim Carrey.  (Something I consider to be one of the highest compliments I can pay to the man.)  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a beautiful film, and a Charlie Kaufman first for me  I actually wasn't scratching my head and saying, `I loved it, but.huh?!' afterward, instead I was just saying `I loved it.'-- Shelly",8,0,1,8 April 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," Still hilarious after two decades
","`This is Spinal Tap' was such a brilliant concept twenty years ago  a documentary about a fake rock band, that people thought (and some still think) that it is a `real' film.  Unlike a lot of comedies to come out of the past two decades, the humor is still relevant and still as hilarious, long after the glam-rock and hair-band phases have (blissfully) passed us by  for the most part.It's easy to categorize the primary actors by their seminal roles throughout the years, Michael McKean as Lenny, Harry Shearer as many voices on The Simpsons, and Christopher Guest as well, the guy in `Heartbeeps' I guess, but after having seen all of the Guest `mockumentaries' and revisiting `Spinal Tap' after catching bits and pieces throughout the years, their talent is undeniable.  It's also testimony to the brilliance of the writing when one realizes how many jokes and site gags are still scattered in pop culture today  there were several cases where I thought, `So THAT'S where that came from!'  `This is Spinal Tap' is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past twenty years, a high compliment from someone who doesn't find what generally passes as `comedy' funny unless it's from a film made prior to 1965 or a film directed by Woody Allen.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it  and watch out for the DVD with the various trailers on it.  The `Cheese Rolling' trailer is a riot.--Shelly",9,0,4,10 May 2004
Toy Story 2," Heaven forbid  I didn't like it
","I'm starting to wonder if there is a purgatory for people like me who actually admit to people that they don't like mainstream films that 'Everybody Loves'. Like 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and just about every Meg Ryan film, I just plain didn't like 'Toy Story 2.' (I can hear the audible gasp.) It's not that I am completely jaded when it comes to 'kids' films  or even more specifically Pixar films  I think I chuckled once or twice during the original 'Toy Story' and I actually liked 'Finding Nemo.' While I'll admit that I was basically forced to watch those two films and 'Toy Story 2 for that matter actually, just because it is on the IMDb Top 250 list, I am not afraid to assert that I enjoyed the former two. The latter though. Ugh.'Toy Story 2' basically picks up where the first left off, the conflict this time being that Woody is stolen and is about to be sent to a Japanese museum with three other toys from his 1950's television show. The other toys he normally hangs out with have to try to rescue him before this happens. I chuckled once, and that was when they showed the 'Rock-em Sock-em Robots.'That was pretty much all I could muster for this film, which I found to be boring and lame. The story was topical in terms of the whole 'collector' idea, sure. But it was flat and just plain banal. I didn't find the little one-liners remotely endearing, and what I found nostalgic in the first one (the toys themselves) were old news by the second film. I guess I'm not cut out for these kinds of films; either I expect a little more, or I just don't like typical kid's films. Unfortunately, when a film is released and people go absolutely nuts over it and tell me that I 'have' to see it, and it appears on the same list with films like 'Citizen Kane' and 'Annie Hall', I expect a higher-caliber offering, and others have to expect that there are going to be people who don't like the films that 'everybody' likes. 'Toy Story 2' is one of them for me. Sorry folks. --Shel",3,5,20,20 September 2004
Saw," Surprisingly good
","Imagine waking up in a strange, dirty room with your foot in a shackle, a stranger in the same predicament across the room, and a bloody, dead body in between the two of you. That is the situation Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) finds himself in, along with Adam (Leigh Wannell) in James Wan's surprisingly good second film, 'Saw'. Gordon and Adam soon discover that their captor is a now-notorious psychopath who puts people into horrible situations as a masochistic life lesson, the results being that most of them have died, with the exception of a drug addict who wakes up to find her head encased in a huge metal helmet that will blow her jaw apart unless she takes the key to the device out of the stomach of the dead man on the floor of the room. The real trick comes when she realizes that the man isn't dead after all, but has to kill him anyway in order to ensure her survival. The two present captives now have to follow the clues given and try to trust one another, even though Gordon's instructions are to kill Adam in order to A) Survive and B) Ensure the safety of his wife and daughter, both of whom are being held at gunpoint at their home. Trying to track down the killer is detective David Tapp, a man who has become obsessed with the case (as they usually do in these films) and, because of circumstantial evidence, believes the killer to be none other than Dr. Lawrence Gordon.'Saw' begins abruptly, when the two men come to in the strange room, leaving the audience with no idea what is going on. This was an excellent move on director Wan's part because we know as much as the victims know at that point, and for the most part, with a few exceptions, throughout the film. There are no real scary moments, but there is a lot of creepiness that brings to mind the film 'Se7en', though it isn't nearly as fantastic. The tag line for the film states 'Every piece has a puzzle' and that is definitely true about the film. It is intricately done and really made me consider and reconsider several theories, because once you think you know the answer, it turns out that you probably don't. The cinematography was very stylish and flashy, (I wouldn't be surprised if Wan honed his skills as a video director before making feature films) and the pacing was very tight. The only real complaint I had was Danny Glover's performance; not that he was ever a fantastic actor, but I've seen him do so much better than in this film, so I don't know if it was an issue of direction or he's just kind of hit a wall in his craft, but I found myself rolling my eyes a bit during some of his scenes.Overall, I enjoyed 'Saw' though it's one of those films that you really don't need to see a second time because once the shocks are over with, there really isn't a whole lot more to experience upon repeat viewings. I think the fact that I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of the film pushes it to a 6/10. I look forward to seeing Wan's future work.--Shelly",6,0,0,20 May 2005
The Last Samurai," Dances with Samurai
","Directed by Edward Zwick, 'The Last Samurai' is the story of Civil War veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a man who is fighting his inner demons that originated from some actions against Native Americans that he didn't feel so good about. So he drinks a lot and is a freelance military adviser. His latest assignment is to go to Tokyo with some former colleagues and train the Emperor's troops in modern weaponry so they can defeat the last of the country's Samurai. During their first battle, he is captured by the Samurai who then take him under their wing, helping him heal his wounds and teaching him how to fight, etc. When the time comes to return back to his 'rightful' place, he makes the choice to fight with the Samurai, who he now relates to most of all.I'll say it right out of the box I really didn't like this movie that much. The film drowns in clichés: The slow motion fight scenes, the shots of Cruise in silhouette at sundown, practicing his moves, the screams of 'Noooooooooo' as the incredibly wounded men charge, and Cruise getting knocked down five times during one of his early sparring matches, yet refusing to stay down because he's just a scrappy guy these are just a couple of the things I found myself rolling my eyes at. I rolled my eyes at those scenes, I chuckled at the fact that he managed to keep a perfectly trimmed beard and clothes that miraculously cleaned themselves after a fight in the rain and mud, and was actually howling during Cruise's detox scene in which he yells 'Sake!!!!!!!!!!' over and over. But I was downright confused after the fight in the alley between Omura's henchmen and Cruise; we experienced the fight once, then suddenly he goes slo-mo and we have to watch the entire fight all over again. Why?! Don't even get me started on the ending. When he walked through the door to chat with the Emperor I almost fell out of my seat; I couldn't believe the film would seriously end that way.I did not hate everything about the film. I thought that Ken Watanabe was phenomenal, and I really liked the fact that they spoke a lot of Japanese. I can't stand it when films think we assume that everyone in the world speaks flawless English. I think that the decision to keep the native language as pervasive as it was, was a good thing. The ninja scene was good, and there were also some great shots; particularly landscapes. However, these things only raise my opinion up from an extremely low position, they don't save the film for me. It was ironic that I watched this when I did because I watched 'Rashomon' the day before, a film that was made 55 years prior, on a tiny fraction of the budget of 'The Last Samurai', which got me thinking about Kurosawa. Of course, it is very difficult to compare Kurosawa to most filmmakers of this genre because he is pure genius, but conversely, it is sad that a film that does have the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison. Also, when did someone decide that Tony Goldwyn was going to be THE bad guy in every movie ever made? It's become almost cliché at this point; go figure that he would be a part of THIS film.I suppose if you like Tom Cruise, historical epics, or action films you should see 'The Last Samurai', but it is barely mediocre, and although I had low expectations going in, I was still very disappointed. Merely because of the handful of positive aspects of the film, I give it a 5/10, a generous assignation in my opinion.--Shelly",5,5,10,24 January 2005
Rocky," Basic, yet inspiring
","Although I saw this film at one point during my life (as a child if I remember right) I figured it was time to see it again as an adult, and as with many films I have seen again, though decades apart, it held entirely different meaning to me.  When I was a kid, my Dad used to go out jogging, and I used to laugh at him when he would play the theme song to Rocky on the turntable while he stretched.  It's still a little corny, but I partially realize the meaning behind it, because `Rocky' is indeed a very inspirational film.-Possible Spoilers-Rocky (Stallone), seemingly simple yet basically good-hearted mediocre amateur boxer gets a shot at a boxing match with the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Weathers) who is all about style and show, and not about substance.  The film basically centers on Rocky's training regimen, and going from a guy who couldn't even have a locker at his local gym, to one who can attempt to go the distance with the best.  Along the way, there are some subplots, (romance, tests of loyalty and friendship, greed) but its basic theme is his inspirational rise to the challenge and eventually, the fight.  The fight itself is very realistic, with the result even more so, and the ending is logically abrupt.  The film ends when the fight ends because ultimately, that is the main plot line.  `Rocky' is an inspirational and decent film that lives up to its legend and deserves its reputation.--Shelly",7,0,6,15 May 2004
The Red Violin," An amazing multicultural film
","Francois Girard's 1998 film, 'Le Violon Rouge' (The Red Violin) is the tale of a violin that is up for auction with a Sotheby's-like company. As the bidding proceeds, we see the birth of the violin, created in 17th century Italy by Nicolo Bussotti for his son, and it's three century journey to where it is now housed, in France. Between the 17th and 20th centuries, the violin is used for a century in an Austrian monastery, buried for years in a grave, travels Europe with gypsies, becomes the prized violin of an English virtuoso, and finally, the personification of intolerance and loss during the Cultural Revolution in 1950's China before landing on the auction block in France. The film becomes compelling when, after a segment of the violin's history is revealed, we return to present day and see someone associated with that portion of history present at the auction, and bidding on the cherished item. The red violin ties all of the stories together, and it is Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), a consultant for the auction house who discovers it's secret. There is so much to appreciate about 'The Red Violin'. There are scenes that look like they were blocked in order to look like paintings of the Renaissance and Flemish era. I expected to see Pieter Brueghel off to the side at times, painting a perfect scene. All of the stories with one exception are intriguing, emotional and somewhat enlightening, particularly the scene set in China. The only segment I wasn't crazy about, though it was definitely necessary to the advancement of the story, was about the English virtuoso Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) and his lover Victoria Byrd (Greta Scacchi). It just didn't do a lot for me, though it certainly wasn't horrible by any means. The score, with solos by Joshua Bell is absolutely beautiful. The most impressive thing to me, however, is probably something that isn't a big deal or noticeable to most. While the story, cinematography and acting were quite good, I was most impressed by the fact that writers Girard and Don McKellar (who also acts in the film) did not dumb down the presentation, but rather allowed each story to be told in their native languages. Considering what we have learned from the last century of films, that we are to expect that it is natural that everyone, regardless of country or origin speaks flawless English, even in their own native countries, it is like a breath of fresh air to see something a bit more 'real'. If you have seen this film and enjoyed it, I would also recommend seeking out Julien Duvivier's 1942 film 'Tales of Manhattan'. It may be hard to find because it's kind of a buried classic, but it is the same kind of concept, only in this case it follows around a tuxedo jacket. It has always been one of my favorite classic films, and was actually the first thing I thought of in terms of comparison after seeing 'The Red Violin' for the first time. The story concept of 'The Red Violin' is compelling and intelligent and the presentation is beautiful Â– I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story with his or her aesthetic.--Shelly",8,0,0,1 September 2004
Shine," A little slight on the writing, but the acting and presentation is brilliant
","When I originally saw this film in the mid-90's, I was absolutely devastated throughout the first forty-five minutes.  So much so, I was pretty much uncontrollably weeping, much to the chagrin of the friend I went with.  Time has softened the film a lot for me, but it still remains a powerful, tender and somewhat inspirational film about a piano prodigy who has led a pretty tragic life.  Geoffrey Rush is unbelievable as the piano prodigy David Helfgott, and although the film is kind of sewn up a little quickly with the Vanessa Redgrave subplot (what about Helfgott made her so in love with him in a short period of time as to want to marry him?) it is a very well done film that I highly recommend to just about anyone, but especially musicians and music lovers.--Shelly",7,23,37,8 April 2004
Some Like It Hot," A film that will always endure the test of time
","There are certain films that are just so 'classic' that when one mentions it, they are usually met with a knowing smile. 'Some Like it Hot', directed by the great Billy Wilder is one of those films. 'Some Like it Hot' is Wilder's gender-bending comedy wherein two small time musicians, Gerald (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis) find themselves witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago, 1929. They escape, only to find that the only way they can afford to leave town is by dressing up as women and joining an all-woman band traveling to Florida. When Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a singer and band member enters the picture, the two men fight over her and come up with ways to romance her, while trying to keep their identities (and genders) secret. This works out better for Joe, who finds himself falling for her, while Lemmon ends up with a romantic interest of his own. All the while, the two are threatened with discovery by the band leader, and eventually, by the gangsters who have been holding a nationwide search for them.I actually watched 'Some Like it Hot' during a Film Club meeting and realized that I had seen this film about a dozen and a half times. Instead of being bored, however, I was afforded the luxury of 'discovering' certain things that I either hadn't noticed before, or had at least glossed over. One thing is that the script is really quite good. Not only does 'Some Like it Hot' have arguably the greatest last line of any film ever, but some of the rapid fire dialogue is hilarious; made even better by the great delivery by the actors. Lemmon and Curtis are always good, but Monroe, while not a great actress is good in this film, and has seriously never looked more beautiful. One other element is some of the chances the film took. There were some risqué scenes and lines that I still am stunned made it through the censors at the time. ('It's not how long it takes; it's who's taking you.')Many good things have been said about 'Some Like it Hot', and most of it is true. It is truly a classic film, and Wilder is a brilliant filmmaker whose diversity is almost unparalleled. Check it out if you haven't seen it.--Shelly",7,6,11,7 September 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Great story, Great film
","For `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', you can pretty much just refer to my review of Guy Ritchie's `other' great film, `Snatch', because everything that I love about `Snatch' can be supplanted with my feelings for `Lock, Stock'.  Less flashy than `Snatch', but with a brilliant script, `Lock, Stock' is a fantastic film.In `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', we encounter four London guys, three of whom are operating on a plane slightly on the wrong side of the law.  Tom, (Jason Flemyng) operates as a small-time fence, Bacon (Jason Statham) is a small-time street con and Eddie (Nick Moran) is Bacon's some time partner in crime, whose specialty is cards.  The fourth member of their circle, Soap, (Dexter Fletcher) is the one member of their group who, as a chef, tries to keep his nose clean at all times.  When the four of them get bored with barely surviving the lives they have mapped out for themselves, they each take their savings and give it to Eddie so that he can play in a high stakes poker game which he is almost certain to win.  This would all run smoothly if the guy who runs the game didn't cheat and therefore clean them out as well as an additional large sum of money, given to them on loan. The foursome then find themselves needing to come up with the money within a week or their lives are at stake, so they have to come up with a way to get the money fast.As with `Snatch', `Lock, Stock' has a large cast of colorful characters who intertwine with one another to make up one hell of a wild ride.  If two characters don't actually meet face to face, it is certain that they at least have a couple of people involved that they each know, which turns the plot into a kind of `Six Degrees of Anyone in the Film'.  What `Lock, Stock' doesn't have that `Snatch' has is star power (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro) and presumably, the same budget, but the great thing is that it doesn't need either.  The acting by (at the time) relative unknowns to the general American audience is just great, and while there are some really great action scenes and some fun camera angles, the spectacle that accompanies `Snatch' is not as prevalent in `Lock, Stock.'  Still, the film is just as good  so does that make it a better film?  Definitely not; and choosing which Guy Ritchie film, for me at least, is like a mother choosing which child is her favorite.  (Yes, I'm that much of a film geek)  But `Lock, Stock' is an excellent, character and plot-driven film that deserves all of the accolades it has received, and then some.--Shelly",8,0,1,24 August 2004
The Untouchables," Wow, so there IS another good Kevin Costner film
","-A possible spoiler-I thought that the only films featuring Kevin Costner I like would be `Bull Durham' and `JFK', but after (finally) seeing `The Untouchables' I can (finally) say that I've found another.  This is a solid, though largely fictionalized account of the indictment of Al Capone (DeNiro) and the events leading up to it, headed by Eliot Ness (Costner).  It is a compelling film, and is extremely well-paced.  Though not in the `typical' De Palma style (unusual camera angles, point of view camera work, etc.) `The Untouchables' is slick and stylish with some great Chicago locations.  I did, however see a couple of the little Alfred Hitchcock-esque touches he has given several of his films; most notably in the scene with the baby carriage in Union Station (similar to the Jimmy Stewart `falling scene' in `Rear Window'.)I was surprised to see that David Mamet had written the screenplay because the script didn't have the regular Mamet `punch' to it, but I wouldn't call that a criticism as much as an observation.  On the other hand, the musical score by Ennio Morricone is something to rave about  it helped to contribute intensity to some scenes and to express the strength of character that Ness and his `Untouchables' possess.  `The Untouchables' is certainly not my favorite gangster film, but it is a solid one, and very entertaining.--Shelly",7,1,1,15 May 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A very satisfactory sequel - just make sure you saw its predecessor first
","I'm not going to even bother with a summary of the plot for The Matrix: Reloaded because it's too complicated.  Besides, the sheer possibility of giving away details is too great.  What I can do is suggest that if you have not seen the first Matrix, don't bother with this one yet.  I've known two people who inexplicably went to see this film without seeing the original and disliked it greatly.  Until I saw it for myself, I couldn't understand how they could dislike the film, even as a stand-alone entity Â– the answer was apparent within the first 10 minutes.  The Wachowski brothers don't insult us and waste 20 minutes rehashing the complicated plot of the first film, rather they continue right along where the former ended.The first time I saw the original Matrix, I walked out of the theater with my friend who asked me what I thought of it.  Answering quite honestly, I replied with, `I have no idea what this film was about, but it was really f-ing cool.'  Of course, with a repeat viewing the answers became a little clearer, and this film answers a few of the questions one may have carried over from the original.  Indeed, the film opens up new areas of confusion which will be presumably covered in the final installment.  Even as I walked out of the theater a little less confused this time, I still had the same comment to make: `It was really f---ing cool.'  I didn't expect to be as amazed this time as I was while watching the predecessor because at this point the effects that the Wachowski brothers pioneered are hackneyed, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and exciting the action sequences were. 
There's no point in commenting on the acting, as it the characters are fairly formulaic: Hero, Mentor, Love Interest, Villain(s), and none of the roles are a stretch.  If I had to comment on the acting, I would have to say that I at least wasn't irritated by Keanu Reeves, who has the acting ability of a 12 year old community theater hopeful.  The best way to approach the film is as an interesting science fiction piece with plenty of incredible action sequences.  I have heard a minimum of 12 theories as to what everything in the second film means, but I think I'm going to choose not to overanalyze the film and simply enjoy it.  And if you haven't seen the first Matrix but decide to see this one, you can pretty much go to any video store, cable channel or even your next door neighbor and watch it before you see this one.  Or, don't bother:  If you didn't care to see the first one, you probably won't like this one, regardless of the hype.

Mystic River," Wrenching melodrama that stays with you
","Before all of the hype about Mystic River, I wanted to see it because we so rarely have straight dramatic films anymore that don't involve a lot of flash, action or special effects.  Thankfully, this season seems to be ripe with films that focus on characterization and story, and Mystic River seems to be leading the pack.  With a phenomenal cast that deserved every award nomination and win they earned, Mystic River is a film that actually grew on me more in the days after I saw it than when I initially left the theater.
*Possible Spoilers*Sean Penn, as the very flawed and grieving father who loses his daughter after she is murdered is amazing in this role.  He was afforded many accolades and much buzz, and I actually firmly believe that while his win was predictable, it was also very deserved.  Also deserving was Tim Robbins as the broken man who becomes a suspect in the murder. Sean Penn's performance was emotional, but Tim Robbins' performance made me weep in the theater.  In general, this was a very strong cast.Unfortunately, Eastwood tended to get a little heavy-handed at times.  For example, the sense in which we see Penn's daughter before her murder, we see this overly vivacious, affectionate and charming girl  it's as if Eastwood is saying, `Just in case you don't believe that it's a shame she dies, and just in case you don't believe Penn's grief, let's make her as charming as we can in the five minutes she's on screen.'  Penn's transformation from an almost professor-looking shop owner to thug is also remarkably quick, despite his former life and his suffered tragedy.However, despite its flaws, Mystic River is an excellent film.  Tragic and depressing, you will not feel good after seeing it, but its intensity is part of its appeal.--Shelly",8,0,0,6 March 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fairly basic, but entertaining
","If there ever were a couple who needed some marriage counseling, it's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie). Outwardly, they are successful entrepreneurs who have a perfect life, if not a mundane one. What they don't realize about the other is that they are actually highly-trained assassins who, after a botched attempt, are hired to kill each other. When they discover this, they use just about every tactic possible to exterminate the other, while struggling with the fact that despite their commitment to their jobs, they are, after all, married.The plot of this film is really very basic, but the synergy between Pitt and Jolie is enough to make the film entertaining. It certainly doesn't hurt that these are two of the most photogenic actors working today, and if you're looking for something that is not thought-provoking or attempting depth, it's a good movie to see. Unfortunately, there's a lot of beating up on each other, so if you're not crazy about seeing a husband wail on each other full force for a good half an hour, this movie is probably not for you. Realizing that Vince Vaughn is a big favorite in the supporting actor field, I have to say that he was completely obnoxious in this film, and even though there was nothing profound about the movie, he seemed to make it even more vapid.While watching 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' I couldn't help but compare it to the great 1989 cult classic 'The War of the Roses', starring Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. While the circumstances were different, (the Roses fought because they hated each other, while the Smiths just had to kill one another because it was their job) 'The War of the Roses' had a very dark cleverness to it that could have been somewhat imitated in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith', particularly in its ending. Sometimes it doesn't pay to try to add depth or improvement to what is essentially an action-laden popcorn flick, but unfortunately the end result will be just that: It is simply an action-laden popcorn flick. 5/10 --Shelly",5,1,4,25 June 2005
Psycho," Incomparable
","The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film 'Psycho' is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; 'Psycho' being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, 'Oh, that is such a classic.' And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit '24 Hour Psycho', wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that 'Psycho' changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that 'Psycho' doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10--Shelly",9,3,5,5 August 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," One of the first of its genre, and one of the best
","After viewing 'All Quiet on the Western Front', made in 1930 and directed by Lewis Milestone, I have been trying my hardest to come up with something to criticize regarding the film. The story of a band of fresh-faced German teens who enlist in the army at the behest of their propaganda-spewing teacher during the height of World War I, it examines their journey from idealistic novices to (for those who are left) war-torn and bedraggled soldiers who have lived through hell, uncertain of why they are doing what they do. The evolution of these men are told through both obvious means, (focusing on each of them before deciding to enlist, and showing their fantasies of how their lives will be better if they enlist) and in more subtle ways (the idealistic protagonist, Paul Baumer) quietly deciding that it is more painful to remain at home on leave than be on the battlefield, so he goes back four days early) 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is probably the granddaddy of the war film genre. I'm sure that Steven Spielberg studied it before creating 'Saving Private Ryan' because I saw aesthetic and situational similarities between the two films, filmed six decades apart. There are extremely well-done battle scenes, regardless of the fact that it was filmed in 1930. It only makes the film that much more awe-inspiring that it WAS such an early film. The script is equally impressive. In a decade (heck, a few decades) where films/scripts that took chances or were not overt in handing the audience the desired reactions, emotions and thoughts, were few and far between, 'All Quiet' is disturbing and cerebral, and clearly an anti-war film. I have not seen it, but judging from what others who did have told me, it sounds like the original took far more chances and was far more subtle than its remake, fifty years later. Equally surprising, in an era where the audience is told who the bad guy or good guy is simply by the color of their hat or the sinister look on their face, the 'hero' of the film is not established until nearly the middle of the film. Until then, the audience is left to look at the entire picture, just as the characters on screen are. In terms of a 'happy, hopeful' ending  look elsewhere. This film ends with such power and effectiveness that I was literally numb as the words 'The End' came onto the screen.My original statement of this review was that I tried long and hard to come up with something I could criticize about the film 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Even after putting a brief analysis on paper, I can't come up with anything, because this film was made seventy years ago and was so far ahead of its time even then that the slightest thing I can come up with can be answered by 'But it was made in 1930'. This is an excellent war film, and an excellent example of brilliant, visionary film-making. It has been studied in film schools for decades, analyzed by critics for even longer, and all of the praise is well-deserved. For anyone who enjoys contemporary war films, be sure to check out their obvious influence, 'All Quiet on the Western Front.'--Shelly",8,1,3,7 September 2004
Love Actually," Underwritten and overambitious
","'Love Actually', written and directed by Richard Curtis is a romantic dramedy which pretty much runs the gambit in terms of relationship stereotypes. Hunker down, here are the basic story lines: It's a few days until Christmas, and Billy Mack, (Bill Nighy) is a washed up, boozed out former pop idol who has an unlikely hit with a crap Christmas song. With his newly formed fame, he finds his chummy relationship with his slobby, average-Joe manager faltering as he makes the talk show circuit. Sarah (Laura Linney) has had a crush on a co-worker in her office, but she proves to be weighted down by the baggage of having a mentally ill brother who calls her three dozen times a day. Harry (Alan Rickman) is Sarah's boss, who is married to Karen (Emma Thompson), and is seriously considering cheating with his secretary. Hugh Grant is the newly elected Prime Minister of England and Karen's brother, who begins to fall for a member of his staff. Daniel, (Liam Neeson) has just lost his wife to cancer, and his young son reveals that he is in love with a young girl in his class, but doesn't know how to show it. (He's about 10 by the way) Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) is a writer who breaks up with his girlfriend and falls in love with the Portuguese-speaking girl who cleans his house in the country. And finally, Juliet (Keira Knightley), a newlywed, is bothered by the fact that her husband's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) doesn't seem to like her. Throw in cameos by Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton and (I think) you pretty much have the cast.As you can see, there are a lot of stories going on here, and unfortunately, Curtis put a few too many in. The result is that there was not one story that I truly cared about in 'Love Actually'. The closest I came was feeling for Karen, but I think a lot of it was because Emma Thompson is just so damn good. Situations occurred that made no sense, plots were concluded with unbelievable ease, and by the time we would move on from one scene to another, I had completely forgotten what the situation was with that particular character because I hadn't seen their story for a good twenty minutes or so. It was like Curtis came up with the characters, wrote a paragraph as a treatment for each and then relied on just that paragraph to tell their stories. For example, I felt hardly anything regarding Daniel's loss, the only emotion or feeling in that regard was in the obligatory funeral scene. Basically, a cute film could have been made using just a couple of the characters, and it would have been an okay film. This was simply atrocious and for the most part, sappy. The acting in the film was of course decent, with this cast it had to be, but all of these great actors were wasted with the little bit they were given. And a note to Hugh Grant:The shrugging, self-deprecating thing has gone from charming to insipid over the course of the last ten years, so drop it. Now.I suppose that anyone who loves a romantic comedy is going to find this movie good. I found it lame and barely mediocre. Had Curtis not tried to shove the concept of love down our throats with about 20 different characters, it may have been decent, but in this form it turned out to be sub-par. Only for the decent acting jobs and that knock down, drag out Christmas program musical number at the end do I give it a 4/10.Shelly",4,1,2,6 November 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of the most important films of all time
","To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.  This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them, the date that the film was released:  1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.  But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.  To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it, do so.  If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.  --Shelly",10,405,466,9 November 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," An excellent military epic
","*Possible Spoilers*David Lean's epic about the British soldiers and officers captured by the Japanese who, in the name of pride and what could be construed as arrogance, build a bridge at the behest of the enemy is not only a great military film, but is a psychological study in the behaviors and motivations of men as well.  Alec Guinness is Col. Nicholson, a man who lets his pride and his allegiance to the rules of war nearly kills him due to his refusal to participate in the building of this bridge.  When he finally `gets his way' however, he takes on the project with full steam and craftsmanship. Unfortunately, the British Army is scheduling the destruction of this bridge because it will assist the Japanese in its occupation of India, something that Guinness realizes too late and with great consequence.  This is a long film, and probably could have been trimmed just a bit, but there is very little to complain about.  It is an epic in every sense of the word, and the rich character studies are just one of the elements that make this a quintessential Lean film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is not a typical military film, but is a fantastic addition to the genre.--Shelly",7,1,4,13 April 2004
Jaws," Groundbreaking & still scary
","A 25-foot Great White shark is doing what he knows best  swimming around and eating when he gets hungry. In this case, his diet consists mostly of the people off the coast of Amityville, and Martin Brody (Scheider) the newly hired police chief has to not only protect the townspeople but also find the shark and kill it. Unfortunately, he has a few strikes against him right out of the box; the Mayor of Amityville is so mercenary he pretty much has to have a body dropped in his lap before he will acquiesce to closing the beach, he hires a crusty old curmudgeon of a shark hunter (Quint, played by Robert Shaw) who, while being good at what he does, has a beef with everyone who comes in contact with him (particularly oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss), and finally, Brody suffers from a little thing called hydrophobia.The story is simple, yet the film is so well put together that it has held up as a horror classic for the last thirty years. Spielberg, at the time with only a few films and television shows under his directing belt, created a masterpiece with the film 'Jaws', a film that is so good; its flaws become almost trivial when making an overall assessment of the film. Several great things occurred due to serendipity with 'Jaws'. Probably the best known was the trouble the crew had with the mechanical shark that led to underexposure of the monster; subsequently leading to a greater scare with the shard did appear. Spielberg, even with these formative films, knew how to create suspense and tension. The image of the three men on a rickety boat in the middle of the ocean where a man-eating shark who is looking for a 5th victim awaits is pretty scary. And that is one of the less obvious moments  never mind the shark bringing down a young boy, a dog, a young woman and man. (Unusually, the goriest actually being the death of the child.) Throw in a now iconic soundtrack and we have ourselves an instant classic.Formally reviewing 'Jaws' is pretty pointless when the movie is not only thirty years out of the can, but has been analyzed to pieces, but a mention has to be made about its lasting effect on pop culture. I know of at least one person who still will not go in the water as a direct result of this film, and while it is fair to expect that I was completely terrified of this film when I was 7 or 8, I'll admit that the movie poster still scares the hell out of me. I think the greatest thing that I found with 'Jaws' is that a film that I remembered being so terrifying as a kid actually turned into a film that was terrifying for a completely different reasons when viewed as an adult. With this viewing I found 'Jaws' to be more spine-chillingly suspenseful than anything; I really felt a sense of hopelessness for the plight of these men, and was scared on their behalf  more of an adult kind of terror than anything that simply goes 'Boo!' 'Jaws' isn't perfect  it actually has a pretty convenient ending that made me go, 'Wait  but- how will they.huh?' But like I said earlier, it's things like this that make you realize that the rest of the film was good enough to forgive this transgression. I have always had a conflicted relationship with Steven Spielberg films; on the one hand, and as a self-labeled life long film student, I know how commercial his films are. But on the other hand, I can't deny that he makes damn good films. Maybe I should just lighten up about it and just enjoy, which I did while watching 'Jaws' again, many years after seeing it for the first time. 8/10 --Shelly",7,6,11,17 February 2005
Ray," The film isn't nearly as good as Foxx's performance
","Taylor Hackford's film 'Ray' is a biopic about singer Ray Charles, a man who, despite becoming blind at a young age, ends up with a very illustrious career that made him a legend. The film centers around his film career, but also touches on his bouts of drug abuse, his many acts of infidelity and some of his psychological inner demons.Jamie Foxx did an excellent job as Ray Charles. Frankly, (and this is my own fault because I'm a freak for award shows  since I don't watch soaps or the OC I'm allowed that guilty pleasure) I was so sick of Jamie Foxx's lack of humility and grandstanding while accepting his many acting awards that I was really curious to see how deserving he is of the accolades he has received. It very quickly became obvious that the reviews of his performance and applause he has been receiving was warranted. It has been said so much about Foxx that it is almost cliché at this point, but he really did 'become' Ray Charles. His mannerisms, speaking voice and even his physical presence were simply astounding. Frankly, I feel like Kerry Washington (who played his long-suffering wife Della) and/or Regina King (Margie, one of Charles' many affairs) were also overlooked for a nod. They both gave very compelling performances that are deserving of recognition.Having said all of that, it's too bad that the rest of the film could not have been as good as the actors in it. Hackford's direction was okay, but it wasn't anything great over even all that good. Even as an admirer of Charles' music, I still felt like this was a big love fest. True, the subject of his addiction and womanizing was addressed, but it wasn't remotely compelling. Charles was a damaged man, and a real son-of-a-bitch sometimes, but I really thought this was glossed over in favor of more positive aspects of his life. The music featured was predictably excellent, but a scene that featured the inception of one of my personal favorite Charles songs ('Hit the Road, Jack') turned into one of the several corny moments of the film. Personally, I thought the film was mediocre at best, but since it is being hailed as a great film by so many, and because it is up for a Best Picture nomination, etc., I have to say that I really feel it doesn't deserve all of the accolades it has received. Perhaps reverence for Ray Charles is being factored into these glowingly positive reviews, but personally, when I separate my feelings for his music and the film, I feel the film really comes up short.Of the 4 films I have now seen that are up for Best Picture at the Oscars, 'Ray' is the only one so far that is not even deserving of the nomination. In a year where films like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' are being left out, there is no room for mediocrity, and 'Ray' is nothing more than an average picture. If you want to see a good biopic about another music legend, check out 'What's Love Got to Do With It.' It's a lot better than this film. 5/10 --Shelly",5,26,46,17 February 2005
Platoon," A personal and gut-wrenching look at the Vietnam War
","Oliver Stone's 'Platoon', which he wrote and directed, is partly based on his own experiences in Vietnam. Our protagonist, Chris (Charlie Sheen) is an idealized kid from a privileged family who feels it is his patriotic duty to enlist, and therefore is one of the lone volunteers in his platoon, headed by the badass Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes. (Tom Berenger, looking even more badass with a deep gash in his face that runs from forehead to chin) Somewhat acting as Chris' mentor is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two provide (in the most rudimentary sense) good and evil influences as Chris experiences the every day horrors in the jungles of Vietnam; from the irritating  bugs, inclement weather, to the terrifying  combat with the Vietcong, to the gut-wrenching  the ruin of a Vietnam village, mostly innocents.I thought that 'Platoon' was a good film  it is obviously a film made before Stone's highly stylistic period (which he still appears to be in), and is instead a fairly straightforward film about the horrors of war. Sheen was decent as Chris; he managed to believably convey innocence as well as hardness without falling into cliché. Berenger was pretty brutal as Barnes, but it was Dafoe who I was most impressed with, (though his talent is obvious throughout his many roles, he still has the ability to amaze me. This was obviously a very personal film for Stone, and I think that he conveyed his message of 'War is hell', 'War kill innocence' effectively. There were some moments where I was incredibly disturbed, mainly the scene in the village. I found that I couldn't stop crying during this scene because it was just so terrifying, and unfortunately very true. 'Platoon' doesn't give us any new insights on war, but it also doesn't prescribe to clichés either. It is a solid and well-done film that does not glorify the war experience, nor does it preach. I would certainly recommend this film to any war-film lover, but it also has enough of a storyline to hold the attention of most other film lovers as well.--Shel",7,25,45,21 September 2004
Paths of Glory," Very compelling anti-war film
","'Paths of Glory', Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film was his first film in the anti-war genre, but not his last. Starring Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, the commander of a regiment in the French army who fall back on their orders because theirs is an impossible attack. Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) is a glory-seeking man who agreed to this attack regardless of the casualties it will cause, and when it all hits the fan, looks for anyone else to be the scapegoats. He and Gen. George Broulard (Adolph Menjou) tell Dax that he must select random men to execute for cowardice, but Dax talks him into only selecting three, and to allow him to defend them. (In civilian life, Dax was the best attorney in France.) All of the events of the film are an exercise in futility, and the entire film's strong anti-war stance is extremely effective.This was one of the very few Kubrick films I had not seen (I think my last one is Spartacus) and I was extremely impressed. As with another early film of his, 'The Killing', his intelligence, vision and burgeoning talent are so very apparent. I enjoyed seeing certain Kubrick trademarks in this film, (particularly the tracking shot which follows Douglas through the trenches) and the story really was a compelling one. Apparently he had to fight to get this film made, and found a strong ally in Douglas, who used his star power with Warner Brothers to get the job done. This is certainly a must-see for any Kubrick fan, and a worthwhile film to check out anyway. 'Paths of Glory' does not have the wit or belly laughs of 'Dr. Strangelove', or even the terror of 'Full Metal Jacket', but it is a strong film with a strong story. Simply based upon the first viewing I give it a 7/10.--Shelly",7,1,3,24 January 2005
Vanilla Sky," A worthy remake
","'Vanilla Sky', Cameron Crowe's remake of the 1997 film 'Abre los Ojos', written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, had two potential strikes against it from the onset: It was a remake of a film that was made four years prior, and it was a remake of a film where the original reeked of sheer genius. Luckily, Crowe was able to overcome these two hurdles and make a solid film that stands on its own merits.'Vanilla Sky' centers around David Aames, (Cruise) a spoiled rich kid who has inherited his father's vast wealth and publishing empire. David is an attractive man (and knows it) who lives a jet-set lifestyle that involves having as much fun as possible in every given moment. Julie Gianni (Diaz), a girl with whom he has a casual 'sleeping arrangement' is not able to subscribe to this lifestyle and when she tries to glean more from the relationship, is cast aside. On the night of his birthday party, David's best friend Brian (Lee) brings his new friend Sofia (Cruz), and the two develop an instant connection. In an attempt to get away from the now stalkerish Julie, the two escape to Sofia's small apartment and proceed to have a wonderful, meaningful evening together wherein David's life seems to have changed for the better. On his way out the door, he runs into Julie, who has followed him to Sofia's apartment, and she convinces him to drive with her so he can 'make it up to her'. What happens during the rest of the film is a mixture of intrigue, murder and romance, at times blossoming and others faltering, and eventually becomes a race for David to find out the truth about what is really happening with his life and those who are involved in it.I didn't want to get too spoilerish with the plot summary, because although the trailer for the film don't hide a lot in terms of plot points, some things that happen are still more shocking when you simply see them for yourself. 'Vanilla Sky' has an intriguing and interesting plot that sincerely kept me guessing until the last five minutes of the film, something I was not expecting from a Cameron Crowe film. Cruise's David Aames is like Jerry Maguire if he was even more of an asshole in the beginning; charming, but so self-centered he practically leaks smarminess from his pores. I actually didn't think Crowe had it in him to produce such a well-executed psychological drama, but 'Vanilla Sky' is a very good film. Once again, Crowe shines with his use of music, something that he has never faltered on. From 'Say Anything' to 'Almost Famous', he has exhibited the uncanny knack to take a song that is either historically beloved in its own right or one that one would never think to use in a particular film, and insert it into a scene that is so fitting that the song and scene become married to one another immediately. He did this with Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes' in 'Say Anything', he did it with 'Tiny Dancer' in 'Almost Famous' and the great musical moment (in my opinion) in 'Vanilla Sky' was near the end when 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys is playing over a semi-chaotic scene. I'm not sure if this is one of them yet, but Crowe's knack for turning simple scenes into iconic moments in film is staggering and admirable.The acting in 'Vanilla Sky' is decent enough, none of it was really a stretch for Cruise, and Jason Lee was his usual laid-back self. The surprising performances for me personally were Cruz and Kurt Russell, who played a court-appointed psychologist. I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, but I found her casting to be absolutely perfect (not a stretch since she reprised her role from the Amenabar original). She was cute and quirky, but her vulnerability was so subtle that anytime I felt any kind of emotion, it was usually in response to a scene she was guiding. Also, Kurt Russell, a mediocre actor at best, was great as the psychologist; his strength and warmth are so low key that when a significant plot point about him is revealed at the end, you almost have to slap your forehead in an 'Oh yeah!' reaction.I really enjoyed seeing 'Abre Los Ojos', and I think that it still has advantages other than its originality over 'Vanilla Sky'. But when gauging a film like 'Vanilla Sky', a film that can be criticized as being Hollywoodized, bastardized and super-sized, it is a testimony to the film and filmmakers that it came out as good as it did. Being a foreign-film and independent film lover, I'll always like 'Abre Los Ojos' thismuch better, but 'Vanilla Sky' is a worthy remake. I highly recommend both. 7/10 --Shelly",7,2,3,28 March 2005
The Deer Hunter," Probably more effective in its time, but a good film nonetheless
","In `The Deer Hunter', Christopher Walken and Robert DeNiro play friends from a small town in Pennsylvania who get sent to Vietnam, where they experience horrifying moments together.  While the first act of the film shows us their lives within their town, and the second contains their war experiences, the third act gives us the aftermath of what happened to them after the war ended for the two.What I observed while watching `The Deer Hunter' was indeed a decent film, however also a film that suffers from terrible pacing issues. A half hour wedding scene here, a twenty minute scene of guys clowning around a car there, and you have a film that not only could have used another `go around in the editing room, but a film that is nearly three and a half hours long. I think that my friends and I were all thinking it, but when we finally go through the wedding scene only to then talk by the car' for awhile, we all just kind of blurted out words akin to `I wonder how long THIS scene is going to be' or `Think I'll miss anything if I'm away for a few minutes?' Generally, that's not a great sign for a film, especially when the pertinent plot devices used within a scene can be shared with the audience in a third of that time.  Pacing aside, the film was well-written and featured an amazing and talented cast.  Besides the aforementioned Walken and DeNiro, among them we have Meryl Streep, before becoming this generation's `grand actress', playing a small but important role as a woman torn between Walken and DeNiro's affections.  The script was intelligent in that it supplied small yet integral aspects of the story in a subtle fashion.  The action within the `second act' in Vietnam was the most horrifying  the seemingly non-stop scenes of Russian roulette were important to the story, but after awhile the tension and nauseating display became a little too much  Russian roulette scenes for five, even ten minutes?  Sick, but effective in portraying that aspect of the horrors of this war.  Twenty minutes plus was pushing my personal limit.  Certainly, none of these criticisms should deter anyone from seeing this film, it is a good film  just make sure to mentally and physically prepare for the disturbing imagery and the sheer amount of time spent watching this film  there are many films that exceed three hours that have minimal or no pacing problems, but `The Deer Hunter' is not one of them, so it isn't `easy.'  While in general I thought this was a good film and watching The Deer Hunter' reminded me why I am a big fan of both DeNiro and Walken, unfortunately their excellent acting wasn't nearly enough to totally redeem the pacing problems I felt this film had.  Unfortunately, when a film shows up on a `greatest films of all time' list and is backed up by several Oscars, a certain amount of expectation is going to precede it.  `The Deer Hunter' did not meet my expectations, but it was a good film nonetheless and should be seen so one can decide its relevancy for themselves.--Shelly",6,4,7,31 May 2004
Identity," Not without its flaws, but it has a good hook
","*possible spoilers*Having heard mixed reviews of Identity in the months since it was released, I wasn't sure what to expect.  All that I had heard was that there was a `twist'.  The movie itself was fairly superficial in terms of a storyline, but I soon came to realize that was the only way the story really could have presented itself.  The acting was pretty cookie-cutter, even from my man John Cusack, but some fairly interesting cinematography that was used to tell parts of the story more than made up for it.  The good news is that with a couple of exceptions, I was kept guessing throughout the film, and more than once I was completely dumbfounded.  When the `twist' finally occurred, it took me a second to figure out what was going on, but it ended up being pretty satisfying.  `Identity' was by no means a great film, but it was entertaining, so overall it was a positive experience.--Shelly",6,1,1,13 April 2004
X2: X-Men United," A fun, exciting sequel
","I walked into this movie really hopeful that my appreciation for the first X-Men film wasn't a fluke.  While I am a self-admitted comic book geek from way back, I tend to not like the films derived from comic book or graphic novel origins.  There are a few exceptions: Ghost World, the first two Batman films, and for camp value, the first two Superman films  but the bad far outweigh the good.  Having this opinion, I didn't expect much of anything out of X-Men three years ago but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.  I am delighted to say that I did walk out pleasantly surprised again this time, but because I actually liked the sequel better than its predecessor.  In X2, we once again have the same characters we left off with from the first film along with a few interesting additions  most notably Nightcrawler, who was brilliantly portrayed by Alan Cumming.  I can't imagine that projecting feeling from behind pounds of blue makeup and prosthetics can be easy, but he absolutely made it work.  X2 had more thrills and back story than the first film as well as more of a compelling story line.  Fortunately, it isn't completely necessary to have seen X-Men before viewing this film; however the exposition used to transfer viewers from the first to second film was subtle enough to clue in first time viewers without irritating fans who know the background.  Without providing spoilers, I will commend the film for taking chances and for providing hints for readers of the comic book of things to come.  --Shelly",6,0,0,5 June 2003
Amélie," Like a Fauvist painting come to life
","If ever there was a film that closely resembled an actual work of art, Amelie has to be one of them.  Between the presentation, the charming story and the unbelievably engaging Audrey Tautou as Amelie, it is not difficult to see why this film has quickly become a beloved modern classic.*Possible spoilers within*There are no `slow spots' in Amelie  you are immediately thrown into the story, which is anonymously narrated in a rapid-fire opening sequence, where if you blink you'll miss something.  From the narrator we learn that Amelie was an only child of neurotic parents who were unaffectionate, but smothering enough to mold her into an introspective and quirky loner who, as an adult is now living a quiet life as a waitress.  She is still introspective and quirky, and through a serendipitous occurrence, decides to anonymously help others.  This may mean playing matchmaker to the lonely, returning long-lost property or keeping company with other lonely eccentrics, but the result is generally positive and the experiences personally rewarding for Amelie who relishes in her anonymous status.  It is when she finds love in one of her `projects' that conflict arises for her.It is impossible not to fall in love with Amelie, who is so charming that even when she is dispensing her own brand of justice against a hateful man by doing little irritating things to his flat like exchange his toothpaste for foot cream or resetting his alarm clock for a couple of hours earlier than normal, she is completely adorable, perhaps more so because the `evil deeds' are so inherently innocent in the grand scheme of things.  Her imagination and innocence is both endearing and admirable, and Audrey Tautou is so engaging and beautiful that she provides the perfect vessel and face for this heroine.  Additionally, the excellent supporting cast is a perfect compliment to its leading lady.The film itself is absolutely marvelous and awe-inspiring.  The cinematography employs a lot of rapid-fire movements, and the camera work is incredibly original.  The set design has the colors and energy of a Fauvist painting by Henri Matisse and the charm and quaint feel of a post-Impressionist Renoir, who himself is featured prominently in the film. Along with the script, which is both heart-warming and sentimental without losing its intelligence, Amelie is a modern day fairy tale that is so exuberant that it made me want to watch it again, but was so profound and heart-felt that I was speechless and unable to weigh in with my opinion until I could let the film absorb into my brain like a sponge.  Only then could I unequivocally assert that this film easily makes my list of favorite films, even with just one viewing.--Shelly",9,1,3,28 December 2003
Rear Window," Hitchock Classic
","Rear Window is considered one of Hitchcock's classics, and is probably Jimmy Stewart's most famous Hitchcock Role.  Stewart plays an adventure-seeking photographer who is laid up for seven weeks in his apartment with a broken leg.  During this time, he has become vicariously involved with his neighbors; looking out his rear windows and following their lives.  As the final week of his incapacity begins, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors has killed his wife, and pretty soon his girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and nurse (Thelma Ritter) realize that he may be right.I seem to get more out of Rear Window the older I get  there are subtleties to the relationship, and to the lives of the other apartment dwellers that I catch as an adult, and didn't when I was younger.  One thing that has remained a constant however is the methodical pacing and the slow tension that builds up to outright terror.  I get just as tense and nervous during the last ten minutes of the film as a 30 year old as I did when I first saw the film at age 10.  It is only as I got older that I realized the helplessness of Stewart's character, and how important that element was to the plot along with its contribution to the uneasiness of the film.I've heard more than once that people have been bored during this film  of course, that is an opinion and cannot be judged, but I find it hard to relate to that, as I believe that even without the elements of suspense, Rear Window still makes a great story and film:  Which is just one of the many reasons it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films to this day.--Shelly",8,7,11,8 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A satisfying and compelling end to the journey
","If I wasn't a Lord of the Rings convert before this film, The Return of the King surely cemented my belief that if a film is good enough, even my stubborn preferences and opinions can be swayed.  Hell, it didn't just prove this fact, The Return of the King was so good that this statement can practically be etched into stone tablets and not be displayed in front of government buildings.I had the distinct pleasure of seeing the extended versions of the first two installments in the theater in the ten days leading up to the day The Return of the King was released, a first for me, as I had not yet seen either of them on the big screen.  Not only did I see these films in the theater, but I saw them with real fans of the films, which made the experience a lot more fun and interesting for me, and was just one of the many factors that made me truly excited to see the final installment the morning it was released. Only a fantastic film could create this kind of excitement in me Â– not only did the film have two strikes against it for the hype and for being a fantasy film, but was additionally handicapped by my stubborn inability to remember the character names and back stories.  Yet I still walked out of the film in a daze because I was so in awe of its superior quality.Peter Jackson, who I have admired on a small level since seeing `Heavenly Creatures', continues to amaze me.  Where did this guy come from?  To go from making small, interesting and fairly weird films to directing the biggest blockbuster trilogy since `Star Wars' and doing it THIS WELL simply amazes me.  I say this with the greatest reverence and admiration as the most cynical and probably pickiest `film person' I personally know.  Another factor that stuck out for me was the acting.  Look at most big budget blockbuster action films and pay attention to the acting.  If you respond with `What acting?' that is pretty much the best way to describe most action films.  For example, when I went back and saw the re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy in the theater, I was dismayed and amused at the same time by the terrible acting.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy does not suffer from poor acting; rather it is enhanced by the good acting of its principals.  I think the enormous number of characters and therefore lower amount of screen time than other nominees may prevent an Oscar win for acting, but if The Return of the King or Peter Jackson is shut out for this film I will be very surprised.  I rarely support the huge films for Oscar wins, but I have a feeling that 2004 will be a well-deserved exception.The Return of the King is definitely in my top ten favorite films of 2003 and is only second to `Kill Bill Vol. 1' as my favorite action film of the year, words that I never thought I would be saying and words that could only be said because Peter Jackson has provided such an exquisite and superb film.--Shelly",8,0,0,28 December 2003
Casino," Typically fantastic Scorcese film
","I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the 'great film' line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.
Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of 'Satisfaction' by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies' which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly",8,135,189,14 May 2003
Ran," Not as great as I thought it would be
","Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. 'Ran', Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's 'King Lear' is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. 'Ran' can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that 'Ran' only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word 'awe') Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, 'Ran' gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",5,24,45,3 June 2005
The Great Escape," Enjoyable film
","Realizing that I was not supposed to accept `The Great Escape' as High Art, I found it to be an entertaining film.  The story about a group of hard-scrabble soldiers in a German P.O.W. camp who are rounded up and thrown together because they are the prisoners who have attempted escape the most, is not deep in the slightest, and fairly formulaic, (I was able to announce the ending of the film, music, dialogue and all, about ten minutes before the actual end) but enjoyable nonetheless.One thing that I enjoyed knowing while watching the film was that the director, John Sturges, not only is the director of one of those other `manly man classic' films, `The Magnificent Seven', but the director of the god-awful Gene Hackman film, `Marooned' that was so gleefully torn apart on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  I guess for every few good films, you can be allowed a stinker.  That's only one of the many lessons I learned watching `The Great Escape', however.  Among the many things I learned as I enjoyed this film were that James Coburn should never attempt an Australian accent, that Charles Bronson was unbelievably buff in 1963, and Steve McQueen always looked 43 years old.  `The Great Escape' is a good film and deserves its place on the IMDB top 250 list, but it certainly has a core audience, and while I truly enjoyed the film, I'm not really a member of that core audience.  I liked it enough to appreciate it and give it a good review once, but I don't think I'll be sneaking this one into the DVD player in the next five years.  Certainly not because of the film making itself, or the plot, which was good, it's just one of those `watch it one time and leave it at that' films for me personally.--Shelly",7,3,9,21 July 2004
Jackie Brown," Decent, but don't expect a Pulp Fiction sequel
","'Jackie Brown', the 1997 film starring Pam Grier as the title character, a flight attendant who smuggles cash into the country for a shady associate, Ordell (Jackson) is the third film directed by Quentin Tarantino. When Jackie is tagged by the feds, (played by Keaton and Michael Bowen) she is willing to give up Ordell because she has a plan of her own. Meanwhile, Ordell has proved himself to be a pretty nasty character, killing associates without even a hint of betrayal, so to say that Jackie is walking a tightrope is an understatement. Rounding out the cast is Robert Forster as Max Cherry, Jackie's bail bondsman hired by Ordell when Jackie is initially arrested by the feds, and eventual love interest, Robert DeNiro as Louis, an associate of Ordell's who is fresh out of jail and about to buy in on one of Ordell's gun selling schemes and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, one of Ordell's women, and object of both fascination and irritation for Louis.'Jackie Brown' features many 'Tarantinoisms' that we have come to expect from his films; slick cinematography, a soundtrack that is perfect for the film (in this case, 1970's R&B) a rich cast of eccentric characters, a solid amount of violence and even more profanity. If there was a Tarantino film that DIDN'T include these elements, I would be disappointed. As John Travolta was dug up to star in 'Pulp Fiction', Tarantino resurrects two 1970's actors, Robert Forster and Pam Grier, and both prove once again that there are few contemporary directors around who have better gut instincts and an eye for casting than he. Although there could have been many other bigger name, safer choices that would have jumped to be in Tarantino's perceived follow-up to 'Fiction', the film geek once again proves that he knows best. Grier is absolutely luminous, and looks at least 10 years younger than her actual age. Better than that, she is sexy, spunky and knows what she wants. The supporting cast is also excellent, and while it's definitely film geeky to admit it, like the actors who appear in the ensemble films of Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson, I always admire the cast of Tarantino's film because while they may not have a large or prestigious role in the film, they are always juicy characters that are sometimes played against type. I loved seeing Michael Keaton as a hard-faced, leather jacket clad fed, and Robert DeNiro, who can chew scenery better than a lot is fantastic as the quiet, shlubby and slobby sidekick.Anyone who approached 'Jackie Brown' looking for a Pulp Fiction sequel was probably either somewhat disappointed or, like me, encouraged that Tarantino can not only do flashy, but can spin a good story as well. And perhaps even more importantly, he wasn't a two-trick pony with the inspired films 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. While I have mixed feelings about Tarantino the man, (I am endeared to his almost autistic-knowledge of film and his inherent film geekiness, but I am both fascinated and repelled by his almost constant hysteria and, particularly in the infancy of his fame, his inability to turn down an acting job or engage in ceaseless self-promotion) I certainly count him among my favorite directors and anytime he releases a film, it's an event. Before seeing his latest releases, 'Kill Bill Vol. 1 & Vol. 2' I lamented that he possibly took too much time off between projects, but after seeing 'Vol. 1' I quickly reconsidered, saying that if he is going to consistently put out superior product, he can take as much time as he wants.And that is why I look at 'Jackie Brown', a film that wasn't quite as stellar or lauded as his others with a certain amount of fondness, because it is a great piece of work, without all of the flash, bells and whistles of its predecessor. Knowing that a 'Pulp Fiction 2' would be an instant hit, Tarantino decided to go in a different direction, and it's that willingness to take a chance, even if it's not a huge leap, that makes me appreciate it that much more. It's probably my least favorite Tarantino film, but even my least favorite Tarantino film garners a better rating than 80% of contemporary cinema. Even Tarantino fans that I know let this film go under their radar, so if you are in the same boat, seek this one out; it is well worth it. 7/10 --Shelly",7,21,29,6 August 2005
Sin City," Good and gory
","With a cast that rivals a Robert Altman film, Robert Rodriguez's latest film 'Sin City' is, quite simply, Frank Miller's stories of the same name come to life. There are three main story arcs that intertwine in small ways: Marv (Rourke) a street tough with a rough looking mug goes to bed one night with a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) and wakes up with her lying dead next to him. When the police show up at his door a moment later, he knows he's been set up and he sets out to find the killer out of respect for her. In the second story, Dwight (Owen) finds out that Jackie Boy, (del Toro) the ex-boyfriend of his current girlfriend Shellie (Murphy) is not only an abusive jerk, but he is about to go wreak havoc on 'Old Town', the red-light district of the city where the prostitutes (and his former girlfriend Gail, played by Rosario Dawson) hold court. In an attempt to protect Gail and the others, Dwight finds himself in a really bad situation that could cause a street war to break out, and put the lives of Gail and her girls in great danger. Finally, there is Hartigan (Willis) a retiring cop whose last case is to track down a pedophile, Rourk Jr. (Stahl) who has kidnapped a young girl. Hartigan tracks him down and administers justice, but Rourk's father is a corrupt Senator, and has Hartigan thrown in jail. Ten years later he finds out that Rourk Jr. is up to his old tricks and that his target is the same girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba), now grown up and an exotic dancer with a heart of gold who has been pining after Hartigan since her rescue. Hartigan must now save Nancy again and stop Rourk Jr. from exacting revenge.There are a lot of characters in 'Sin City', and for the most part, the stories are fulfilling. I thought the first two were the best, but the Hartigan segment was not very compelling, though it was by no means terrible. There were some fantastic characters (I particularly loved Kevin, Elijah Wood's character, but it was such a bizarre and shocking character reveal that I didn't want to go into it in the summary because it's too fantastic experienced first hand.) The real story about 'Sin City' is obviously its cinematography and appearance. Much has been made about the 'comic book come to life' look of the film, but it really is true. As a former comic book fanatic, (though I have not yet read the Sin City series) I was delighted with the presentation. Blood spurts white as well as red against the stark black and white film, blue and green eyes glow from black and white faces, and the eyes of one of the most evil people in the film are obscured by the ominous glare on his eyeglasses. 'Sin City' is a comic book lover/comic book film geek wet dream, put simply.This is actually a really difficult review to write, personally because I had to ascertain my feelings about the film without a prejudice I have toward a certain kind of violence. For no clear reason I have a big problem with decapitations and hangings, and unfortunately 'Sin City' is rife with them. There were times when there were three or four minute scenes when I couldn't look at the screen. But if you don't have a problem with that specifically, you're in businessas long as you don't mind violence, and a great deal of it. I went to the film with six other people and four of them (all Kill Bill fans, mind you) were turned off by the excessive violence, though one of them didn't let that diminish his view of the film. Other than the head thing I was fine, but there was a great deal of slicing, dicing, some cannibalism, even castrations (yes, in the plural sense). Obviously, it is all done in a very cartoonish manner (particularly the scene between del Toro and Owen having a conversation in a car, the scene that Tarantino directed), and even some very violent moments were silhouetted, but the violence is pervasive enough to give me pause about recommending it to say, my parents.I find myself nearly salivating when I think of how cool the film looked, and if it weren't for certain elements I would certainly want to go see it again; it's kind of like being drawn to shiny things. Though I traditionally am a celluloid purist (I had issues even going to see 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'), Rodriguez, probably one of the more schizophrenic directors we have working today (this is a far cry from Spy Kids, to say the least) really created something groundbreaking with 'Sin City', and his vision and success with this medium really make me eagerly anticipate more. Without any prejudice, this film gets 8/10.--Shelly",8,2,6,4 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Compelling epic
","I finally got around to seeing this film about 6 months after I had intended to, and unfortunately picked the hottest day of the summer so far to see it. I say unfortunately because every yokel in the Milwaukee metropolitan area decided to take advantage of the budget prices, and of the air conditioning for three hours, so the audience I watched it with generally were not the least bit interested in actually watching the historical drama and weren't afraid to vocalize this.  Loudly.  And repeatedly.  The good news is, apparently the average attention span for a film is 2 hours, so around the 2 hour mark people seemed to leave the theater in droves, and I finally was able to experience the final hour in relative peace.Having said that, I actually really enjoyed this film.  I have heard complaints of the length, the lack of action, all they do is fight, there's no story, etc. I found it to be not only compelling, but it actually has prompted me to do further research on this time period.  This was a film that Scorcese has been trying to make for a long time, and it is a natural addition to his gallery of films that take place during certain periods of history in New York.  Perhaps I missed something, but I only saw a couple of major fights during the film's three hours, and in answer to the lack of storyline:  Clearly, this was a film not only about the life and times of the Five Points from an historical perspective, but it chose several characters to lead us through this history lesson not through narrative, but as a regular 'life on the street' type of storytelling.  It is also a classic story of a love/hate relationship between mentor and apprentice as well as a struggle with ones own identity and destiny.If I had to issue a complaint or two about the film, I agree that the length was a little cumbersome, and Leonardo DiCaprio apparently kept losing and finding his accent with wild abandon, but that is more nitpicky than anything.  For the few faults this film may have contained, the high points certainly made up for them, namely the amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  I had heard a lot of build up regarding his character over the last several months, and of course he was nominated for an Oscar, but his performance was truly inspired.I will definitely buy this on DVD when it is released, but will probably wait awhile to watch the film itself again.  However, if Scorcese provides a commentary track, I will be watching that instantly - the man is a genius and once again, he has created a film that solidifies my complete awe of his intelligence and vision.--Shelly",7,0,0,29 June 2003
Donnie Darko," Not as impressive as the original
","*This is a review of the Directors Cut*I've already reviewed the originally released cut of 'Donnie Darko' so I am not going to review the film again. Instead, I'll comment on the differences between the two versions; unfortunately most of the differences took away from the original film, which I think is truly excellent. I traveled two hours round-trip with several friends to see the Directors Cut since it was not playing in Milwaukee at the time, and while I am glad that I saw it, I feel that the original is the superior version. There were many superfluous scenes in the new cut which did not add to the film; rather I almost felt that they made the pacing falter a bit. For example, the new scene between Donnie's parents in the café  a completely unnecessary scene which did not add anything relevant to the story. There were a handful of scenes like this, as well as some added dialogue that indeed added to the development of some characters, (Drew Barrymore's character, the teacher 'Karen' was enhanced a bit) for some it just seemed silly (One of Donnie's bus stop friends telling Cherita that he 'hopes she gets molested' turned him from just being an incidental character into being an incidental character who is a jackass.) Another major difference between the two films was the addition of several special effects to the new cut. There were a lot of dream-like sequences (the file cabinets floating among the clouds ala Rene Magritte) and all of the stuff focusing on Donnie's eyeball, computer-ish codes, etc, that just did not work in my opinion. Also, some of the most subtle changes, soundtrack for example, were disarming. The opening song was 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen in the original, which provided a great backdrop in the introduction to Donnie, his environment and his family. Kelly used 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS in his directors cut. Certainly, a good song, but after using a perfect song originally, it is hard to get used to an inferior replacement.Which is how I sum up my feelings about Kelly's directors cut in general? Why mess with (near) perfection? 'Donnie Darko' is a fantastic film that was so thought-provoking it made some people run the other way. Only those who were interested in something beyond the ordinary stayed to ponder and theorize its meaning, and still are to this day. Kelly's new cut does not enhance the film, rather, it made it plodding and a little dumbed-down  two adjectives I never thought I would ascribe to this film. See the directors cut to play 'spot the new stuff', but stick with the original.--Shel",9,348,601,21 September 2004
Donnie Darko," Harvey On Hallucinogenics
","Donnie Darko is a film I've been meaning to watch for about a year now, since it has become something of a cult film. Also, a lot of people I know who have seen it have an opinion about it and appeared to be one of those 'love it or hate it' films which intrigue me even more.  Interestingly enough, the main praise I have heard is that it is a movie that makes you really think, which is the biggest complaint I've heard about it as well. 
**Possible spoiler if you don't read the back of the VHS or DVD, I believe**Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Darko, a suburban teen who is emotionally and mentally disturbed.  By day, he lives a quasi-functional existence, but generally at night, he is visited by a nightmarish rabbit with a scary skull head who tells him to go out and perform destructive acts.  Why would Donnie do this?  Because on October 2, 1988, Donnie is beckoned outside by Frank the rabbit, just in time to avoid the plane engine that comes crashing through Donnie's bedroom.  Therefore, Donnie feels indebted to Frank, who tells him that in 28 days, the world will end.  The film then follows the next 28 days of Donnie's life.I was enjoyed this film for so many reasons. One primary draw is a great character, and Donnie Darko is definitely an incredibly multi-dimensional character.  I was so thrilled to see a figure who is conflicted, eccentric and disturbed, yet incredibly intelligent.  His continual questioning of authority because of his expansive way of thinking is extremely refreshing because so many times we see films where youths question the status quo but don't have the bones to back it up.  Along with the main character, there is an impressive supporting cast - most notably Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom and (words I never thought I would utter) a small but effective performance by Patrick Swayze as a local self-help guru.  I have to make a special mention for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Darko. I had never seen him in a film before this week, and I have now seen him in two, this one and The Good Girl.  I am really looking forward to watching the progression of his career and to see what types of roles he takes in the future because he is extremely talented.  He seems to bring a very believable soulfulness, maturity and intelligence to his roles which was personified in this film. Films that leave many aspects of the plot open for interpretation is another genre that I am attracted to, and this film does just that.  The director, Richard Kelly is still young and has the potential for having a very interesting career if this movie is any indication.  His style is a mixture of two of my favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson and David Lynch, a very attractive combination.  Like PT Anderson he has rich character studies and uses the soundtrack in an extremely effective manner.  I absolutely loved the 80's new wave soundtrack, because you absolutely believe that those songs would be on a mix tape Donnie would put together.  And like Lynch, he explores dark elements to every day life and isn't afraid to insert bizarre characters into his vision.  (Hence Frank the rabbit who, and maybe I missed something if he was supposed to be funny, didn't make me laugh once - I actually took him very seriously and was a little frightened by him).One wouldn't expect to find any humor in a movie that explores mental illness, an impending apocalypse and even the existence of God, but I did laugh a few times.  Most of the laughs were at Jim Cunningham's (Patrick Swayze) expense, and were usually extremely subtle which is again extremely refreshing.Don't bother with this film if you are not interested in suspending disbelief for two hours, and don't even attempt it if you like your stories handed to you on a silver platter, with beginning middle and end explained complete with charts and diagrams.  If you are interested in cinema that takes chances and is going to make you think about it for hours, possibly days after then check this film out immediately because it is outstanding.--Shelly",9,0,1,6 May 2003
The Godfather," Not just a guy film.... maybe
","What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said?  The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling.  I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film. 
The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it.  However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C)  It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater. Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime.  If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.  --Shel",10,2,5,16 August 2003
