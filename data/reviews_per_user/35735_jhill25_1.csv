Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","This movie was beautifully shot, however I was expecting more from this film. Costumes and sets will win awards, I wouldn't hold my breath for any others. As a history buff I feel short changed. I feel the movie had begun to pick up the pace then just ended. The last line is good and I get she (Coppola) was trying to portray the lives of luxury and folly the court lived (which she did), but this should also have taken you to the hours of agony and anguish this woman was put through, the loss of her children, and her courage right before her death. I felt I got about $3.00 worth of her life. Rent the 1938 version for a better picture of this queen's life.",3,2,3,3 November 2006
