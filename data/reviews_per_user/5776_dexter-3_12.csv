Antz," A fun film, with great animation...
","This was an enjoyable film with a nice turn on the neurotic characters usually portrayed by Woody Allen.  Stallone was amusing also.  The animation was great, although the message a bit on the bogus side.  I found the realization of 'Insectopia' very amusing.  A fun '7', although it doesn't displace the king, 'Toy Story.'",7,0,0,7 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas shows fastball, sneaks by a SLOW changeup...
","Well, everyone expected a great film, with a killer story, amazing special effects, and great performances.  What we got was drivel.Yes, I saw and enjoyed the original 'Star Wars' films, but did not see the need to buy sheets or toys or models or otherwise alter my lifestyle to suit Lucas' marketing machine.  Unfortunately, when reading other reviews, one finds that many have bought into this 'saga', and have been suckered into this TERRIBLE excuse for a film from a much older George Lucas.What the 'Great Director' (of five films, no less!) hath wrought is a 2-hour video commercial for his real business, toy and junk merchandising.  There isn't a great moment in this film, and most of it is annoying (Jar Jar Binks, Jake Lloyd) or stupid (the ridiculous underwater city and its inhabitants).  Was that really Oscar-nominated Liam Neeson talking to a flying blue insect, an unintelligible thing with a long tongue and Labrador ears, and a guy with a cool head tattoo and horns?  Wow.  It was amusing to see Samuel Jackson in a film where he didn't swear, but that's it.  Oh, and the pod race with those ridiculous alien characters meant to recall the great chariot race in the second 'Ben Hur'?  I dozed.  As I would expect any adult would, when an annoying eight year old kid is the center of the story, doing ridiculous things ('Gee, I don't know how I just blew up this space station and saved the world, but I better get outta here!').All in, this film is an insult.  One reviewer even said that he/she didn't really LIKE the characters, but had to see the film again to really understand it (as if multiple viewings will reveal more of WHAT ISN'T THERE).  What a scam.  I'm afraid to ask what films or influences are affecting those who wrote and said this was a good film.  I found it embarrassing and insulting, and a poor example of craft from a guy who's had 20 YEARS to think up a better film that appeals more broadly to ADULTS and kids, as the original films did.  All of the alien characters are ridiculous and highly unoriginal.  A friend who saw 'Phantom Menace' also noted that the special effects aren't that much better than the original films, either, and ILM is Lucas' real legacy to filmmaking.  Sorry, but the reviewers are right.  This film is MEDIOCRE AT BEST, and is really a subliminal message to buy junk.  Save your money and see 'The Mummy' or 'Austin Powers', both of which are a hell of a lot more fun.Rating: 1 out of 10.",1,66,129,7 June 1999
Armageddon," My God, what a waste!
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I read that Bruce Willis was upset that the audience was laughing during the supposedly serious parts of the film.  He's got some nerve.  This film is one of the most trite, cliche-ridden exercises ever with not a single original moment in it.  I believe Liv Tyler has a smile on her face through the whole thing because she knows it's so bad.  Unfortunately, browsers can't rate films a '0' at IMDb.  The only slightly mitigating factors here are the performances of Keith David and Billy Bob, which are tongue-in-cheek (I hope!), and the NASA geeks.  Otherwise, rent '2001' or 'Outland' or even 'Deep Impact', all of which are more entertaining.",1,1,3,6 December 1998
The Shining," This film is terrible and overrated because it's 'Kubrick!'...
","I have a running argument about 'The Shining' with a friend who has a varied and keen appreciation of film.  He does not, however, see many 'horror' films (if that's what 'The Shining' is), and does not like or read Stephen King.  Which brings us to the point:  I think 'The Shining' is a great novel, a truly scary entry in it's genre.  Like many King novels, it is about wasted people who become vessels of or for evil.  That may sound silly, but try comparing 'Dolores Claiborne' (also an excellent film) with ''Salem's Lot' or 'The Dead Zone' or 'Gerald's Game', and you'll find there's more there than just sharp teeth or things that go bump in the night.  'The Shining' is, in its simplest form, the study of a man who is a failure at everything he does, including becoming an alcoholic.  This is not a paean to King, however, or to suggest that he's a misunderstood Shakespeare.  There is more to his novels than a serious reader or filmgoer would suspect, and Kubrick leaves most of the meat of this story out of the film.My friend and I also disagree about how one reviews a film based on previously published material, and whether the original source must be invoked in comparison.  Regardless of one's bias to that particular issue, Kubrick fails on both fronts here.  (I believe it is a valid comparison to review both film and original source.)  I found 'The Shining' to be miscast (Shelley Duval????), poorly acted (Duval and Nicholson, who is just over the top), and poorly adapted for the screen.  The Scatman Crothers character is made superficial (all that way JUST for an ax in the chest), the development and attempts at denial of Torrance's encroaching madness are barely sketched, the heroic and suffering role of Wendy is replaced by Duval's whining, the hilarity of Danny talking to his finger (the now famous croak 'REDRUM!') still amuses me, and the subtle horror of the novel is replaced by the ridiculous 'Elevators of Blood' scene.  I've seen much better psychological horror films ('The Haunting', 'Daughter of the Mind') and better raw horror films ('Night of the Living Dead', 'Halloween',  'Prince of Darkness'), and this film is just BAD.I believe 'The Shining' receives good reviews because 'Kubrick!' directed it and 'Jack!' plays a loony in the lead, but it just doesn't cut it.  It is well-filmed and has some good scenes and lines.  But, if it's not a horror film, then what the hell type of film is it?  I'm also a big Kubrick fan, and although his career peaked with 'A Clockwork Orange', his later efforts (excluding this one) still have merit.  If you disagree with what I've written, then read the novel and see the much better TV film adapted by King (even though he wrote in a hokey ending).",2,7,18,23 March 1999
American Beauty," This film is a fraud...
","'American Beauty' is excessively praised as a great piece of American film, when in reality it isn't even good enough to be a decent rip-off of better films.  Unfortunately, many viewers have fallen for it.  ('Moonspinner55' and 'tubist38' have good reviews.  Note that one person who initially praised the film reviewed it again a year later and said, 'What was I thinking?')  Mendes wastes some excellent actors in these meatball scenes (for example, Spacey throwing the asparagus...who couldn't do that well?)  A lot of this film is some snappy one-liners or clever scenes strung together with...nothing.  Everything that happens is almost laughably predictable. And the crucial scene, where an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind is supposed to impart some deep meaning on the true nature of existence in the phenomenal world?  Right.  Finally, I must comment on Annette Bening, who is one of the better actresses working today being cast in the role of a cartoon...what a waste.This film is a '1,' and should in fact have a turkey symbol next to it. 'American Beauty' is the perfect symbol of the decline of the serious American film.  'Ordinary People,' 'Out of the Blue,' and 'The Sweet Hereafter' are much better films.",1,17,34,4 June 2001
Independence Day," Some good special effects and scenes, overall a hollow effort...
","Several good reviews ('John' and anonymous on the Spanish conquest of the Americas), but all generally say the same thing:  Great effects, so-so to lousy film.  The characters here were poorly drawn, the American flag-waving a little excessive, Bill Pullman gives one of the WORST 'rally 'round the flag' speeches ever (he should see Kenneth Branagh's St. Crispin's passage in 'Henry V'), and a severe drop-off in the second half of the film.  This could have been a great one...I was also struck by how incongruous a couple Pullman and Mary McDonnell were.  And, I was amused by the thought that if all exotic dancers were as attractive AND resourceful as Viveca Fox, the question of who will be the nation's first female presidential candidate is resolved.  Oh, well...what happened to the sense of discovery or wonder that infused the early SciFi films of the 50s and 60s, where real questions about progress and humanity were raised?  I must say that 'Independence Day' is a poor effort even in comparison to 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' or 'Fantastic Planet'.  A '4' out of '10'.",4,1,2,2 April 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Dated, but fun...
","This film, one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) musicals ever made, unfortunately shows its age.  Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish.  It has not aged well.  I recently saw 'Singin' in the Rain' at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium.  (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show.  Films selected are usually 'classics' like 'Gone With The Wind' or 'Casablanca', and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities.  Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts.  That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints.  I rated the film a '7' just for that scene alone.",7,7,11,19 April 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Okay but WAY overrated...
","'Lock, Stock...' has some interesting scenes and good camerawork, and may be a great introduction to the British underclass.  However, it's difficult to understand, very profane, and unfortunately, derivative.  These types of hijinks have been filmed before ('The Italian Job' and 'Get Carter' respectively do the English caper and brutal crime things better), and they're never believable anyway.  The film will hold your attention, but isn't as amusing or clever as the average 'Monty Python' episode.A '6.'  Sensitive viewers should note that the film is very violent and profane.",6,6,12,15 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," This AIN'T a horror film...
","'The Sixth Sense' is NOT about ghosts or the supernatural.  Yes, there seem to be 'spirits' or something, but think:  Why are they there?  How does Cole resolve the conflict?  That's what the film is about...All the characters struggle with loneliness (even 'aloneness') and an almost desperate need to 'finish' something.  That's what makes the film so affecting.  Initially, I was mad that I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on, but I later realized that it was due to some trickery AND some skill on the part of the writer/director.  The film's depth was fully realized by the excellent performances of HJ Osment and Toni Collette, who is outstanding in her role as a struggling single mother.  She is marvelous at playing each of the different situations her character is challenged with, and her facial expressions ring true every time.  The final scene with Lynn and Cole in the car is very touching, as Cole has often said he doesn't want his mother to see him as a freak.  Willis is also good, as is Philadelphia.  Wahlberg is certainly convincing.  It's difficult to discuss the plot without potentially spoiling the film, so my advice would be to just see it.  It ain't 'The Blair Witch Project,' so if that's the thrill you're seeking, you'll be disappointed.A '9' out of '10.'",9,0,0,19 August 1999
The Matrix," Quite a ride...
","'The Matrix' is an absolute thrill-a-minute ride with a twist: there's a plot and some depth behind the superb special effects.  The film is highly entertaining, provocative, is generally well-acted (Reeves does a great job UNDERPLAYING his role here), and it boasts a terrific villain in 'Mr. Smith,' whose monotone barely disguises his loathing for humans.  The producer of 'The Phantom Menace' should take note of the use and quality of the fx here, and perhaps get a clue for his next film.  In particular, the martial arts scene with Fishburne and Keanu is not new, but is sharp and nicely integrated into the plot.My main issues with the film (as also noted by Roger Ebert) are that it has a partially derivative screenplay (see 'Dark City,' the writings of Philip Farmer and Harlan Ellison, and certain stock action films), and that the climax, while exciting, is predictable and well-worn, and implies that the screenwriters and story editors simply ran out of ideas.  This leaves the viewer unsatisfied with the traditional 'good guy v. bad guy' fight that leaves the intellectual issues raised earlier unresolved.  That said, 'The Matrix' is great entertainment and a definite 'big screen' film.  An '8.'",8,0,0,25 October 1999
The Breakfast Club," Doesn't stand the test of time...
","I saw this when it premiered, and liked it a lot better then.  This has not aged well.  Of course, I am almost 40, but these issues seem slight to me now.  The situations one now faces as an adult are Olympian in proportion to what these kids whine about.  So, here is an essential fact to remember when looking at this film:  Most teenagers think their parents don't care, don't listen, and don't know anything.  They're wrong.  The truth is, the world doesn't revolve around post-puberty teenagers.  The issues raised here most often occur because of poor communication (which is not necessarily always the fault of either parents or teens).  No one, not even grown-ups, have all the answers.  Deal with it.  And yes, sometimes bad stuff happens to kids like the Judd Nelson character, but if it ain't you, get over it.  (This does NOT mean I condone that behavior, or encourage people to ignore it if they see it.  It is here for drama.)  Think I'm full of s**t?  Look at the high school these kids 'go' to...I went to one 'like' it, and last time I checked, the people I graduated with were pretty much okay.  The problems they face now sure aren't 'high school' in nature.Hughes does a lot of damage demonizing parents here.  The Estevez character may dislike his father, but he would thank him in the 'grown-up' sequel (which could still be made...it's not like any of these actors went anywhere.  They're available).Some good scenes, b.s. ending.  A '3' out of '10.'  No one ever reviews how the janitor and Bender interact and what they talk about, thereby ignoring what should be an integral part of the film and an insight into 'grown-up' behavior.",3,6,15,22 June 1999
Jurassic Park," Okay the first time, looks worse after the second viewing...
","I saw this film twice, once at general release and later on video to appease a small child.  The first time I thought it was okay, but after the second view, I realized...NOT!  Spielberg and the rest of the production team have taken an interesting Crichton novel and made a terrible film with many changes, not all for the best.  The special effects and the 'island' are great, as is Laura Dern's bottom (to summarize an earlier review), but the rest was just...there.  Too bad, too, because they waste some great actors, notably Sam Neill (who does deliver one of the most convincing lines I've ever seen, as 'Karen Davis' notes).  Like 'Independence Day', this could have been a great film, but falls far short of expectations, and could have used a better continuity editor.  The sequel is TERRIBLE.  'The Lost World' is a more enjoyable alternative.",3,15,37,2 April 1999
