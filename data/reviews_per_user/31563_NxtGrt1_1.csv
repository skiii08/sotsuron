Scarface," Awesome Film, Pacino at His Best
","Though a very graphic and violent film, Scarface is a powerful and gripping movies that  explores the depths of the narcotics business in America, from the blue collar to the white collar. The film is brilliantly done by Brian DePalma(The Untouchables) and wonderfully acted by Al Pacino, who gives some of his best work here. Very entertaining and a cinema classic.",9,0,1,6 January 2004
