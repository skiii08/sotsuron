Despicable Me 2," bwahahahahah
","i give it 10/10 because it was just outright funny and entertaining. a perfect family film. bright colourful characters, charming animation style and an entertaining plot.its not going to change the world, but in terms of 90 minutes of entertainment, i laughed, i laughed again and wiped a tear. loved the first film, love that they give the minions more screen time in this one. a perfect movie to cheer up a weary heart or entertain the kiddies.nothing for parents to be concerned with, no swearing no adult themes, just fun.",10,1,2,3 September 2013
Spider-Man 3," worth seeing but losing its charm a bit
","oki so im probably gunna piff some people off here, but i have to say i was a little disappointed with this movie.I ADORE this kind of movie, and had me booked to see it on opening night. i did however leave feeling slightly let down.the graphics as always are fantastic and fast paced.the flaw i think came in the characters and the story lines. at the end of the day i just felt that there was TOO much going on. there was easily another movie in this, and what drew me to this movie was the whole dark side of spidey, which in the end turned out to be...well...corny badass. bad peter parker turned into some emo haired eyelined overly sexed character rather than some dark twisted mind. having said that there were a lot of laugh out loud moments.there were probably 3 main story lines in this movie. the sandman story could have been a separate storyline in another movie, the relationship between peter and harry would have worked nicely as a side story to the main good spidey bad spidey but unfortunately the two stories didn't interact nearly as much as they could have.it felt overly long, probably because they tried to cram 2 movies worth into one. i cant help but feel this really let the movie down from what it so easily could have been.still worth watching, but not what was expected.",7,1,1,5 May 2007
Match Point," a huge disappointment
","i went into the cinema with mixed expectations, id read a lot of critics claiming it to be a masterpiece, had a lot of friends saying it was awful. i did however go in with an open mind and was hoping id have spent money on something worthwhile.i was extremely disappointed.the actual story was very deep, carnal and dark in its explorations of desire and guilt but was completely let down by appalling acting.the characters were lacking in any real identity and personality, making it extremely hard to care what happened and how. there was no chemistry between the two main characters, chris and nola, and the emotional depth that would have been magnificent had it been achieved was tepid and underdeveloped.this film had the potential to be something extremely dark and disturbing, as well as moving. however all i was left with was a feeling of disappointment, and resentment that i had wasted my money on this example of how not to cast a movie.in short, i just didn't care what happened, which made the ending such a failure despite its completely unexpected angle. this movie lacked the talent and skill of its actors to show the depth of emotion needed for such an involved and deep plot to work.i wouldn't recommend it",4,1,3,26 January 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," a complete mess
","i cant understand how this movie could have got the credit its achieved when its completely misleading.this is without a doubt NOT a fantasy movie. this movie is NOT as advertised as a dark exploration into fantasy, it is a very disjointed poor effort at attaining a level of creative genius that simply surpassed the skills of the director.don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the excellent acting in this movie. i have no qualms about the talent seen on screen.i am however struggling to understand how people can have reached such a level of dullness that they could see this movie and be astounded by its creative imagery.do we not read anymore? do we not draw? do we not dream. this film completely lacked any skill any creative talent that was abundant in other films such as the original labyrinth movie and dark crystal. what has happened to imagination? this film exploited computer technology and advanced special effects to add polish to what was simply an extremely dull and lacking story.perhaps what i found most displeasing about this movie, is its frankly insulting attitude to fantasy. this movie could have been done so well, and no this is not an attack on its Spanish origins. this movie simply splashes about special effects and crams in totally unneeded fantasy elements that simply do not fit. this film is NOT a fantasy, in fact the fantasy elements totalled to less than half an hour of the film and were so disjointed from the storyline that they completely failed to have any impact.i cant help but feel like this movie that is being defended simply because its foreign actually managed to sit itself with the rest of the commercial drivel that seems to be coming out of America. this in itself is not terrible, i can enjoy a shallow meaningless movie for what it is. this movie however tries and fails to attain a level of creativity and depth that it set itself out to have.really was so terribly disappointed with this movie. please please please do not confine your imagination to this absolute trash. only reason I'm giving it 4 is because the separate elements on their own have merit, but as a film, this was an absolute mess.",6,4,10,5 May 2007
Forrest Gump," watch it to enjoy it
","hm I'm a little shocked at the level of hatred for this film. I've seen it at least half a dozen times, and every time i cannot help but be touched.i think a lot of people are taking it far too seriously.i don't think this film is about all the events featured in it, its not about the moral implications of war, about the right and wrong way to live life, i don't even think its all that much about the 'american dream' this film is about the way a simple minded innocent man LIVES through these experiences, its about his VIEWS on life.i think its really sad that people can watch this film and completely miss what makes it so moving. if u watch this film as a walk-through of the life of an extremely likable character, if u see it as he sees things, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie experience. if your going to watch it to pick faults in the personality and views presented then you will undoubtedly find a lot to complain about.its a story about how one individual handles the situations that life throws at him. it is what makes this film so charming.",Null,3,6,11 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," the right way to relaunch a franchise
","Before eyes start rolling, trolls start trolling, i LOVE star wars, i grew up with the originals, have seen them countless times, waited with enthusiasm for the prequals, was disappointed beyond measure when they lost the force, laughed scornfully when heard Disney got hold of rights, sneered at idea that yet again star wars was being sold to the highest bidder BUT i loved it and with shame i had to admit within the opening scenes that this was going to be epic. there are going to be certain individuals that will tear apart any attempt to relaunch a much loved story, but i left that behind and sat with wonder while my boyfriend gaped with glee. the outstanding contribution from the actors, extending through to the extras made each scene moving, exhilarating, a true space opera. part of what made Star Wars magical was the level of detail, the busyness of the landscapes, the feel of a very much alive galaxy far far away. this was back with new technology giving everything a polish. body language plays a huge roll, as it did with the magnificent Vader, we were reliant on the nuance of motion, a tilt of the head, a catch in the voice to get behind the mask of the new antagonist. (the voice acting was superb, deep and resonating with emotion). likewise without seeing the face, we are introduced to a storm trooper who sees with clarity what he has become. The musical score was ever present, swelling at times and yet unnoticeable as a separate thing. it became part of the landscape, and lacked the gimmicky trills and flamboyancy of the prequels (thank goodness) The space battles were glorious and not overdone. each one having purpose and power. the droids were funny and witty, restoring the humour as it was originally. The driving force of the story returns to the notion of family,the destruction of not having one, the loss of loved ones, and the idea that power and family are not compatible. some felt the antagonist Kylo Wren was spoilt and shallow, but in him i saw and felt the despair of a family touched by power (lets not forget the Jedi trained separated from all influence light or dark to avoid corruption) and in him we see that to have power is very lonely indeed. Cannot wait for the next installment, to follow the enchanting Rey on her journey. Don't let trolls make your mind up, watch it and decide.",9,4,19,24 December 2015
Munich," one of the most powerful and thought provoking films you will ever see
","quite simply, this movie is one of the most thought provoking, disturbing and utterly human portrayal of real life that your ever going to get.as a 19 year old, i went into it not fully understanding the subject matter, came out not really understanding all the details, but the main thing i got from this film, which was driven into my mind through the mesmirising acting of a superb cast, is that in war there is never one side to a story, no side is ever completely innocent.i cannot possibly explain the impact this movie has. the realistic and gritty filming makes it seem almost as if your walking along with the characters. one of the group. you feel their emotion, and piece together information as they get it.no comment is ever going to do this film justice. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT, you will remember it. this film is truly a masterpiece, and will be remembered for years to come. though the situation was based on real events, the emotions, and the concepts are easily applied to modern day.what most upset me, was that 30 years on, and we are still making the same mistakes.just because somebody is on the opposite side, does not make them the enemy.i fight you because u fight me. you fight me because i fight you.its horrific. this film is a must see.",8,2,3,16 February 2006
V for Vendetta," utterly explosive
","this movie is a must see. i was so anxious to see it after the impressive previews, but i was so unprepared for the actual experience.i could EASILY go on and on about the superb twists and intricacies in the plot, but i think its best to see the movie to fully appreciate the power of this film. i was concerned, that this would turn out to be another comic book action movie, with cheap thrills (as much as i love em) and action packed scenes with little story line.was i impressed.the thing which really sets this film apart from the rest of its genre is the casting. i cannot remember ever being so immersed in individual characters, and Vendetta has plenty. V was cast perfectly, i was utterly enchanted and charmed, but at the same time frightened and horrified by his hate and twisted morals, i simply couldn't help but be drawn in by such a character. Hugo Weaving did a masterful portrayal of a deep emotional character, without ever taking the mask off. it was his presence and magnificent mastering of speech that made V such a charismatic and powerful character.Natalie portman was magnificent, John Hurt masterful in his delivery, as well as Stephen Rea who tied the whole thing together.the music score was powerful and moving, amplifying and exaggerating some of the most crucial scenes in such a way it had the hairs on my neck standing on end.this movie had the potential to be a good action comic movie adaptation, but in reality achieved so much more.the plot is not far fetched, is in fact running in parallel with a lot of recent events, and so convincing in its delivery that this film is a powerful statement of just where the world seems to be going.one of the best movies i have seen for years, visually stunning, expertly directed and produced, powerful and flawless in the skills of its actors- the last scenes will take your breath away and have anyone British asking themselves if they would have been standing there with a mask too.not art, just magnificent.",9,3,6,22 March 2006
