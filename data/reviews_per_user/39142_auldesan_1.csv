Sucker Punch," If I were only younger
","You have to understand what kind of movie this is to appreciate it. There is a specific target demographic that a movie like Sucker Punch shoots for...I can't say that I was enthralled about this movie as I was about 300, but Zack Snyder still captured my attention well enough to meet my relative expectations visually (I wasn't as drawn in by the storyline). I think this would have fared better in my eyes if I was about 5 or 6 years younger. I was much bigger into video games and comics even at that point in my life, but just haven't found the time for it as I've grown up, had a more serious career and family. Overall, I'd say that this a cool action, OK acting, better than average storytelling, and a fairy decent script (the best parts were all of the promotional trailers and cool concept art that have so frequently become the staple of a Zack Snyder Film (strongly hinting Frank Miller artistic vibes).",6,4,7,2 April 2011
