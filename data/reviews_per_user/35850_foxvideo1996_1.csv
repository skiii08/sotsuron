The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Dark, Depressing and Ridiculously Clichéd
","I first found out about this movie from my older sister who's name I won't reveal here. She knew I enjoyed The Breakfast Club and every other John Hughes movie and she also knew I had a massive crush on Emma Watson. So she told me that I would enjoy this film. We watched it together on a rainy Friday night when my parents went out to dinner. I went into this movie with the spirit of all of John Hughes movies in my mind. But I was wrong. As I'm watching this movie, I was shocked and disturbed by how horrible this movie was. This movie wasn't even remotely like any of John Hughes' movies. I rather watch those movies any day over this train wreck. This movie relies on massive dark and depressing clichés as seen in all teen movies such as abusive family members, underage drinking/drug use/partying, bullying, crying over how no one accepts you, etc. The some of those things actually triggered bad memories for me which I won't go into here. The partying scenes are so ridiculous. As I'm watching these scenes, I kept expecting Arnold Schwarzenegger from Kindergarten Cop to show up with a shotgun and shoot up the party and say 'I'm the party pooper'. The only thing that kept the movie going for me was Emma Watson. I just kept watching the movie for her scenes. But other than that, I could barely maintain my sanity while watching this garbage. The worst moment in this movie is Charlie's breakdown scene. This is literally the most overacted scene in any movie I have ever scene. It's almost to the point of unwatchable. I wanted to give up from here, but I didn't. Another big flaw I noticed with this movie was all the dark color tinting. This movie was supposed to be a teen dramedy not a horror movie. It makes The Breakfast Club look like Twilight. I'm not saying The Breakfast Club was hilarious. I'm saying that movie was more bright and colorful and had more humor in it than this. Anyway, after I finished this movie, I immediately did a Bill Murray marathon which consisted of Stripes, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Meatballs and Caddyshack as an attempt to cleanse myself from the filth of this movie. If you want to maintain your sanity and not bring back traumatic memories, do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this movie as you can. Don't waste your time on this big pile of feces that this movie is. You'll thank me for this one day. That is all.",1,13,31,16 October 2016
