Blade Runner 2049," Great movie
","I watched the original Blade Runner 3 times so when I read the good critiques of this movie, I was very excited,While it didn't conserve the dark atmosphere of the original, Blade Runner 2049 it still had the same theme. What's humanity? It even had a similar twist at the end.Ryan Gosling had a great performance and it's always great to watch Harrison Ford. The scenario is great and the music and scenery are breathtaking. So all the good ingredients for a good sci-fi.The only minus is the villains, I would have loved to know more about them and about the inception of the new generation of the blade runners.",9,3,13,19 December 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," One of my favorites
","Insanely good
Historical time is beautiful. Spain during the civil War
You learn about the revolutionaries, also about their dreams
The fantasy makes sense
You emphasize with the girl, through the fantasy you see her dreams and hopes
The villain is scary. The general is one of the best villains
One of the most beautiful endings. I cried.
You feel 'woooah' at the beauty
The music complements the story perfectly",10,1,2,25 January 2020
Full Metal Jacket," Great antiwar movie
","Many have found this movie consists in 2 parts. Personally, I find there are three distinct parts in this movie, the second one consisting a bridge between the 1st and the 3rd one.The first part consisted training the soldiers.
The second part consists in discovering Vietnam, its people and the other soldiers.
The third part finally was all about the war, its consequences and its effect on the soldiers.Full metal jacket is a very intelligent anti-war movie, perhaps a bit too intelligent, as many misunderstood its message. The movie manages to not only condition the trainees but also to condition us the viewers. And that's the power of the movie.And effectively the first part made us feel for the trainees. They were so strong, organized and funny that one could only feel sympathy for them. By the end of the first part one was expecting this hard training to result in forming some mighty heroes.However soon enough one sees the result of the dehumanization in the boot camp. Their experiences in Vietnam even accentuate this. At the end of the movie one realises even more that the soldiers not only are brainwashed but that they lost all of their humanity.",9,1,1,24 September 2019
Shrek 2," Very entertaining again
","With lots of humor, great characters and excellent songs, Shrek 2 is an extremely entertaining movie. The story is fast paced enough that one not only doesn't get bored, but doesn't even realize the passing time.And while the first Shrek movie was mostly about Shrek and Fiona, in this one it's the supporting characters that steal the show. Especially Donkey and Puss were a joy to watch, each of their reactions and interactions being a treat.Similarly to the first movie, Shrek 2 doesn't have the depth and emotion to be a 10/10. I wish we could've seen more of Fairy godmother's story and Shrek and Fiona's relationship. I also like Shrek 1 a little bit mostly because I preferred Lord Farquaad to the prince charming and the fairy godmother.Considering the good ending and the bad reputation of the other sequels, I think I'm going to to stop here with the Shrek saga, for fear of being disappointed with the other sequels..",8,1,1,12 July 2019
Shrek," Great Movie
","I absolutely loved this movie. It has all the ingredients of a classic: an original story, great characters(especially donkey), great humor and a stunning soundtrack.
I especially loved how much of the movie was a jab on Disney/Eisner(Dulac & Lord Farquaad for example).
+ the humor (it had so many memorable scenes)
+ the songs
+ the story
+ the uniqueness (Shrek is one kind of)
+ the pace
<ul><li>the movie lacked the emotions and the depthness necessary to be a 10/10 for me. If one wants that, he should watch the beauty and the beast, not Shrek.</li></ul>= very entertaining, in fact so entertaining that one wishes to watch more and feels like the movie was a bit too short.
= great movie. felt too short. doesn't possess the magic of the old disney movie to be a 10/10.",9,0,0,10 July 2019
