National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A bad copy of the first film
","If you have seen National Treasure don't bother to watch this movie. Same plot, same jokes, same characters but worse acting. It looks like the film crew didn't bother at all, how the film might look at the end. For example: Why should anyone build a deadly trap with an escape possibility ?Why is Gates ancestor innocent of they find the treasure ? Makes no sense might have been part of the conspiracy as well.The president on the one hand wants Gates to succeed but on the other hands does many thing to prevent him to succeed for no reason.I could go on for hours.Me and my friends spent a long time after we watched the movie with making fun of its flaws and logical mistakes. No kidding, in every single scene you can find logical mistakes. I even apologized to my friends for taking them into this movie.",1,9,15,25 January 2008
Casino Royale," 8.0 is totally overrated
","I'm not a big Bond fan and i didn't expect much of this movie, but its an OK popcorn action movie. I'm expecting a good story, cool action, new ideas and many surprises of a 8.x movie. This film doesn't justify such a rating.If you are a Bondfan you'll most likely love or hate this movie. Its a completely other Bond than Brosnan was and many people will say this isn't a Bond but its not a new Bond, its just a completely other Bond than Brosnan was. Personally i like this Bondtype much more than the Brosnan type of Bond. But in the end this in only a composition of old Bond movies. No new ideas in this movie. Bond showing emotions? Already seen in 'licence to kill'. Bond getting tortured ? already seen in 'die another day'.The action scenes are pretty good but not better than in any other A class Actionmovie and especially nothing amazing in times of Mission Impossible 3.The story is OK but its getting weird from time to time. If you watch the movie carefully you'll even find some logical flaws.There were also parts in the movie when i felt like at the end of 'Lord of the ring 3'. You sit in the cinema and ask yourself when its going to end and it goes on and on and on.If you are a bond-fan go watch it. If you like action-movies, go watch it. If you like popcorn movies without much thinking, go watch it. If you want anything else, don't wast your time.I don't think anyone would talk much about this film if it didn't have the 'Bond' in the name.",5,4,7,30 November 2006
