Ghost," ...So what can a ghost do afterall?
","It is one of the few times i rate a rather light movie less than the overall rating. This movie has many flaws, according to me. I mean...the movie turns around from the things a ghost can or cannot do. So, from the movie we see that a ghost cannot touch people or make them feel its presence. They cannot hear it. Additional, a ghost cannot touch material things, such as doors, unless it concetrates hard. Yet, we can see the ghost walking on the road, walking on the floor of its house, taking the stairs (!!!!) to go to the next floor. We can see it jump...so does GRAVITY affect ghosts? What are they made of then? Don't get me wrong, im not the kind of guy that would search a movie for flaws to judge it, and i have enjoyed many films about ghosts and other supernatural things. But, in this movie, i could not understand what the ghost could do. It couldn't touch a door to open, it could walk right through it. OK. Yet, he couldn't walk through the walls? Or worse, through the floors? Or he could sit on a couch???? Could he feel the material things, yes or no??? There is a difference between claiming the ghost can move things with the power of its mind, soul or whatever, and claiming a ghost can naturally walk, jump, feel the wall but not the door, pass through the wall of the train and land on the floor of it??? (pardon my English). Those mistakes, can naturally be made since we are dealing with supernatural things, but if they ruin the whole point of the movie, then yes it affects the way im gonna rate it.",5,5,13,14 April 2004
