Scarface," The very best of Al Pacino
","Well watched this movie for the second time,and that too after a decade.
Very randomly played Scarface on Netflix and was absolutely stunned by the level of acting potrayed by the legend Al Pacino himself.
Brings back a lot of Hollywood Great hits at that time which I have to re-watch including Heat...Amazing film to watch anytime that's for sure.",8,0,0,19 February 2020
