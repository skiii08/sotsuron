The Blair Witch Project," What movie did you see?
","After reading all the comments praising this movie as a scary masterpiece, I really want to know 'WHAT MOVIE DID YOU WATCH?' The Blair Witch Project is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It is so beyond what is being hyped in the media it is beyond belief. I along with the majority of a packed audience were screaming 'REFUND!' at the end. I was not impressed with the actors, the script or even the plot.  I truly think word-of-mouth on how bad this movie really is will destroy any chance this movie becoming a blockbuster. It is truly one of the worst movies of the decade.",1,1,3,2 August 1999
Cast Away," Great Movie but. . .
","It really seem like one big ad for Federal Express. I think it would have been better if there was a fake company Hanks' character worked for. (I guess the same would apply for the ball named Wilson) there is too much commercialization in American movies. So much so now that there is no need for ads in between breaks now. You see an actor drinking a Coke,  calling someone on an Ericsson cell phone, driving a Pontiac Aztec.That trend is taking away from the true art that was American film.",Null,1,2,4 January 2001
