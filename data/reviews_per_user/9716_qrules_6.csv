Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," After 16 years...
","I have to admit I changed my mind about Episode 1 after I read the famous theory about Darth Jar Jarhttps://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_bin ks_was_a_trained_force_user/and re-watched it making a close analysis. I came to the conclusion: George you are an evil genius. Why didn't just ignore the Jar Jar bashing and stick to your original plan - whatever it was? Here is why:When I watched Ep 1 back in '99 I was already prepared for the annoying Jar Jar thanks to the reviews. But when you just ignore all this you can actually really enjoy the subtle details on the first half of the movie - while the second half when they arrive at Coruscant is still clumsy and flawed. I guess George ran out of time.I assume you read the theory in the link. I do not completely agree with it, but it will help you to understand what comes next: I will just give a quick analysis of the first 20 minutes to prove that this movie is not that bad, but first you must be ready to look behind Jar Jar's behavior:When we meet Jar Jar:Qui-Gon runs into Jar Jar and he thinks, Jar Jar is a moron and tells him to leave. Jar Jar then already managed to change Qui-Gon's mind, by using (force) manipulation. Jar Jar implants the idea that it is demanded by the gods to stay with Qui-Gon and serve him. From that point on Qui-Gon thinks Jar Jar serves him. But who is really serving whom? Also note how clever this demanded by the god thing is later!Then Obi-Wan runs into them with blaster fire from some droids. Jar Jar escapes the blaster fire pretty fast and Qui-Gon destroys the droids. All this happens so fast, the audience hardly has time to realize what happens!On the run, Jar Jar mentions Gunga City but says they cannot go there, why? He perfectly realizes both Jedi need transportation and Jar Jar made the Jedi think it was their idea to go to Gunga City. But whose idea was it really? Finally when Jar Jar somersaults into the water he pops up saying: You follow me now, OK? Right! Got the message! So the Jedis are fooled and the audience is fooled as well, all are thinking what an annoying idiot! But if you look past this and try to understand what Jar Jar really does and why it becomes more interesting!The whole thing continues when they are before Boss Nass. There you can also see excellent editing, indicating who is just influencing whom. Note there is a cut to Jar Jar's point of view! Ask yourself why and you'll understand!When they are leaving Jar Jar manipulates Qui-Gon into asking Boss Nass about his release. Qui-Gon can now use the gods demand it point he learned earlier or else how would he knew that?Now, I admit the movie still has clumsy dialogue but realizing what Jar Jar actually does and what sort of character he really was intended to be, it made the movie much more interesting to me.As mentioned above, with the arrival on Coruscant the movie gets kind of dull again. But if I think unemotional about it, the first half of this movie has a much better, more complex plot and much better character development than episode 4 and episode 7. Sad, but somehow true. I am not saying the newest episode is bad, but a master mind seems to be missing. Never thought I'd write this.So give this movie another chance and try to look behind Jar Jar's behavior, the CGI crap and the medichlorians, they are just a story tool to show how important Anakin is.",8,3,8,17 December 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 5 Darth Vaders out of 10 and Vader has no real function for the plot!
","I just saw the midnight premiere in Germany and I just wish to share my thoughts in this movie. I should mention I watched ANH right before this one, so I got a good comparison.First, I would like to congratulate Disney for really trying to make a different movie, it has some good looking effects, the Star Destroyers looked like they were models, at least in some shots, which I appreciate. K-2SO has some funny one liners, Darth Vader is in it and the references are very neat. **SPOILER** Although I ask myself how the two 'death sentences on 12 systems'-guys (dunno their names) escaped the destruction of the city?All in all it felt nice to watch, yet there are numerous things, aesthetically, about the staging and the characters, that to me do not fit. If you want to know why Vader has no real function in the story, skip to the end. There is Darth Vader's costume and statue. The whole thing seems somehow wrong. I thought to myself the helmet and his statue are looking too stocky and that rubber part under his helmet? It may be the same thing used in ANH, but it just does not look like it.Although I was surprised about the quality of Grand Moff Tarkin's face, I could easily tell when it was CG and when it was stock footage. Nice try though.Some shots on Yavon 4 are the same as in ANH, but still they were not able to recreate the atmosphere. But they gave it a good try.By trying to close a plot hole, that is the existence of the exhaust port, another was created: why on earth didn't the death star attack the rebel fleet? Really? To give Vader his moment? There are some other things in the final battle that made no sense, but that's o.kThat virtually none of the main characters of the movie survives is the classic recipe for a so called war movie, but I found the deaths of most of the characters quite boring. It would have given the movie a much better dramaturgy if Vader killed most of them, but no, he just has to kill some poor rebel crew members.Now for Vader. The bacta tank scene has no real function. Why is it there? We all know what is wrong with Vader. His conversation with Krenic does what exactly? Remind him of all his mishaps and give him a warning? Krenic already knew this from Tarkin.The boarding of the rebel ship? Haha. Vader accomplished nothing! The rebels escaped with the plans. (By the way the corvette in which the rebels escape looks wrong too!) So the story could have lived well without Vader or it makes Vader look really bad because he wasn't able with all his force powers to pull the disc with the plans out of the hand of that one rebel? Sorry that is lame. Vader is just there to please the fans.I think the movie would have worked much much better if the Krenic character would have been replaced by Vader and make him the main villain of the movie and Tarkin responsible for the construction of the Death Star as it was indicated at the end of RotS! It also would have served the ongoing tension between Vader and Takin in ANH if they would have had tensions in this movie as well.",5,16,33,14 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A hollow flashy shell
","As a long time fan of Star Wars and movies in general I followed all the leaks and rumors, because I was curious of what would happen after the very bad episode 8.So I went with no expectations and was mildly surprised, because it isn't THAT bad. The plot is in fact hard to follow, especially in the beginning. There are a lot of jump cuts and the movie feels like two movies have been cramped into one. The interaction between the characters is good and for the first time you get the feeling there actually is a chemistry there. The production value also is excellent, but hey, Disney has money.*** SPOILERS ***The problems, however, are immense:1. There are a lot of plot holes. Not only in the movie itself, but also if you see all trilogies as a whole. To name just two: how did the emperor survived his fall into the shaft and the death star explosion? And why don't the rebel ships explode when the emperor hits them with force lightning while Rey destroys the other transporter?2. The characters hardly have time to breath. The movie throws them from one bad situation into the next. So neither the characters nor the audience have time to process all of it and therefore the movies fails to make the audience connect with the characters and as a result the characters feel hollow. In the beginning I felt some excitement, but it quickly faded away after 60 minutes, because it was too much too fast.3. The movie trys to gloss over its lack of substance with red herrings (Chewie 'dies' and im the next scene we are told he didn't) and member berries. Remember when Yoda got the x wing out of the water? It is so cool when Luke does it. Or remember the duel between Vader and Luke on the death star? Let's play the proper music theme. Also Han Solo shows up to give Ben a pep talk.4. On closer examination it has the same beats as RotJ: death of the 2nd master (Yoda and now Leia), first the quest to get a thing (freeing Han and now finding the way finder) confrontation with the emperor, attack on a massive fleet of star destroyers, 'ground attack' to make sure the big target can be achieved. In total it is a creative bankruptcy.5. The plot is so contrived it is almost painful. Every time the heroes have reached a dead end, something happens. For instance when the heroes get captured on the desert plamet, Lando shows up and saves them. Or when the Rebels seem to lose the final battle, Lando shows up with A LOT of ships. And so on. The things happen because they need to happen. This is not good! There is no organic unfolding of the events. Unlike in Revenge of the Sith. And because of all of that the plot is a video game plot - only without the interaction.6. The problem with Rey remains. Although Daisy Ridley does and the writers did a better job this time to make Rey more more likable for me, there was at no time the possbility of failure. Unlike Luke, who almost killed his father and came just in the time to realize what he was about to do when Luke chopped off Vaders mechanical hand. Luke took a look at his own mechanical hand and stopped. It was a wound inflicted by his father that saved him. Rey does not have this kind of wound. Rey also doesn't save anybody, she only kills the evil. (Ben is saved by Leia and Han.)7. The unmotivated and unexplained return of Palpatine just nullifies Luke's and Anakin's story and redemption, respectively. Every fan with a brain should be able to see this. Also since Rey is a Palpatine, Palpatine effectively won.To conclude: if you turn off your brain and don't ask any questions you are going to enjoy this movie. If you start to think, you'll soon notice the mediocrity of this movie.",5,8,13,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," To sum up the movie in one sentence:
","Snoke is a silly joke in a yellow bathrobe compared to Palpatine. And so is this movie compared to Episode V, even to Episode III in my opinion.*** Spoiler from here on***Before I am going to mention my main issues I have with this movie let me say I had some really good laughs, intended and unintended ones, and the movie was well made, but the story...oh boy.As I read somewhere at least one subplot is totally pointless because it leads nowhere, namely the 'casino plot' where Benicio del Toro comes in, what a waste of a good actor. I learnt when some sub plot is pointless, you just cut it. Also the internal logic of this sub plot stinks: if that admiral with the purple hair just would have explained their plan to Poe all would have gone well, very well to be exact. So we have a whole pointless sub plot because some leader didn't want to explain their plan. When this lady assumed command and looked clueless I felt: Where is Captain Kirk when you need him?The other main issue I have is this:
Killing off your vain villain is o.k., but not in the damn middle of the trilogy! Here is the strength of the original trilogy when it comes to the main villain: Although the emperor is mentioned in ANH, you have the impression Vader is main bad guy, only in TESB you see the emperor for the first time as a hologram and in ROTJ for real. In this sense TFA feels like part 2 of a trilogy and TLJ as part 3, but it just is supposed to be the 2nd part. What good is that?Kudos to Disney, you have manouvered yourself in an excellent position with that. So the whole storyline of TFA and TLJ feels like two people were working on it and Rian Johnson just didn't like JJ's creation of Snoke so he kills him off in a most silly way, one of the unintended laughs.As sad as the passing of Carrie Fisher was, why not kill Leia? Do some reshoots, but no, Luke has to go. Really well done. The only explanation I have is that they did a lot of reshoots in order to kill off Snoke and then set of a new trilogy with that kid in the end....here we go again.....I never thought I'd say this, but I really miss Mr. Lucas' talent for constructing and telling storys.EDIT: Almost 48hrs later after I watched the movie I am still feeling disappointed. The analytical part of me still says, the movie isn't that bad so my 6 stars will stay, but the Star Wars Fan boy heart is so sad. I still don't know if I can joyfully rewatch the original episodes because I know what is going to happen to Luke later.The only explanation I have is this: George Lucas sold to Disney to get revenge on all these prequel haters so he can say: 'See that big pyle of Micky Mouse poodoo you can get?'",4,373,589,14 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," thanks quentin
","this is my first comment on imdb: after watching the average matrix reloaded and the disappointing matrix revolutions i watched this one. i have heard a lot of things about this movie and i knew what to expect.the violence, especially the blood fountains, and the fights are so unrealistic that you have basically two options: leave the theater and puke or start laughing. if you think you can laugh about such things, you will find this movie absolutely fantastic, if not, stay out!uma's fight against the crazy 88 is so wonderful (filmed) that it shows that neo's fight against the hundred's of smith's in matrix 2 is just a pure special effects hoax and i'd like to thank quentin tarantino for showing this! in my opinion this fight alone is worth watching the movie!to summarize my feelings i had, i'd like to paraphrase a line of matrix 2: the movie starts to simply. each minute creates a new effect... you begin to ask why, what is the reason for this?... soon the why and the reason are gone and all that is left is the feeling itself.so just enjoy this movie and don't ask why there is all that violence.",9,0,1,17 November 2003
Avatar," Poor (story-wise) remake of 'Dances with wolves' in Space, but great 3D
","I finally saw Avatar in 3D and I have to say technically it is very good - you wouldn't expect nothing less from James Cameron. The 3D effects are very nice to watch, but as you already have guessed here comes the criticism.I personally think that once you are adopted to the 3D image and if you put that aside, there is nothing much left than a poor remake of 'dances with Wolves'. The story could be told in a much shorter time. The 'acting' of the Na'vi is almost none existent.The characters are very two dimensional, only Sully appears to be a 3D character. The design of the fighting robot in the end reminds me of the robot from aliens, only the fight back then was better, more suspense.So, if you love the 3d stuff, go and watch it again, otherwise wait for a better 3d flick or spend your money on a Dances with wolves DVD/blu-ray.",6,2,4,21 February 2010
