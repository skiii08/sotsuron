Minority Report," Cool
","Yes.Minority Report is an extremely well made film.It has dazzling special effects,and it has some great set pieces.Colin Farrell gives the best performance in the movie trying to create a two dimensional character with a genuine ability that doesn't exist elsewhere in the movie,except for the small role of Cruise's wife.It's not a movie that lends itself to good acting,so maybe Tom Cruise was well cast after all.In film after film,he seems to be the male contemporary of Elizabeth Taylor,great at emotional outbursts,but with no depth of ability to back them up.There's a complete lack of emotional warmth in his acting,and especially in this movie.I think that's why there appears to be no heart at the centre of Minority Report,just an icy shell.There is very little color in this movie;like Tom's wardrobe,it is almost a monochrome movie,that adds to the coldness at it's centre.A stunning,but very uninvolving experience.",Null,0,0,31 July 2002
Children of Men," Powerful and disturbing,but difficult to sit through
","With no knowledge of the book,I didn't know what to expect.If I had,then I may have given this a miss.I found the first half interesting,but as it went on,it became so bleak and depressing,and I found the second half,after the birth of the child,gratuitous in it'sviolence, and I'm sorry to say I was just glad when it ended.Although all the actors were good in their roles,some were surprisingly brief.Being a fan of Julianne Moore,her 'starring' role is just an extended cameo.AND JULIANNE MOORE as Julian,would have been more fitting.Clive Owen,who gets better with each film,is always good as the anti hero,and here is no exception.He was also effective in a similar type film,Beyond Borders,so he is obviously drawn to these bleak parables on mans inhumanity to man.A powerful film,as I said,but not exactly an entertaining or uplifting one.",5,6,18,25 September 2006
