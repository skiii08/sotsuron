The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Pretty accurate
","If you've read the book enough times you know it's pretty dead on, despite certain details missing from the movie. There were scenes from the book that could have been in the movie and made it a little more intense. In a way, the movie downplayed some situations (i.e. 'Candace' and 'Pony-Tail Derek'; Drug use; Charlie's former friends, among other things). Also, from reading the book enough, it really seems like the characters were awesomely picked. All in all, I got the same indescribable feeling from the movie that I got from the book. I would recommend it to ANYONE who wants to watch a movie that will actually make you think and feel.",10,2,4,27 May 2013
