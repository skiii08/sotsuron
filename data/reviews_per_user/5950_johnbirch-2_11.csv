Moneyball," Really very good - even if you know nothing about American Rounders
","I know next to nothing about baseball, and know little more now. The film confirmed all my suspicions that it really is just rounders on steroids, and I would still not feel inclined to cross the street to watch the sport.But despite all that this is a great film that I found engrossing from start to finish. It, at its heart, is a story about an organisation in crisis whose only solution to being in a hole was to carry on digging until the hero (well, heroes) say 'damn you all' and go a new way.What is, curiously, even better is that they do not QUITE succeed (it is based on real life events, apparently, so check out the history) which makes it all the more affecting because its like real life. There isn't the perfect, happy, ending - but the world has changed as a result.Even it you know as much about American Rounders as I do, even if you hate sport, enjoy. Its a good film.",9,2,3,10 September 2012
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Tone perfect homage to Eurovision
","Eurovision is a wacky, cheesy, camp, cringe-making, over the top but also at times self-deprecating, funny, a bit wonderful - and always too long. And this film is all of those things. As a results it absolutely nails Eurovision.It looks like Eurovision, the songs are very Eurovision, the presentations are exceedingly Eurovision. And what is great is that the EBU - who run Eurovision - made the film. This is Eurovision making a joke about Eurovision. And it really works.Also there is a brilliant musical number midway through that includes several real winners and contestants singing a montage of Eurovision songs, which is brilliant on its ownIt is both a homage to Eurovision and a spoof of Eurovision and as a Eurovision fan I loved it. Even if it is a BIT too long.",8,8,16,26 June 2020
American Sniper," See the world through the eyes of an American red-neck.
","Wow this is a film that has polarised opinion - and I think incorrectly.Let's get this out of the way first. The second Iraq war, which is where this film was based, was one of the most illegal and immoral wars in modern times for which the two main culprits (and those behind who were pulling the strings) should be behind bars in The Hague at the start of a life sentence (which, frankly, would be far less than they deserve).BUT... the film is not about that. It is not a film about the Iraq War, it's a biopic about one soldier who fought in it. As such it takes his view of things, and sees it entirely through his eyes. And these eyes belonged to almost stereotype - a Fox News-watching, right- wing America-luvvin, Bible-toting, gun-carrying, Texan who sees the world in entirely black and white. Indeed had he not really existed I think the film might have been accused of wild exaggeration.Remarkably he claims not to be a red-neck, though interestingly only on a technicality.Indeed by all accounts if anything they calmed him down a bit, missing out his claims to have shot looters after Hurricane Catrina. Even so he still does come across as not very pleasant, nor particularly bright, describing the enemy in nothing but derogatory terms, really believing that but for him they'd be invading the USA tomorrow, and completely failing to imagine what he would do if the boot was on the other foot.As such the film is close to brilliant. It really does capture Kyle in all his red-neck 'glory' without going over the top, to the extent it seems that fellow red-necks love it.But that is not all. Rarely has a film depicted the problems faced when the 'hero' returns home so well, both the problems for him and those around him, and how only by being with fellow veterans does he begin to come down - as perhaps only they understand. As for the in-theatre stuff, it is very well done indeed. Yes, the Iraqis come over as 100% evil one-dimensional moving targets - but that is how Kyle saw them, and this is a biopic (remember?).Performances? Bradley Cooper, who is in just about every scene (as he has to be) is stand out. A remarkable performance he inhabits this complex but also simple character like a glove. He is superb.So spend some time with this flawed individual, and be thankful I think that you never had to be with the real thing.",9,4,22,23 January 2015
Quantum of Solace," A Bond film for people who don't really like Bond films...
","I've never really been a fan of Bond - and I loved this film. My wife, on the other hand, is a Bond fan - and walked out after 20 minutes. In a way this says all you need to know about a film so far from Roger Moore that his oeuvre might as well by Whitehall farce.Its complex, its all action, it demands - requires - total concentration. Blink and you will miss an important bit of the plot. So don't blink - just enjoy the ride.On the other hand, if you are a fan of Smersh and over-the-top villains with white cats, amusing quips, and simple black-and-white plots than all the family can enjoy... forget it. This is really not the film for you.",9,1,6,3 January 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," More padding than a padded cell full of duvets
","This is a very pretty film, and the 3D is pretty good - especially the bees. If you want to spend nearly three hours looking at great scenery and impressively realised sets, not to mention the scariest spiders ever, then this is the film for you. If you like dragons too all the more so.On the other hand if you are looking for a story then you may be left wanting. Okay it is the middle one of three, but for quite startlingly long periods of the film nothing happens, or if it does happen, happens very slowly. Indeed. Or to put it another way, at one point - after the main characters had arrived in a village - I fell asleep. I woke up 10- 15 mins later and found I had missed (in terms of advancement of plot) absolutely nothing. At all.Quick summary. Film opens in a pub on the edge of The Shire. We discover one member of Bilbo's merry band has upset lots of people who all want him dead. Galdalf arrives. Threat averted.Bilbo et al now start treking towards the mountain. Arrive a seriously dodgy wood (Mirkwood, but maybe McGuffin Wood would have been more appropriate). Obviously they have to go through it (one is strongly reminded of that classic book 'We're Going on a Bear Hunt'... and then slightly horrified to think what Peter Jackson would come up with if he had the rights to that!). At this moment Gandalf leaves for no terribly good reason other than it needlessly puts the band of travelers in peril.They enter said wood. This is actually quite a good bit. Admittedly the future (I nearly said 'imminent', but that word has no place in a review of Hobbit 2) arrival of the spiders is telegraphed waaaaayyyyy ahead, and you kind of wonder what bunch of thickos would wander into a dark wood full of spider silk (and I mean full) without anyone actually saying 'this white stuff... doesn't worry anyone a bit does it?'Anyway - big scary spiders appear. Mayhem. But no-one dies as a chap from Lord of the Rings shows up (with friend) and spiders leave.Meanwhile Gandalf has gone off to meet the Seventh Doctor. This is confusing as quite why Doctor Who is in Middle Earth, or where he has put his Tardis, is never explained and - although The Doctor accompanies Gandalf for a period - as soon as it gets remotely interesting Gandalf sends him away. As with much of the film this section is pretty but utterly pointless, plot-wise, but does fill a good 20 minutes or more of screen time. Gandalf now deals with a hornets' nest of nasty creatures by shaking said hornets nest and then bumping off large numbers of them, thus ensuring he is too late to meet up with Bilbo's Band as arranged.After some fun with Lord of the Rings guy's friends (who have taken against them) said Band have arrived in a town where Stephen Fry is king. As usual, Stephen Fry plays the part of Stephen Fry flawlessly. Nothing of any real significance happens for a long time.They arrive at the mountain, and Bilbo is sent off to find a stone alone by his brave band. Finds the stone, plus a Smaug the Dragon, who has clearly been watching Goldfinger as - in a homage to every Bond villain throughout time - his proceeds to talk A LOT to Bilbo about... almost anything... thus allowing Bilbo to escape, rather than simply killing him immediately. Unless his first aim really was to talk Bilbo to death - because he does come pretty close. Again you wonder about how stupid a character can be as Bilbo's target is a stone shining out like a searchlight - but Smaug never seems to cotton on to this. After that... long, long battle between Smaug and Bilbo's band during which... no-one dies, not least because whenever anyone is at the Smaug's mercy he decides to talk to them instead of doing the proper dragonly thing.Eventually everyone gets bored (or something) and Dragon flies off to attack Stephen Fry's village. Roll credits.Summary - a 160 minute film whose story could have been told in 60 minutes. Or less.",5,1,1,28 December 2013
Green Street Hooligans," Film that fails to rise above an awful script
","It is entirely possible that the original draft of the script for this film was probably quite good, but then it rather appears that some committee got hold of it. 'No, you can't say that' they seem to have said 'Americans would not understand it. You need to explain'. Time and time again...The result is, while I could forgive the wild inaccuracies, like catching a train from Kings Cross to Manchester, or the strangely empty Blackwall Tunnel, it was the huge lumps of clanking unrealistic dialogue that, for me ruined the film.The acting is average at best, the violence dull and repetitive, the story predictable. Shame really. There was probably a good story in there once.",5,0,0,13 March 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Miss-titled misfiring mistaken mess?
","To begin at the beginning (as the Queen of Hearts says... in the book), this is not Alice in Wonderland. Yes, I know its a Tim Burton re- imagining, but that is not what I mean. What I mean is this is Alice Through the Looking Glass - 90% of the characters and what remains recognisable from the original plot is Looking Glass, not Wonderland. Does this matter? Yes - because it betrays a complete lack of any knowledge and feeling for Carol and Alice to mix the two books together, even in a 're-imagining', even by Burton. Especially by Burton. Its just plain lazy. As another reviewer has said, it even makes you wonder if Burton has read the books, or done anything at all other than watch the original (and truly dreadful) Disney cartoon.Then to compound that by throwing in the 'jabberwocky' (and he even gets that wrong - the creature is a 'jabberwock' for heaven's sake - read the damn poem, Burton!), and then centre the film round that??? A story within story that is not Wonderland anyway? Lazy, unthinking, meaningless.And then make it a dragon too! Lazy, lazy, lazy! Forget the Tenniel picture, read the poem, and work out for yourself what a MANXome foe that scratches with its claws is! Do some damn research, Burton! Let's just TRY to be original, shall we? Isn't that what you are famous for?What makes it even more annoying, even if you ignore all of the above, is that the film could so easily have been so much better. Because the initial conceit is promising. Call her anything other than Alice and you have the tale of a young woman finding herself in her own childhood dream/nightmare. Wonderland is, in so many ways, a nightmare - not a cuddly dream, and who better than Burton to realise this?But from this great, exciting, edge of the seat start it all goes horribly wrong. Alice not only fails to remember her dream (a fact that totally contradicts the opening scenes), but shows not emotion at all when all kinds of strange things happen - things that made the child Alice cry. Weird stuff abounds, but for no reason or plot purpose - the Red Queen's head being just one example.We have a plot device added by Burton - a scroll that predicts the future and which Alice sort of tries to escape from (well, in a very half-hearted way, frankly). Could this be a theme, you think? A point? A purpose? Nope - remove the scroll from the story and you'd lose nothing. So what the heck was the point of having it?Yes, its a very pretty film - a memorable, visual feast. But you need more than pretty pictures to make a film - you need a story, a point, something to say. This says nothing. Other than a lazy man with no clear ideas getting by on reputation.So - a couple of points for the visuals, and one bonus for the potential shown at the start. But zilch for the rest.",3,1,2,31 December 2010
Avatar," 3D film, 1D acting
","The 3D is very clever, the CGI very pretty. But isn't a move actually about telling a story?Avatar is indeed a film that could not have been made without 3D... because no-one would have watched it. Once you get past the pretty packaging what is left if possibly the most unoriginal, dull (yes dull), uninspiring, predictable film I have seen in years. I was bored. Once you have got used to the eye candy, its dull. Take the standard plot from 100 cowboy and Indian films, add in the stereotypes from any Vietnam films (ideally the worst ones), dust down with some eco-greenery, and round off with any random action sequence to finish the film off. As a bonus add in the most unappealing, annoying 'hero' you can imagine and you have Avatar. Really.Its also a film whose plot makes no sense in so many ways. They are there to get hold of a mineral with a truly silly name whose purpose is never explained. They do not give a hoot for the indigenous wildlife and inhabitants. So why the crazy science stuff - if its so vital surely your stereotypical super-ruthless marine colonel would nuke the place from orbit, then take it? No - instead he flies in using helicopters - very 26th century, even my 13 year old son couldn't understand that one. All that was missing was a few comments concerning the pre-breakfast smell of napalm.The plot holes are many, and Ms Weaver is still playing the same part she played in Alien - just worse - but its still probably the most rounded, convincing performance from any actor. There is a certain irony about a 3D film having such 1D acting.The shocking thing, though, is that so many people are taken in by this dross - that does not bode well for the future of Hollywood films.",2,3,5,15 February 2010
Limitless," Fun film - shame about the last 20 minutes
","This is a fun film to watch. Yes, even the basic premise is baloney (we only use 20% of our brains? Tripe!) and there are a fair few plot holes, but - hey - its a bit of sci-fi fluff not some dissertation.But even so... what's with the ending? I mean the whole film is leading up to the great pavement pancake scene and then suddenly the story does a complete 180 degree turn. Suddenly a film whose main message was that taking a short-cut anywhere using drugs is, ultimately, a bad idea into positive peon of praise for the pharma industry - we really can solve all your problems with a few pills and a bit of tweaking.What happened? Did the screenwriter and director die three-quarters of the way through? Did some big pharma company threaten to sue? The ending even betrays the story's own logic, leave alone anyone else's. Its the worst, most contrived, most stupid, most inappropriate, most illogical ending to a film since the first release of the Butterfly Effect. At least that director put that one right - no sign yet that they have see the light here.So enjoy for the first 80 or so minutes, then gasp in wonder at how such an inane ending can be shamelessly bolted on for no good reason.",Null,0,0,7 May 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," No middle way - you will love or hate this film
","And I absolutely loved it.It is VERY violent. A scene in which dozens of people's heads explode to Land of Hope and Glory, with fireworks thrown in was both a high point and pretty typical of the humour involved. If you would find that distasteful then watch something else. Otherwise... its great.And actually its really not that gory. Yes, people explode, are shot, sliced in half etc. but there is actually very, very little blood - so it is actually fantasy. The violence is cartoon violence. Think Tom & Jerry.But leave that aside - the story is brilliant. As others have said, this is how James Bond SHOULD be. Gadgets and gizmos, jokes and one- liners, twinkles in the eye, good guys and bad. But it also undermines the type in so many fun ways. All action, the near two hours flew by. I was left wanting more - but PLEASE let there be no sequel. No way a second film could be as good as this.",10,4,7,3 January 2016
Da 5 Bloods," No wonder this went straight to Netflix... How could Spike Lee associate his name with this drivel?
","My wife put this film on so I knew nothing about it - and was amazed afterwards to find that it is a Spike Lee film because it is so bad we gave up with it about two thirds through.Where to begin? The performances are passable, but the story is both unbelievable and predictable, while the script is dreadful. Really poor.To begin with swearing does not both me much, but it did here because it seems that all of the characters only knew one swear word, and used it in every other damn sentance. Seriously. And at times several times in the same sentance.Seriously, are black Americans this unimaginative and lacking in vocabulary? Surely not. Damn it, if this was a white director I'd be accusing them of racism. So why the hell is a BLACK American director making them sound like complete idiots?As for the storyline itself I can suspend belief but... come on! No need to go into detail but The Lavender Hill Mob is a more realistic plot. Carry On films have characters with more foresight.Spike Lee has a great reputation. So was he asleep for this film? Did he lose interest?",2,9,20,14 June 2020
