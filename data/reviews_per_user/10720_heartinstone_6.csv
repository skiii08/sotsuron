Iron Man 3," Best Iron Man yet
","The wait is over. Iron Man is back and in full force, and it was the best Iron Man movie to date. With a new director (Favreau was Executive Producer but it was directed this time by Shane Black), Iron Man surprisingly didn't loose any of its shine or appeal, which seldom happens when franchises change Directors.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, and will always be Tony Stark. Some actors get stuck with a type cast role, but in a rare instance, there are those roles in which no one else could play. Who else could play the rich, egotistical, genius playboy character of Stark? Who else could deliver such humor that is so genuine to the role? No one, that's who. Without RDJ, Iron Man would never deliver such a phenomenon of comic book movies.The script was perfect for this film. The funniest Iron Man in the trilogy, the humor combined with the most action in any Iron Man movie kept you laughing till your stomach hurt or got you on the edge of your seat. The production designs of the suits - all of them - are amazing. Every single actor on screen pulled their weight and the chemistry played perfectly. Also, there is a lot of mention of what happened in the Avengers, and the story focuses somewhat on how that has affected Tony.There was one twist near the end, to which I will definitely not reveal. Now, this twist is either good or bad depending on what people were expecting. It is a creative direction I never thought would happen, and the surprise caught me off guard. I'm still not sure if I am disappointed, but in essence - I could see why they played it that way. I won't spoil it. I can't, because it's such a big twist that it's like telling you the end of the movie where Tony Stark dies.(hahaha. just kidding).Iron Man 3 was definitely worth the wait. And don't forget, stay at the end of the credits!",9,1,6,4 May 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper is officially an actor.
","Bradley Cooper is officially one of my favorite actors after watching this film. No, seriously. I've liked his movies, like the Hangover and the A-team and The Words. But this movie- this movie brought out the best of his talent. The story centers around Pat, who was just released from a mental institution after a major breakdown when he found his wife cheating on him. He moves back in with his parents on the thought that he was destined to get back together with his wife, who - evidently has a restraining order against him. It's a challenge for him, dealing with his newly diagnosed bipolar disorder and his OCD father who will bet everything on the Eagles winning a football game. But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of one of Pat's friend's wife. Tiffany is probably just as screwed up as he is. She's a broken, lost girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her but knows a lot about living. The two form an unlikely friendship, and though they each have problems of their own, you know instantly that they'll be perfect for each other. There was something about this movie that stayed with me after I finished watching it. I'm still not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it was the strong performances of Lawrence and Cooper that made me realize how good of a movie it was. Perhaps it was the storyline and the characters that were so ridiculously troubled that you couldn't help but cheer for them the entire way through. Lawrence's performance was spectacular, and I have a feeling she will become quite an actress in the years to come. But it was Cooper's performance that took me by surprise. As he's known mostly for his comedic roles, Cooper's dramatic role was superb. He stole each scene, and you could tell he loved playing this character. The pacing of this film was excellent, not a dull moment in the entire movie. The supporting characters were wonderful, especially Robert DeNiro, who played Pat's OCD father. The script was fantastic, perfectly written and the dialogue was genius. This is one of those rare gems, where people have heard about but don't really know what it's about. After watching this movie, Cooper and Lawrence definitely have to take home the Oscar. If not both, than definitely Cooper. I will probably own this movie when it comes out on DVD, I loved it that much.",9,2,3,16 January 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," When in doubt, go for Jeremy Renner
","Left in the woods as children, Hansel and Gretel grow up to become infamous witch hunters after encountering one in a house of candy when they were abandoned. They're hired to help find eleven missing children, who were said to be taken by witches. But they find out even more about their past, and learn more about themselves than they choose to know.This was a sweet take on Hansel and Gretel, a beloved grimm fairy tale we all knew as kids. You know the story, two kids were abandoned by their father in the woods. They come upon a house of candy, and a witch lives inside. The witch makes Gretel fatten Hansel up so he could be eaten, but they kill the witch and escape.But in Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, the story doesn't end there. In fact, the story continues on to say that they become infamous witch hunters, known all across the land for hunting terrible witches and other dark magic. When a mayor of a little town hires them to take control of the search for eleven missing children (said to be taken by witches), their job doesn't get easier.They kick a lot of ass and take a lot of names, but these are some strong witches. It was one thing I liked about this movie. Hansel and Gretel weren't technical invincible, so they didn't always win. And the witches? They were creepy! The design of these witches was very creative, and I'm sure it was definitely creepy to see in 3D.I really liked the original take of this classic fairy tale. Renner and Arterton had very good chemistry together on screen. Both characters were very well developed and played out. The script was great as well, the dialogue flowed well and the humor was spot on. Case in point, if you liked movies like Brothers Grimm and Van Helsing, You'll like Hansel and Gretel. If not, just go for the very fact that Jeremy Renner is in it.",7,3,6,5 February 2013
Django Unchained," The Name is Django. The D is Silent
","Quentin Tarantino returns to the theater with his newest film, Django Unchained. And let me tell you, it does not disappoint. After the success of Inglorious Bastards, Django Unchained has a lot to live up too-and it pulls it off. In fact, it may be even better than Inglorious Bastards- but I'll let you be the judge of that. Jamie Foxx plays Django, a slave sold to two brothers who is inevitably 'saved' by Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) by offering him a job as a bounty hunter. Schultz is also a bounty hunter, and is after a family of three brothers, and knows that Django has seen them before and knows who they are, therefore the best person to help him out. In exchange for those lives, Schultz promises to find where Django's wife was sold and rescue her. They discover his wife Broomhilda (Washington) was sold to a plantation owned by the famous Calvin Candle (DiCaprio). There, they buy their way into his life in order to be able to buy the freedom of Broomhilda...and then, like every Tarantino movie...things go horribly wrong. Does Django free his wife? Does Schultz survive? Is there a huge epic blood bath at the end? If you've seen Tarantino's movies...you could probably say yes to two out of three of those things. Django Unchained was a fabulous edition to Tarantino's list of unforgettable films. All though there is a lot of controversy surrounding it, because the N word is said over 110 times, keep in mind that Tarantino obviously did not mean for this to be a historical representation of the 1800s. Sure, it's got slavery and western aspects of the 1800s, but he did not intend for it to be historically accurate, nor did he want to be an exact representation of the slave trade. It's Tarantino. You can pretty much assume that everything will be exaggerated, and that there will be blood...and it will be awesome. Also, Christoph Waltz should definitely win for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.",9,1,4,13 January 2013
Elysium," Ignore Jodie Foster's horrible French accent.
","As one of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Elysium comes at the heels of Pacific Rim, another post apocalyptic film widely received from Del Toro. Elysium comes from the Director of District 9, Neil Blomkamp, and stars Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Did it live up to it's expectations? It depends on how high you set them. As a Matt Damon fan, my expectation were that of any Matt Damon movie: it would be awesome. Did I like it more than Pacific Rim? Nope. But I did like it a lot, and here's why.Like District 9, Elysium focuses on the social and political issues that are relevant to today. These issues are so close to home that you almost feel like: man, this could actually be how it is in 2154. It focuses on health care, separating the classes between the rich and the poor. It touches on dangerous working conditions and corporate involvement. But Elysium isn't just about the social issues. It's about becoming aware of exactly who you are and who you should be as a person. It's about self-discovery and the idea that sacrifices must be made in times of dire circumstances. Elysium is a commentary that encompasses every aspect of morality.The script, though not the best written one, was well delivered by Matt Damon and his supporting cast. Jodie Foster's French was almost fluently spoken all though when speaking English, the accent itself was horrible. Sharlto Copey, who we know from A-team and also District 9, is actually a bad ass villainous character. He's creepy and satisfyingly evil enough that Kruger is a believable character. The art direction and production is also something to admire. The design of the ruined Earth as opposed to Elysium was well contrasted and beautifully creative.If you see one dystopian / post-apocalyptic film this summer, it's a toss up between Pacific Rim and Elysium. But if you liked District 9 and love Matt Damon, definitely choose Elysium.",8,0,4,12 August 2013
Les Misérables," Les Miserables...Le Misery...
","I had been waiting to see this movie from the first time it was said to be released. All the previews and all the behind the scenes special made me really excited for it. Fortunately, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie .Unfortunately, it was not as epic as I had hoped. Adam Lambert may have slammed the movie, saying that Hooper should have tweaked the music in the studio to make it sweeter. He also declared that Hooper should have chosen actors that could sing, and that the voices threw off the concentration and the enjoyment of the movie. I wholeheartedly disagree. Most of these actors have had Broadway experience. With the exception of Russell Crowe, each of these actors performed spectacularly. I loved the raw and real feel of the singing. Hooper was right not to tweak the vocals. Crowe was probably the weakest one in the group, and all though his voice was not to par with the others, it got better as he went along. All though, what was different about Crowe is that he seemed to have trouble acting and singing at the same time, and I felt he mostly concentrated on trying to move and sing, rather than act and sing. Hathaway's performance of Fontine was so incredible. I could barely take my eyes off screen because she was so amazing. Her voice is beautiful and her performance was so real...it effected me in more ways than one. Fontine is such a minor character, but Hathaway's performance made it more meaningful. If she doesn't win best supporting actress, then I don't know what the Academy has against her. This version of Les Miserables is definitely something to watch. I don't personally feel it will win best picture, but it is still a great movie to watch. Trust me, I had the songs stuck in my head after watching it, lol. (Just a note: if you are not a Broadway or theater person, you might think other wise. This kind of movie is not for everyone, as there is pretty much all singing and barely any spoken acting)",8,1,3,15 January 2013
