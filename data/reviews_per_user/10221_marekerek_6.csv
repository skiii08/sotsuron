The Equalizer," Entertaining
","Acting: Denzel Washington and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz did their best and were obviously the best in the movie. What surprised me was the performance of Marton Csokas(whose resemblance to Kevin Spacey is striking). It was way better than I expected. The others did well enough. 8/10Direction and cinematography: Antoine Fuqua is really starting to grow on me. His style is clear and very easy to follow. Direction was great in this movie. 9/10Soundtrack: Average. I liked the Eminem song during the subtitles, Guts Over Fear. 7/10Plot: The first two thirds of the movie were great. The final act was.. not so great. It wasn't bad either, but when the main hero is so perfect, you know he's coming out of everything alive and safe. The villain was pretty good, I was afraid I'd have to sit through the entire movie with that first Russian villain. Thankfully, he was just here so we could see how much of a bad-ass Washington's character is. I liked the restaurant scene, it reminded me of Heat. Very well written(the whole movie, not just the Heat scene). 8/10Overall: It was much more entertaining than I though it would be. A pleasant surprise. Best scene: Restaurant.",8,0,2,11 December 2017
Public Enemies," Surprisingly boring
","Acting: Marion Cotillard was surprisingly good, even though I never liked any of her performances(she was godawful in The Dark Knight Rises). Christian Bale was surprisingly bland, even though I loved his every other performance(he was fantastic in The Dark Knight Rises). Johnny Depp was quite alright. 7 /10Direction and cinematography: Fine. 7/10Soundtrack: Very boring. 3/10Plot: Repetitive. And even though there were many action scenes, the movie was boring. I checked my watches every few minutes. The ending was fine, except for the very last scene, that was not believable at all. 5/10Overall: Michael Mann didn't even try to come close to Heat in terms of quality. The script wasn't great, the romantic scenes were awkward, but the scene where Dillinger is escaping his second prison, that was very good. 6/10Best scene: The second prison break.",6,0,1,10 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Sum of my thoughts
","My favorite movie of the original trilogy. It feels much more personal and human than the first two, which were in my opinion primarily focused on space battles.The space battles themselves would never have been able to elevate the Star Wars films where they are now. It was the characters that made it what it was, and I'm glad this movie focused on developing the characters of Luke, Leia and Vader more than the first two.I honestly didn't enjoy the space battles in any of the first three movies, that is of course because of me growing up with movies with better special effects. However, that's not my only problem, especially in this movie. The final space battle took place at the same time as the lightsaber fight between Vader and Luke. That fight meant so much more for the film and felt much more important than a ton of spaceships firing and missing all the time. The fight was much more tense and overall more interesting than whatever was happening elsewhere.Mark Hammil remains my biggest problem with the whole trilogy. His acting was just as bad as in the previous films (Daniel Radcliffe at least got better over time). He more or less just says his lines, he doesn't seem to actually feel anything. Compare that to Harrison Ford or Carrie Fisher, who actually put on good performances. Ford manages to do that even with minimal screen time especially compared to the first movie.Another big problem was Palpatine's death. The greatest force in the whole universe thrown over the ledge like a ragdoll. That was actually pathetic.Next big problem is Richard Marquand, who puts no personality into this film at all. No vision, no style, barely any memorable shots or sequences (just one from the final swordfight comes to mind).A lot of people seem to dislike the Ewoks in this movie. I actually found them likeable and cute, but I get it.Overall, this film passed by more quickly than the first two, mainly because I found it's content more interesting and the finale actually exciting.",7,0,0,16 June 2019
Man of Steel," A CGI mess.
","Acting: Wasn't the most important thing in the movie, was it? The CGI can handle everything. Maybe that's why they chose Henry Cavill to play Superman. A hot body, but that's about it. Amy Adams was great, even though quite different than the comic Lois Lane. Others were okay. 6/10Direction and cinematography: Zack Snyder, you're not Chris Nolan. Deal with it. Stop ruining DCEU. Terrible. The CGI was good at first, but by the end it was so damn annoying. 0/10Soundtrack: By Hans Zimmer standarts, not so great. Not bad by any means, but one of his weaker ones. 6/10Plot: The world is not ready for someone like Superman. He should spend at least half of the film being just Clark Kent, maybe the people could trust him later. But in the end, the people and the government fear and distrust him and nothing he did really matters. The final battle was a CGI orgasm, but it did even more damage to the plot than to the city of Metropolis. And in the end, it all could have been avoided, if only Superman decided to break Zodd's neck before they destroyed the whole city. But then the CGI wouldn't stand out and that's not a good thing, right? 0/10Overall: One of the most overrated movies I have ever seen, far worse than BvS, Suicide Squad or Justice League. Simply everything apart from Amy Adams sucked.Best scene: None.",3,1,1,13 December 2017
The Thin Red Line," Underwhelming, but not bad
","Acting: A film full of stars, not one performance is bad. The best performance in my opinion is that of Nick Nolte. Inclusion of John Travolta and George Clooney might be a bit unnecessary, but it doesn't do any harm so I don't have any problems with that. 8/10Direction and cinematography: Wonderful. The camera-work is perfect, the battle scenes are not confusing and very well shot. 9/10Soundtrack: The main score by Hans Zimmer(Journey to the Line) isn't by far his greatest, but it's not bad either. What I loved though are the choirs in the beginning and during the subtitles. 8/10Plot and screenplay: This is where the film fails to deliver. The plot is way too simple for a 170 minutes long movie. It's dragging, there are scenes where virtually nothing at all happens. The dialogue is all very philosophical, some good lines but it doesn't move the plot much. Same goes for all the monologues. 1/10Overall: I was very hyped going into this movie. All those terrific actors, Hans Zimmer doing the music.. And it bore me to death. I was very disappointed with the plot. It was way too long. The biggest plus goes for the choir soundtrack and acting. 6/10Best scene: Opening 10 minutes.",6,0,2,9 December 2017
Sin City," Make it all black instead of black and white and it doesn't make a difference.
","If you take the movie as a terrible low-budget comedy, you might not get bored to death. But this is not low-budget, this is not a comedy and this is, apparently, not terrible. The first chapter(The Yellow Bastard) was quite alright, then it all just got boring, tedious. All the chapters were like 'the main (anti)hero has to kill somebody and it will probably end badly for him'. But the final act was absolutely terrible. The killing scenes were comical(perhaps because of the black and white setting), I could not take it seriously for a minute.Positives:The acting and the soundtrack.With all the great actors in the movie, this film was a tremendous disappointment for me. 20 minutes after it ended, I cannot really recall much of the film.",3,0,2,21 October 2017
