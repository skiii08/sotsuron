The Blair Witch Project," The first 45 minutes is a bit boring!
","Was sort of scary at the end, however was too short and the ending was bad. So much more could have been done with this concept if the story had departed from traditional horror confines. For instance, why do all the scary parts happen at night? why would a ghost witch be afraid of the light of day? I think it would have been much scarier if there had been no safety with the arrival of daylight, because they felt safe in the daytime, and that is not good in a horror movie.",6,0,1,13 December 1999
