The Blair Witch Project," The blair witch project review
","The blair witch project in my opinion is more suspense than horror, maybe in the last of the film is horror but in general I think is more suspense. At the end of the film we can see that Mike is facing the wall because she or whatever can kill the person who is coming down the traps it is a trap. I think that is a very good movie because you feel into the film and the content is interesting but if this a horror film I think that maybe is a little bit over hyped because it has not made me very afraid.",7,1,1,1 December 2017
The Shining," The shining review
","The shining is a horror movie that in my opinion is very well done because you will think that it is just a scary movie and seeing it only once it seems scary just in truth, it has many easter eggs mostly about the First Natives. If it's your first time watching the movie, you will hardly catch them but after watching it several times and with the help of criticism and analysis of the movie you will be able to understand them which makes the movie very interesting. Definitely this movie is a classic and that everyone should see it, because although in some parts of the film they are scared, if you can understand the hidden messages of the movie, I'm sure you'll love this movie.",10,0,1,1 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," The disaster artist review (Alex Salcedo)
","The disaster artist is a movie based on 'the room'. To my regret, they have made this movie to teach how the life of the characters was out of cameras, and how one of the worst movies in the history was made. They did a pretty good job, and its incredible how the actor imitated his scenes, he is definitely a genius. I don't think is necessary to watch 'The room' because they did a real good job in this movie and you can understand what the movie is about.",8,0,0,9 April 2018
