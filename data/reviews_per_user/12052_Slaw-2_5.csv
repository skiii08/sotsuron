The Blair Witch Project," Project : Overly Hyped Bad Movie
","If you thought that the hype surrounding Star Wars ruined the film for you well then don't go see this piece of trash. When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought to myself a great story and it looks freaky as hell. Well it turns out there are only a few really good parts and they aren't even scary. The ending is terrible and the film turns into a terrible campside story instead of possibly a urban legend. Great idea, bad execution. There is about 10 -15 minutes of scenes that are worth watching. The film just like it's characters just keeps going in circles. I applaud the efforts but they still failed no matter how much money this makes. Unfortunately since this movie will most probably be a success it will have a sequel and have a ton of horrible indie movies being shoved at movie theaters. Yuck!",2,0,2,1 August 1999

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning of one of the greatest stories ever told
","I'll keep this short and sweet. Unlike some of the negative reviews this movie has gotten, it is Star Wars. From start to finish this movie lived up to my expectations. I loved it and have seen it 7 times in 4 days. It is an excellent addition and probably the third best in the series (Empire being the best followed by Star Wars), which is not a bad thing when it is the greatest trilogy to grace the silver screen.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
American Beauty," THIS IS FILM MAKING
","Wow is a one word review of this film. This year has brought many beautiful surprises but none shine as bright as American Beauty. The story however tragic, is uplifting at the same time. Kevin Spacey is magnificent and plays his role perfectly. I would imagine this role will earn him an Oscar nomination because frankly it is the best performance I've seen lately. To give a basic run down of the movie think, Falling Down without the hostility. Kevin Spacey is awakened from his monotonous daily life where the only thing he looks forward to is jacking off in the shower every morning. Suddenly, he is a new man. Doing what he wants when he wants. Risks aren't risks, they just become decisions. No worries, no problems. He lives life like everyone wants to but at the same time, aren't willing to take the risk to do it. At the same time, Spacey's daughter hates her parents. She thinks her dad is a complete idiot and has no interest in her (which couldn't be further from the truth). Her mom is a Martha Stewart in the making , minus the compassion and patience needed in raising a child. All the while, the new neighbors move in. Their son is a voyeur (a s***ty label but what else do you call someone who videotapes everything) who has taken an interest in the daughter and silently watches from afar. That's about all I wanna say so you can experience this movie. Like the director says, it sounds like a messed up sitcom but believe me when you see it you won't feel that way.",10,0,0,29 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," wow
","Well let me say after seeing 'The Jackel' and 'Mercury Rising' I was almost giving up on our old friend Bruce. He was good in 'The Siege' but that was Mr. Washington's movie. But after seeing '6th Sense' let me be one of the first to say......BRUCE IS BACK, BRUCE IS BACK. As Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, we finally get to see Bruce Willis the actor for a change. To talk about the plot/story of the film is to begin to taint it for those who have not seen it. Don't read reviews, don't listen to people talk about it, just go see it. With all the supernatural thrillers, I was the most excited for The Blair Witch Project. After seeing that terrible film I was happy to see a movie that could scare me or at least creep me out. For everyone who makes a big deal about the unseen terror well wait til you see what you can't in 6th Sense ( if that confuses you don't worry). Hopefully upcoming thrillers like 'Stigmata' and 'End Of Days' are as clever and well-crafted as this film was. I am happy for Bruce and most of all happy to see such a good film to come out this summer to keep this summer's trend of excellent movies (for the most part)",10,0,0,7 August 1999
