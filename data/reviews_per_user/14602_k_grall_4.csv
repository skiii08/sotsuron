Ford v Ferrari," Actual racing provides a visceral, visual punch, which I appreciated
","This is a sports movie that I want to compare with Borg v McEnroe and perhaps Rocky. And this movie just falls a little short of those movies, for me. Perhaps it is that car-racing requires such complicated mechanics in a team-effort to be successful, as compared to a simpler pathos in one individual's endeavour.Also, I am wary of a film trying to bring me in with its *wink**wink*intheknow knowlege of cars and jargonist language about cars. It's meant to explain things to a viewer and bring them in, and mock the characters that ought to be mocked (because we're intheknow, and they aren't). For some reason, I was aware of and resisted such attempts. Alongside my experience here, the storyline was adequate and just escaped being hokey, and the characters were adequately pitiable and relatable.What I was really impressed by was the foregrounding of the LeMans lap, and then visually punching us with that pre-knowledge when the actual race was on. The scenes were visceral and this boosted my rating.I thought the edit and shots taken and varied between close-up and other were all done well. Would love to compare shots with Logan, Walk the Line or Copland, just to see.Matt Damon does his best Tommy Lee Jones impression with his voice, I thought. Just throwing that out there.An alright film, and probably better than other car-racing films. Car-racing? why not, just for this story.",8,3,12,15 November 2019
Joker," Empathy is key. Indeterminate spaces created that I appreciated a lot
","I like sophisticated fiction that creates spaces of uncertainty within them. Whilst watching Joker, I kept on thinking of Fight Club, and I wondered why? Because it's not really like Fight Club - but it is. How one character relates to the world. And then there's the creation of the fictional character in Zazie Beetze's apparition, for Fleck. So, that's one indeterminate space that I really appreciated the whole text as creating. I found it also particularly telling that there is a scene where Fleck admits his original three murders to an admin worker, and it's references Raskolnikov's own admission in Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment beautifully, here. That text is a masterpiece of exploring existential being in a society, and so the reference was not lost on me.I had empathy for Fleck, and the filmmakers did this wonderfully well. Those many reviewers that judge Fleck as a 'pathetic' and 'sad' 'incel' figure have already objectively judged him, I feel. Empathy at that point of judgment renders empathy not really possible, in my opinion. Much is missed out on. A much more interesting question is how are those actions reached, empathetically? Todd Phillips has given us a very good exploration, that references, and the text is richly complex. I had a good time here.",10,2,5,3 October 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Watch the Ultimate Edition
","This is a review of the Utlimate Edition, and which I rate is as 10 out of 10. For me, BvS Ultimate joins Dark Knight, DK Rises and Logan as among the comic-movies I give the perfect score to; just so you know my sensibilities. However, I feel that a very real argument can be made that BvS Ultimate Edition is in its own league as being THE sole super-hero movie ever made.My premise is that it has reaction to the Superman - the fantastically alien, ubermensch or God - as its main text. Simply put, no other film does this as its main subject and theme as BvS does. And the Ultimate Edition (i.e. Zack Snyder's full three hour+ artistic treatment) is a brilliant exploration of the theme.It is the Ultimate Edition which is great. If you've only seen the theatrical cut, then you miss out on the storytelling which acts to balance the movie. Essentially, Bruce is given pathos and pity in his perspective in the UE's longer opening that provides such a balance. Luthor can be seen as more masterfully manipulative of both Bruce and Clark, and Bruce's real pathos and pity gives way to tragedy. Meanwhile Superman remains himself and is the subjected acted upon not only by Luthor's evasive deceptions but also thematic conversations of where and if the superman fits, and is 'good'.Importantly, the UE also includes a Lois Lane investigative reporting thread that uncovers Luthor's manipulations but she just cannot reach the self-doubting Superman. The tragedy plays itself out, and Luthor remains out of the clutches of The Fourth Estate, and ahead of the branches of Government that serves to define the 'good' (relisten to Holly Hunter's speech for that note).In all, the humans - Bruce, Lois, the pluralist branches of Government, and even the contemplative/uncertain side of Clark - are shown to have agency in UE, and Luthor manipulates them ALL. Masterful. And then plunge into tragedy, based particularly on Batman's pathos. I have thought since film riffs on The Dark Knight in a big way, if someone was present to 'But Luthor cannot win...'The first half of Snyder's UE present all of these swirling agencies that focuses into what ultimately happens. I love this movie and I consider it THE only real super-hero to have ever been made. Please watch the Ultimate Edition before judging this movie. Also please sign the petition for a full Zack Snyder extended cut of Justice League, godwilling.",10,4,7,26 November 2017
Green Book," A good Hollywood film. Good acting and the camera work as a foundation
","I was impressed by both Mortensen and Ali, and the story is alright. Camera work; more than solid, and it's like the 'best butter' you can find in an Old Hollywood type of way. However... my main complaint is a focus on dialogue scenes, particularly with the Lip's (Mortensen's) wife, played by Cardelini, that just drove a point home... too cute? I don't know, but these 'golden'-type moments in a 'golden'-type movie, just detracted from it all, from what I like, completely.Also, one final - minor - complaint I had that ticked me was Doc's seeing and observation of the rural black-Southern workers, who were looking back at Doc, dressed in his fine clothes and chauffeured in a car. That shot needed to be there, I'm pretty sure, and it goes to Doc's unsettled identity issues on race, gender and sexuality, later. However, it is, as a scene, comparable to Tarantino's own point on this in Django Unchained. So, it's like I've seen this point recently before, and this took away from the complete profundity of the moment, for me, in this film.Overall, worth a watch for all the good reasons people are saying though. A good Hollywood film.",8,1,3,3 September 2019
