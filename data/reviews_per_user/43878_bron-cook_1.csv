The Avengers," Don't believe the hype
","I saw this was 8.8 on IMDb and thought wow! I really should see whilst it's at the cinema. I really liked Spiderman 1 and the recent Superman, so I thought I'd really enjoy this movie as well. Wrong! This movie lacks any character development or suspense. It moves from event to event without any build up so there is no anticipation within the viewer. Nothing really bothers any of the avengers which makes the movie boring. I mean, Thor has an incredibly hard fall and when he gets back up his hammer hand doesn't work FOR A WHOLE 5 SECONDS! Next time the movie cuts back to his scene he's right as rain, so there's no opportunity for the audience to really care about what happens on screen as everyone takes it in their stride.The special effects are very good, I went and saw it in 3D but I think it would be better enjoyed in 2D. There is a certain lack of clarity in most movies that have 3D applied post production. It's not bad, it's just not good enough (e.g. Like avatar was) to make up for the reduction in clarity and extra $3.TLDR no character development or anticipation, gave it 5 for the special effects.FTR I am a 32yo female.",5,7,19,13 May 2012
