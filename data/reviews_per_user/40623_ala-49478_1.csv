Requiem for a Dream," Intense, Depressing, Visceral and Amazing
","In my opinion it's in the top 3 movies when it comes to addiction and top 20 movies in general.
The music score adds to the dark, psychedelic filming. It's the same repeated music but done so perfect it makes you anxious and depressed... just what this movie is trying to do. It does it so well. If you are an addict or know one, it may trigger some unwanted feelings.
Just be prepared to feel like crap after the movie ends.",10,3,3,12 November 2019
