Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Give this movie a chance its really good
","Why are people critizing this movie so much, its only the first to hours of 6, I believe that the critics are asking Lucas to put the 6 hours in these 2 hours.Great visual effects and great storyline its leaves you wanting to see episodes 2 and 3.",10,0,1,7 April 2000
