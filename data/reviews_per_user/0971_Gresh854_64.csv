The Lobster," Insanely Prolific
","There's nothing out there quite like The Lobster. Yorgos Lanthimos has invented something harshly relevant to a society eminently apparent of now and till the future. I abhor the fact that a majority of audiences unquestionably missed the mark on what this movie meant. To me, not only is Lanthimos take on society's perception of love darkly and satirically delightful to watch, but also, culturally relevant to what today's standards in terms of building a relationship are. This is How I Perceive the 1st Half: With the uprise of social media-an undoubtably other circumstances-love and romance has been in demand at higher levels than it has ever been. Marriage has been worshiped as such a 'positive' norm in society, that people continuously are feeling more and more pressured into finding a partner, no matter the odds. Socialization has caused us to become ignorant of love's meaning/ purpose, and more focused on the selfish endeavor of finding a way to fit into our now devious world through progressive appearances. This is How I Perceive the 2nd Half: 'Specific' societies often deny people who have 'taboo' (according to their norms) relationships from continuing their accords by punishing them through severe practices, simply because 'taboo' occurances don't follow their general beliefs. Their are countless examples of what is considered a 'taboo' form of love within many societies (different sexualities, different nationalities, different personalities, different social statuses, etcetera). Adversaries are always trying to shut you down when the one good thing in your life finally comes into play-relatable. I'm assuming Lanthimos is modestly saying, 'Hey people need to mind their own freakin' business and let folks love who they want to love. As long as it's real, who gives a damn.'This is How I Perceive the Ending: 'Oh, the crazy things people will do when they're in love.'So...yeah. The Lobster is probably the most informal love aphorism of the 21st Century. Go figure. Yorgos has the most f***** up vision in Hollywood right now, but that's exactly why we need him. This wickedness he constantly froths into his filmography is awfully necessary in order to get timely, critical, and imperative messages-like this-out into such a flawed province (society). The more I watch The Lobster the more poetic, shocking, outlandish, traumatic, disturbing, sinister, and umm...funnier it becomes. Don't be ignorant fellas, please, look at this film as a MOMENTOUS learning lesson. Embrace the eccentricity, as they say. (Verdict: A)",10,4,7,2 October 2018
First Man," Astounding Achievement From Chazelle Once More
","First Man is about as beneath the surface of a character study of legend and family-man, Neil Armstrong, we're ever going to land. Thanks a million to Damien for presenting the film at a steady, gradual, and passive pace that resonates an honest, down-to-earth sense of authenticity. Chazelle's craftsmanship in building tension is a stimulating opus of knack and heavy expertism. Man is on a role. (Verdict: A-)",7,2,8,12 October 2018
Walk the Line," Maybe I Am
","Walk the Line is about as good as a Johnny Cash biography is ever going to get. Two reasons why: 1) Joaquin Phoenix literally is Johnny Cash. Can we get some genetic tests to prove this please? 
2) James Mangold clearly had an understanding of how to rightfully honor the story of Cash through the blends of accurate documentation and interlopes of sentimental weight.Also, contact lenses are peculiar. (Verdict: B)",7,0,0,29 September 2018
Requiem for a Dream," The Most Traumatizing A Movie Can Possibly Get
","Requiem for a Dream is the most psychologically brain-damaging drama of all-time. The finale of this film is like watching your soul get squeezed, as your heart slowly shatters, and once it's all finally stopped, you're left only with a gutless and empty feeling inside. Now this is why Aronofsky wins. Say whatever you want about the guy glorifying everything in his films, but at least he does it with a passion that can not be matched by any other director. He will get his message out no matter the odds-in this case, the odds being his choice to insert some of the most stressful sequences ever put to film. The first time I saw this film was somewhere around my mid-High-School experience, and it's frightened me away from ever even remotely thinking about doing hardcore drugs, ever since. FYI, to teachers who are trying to teach kids not to do drugs, don't show your lame-ass, cheesy, cheaply made, 90s-released, 'Drugs Aren't Cool!' documentary videos, just show them Requiem for a Dream, and I guarantee every single human being who sees it will be scared of doing drugs for a solid and long amount of time. The fact that this movie didn't even get nominated at the Academy Awards for best editing is an absolute sin, cause the editing in this is some of the most effectively creative but also stressfully poignant, quick-cut mastery ever achieved. And when you add the impeccably dreamy cinematography and EPIC original score by Clint Mansell with the editing, voilÃ , you have yourself a technical masterpiece. It's no surprise that Ellen Burstyn got nominated for an Oscar for this movie, she brings home a marvelous performance, and so does Leto, Connelly, and quite surprisingly Wayans. Whenever someone asks me-and this is rhetorical, nobody really has asked me this-'What's the most screwed up, repulsive, nerve-racking, and unorthodox movie you've ever seen?' Typically I answer with Requiem for a Dream (or mother!, but that's for a whole other review/discussion). But trust me, when I say this, I mean that as the upmost apical, and positive compliment. If there was such thing as an A double or even triple plus, I'd reward this movie with it, but since that doesn't exist, I guess we're going to have to rate this the proper way: (Verdict: A+)",10,1,1,27 August 2018
It," Not Just Your Typical Horror Movie, It's Much Much More Than Just That
","Yah I grew up with the 90's original TV mini-series, and yes I have read the extensive but unique Stephen King Novel, It. I've been waiting for this movie to be made for quite some time, cause all though I do find the original 1990 It to be a harmless, cheesy horror flick that you can have fun with, I felt as if it did not do too much justice to Stephen King's sufficient story. The 2017 It movie, I can gladly say was one of the biggest surprises of the year. This film not only was a horror film with some good scares, but a emotionally impacting coming of age film, about friendship and lost. No joke, I actually got very emotional towards the end and even throughout the entirety of the film, due to some of the very important themes this film portrays.     What I surprisingly actually liked the most in this film was the relationship between all the kids in this film. Every kid in this film acts so well, and they're all given very entertaining dialogue that was consistently intriguing throughout this entire movie. The film doesn't tone down on kids cursing or anything, these kids will make sex or immature jokes all the time and I enjoyed it so much, because it felt real. To my knowledge I definitely remember most kids at my middle or high school making inappropriate R-Rated jokes a lot so that was real treat. This film also, is actually quite funny. Particularly this kid in the film named Richie played by Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things, was absolutely hilarious. All the kids stand out, they're all given really emotional backgrounds, that are sometimes really disturbing particularly with Sophia Lillis's character that really added to the films levity. I thought it was very unique for this horror movie to develop these characters for most of the run-time of this film, in having to sacrifice scares and what not. Most horror movies these days typically never develop the characters a lot, and rather throw a bunch of scares at random people instead of having the chance to allow the viewer to understand certain people's backgrounds. Thank you, to the screenwriters, noticing that a bundle of character development, would ultimately save this film from going under the radar as your everyday cliché horror flick.As for Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, I thought he was incredible. Probably the most perfect adaption of Pennywise we will ever get. He really killed it. Nothing for me about him particularly scared me, maybe because I don't find clowns scary, but every scene he was in made me feel so unnerving. It was almost like I had such a level of intensity built up with me, cause every time I saw him on screen I was just waiting for him to do something terrible. Because generally, most of the time Pennywise is on screen, he does normal clown stuff like normal clowns do. He does his silly laugh, smiles a lot, talks about balloons and what not, it just really disturbed me. I can't exactly explain it, but the eeriness of Pennywise really just blew my mind in this film, No spoilers of course, but there is a particular scene at the very beginning of the film, that I will stand by as probably one of the all time best scenes I have ever seen in a horror movie. There was so much uncomfortable but satisfying vibes going throughout me when I saw the scene, and it just basically gave me the predicament that this film was going to be pretty exceptional.As for flaws I don't have many, but I do think they overuse CGI a bit too much sometimes. There's a particular form, that is shown in the film a couple of times that really didn't work for me. All though, sometimes they do use the CGI for good reason, involving Pennywise's scenes that didn't bother me whatsoever.So overall It is pretty much a near perfect adaptation of King's novel. It didn't really scare me, so that might come across to some as very disappointing, but the fact that this film allowed itself to be more of a coming of age, emotionally impactful, and exceptionally fun and thrill-riding, mystery, adventure throughout, I was satisfied to the highest level. I can actually say, that I can see It becoming a possible horror classic in the near future. I think It is one of the better, Stephen King adaptations I've ever seen, and if you're looking for something that is going to enthrall you, for 2 hours and 15 minutes, I definitely recommend checking out It. I'd give It a grading of a solid A, and a score of a 9.5/10.",6,8,18,9 September 2017
Hereditary," The Most Frightening Horror Films, Are The Ones That Feel Disturbingly Real

In Bruges," Dark Comedy Is Simply The Best
","Can we all as a whole, come to a consensus that Martin McDonagh is a screenwriting genius. I confess, In Bruges is actually my least favorite of McDonagh's filmography (so far)-my favorite being, not-so-popularly, Seven Psychopaths-but that's not to say that this diabolical thriller didn't showcase his distinct talent beyond words. In Bruges is an offensive, recklessly non-stop hilarious, dark comedy...with a heart. I like it. (Verdict: A-)",9,0,0,17 September 2018
Rocketman," Rocketman > Bohemian Rhapsody
","Rocketman decides to focus on Elton John's character evolution more than anything else, chronicling his life from when he was a wee-little boy to his glory days as the colorfully decorated, piano-playing, musically blustering star. One detail I must address that really hoisted the exploration of John's life was, in reality, the 'R' rating.You get to see a respectful and psychological turn in his persona, you get to witness the heartbreaking 'addictions' that he constantly forces himself into, you get to view the uncut collision of him dealing with his sexuality, and you even get to feel that loss of love that Elton had felt when he persistently questioned his relationship with peers. All of these affairs are dispensed without and blockades or any desires of censorship and I must commend the filmmakers for going about this risky decision.And sure, Rocketman is arguably quite the corn-fest at times, but the movie is able to take these cheesy elements of the typical rockstar biopic and format it into a creative fashion that characterizes more charismatic and less repetitive exhibitions. Which brings me to my next point...I am so pleased that Rocketman turned out to be a nearly full-on musical? I mean, it had to find some way to be different from Bohemian Rhapsody, right? Whenever a musical note comes on it's not just there for Elton John fan-a-holics. The songs always pertain to the presented events transpiring on screen. The methods they use to present the songs as well, offer some more than compulsive and devouring visuals. I also appreciated how they redid all the songs to fit the scenes in a more appropriate manner. It makes the film seem less like a compilation of Elton's original greatest-hits and more like a rendition of what each song means to the story.Now, Taron Egerton's performance in this is...wow, wow, wow, wow, WOW. He is just bleeding with range and chaotic pizazz in this encapsulation of a contrasted human individual. If someone is worthy of an Oscar nomination this year, it's this guy.Rocketman doesn't entirely rely on nostalgia like most of its kind does-that implying that sometimes it does, however-and most of its misfit adventures proved about in the story seem earned rather than glossed over at a maximum pace of negligence. Definitely check this one out, especially if you're an Elton John fan!",7,121,235,20 May 2019

A Star Is Born," An Impressive Directorial Debut From Bradley Cooper
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, A Star is Born, is, well, a beyond impressive directorial debut. This is another one of those amiable films, that has that charisma, that emits rare, unworldly sensations of comfort, welfare, and empathy. Heart and soul, it's solely touching. By far, the most memorable aspect of this film that heaps of cinephilia's will be commending for years and years from now, is the on-screen junction between Bradley Cooper and Stefani Germanotta's-AKA Lady Gaga's-characters. It's unreal how real their love felt as unreal as that may realistically suggest. Cooper's devotion to storytelling and character absorption is not only laudable, but also, genuinely authentic. Hats off to you once again Cooper. You are an acting master. Getmanotta you are also an acting master, which I was shocked to find to be true, in the case that you are indeed an acting master of the mastery of acting and whatnot-I don't look into the proper terminologies I just 'say'... Oh, and Sam Elliot-no surprise; the man is a legend-killed it. The man is turbulent in his role as an old but dismayed friend. The dialogue is 'spot-on.' This is like, Silver Linings Playbook dialogue leveled 'spot-on.' We can assume that Mr.Cooper and his writing team have learned a lot of calligraphy skills from David O. Russell. I appreciated the accessible amount of F-bombs as well. Don't judge me.And that climax. There's a very very particular sequence towards the finale that was perfectly edited, perfectly lit, and just wow, for sure, perfectly executed. Without question a cinematic highlight of 2018.And yessir, the music is absolutely chic-minus the song, 'Why Did You Do That?' which I assumed was initiated in order to mock our typical 'Pop Music' standards of today (if it's not, forget what I just said or don't @ me). It's inviting, electrifying, and notably appealing even to a rock-and-roll finatic like myself.This is not sponsored, but I felt as if this service is vastly relevant to one of the major, presented topics in A Star is Born, so I'll self-sponsor it. If you're currently dealing with substance abuse issues or disorders or you know of somebody close to you that is, I highly recommend visiting atoncenter. They are a profoundly sufficient drug and alcohol recovery program that is on duty 24 hours a day. You can't start helping others until you begin learning to help yourself. Is A Star is Born a bit predictable at times? Yes. But despite this, being able to witness an early-screening crowd of theater members who were verbally locked-on, inflexiably engaged, warmly reactive, and sentimentally invested in this angelic story, was such a feast-especially when you know what one film can do to one's life. It's always pleasing to behold the reaction of numerous of viewers experiencing an out-of-the world ordeal. Cooper, you did a damn good job. You devious man, you almost made me tear and I hate you so much for it. (Verdict: A-)",7,1,1,5 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Yeah, It's Unfortunately Not That Good
","Captain Marvel is a narrative mess from the moment it starts (of course when I refer to the 'start' I mean once the film tackles after that glorious MARVEL logo intro) and to many fans' surmise this is principally due to how impulsively meteoric the construction of the film's story plays out. Speaking of meteoric, those who shot the action must be Lars von Trier addicts because they are zooming in and out and shaking the camera like they're on cocaine or somethin' and I kid you not, I could barely wrap my head around what was going on half of the time these parades transpired. Also, woefully, despite Brie Larson having proved herself to be quite the star, her performance, but predominantly her character, emerges as this stale, artificial physique. I don't blame her entirely though, it's most likely those who wrote her lines and directed the movie who should be faulted at hand for making Larson's portrayal as Carol Danvers so stiff and awkward.But let me be clear, Captain Marvel is by no means a 'bad' movie. There are tons of distinctive traits to like about it. Some examples include Samuel Jackson's revamp of a young Nick Fury, surprisingly the introduction to the alien race, the Skrulls, and all that glorious, throwback 90s nostalgia music references (Nine Inch Nails, No Doubt, Nirvana, etc.). YES PLEASE.Trust me, it gets progressively better as it hauls along but at the end of the day, Captain Marvel is just another soulless, muddled comic-book adapted movie. If you're a die-hard fanboy who doesn't care for objectively decent-quality content and only wants to seek out filler for Avengers: Endgame and a by-the-numbers superhero-flick, you'll surely love this. But, if you're someone who actually cares if a movie offers cohesive, worthwhile elements that ultimately lead to a purpose other than cushion for a movie that's literally coming out in a month, I'd give Captain Marvel a light pass.Verdict: C-",4,1,3,13 March 2019

Us," Another GLORIOUS Hit From Peele
","Oscar-winning comedic and freshly declared horror director Jordan Peele, endows his patriotic followers with his highly anticipated thriller Us: an allegory that accompanies the account of the tormenting of doppelgängers upon a buoyant, middle-class family struggling to bypass their inner-demons.In Peele's latest attempt to win over audiences of the genre, he gloats audacious twist and turns revolting around a parallel, underground, modern nation that will doubtlessly perplex the contemporary American public-and for a more than coincidental and ironic reason.Get Out might be the 'objectively' better movie, but Us is my kind of horror movie: highly confusing, a tad bit pretentious, and jaw-droppingly cruel-principally within its ambiguous exploration of humanity's current tragedy.",6,1,4,28 March 2019

Ed Wood," Tim Burton At The Top Of His Game
","Ed Wood is Tim Burton's second best film in my mind. For me, Edward Scissorhands would still take the cake for first place-you just can't beat mystical and magical- but despite that being the case, Ed Wood I'd arguably say, is Burton's most masterfully directed and written film yet. This is the original Disaster Artist, just with more heart and gusto-not tryna' diss on The Disaster Artist, I'm just trying to make a comparison cause I'm too lethargic to explain the overarching synopsis of Ed Wood. This film, even from scene 1, is down-right engaging, enticing you into defensibly the most allusive true story about a Hollywood star. Johnny Depp is at his absolute prime when portraying Ed Wood. Sitting on it, this might be his most gifted performance of his entire career-it's a very underrated one indeed. It may not necessarily be Depp's most iconic role-I'm sure all you Pirates fans would reward that trophy to Jack Sparrow-but it's certainly his most driving. All the minor gestures and gimmicks he squeezes into this character makes his believability all the better. And when you mix Wood's character with Martin Landau's Oscar-Winning and furthermore, calamitously tragic performance as Bela Lugosi-which was in fact, 100% well-deseved of that Academy Award-you have yourselves one of the most compelling duo themes present in a based-on-a-true-story film. Ed Wood may be Tim Burton's least Tim Burtony film, but it's at the cost of creating one of his most prolific and momentous masterpieces. Ed Wood is the utmost curious retelling of a man in seek of his aspirations and obsessions. You know you've accomplished something ravishing when your viewer-that being this dork, me-doesn't want it to end even after its over 2-hour runtime. I could fancy a couple more additional hours of this cinematic treasure any day. (Verdict: A)",9,1,1,16 September 2018
Aquaman," A 50/50 Superhero Flick
","James Wan's Directing: YAY!
Beall and McGoldrick's Writing: NAY!I don't believe it's materially doable for me to scheme into words how carelessly ludicrous Aquaman is. I can't declare if I positively cherished the campiness and nuttiness of this movie, or if I positively despised it. Warner Bros have blown their 200-million-dollar budget on something ferociously miraculous, but also, something terribly disposable.In simple terms, Aquaman was acutely run-of-the-mill for me because, all though, Wan's supervision of the action (yes to those one-take shots!) and furthermore, the numerous of filmmakers' tackling of the graphics flowed lavishly, the writing and dialogue, nonetheless, ignominiously sinks to the bottom-ground. Soooo, I suppose I'll meet in the middle with this encapsulation and proclaim that this lunacy of a production-that is Aquaman-is, all in all, mediocre?Aquaman is testosterone fueled mania suffocated with oceans of shirtless men shrieking their heads off while mounting gigantic fishes. If that's what you like in your movies, I recommend trekking alongside this motion picture, but if you're seeking out a superhero flick with sagacity and dandy quality, turn the other way. I'll grant it this though, it's rigorously an improvement from Justice Leauge and Suicide Squad. And, hey, I'll even tally extra points for the Halo jumpsuits and the hardcore, drumming Octopus.

Ready Player One," Visual Masterpiece, Convoluted Story
","It genuinely sucks that Ready Player One is about a 9.5 on the scale of visual gratification but a near 3 on the spectrum of plot. It slaughters me to know how mind-bogglingly phenomenal this movie could've been if it had openly mimicked Ernest Cline's-close to-perfect flair a dose more and had additionally, indulged the classical Spielberg magic that made Spielberg SPIELBERG, not this money-hungry mainstream, cop-out SPIELBERG.Okay, wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it. Let's start this review back at the beginning.Ready Player One incorporates a scale of imaginative frenzy unlike anything ever indulged on the big screen. Every single moment we get to experience invading the spelbinding world of the Oasis, it's like time-traveling into the future of virtual, technological reality. The CGI developers/ designers have crafted a universe rightly groundbreaking. It's BREATHTAKING. This is the plausible galaxy of virtual spectacle that Cline had originally described it as in his best-selling novel.The action is ADRENALINE FUELED. Once you enter the first race of the film, voilà, it's game over. Heart Rate: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300...oops. I'm dead. You wanted the ultimate nerdy euphoric detonation of a life-time? Boom. Feast your eyes.While all of these engrossing features surely make Ready Player One something to admire, there is however, aggravating infections that dragged it down to near mediocrity.The moment where I think Ready Player One dropped the atomic bomb on the storyline was when (about an hour into the film), for some ill-advised reason, Samantha decides to kidnap Wade and make him a part of her rebellion for the rest of the movie's duration. That's about where the writers I think screwed up BIG-TIME because if they had just followed the book's basic plot structure, this movie could've been instantaneously less convoluted. They basically trashed every working element from the source material in order to give us a cheesy romance to explore half-way through our film instead of gradually building the relationship up to a satisfying climax that would've indeed advanced our characters. Character motivations have officially hit the equivalent to a Jackson Pollock painting-being that the whole shebang is now all over the place.And, look, it's not just timidly weak character development that yanks this movie down, it's also the continuity of EVERYTHING. I recommend not doing this-but I unfortunately did. I started thinking about all that had happened in this movie's stream of events and literally, nothing makes any sense. Whether it be how......it's physically impossible the Oasis can possibly function with people using it in the real world (considering the movements and tangible spaces and what not), or how/why characters just discover/find other characters in the real world somehow without explanation (Samantha finding Wade), or how IOI can even function legally, or how IOI even profit from enslaving people to pay off debts, or how the MAJORILY SIMPLE key to opening those IOI slave-rooms hasn't been exposed to the public yet, or why there are so many character decisions that seem illogically spontaneous, or why GOING BACKWORDS WAS THE KEY TO WINNING THE RACE (HOW DID NOBODY THINK TO DO THAT IN FIVE YEARS! AND THE CLUE WAS SO BLANTANTLY OBVIOUS WTFFFFF), or......I could go on and on but let's just say this whole movie's 'new set of alteration in the story' seriously made every plot element in the film feel like one colossal cluster.I understand that it's absolutely necessary to change components from the source material when developing a live-action adaptation, but if you're going to do it, you better well make it good, if not, better. Plus, why even change it at all if the format was initially foolproof to begin with and you could legitimentally just copy and paste the blueprint while, in the end, birthing a more compelling and dynamic story, while even saving some funds! I just hate how this studio has turned such an intricate, thought-provoking, and plausibly crafted storyline into something so average and formulaic. It makes me consistently wonder what could've caused a decision like this (But let's be honest. They probably just chose to format the story like this so they could appeal to the modern, younger, more hyperactive audiences in order to make more $$$).Ready Player One is too fixated on the visual thrills rather than investing their audience into a Spielberg suffused, enchanted story that will firmly provoke something rewarding. The film mostly seems like a cooperate made product rather than Spielberg's actual creation. Honestly, if they had-I hate to be that guy but I'm going to be that guy just this one time-pursued the novel's basic template, Ready Player One might've genuinely twisted out as a blockbuster masterpiece.However, that being said, this movie is still loads of fun?

BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee Is Back In The Game
","What blows me away the most about BlacKkKlansman was its ability to profitably blend such a serious and calamitous subject with an appropriate amount of comedy. Only a long-in-the-business, cinematic master like Spike Lee could pull off such a trick, and he does it without complication. It's also refreshing to see that Spike Lee avoids stereotypes even when depicting some of the more unpleasant and nefarious characters/groups, allowing the film to feel less biased and more grounded in reality with various angles interweaving. BlacKkKlansman contains one of the most hard-hitting, politically dynamic screenplays (right next to Blindspotting) of the year that had me infatuated with revelation. It certainly is one of Spike Lee's best joints in years, maybe even decades. (Verdict: A-)",7,9,17,19 August 2018
Suicide Squad," It's Disappointing As Hell, And An Overall Huge Mess With Sprinkles of Entertainment
","Man, I don't think that I've been more pumped for a film since Star Wars Episode VII. Most of the marketing for Suicide Squad has been extremely good and has kept me pumped since 2015. Now the big question is, is it any good? Well, overall it's enjoyable, but it does not exceed expectations in many ways. I really hoped that this film would make up for the disappointing and flawed film Batman V Superman, but all it confirmed for me was that the DCEU isn't trying hard enough, especially since this was even worse than Batman V Superman. Now before I get into the negatives about the film, I'm going to talk about the pros about this film. First or all let me get this out of the way, Jared Leto as the Joker was great. I enjoyed his performance; he wasn't trying to copy Heath Ledger or Nicholson he was his own unique gangster, mob Joker that really caught my interest. Now this does lead me into one con that I will talk about towards the end of this review.  Deadshot and Harley Quinn, my gosh were probably the best characters in the film. I loved seeing these two on screen they were portrayed perfectly especially Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Diablo, Captain Boomerang, and Rick Flag were also fine characters. Killer Croc, Katana, and Slipknot were on and off characters to me, sometimes they had okay moments and sometimes they just felt like unwanted and unnecessary characters. Amanda Waller I believe would've been a great character if she didn't make some certain choices in the film that honestly made no sense or were never explained. Now the action in the film was pretty fun for the most part. I liked the fighting I like the flashback character origin stories that all happen at the beginning of the film which are by far the most entertaining aspects of the film. I also liked how there was a lot of really funny humor in the film as well which was definitely a plus. The film's first act is pretty entertaining and for the most part I enjoyed it. Oh Yah, Batman killed it once again in the film like he did in BVS. Now that I've got most of the Pros out of the way it's time to get into the negatives of the film. This film's editing honestly was pretty bad. I know the film had to do last minute film shootings and editing and I think that might have made the film take a turn for the worst. The film is pretty fast paced which may seem like a good thing, but it really wasn't cause the editing was so choppy that there was no breathing time for me to process what was happening on screen. The editing sometimes really confused and took me out of this film. Also, the soundtrack is a great soundtrack, but most of the music interjected into the film was so loud and so out of place that it distracted me from many scenes, one in particular which I will not spoil which contains the Joker that really threw me off. Also another con is the main finale battle of the film was extremely terrible. It almost reminded me of the ending of the new Fantastic Four; it was obviously not as bad but it was extremely lazily made. Also there is so much scenes that felt like they were missing from the film which made the plot become extremely confusing and stupid at times and almost, in the end, made no sense at all which really told me that the people working on the plot of the film did a poor job. There's also some over-dubbing for the voices of the characters that you can tell were voice-overs which really took me out of the film one in particular with the Joker that almost made me laugh cause it was so badly dubbed. Also, no spoilers of course Enchantress and the villain of this film were done very poorly. Enchantress was a fine character at the beginning but slowly morphed into a cheesy, disposable character and the villain was so cliché and lame which really bugged me. Some of the line delivery in this film was sometimes extremely out of place and truly cringe-worthy even though the majority of the film does have decent dialogue. Its just that some of the poorly done dialogue probably had to due with the factor of the editing that made it seem poorly done. And a huge disappointing factor of the film is that the Joker is barely even in the film. He's literally interjected into 30 second mini scenes throughout the entire runtime of the film. My final flaw with this film is the emotional levels they try to present in this film. There is so many scenes in this movie that try to be emotional and try to touch your heart, when really it just comes out as either confusing or extremely messy. I do enjoy how they tried to bring heart into this film, but some of it was done very strangely, and not in a professional way for sure. Overall though I think if you go into this film with an open mind knowing that this film is going to be a okay, mindless blockbuster film, you might enjoy it. If you're going to go into it thinking its going to be the DC film that saves the DCEU and 'Oh this is going to be a awesome film,' you will most likely hate this film. To me this film is overall a huge disappointment, but it still has a couple of enjoyable moments. Suicide Squad is a film with an extreme amount of editing problems and flaws, but it has just enough action and likable characters that it can be enjoyed as a choppy, okay, summer blockbuster popcorn-flick.

Barry Lyndon," Another Kubrick Masterpiece
","Barry Lyndon is one of the most captivating single-man journeys I've ever endorsed. The coinciding messages about the effect poverty or wealth can have upon an individual's character, ambitions, and actions are marvelously exhibited. The film's finale is as exhilarating as it is inventive, and proves itself as one of Kubrick's finest cinematic sequences. The narration the movie offers however, feels glaringly unecessary, but despite that, every other aspect of Barry Lyndon is all you could ever hope for in a Kubrick gem.

Incendies," The First Sign Of Villeneuve's Geniusness
","I'm in a chasmic lost for words. Incendies was...goodness gracious. Villenueve. Villenueve, never leave us. Please. Never, ever leave us. You are a god.Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, okay, I think I'm sturdy now. Incendies is a rare film that manages to be an invigorating political thriller about violence, war, religion, and hostitily, while simultaneously, be a malevolent, nail-biting mystery-noir thriller. There are so many sequences in this bruting, cloak-and-dagger mischief-maker that will stick out to you like an imperishable parasite. It is crushing.The only reason why Incendies doesn't earn a 5/5 from me-for now-is because the pacing at first glance wasn't all too keen at times, there's admittedly a plateful of coincidences that materialize, and the character, Simon, was a bit of a nuisance virtually every time he emerged on screen. I'm sure though that after a rewatch in the near future, I'll end up fine-tuning notably more to this deviously harrowing exploit. Nonetheless, j'ai adoré. (Verdict: A-)",9,4,5,13 February 2019
Predator," The Perfect B Movie
","Predator is B-Rated, action nonsense at its unadulterated finest. It's just about everything you could possibly hope for in a maniacally crafted, action blowout. From my perspective I can respectably understand both the majority of Predator fans' opinions and the majority of critics' opinions (which tend to be negative) towards this film. In the long-run, Predator isn't necessarily my cup of tea, but I fully respect the hype and admiration surrounding the picture, as it does make for a solid, kick-back watch. However, that doesn't take a way the fact that I had some faults and issues with the flick. Despite the movie containing some of the all-time most rad, cheesy, badass one-liners, it's screenplay/dialogue is quite mediocre for the most part. Additionally, the actors'/actresses' performances, at least for me, don't hold up superbly well-(I hate saying this) even Schwarzenegger sometimes feels unconvincing in parts. It's also pretty shoddy that it becomes troublesome to care for any of the characters in this movie, considering we are provided little to no information on just about any of them, making the deaths and kills feel more gore-porn directed rather than emotionally draining. I understand that this movie isn't necessarily trying to be super subversive, deep, nor meaningful/compelling-it's just simply trying to be a mindless, action phenomena-but regardless, it doesn't change the fact that some character development would've made for a better movie. Also, the emphasis on 'action/violence over-kill' didn't fit well with the more intense atmospherical presences. There's certain points where a sequence will carry on with an ongoing series of explosions, or an ongoing series of random gun-firing, and it'll be pretty wicked for a while, and then exceed it's welcome for way too long, and sooner or later, become pretty comical and goofy. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm nit-picking apart this film to death (and it's defintely seems like it cause I probably am) but conclusively, at the end of the day, I enjoyed rewatching Predator, its just that I didn't feel like I took a whole lot out of it despite its creative aspect/gimmick with the Predator villain. It essentially, didn't seem disaparate enough nor equally or close to as impressive as some of the more classic slasher/sci-fi thrillers. The most interesting aspect about this movie though, well, was the character of the Predator, who is BEYOND dreadfully stunning. Every time you get to glance through the perspective of the Predator, it makes for a bone-chilling sensation. He's almost up there with the Xenomorph for me, and additionally, I'll also give him the benefit of the doubt by saying that he would totally kick a Xenomorph's ass if they went head to head (this being from the perspective of a person who has not yet seen the AVP movies). Predator may be a semi-gutless, creature feature, but it's also a semi-kick-ass, action extravaganza. Verdict Change: (B+ -> B)",7,0,0,30 August 2018
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal Deserves An Oscar!
","The biggest American crime ever to be committed in the cinematic timeline of this decade-right next to the fabrication of The Emoji Movie-was the Acadmey's neglect to nominate Jake Gyllenhaal for best actor due to his eerie, highbrow and persistent performance as, Louis Bloom, the greatest on-screen psychopath since Heath Ledger's The Joker. To top it all off, while this near masterpiece alluded to us as, Nightcrawler, did get nominated for best screenplay, it's plainly evident that it also, should've-beyond the shadow of a doubt-won back in the theatrical goldmine of 2014.First time director, Dan Gilroy, encapsulates the city night skies of Los Angeles spiritedly through a friendless outlook of a calamitously gruesome medium that will infect audiences around the world with trembling fear of the nefarious sides of the human spirit.

Bohemian Rhapsody," Divided
","Bohemian Rhapsody was one of my most anticipated movies of 2018. It'd be quite strenuous to oblige to you'll quite how crucial the band, Queen, means to me and how much they've inveigled myself as the person I am today.As a youngster, I had been raised upon the newest, hottest, artificially publicized pop and rap tracks that were continuously featured on the most vouged radio stations at the time, but in the corner of every auto-tuned, computerized feature I listened to, I would often get to occasionally tango to a Queen hit.Freddie Mercury and his band of bohemians are the quadruple-handed culprits who peeked my interest in soulfull, rock and roll music genres which conincidently, have shaped me into the 'Classic Rock-Head' I am presently. Not only that, but the obscurities and lunacy of their lyrics-especially from hits like Bohemian Rhapsody-drove me into studying the arts of profoundly galvanized poetry/lyricism/literature.Their music additionally, has helped me power through numerous of my most emotionally conflicting encounters I had brawled with during my time here on planet Earth. This iconic band has been persisting alongside my life ever since I was born, and that's something I can't declare about towards any other musician/musical group.Now Here's My Consensus:I am very, very tied on this film. On one hand, I thought Bohemian Rhapsody tributed the story of Freddie Mercury-for the most part-judiciously, mainly due to Rami Malek's immersive performance. Trust me, if Malek wasn't in this movie, Bohemian Rhapsody would've crumbled to ashes apace with some of the biggest catastrophes of 2018. As a depiction and honory of a musical legend, I was earnestly contented to witness the results.On the other hand, I found this movie to be a pretty incoherent, potboiler mess of a product. The harshest way to submit this is, well, simply put, to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is fundamentally your average company manufactured, cop-out, strand of merchandise that was only fabricated for mainstream audiences who will unknowingly be able to eat up the same old 'Fast and the Furious: Family is Important' blueprint that they've unconsciously seen billions of times.However, this movie is dang LUCKY that they got Malek on the project and that they AT LEAST managed to make a glaringly enthralling, two-hour, sound-explosion of a music video.The Main Core Killing This Movie: So, not gonna lie, Bohemian Rhapsody's script is somewhat atrocious in my humble opinion. This penmanship nearly lineaments everything I don't want in a 'based-on-a true-story' feature. Whose bright idea was it to make a Marvel movie confided within a Queen movie, an arrangement which wasn't necessarily a construct that one should really consider for a freakin' Queen movie. Writers of the world, you don't have to throw in a satirical one-liner every twenty seconds in order to conquer your audiences attention!And MY MY. Like, if you didn't think a movie could get more 'by-the-books' clichÃ©-especially when diving in with all the family is valuable and family acceptance mortalities-than you sir or madam, were wrong. Screenwriters-I've been sounding so demanding recently, I apologize. I guess I'm just admittedly aggravated today-stop making your dilagoue feel as if it's sprouting out of the pages of a life coaching pamphlet! It's amateurish, honestly.They just had to bend the story into little bits and pieces because they just had to insert their little chestnut morals and preaches, and their superfluous, forced humor. Why Hollywood? Why? (Probably because of production issues and what not. Oh. And Bryan Singer. Supposedly. And marketing. And money. Definitely money.)The editing is a bit of a mess too. The sequence of events are muddled like crazy. You'll needa do some final cuts on this DARLING! And about 30% of the movie is just witnessing the band drag on from how they crafted one hit to how their next hit was created and so on so forth.Did I just rant? Woah, I totally did. Hmm...let's lighten matters up, I suppose. I don't want to give off too many negative vibes about this mediocre biopic feature. There is virtue to be found.But Rami Malek. This man carries this ENTIRE movie. Without him, Bohemian would like an ATOM BOMB. Or...not, like an Atom Bomb. Cause the song. Okay, I'll shut-up.Malek's performance is honestly Oscar-nominee worthy. He embodies head to toe, Freddie Mercury's EVERYTHING. Even in the sentimental, dramatic moments, he kills (sorry), DESTROYS it-despite the poor script and dialogue he's often given. Additionally, his chemistry and the story behind his love life was intriguing enough to keep me locked on. The positive outcome of the film originates from this portrayal and this plotpoint that majorily has to do with who Freddie was and what he had to accord with during his times of fame.I mildly relished Bohemian Rhapsody, and I was enthralled whenever we got to relive Mercury's tale, but...a Queen movie deserves light-years better than this. I'm possibly being a tad-bit generous offering Bohemian Rhapsody with this grade, but, I can't deny that I enjoyed and was cheery that I got to venture this film of messy yet, dapper flair...so: (Verdict: D+)",4,82,129,6 November 2018
The Village," Shyamalan's First Mixed Bag Of A Film
","Time to breakdown M. Night Shyamalan's, The Village.The Shyamagold:
THAT ROGER DEAKINS CINEMATOGRAPHY GOODNESS! WOW, WOW, WOW!
Shyamalan writes just the dandiest of characters. Blind Dallas Howard for the win.
Joaquin Phoenix is a god who can save any mess of a film. That is if, theoretically, this mess of a film has him present throughout the entire movie...
Directing of the camera is miraculous. Shows you Shyamalan isn't vacant in terms of his magical talents quite yet.
Costumes, props, etc. are spruce.
Neat twist!
Even neater second twist!The Shyamabull:
Most of the dialogue and delivery from the actors/actresses are awkwardly ATROCIOUS.
A ton of character actions/decisions make zero sense. Many 'whys?' were spoken that day in my TV room.
Transitions are seriously spontaneous.
The police officer's acting and just his character in general is a sin on its own.
Plot. Hole. Galore.
Last scene is an 'eh' way to end the movie.The Kajillion Shyamalanian Twists (Spoiler Warning):
Joaquin Phoenix is not actually dead... after getting stabbed...multiple times.... somehow....
Red = Blood. Symbolism. Boom.
The monsters aren't real and are just the Elders playing 'Trick or Treat'! Cute!
The magical rocks aren't actually magical rocks and are just used to trick gullible villagers who don't know the 'secret'. Thank golly.
Adrien Brody is actually the monster hunting down Ivy. Shyamalan tried to ploy us into thinking he was a real monster even though the film literally just revealed that the monsters (who all wear the same exact costume designs) aren't real, only in history books. Cheap move man. Cheap move.
The villagers were unconsciously Amish the whole time and the Elders were just some traumatized hippies who meet in therapy camp! Now that's a truly clever Shyamatwist!
Simple medicine is all you need to save a person's life-even for anyone who gets stabbed a billion times.The Village is ethically one of the most difficult films I've ever had to rate. The film is frankly, ingenious within-some-of it's plot, but has too much brainless, unsystematic garbage in it for it to pound anywhere near Shyamalan at his height. So with that said, this is the fairest grade I could come up with for M. Night's, The Village: (Verdict: C+)",5,0,1,23 January 2019
The Shining," Kubrick Mastered Horror
","I finished reading Stephen King's classic last night, so it only seemed right to re-watch my favorite horror movie of all-time: Stanley Kubrick's blood pulping adaptation of, The Shining.I unreservedly understand why King detests this movie now. I mean, if my work was tampered like this, I would assuredly be pissed. But I'm not the author, so I have the potential to relish this malicious braintwister. The book is beyond any doubt, better in terms of its story components and character developments. Having said that, I think Kubrick's revamp handles its horror ingrediants more psychologically, and arguably, more dexterously.The main reason I personally think that, The Shining, towers over any other horror movie in existence, is because of the methods the film employs while incorporating the soundtrack into the sequences. The vital timing, the detail to tension, and the evolution of the music is key to exhibiting such an excruciating feeling of angst.Here are a couple other noteworthy techniques that make, The Shining, stand from the crowd: The impulsive snap-zooms, the one-take stalking shots, Jack's topsy-turvey facial expressions/mannerisms, Danny's interactions with 'Tony', Jack's unexplained link to the Overlook Hotel, the interlacing cuts of multiple scenes, the drawn-out, gripping, one-on-one dialogue segments, and the spontaneous imageries.Like I divulged before in my recent review of Luca Guadagnino's, Suspiria, the modules that make horror movies scary are the ones that fiddle with normality. Tinkering with what is morally ethical or what is bearable is what makes a film frightening. The Shining deviates from convention more flawlessly than any other thriller out there.Kubrick may have butchered King's vision but, in doing so, generated the most effective horror movie to date due to his atypical perception. The Shining is the definitive sugar-daddy of the entourage of cinematic fear factors that came after it. (Verdict: A+)",10,2,5,8 February 2019

The Lego Movie," The Greatest Animated Movie in Over a Decade
","How to start of this review? Hmmmmmm. How about 'Everything Was Awesome!' I know, pretty overused at this point. But the LEGO Movie is awesome and I'm not just saying that, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.Plot - The Story is about a ordinary guy named Emmet who is said to be the special. He eventually goes on this Journey with some Master Builders from stopping Lord Business from doing the evil stuff that he is supposed to do. Surprisingly the plot is really smooth. It takes a while to get adjusted during the beginning but towards the middle, you are totally adjusted to the plot. And the plot seems to work out just perfect not too much not too little.Characters - The cast of this movie is like, to be honest, one of the best casts in an animated film ever put to film. We've got Christ Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnet, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, even Morgan Freeman put in the films main roles. Each actor portrays the emotions of the character so well. The voices just work with each individual figure. So the characters are portrayed very carefully and well during the film each one at the right time.Animation - The Animation in this movie is so good. You literally feel like you are inside a LEGO world. The animation looks like Stop-Motion, but it's actually computer animated which actually makes everything look a it better. You literally could imagine this happening on your kids or your LEGO's. It's like you are watching little tiny Minifigures going on an adventure. Also when things are blown up or smoke is coming out of vehicles, it's all LEGO bricks manipulating everywhere. It is genius animation, just it just fits with the LEGO movie.What to Except - Pure satisfaction and maybe even more. This is one of those kids films were parents enjoy it just as much as their kids EQUALLY. There is a ton of Pop culture references in the film that everybody today can relate to so much. There is literally non-stop funny humor throughout the film. And a some of it is adult humor to keep the adults very entertained and into the film. What mainly to expect is 'Getting Super Surprised' When you here about a movie about LEGOs, your just thinking 'it's going to be a huge advertisement for sure.' But it felt like it wasn't advertising anything at all. There were so many life lessons in the movie that are not hard to catch especially to the parents. Family lessons that aren't just any silly all life lesson, but something deeper and more. All these lessons and heart-warming moments are fit into one whole 100 minute movie very smoothly surprisingly. In the end is what will really get you but I can't spoil it because that would ruin the whole movie. So parents, children prepare for a surprising film, trust me.Overall - Overall the LEGO movie is a enjoyment for the whole movie but not just like any old good animated movie. This is something more. Something more, something movies these days should have. It's been more than a decade until we've had amazing movies like this. Disney still has there A-Game on, but I think Warner Bros. Is starting to step up their game. So should you buy it on. Blu-Ray or Watch it? Both. You can watch this so many times and always keep on being entertained. The LEGO movie is one of the, or just maybe, the greatest animated film ever played on the big screen. (A+)",7,4,8,18 June 2014
The Favourite," Yorgos Lanthimos Takes On Old-Fashioned England
","The Favourite was not what I expected. This isn't classic Yorgos Lanthimos, this is a whole new, more whimsical Yorgos Lanthimos, approached parallel to his usual sinister, vexing, and twisted spirit. In full hindsight, this more comedic and less calamitous manner ended with me completely and whole-heartedly digging it. And when I say, The Favourite is more cheer and juvenile than his previous work, I'm not inferring that Lanthimos loses his infamous psychologically poignant gift in this, I'm just inferring that it's done in a much more subtle way, hidden by cynical buffoonery.At the time being, I would claim that this isn't my favorite-sorry-favourite of Lanthimos's filmography-The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer still hold that spot dearly to my heart-but I would doubtlessly claim that The Favourite is by a long-shot, Lanthimos's most gratifying and crowd-pleasing film. I did not expect to had had such a blast with this movie. Not only is it funny as hell, but the comradery and rivalry between Emma Stone's character and Rachel Weisz's character-both who by the way, give the most dexterous performances of this entire year-was just too much fun to take in. And Olivia Colman's performance as the queen...comical perfection.The atmospherical tone of this movie also is one of the many aspects that won me over. It reputed like an old-fashioned, 1-on-1, battle of the minds movie, just with touches of Lanthimos's typical synthetic stylizations. It's the cherry on the top of this shrewd satire.The Favourite might not be as poetically relevant to today's society like The Lobster, or as tramuatizingly stirring like The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but it's a playful piece of mental spectacle that is oddly bone-crushing, yet, pleasing, all at once. Loved nearly every second of it. Bravo, once again Sir Lanthimos. (Verdict: A)",8,177,324,14 October 2018

Chris I swear is the next big Hollywood star I guarantee it. He was in the LEGO movie and now this. He's also going to be in Jurassic World. Chris plays a thief and he is flawless in the movie. Gamora was a good character to. She's a Assassin and a fierce warrior. Drax's character was OK but I liked him. He played a really fearsome warrior. Rocket! Oh my god Rocket stole the show. Rocket is so awesome on screen all the time and also sometimes so adorable. You can not hate Rocket, he is just pure awesome. Groot was a very lovable character too, he was very heart-warming and powerful in this movie. The only character I do have a bone to pick with is Ronan. He honestly was kind of a lame looking villain, but he really didn't bother me during this movie.Plot - The plot worked out pretty well. The length of this movie was perfect and everything that happens in this movie entertains you.

Cold War," Staggering
","Cold War is a high-handed tour de force of filmmaking courtesy pizzazz that in the final analysis, thrives due to its pristine inclusions of comforting original music, compulsive cinematography, stellar performances, and
sincere dialogue.In spite of these stainless insertions, Cold War didn't 'to the hilt' secure my heart considering how hollow I found the bulk of the story to be. Some may find its unadorned, cliché romantic efforts to mark the beauty of the film but personally, I found it to be quite fainéant. Fortunately, the conclusion of the movie takes a courageous and lionhearted route that at long last, redeemed the presumed lacklusterness of the previous acts' schemes.Cold War is a seductive yet, melancholy viewpoint on the state of being maligantly lovesick. Pawel Pawlikowski has reinvented the cut-and-dried love story with a fresh, passionate, power-seasoned zing to it. (Verdict: B+)",8,1,3,12 February 2019
Logan," Logan Is A Dramatic Action Masterpiece, Not Just Another Superhero Entry
","Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, 'The Dark Knight' of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and cliché. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an 'A' and a IMDb score of a 10/10.",7,5,12,15 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Must Watch For Anyone Who Respects Cinema
","Rewatched 2001 A Space Odyssey today. It's shocking to hear it has been 50 years since the film's release. It's hands down the most cinematically gorgeous movie ever conceived, and still has one of the most puzzling yet fascinating storylines. Kubrick's masterpiece shall never die!",10,5,8,11 April 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the Best Love Stories Around
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an inexhaustible serum formulated by lofty doses of trepidation. The film takes a similair high-octane approach within fetching out its countless events to that of one of my all-time favorites, Requiem for a Dream, making just about every conceptual message it has in store function freakishly well. Charlie Kaufman's script is the key module to this movie's heart-rending brain cluster that is surely guaranteed to tumble over and cause any other romantic narrative to look puny in comparison.

This Is Spinal Tap," THESE GO TO ELEVEN
","It's humorous when you recognize that in between the 34 years that had occurred after This Is Spinal Taps's release, nobody would've been able to predict that a good 90% of today's music would make Spinal Taps's fictional discography look like Led Zeppelin's authentic discography. I'm rooting for a This Is Spinal Tap spinoff where we look into the lives of most Pop/Rap/EDM/ Alternative artists today. It doesn't even have to be a mockumentary, it literally could transpire in reality and it'd probably end up just as laugh-out-loud as This Is Spinal Tap. The amount of intellect between the band members of Spinal Tap and-I'll use this word again-most artists of our generation is disturbingly similar. (Verdict: B+)",8,1,2,22 September 2018
Don't Breathe," Don't Breathe Is Not Only Extremely Intense, But It Also Sets An Example Of How Horror Movies Of Today Should Be Made
","I'm not the hugest horror movie buff, but when it comes to horror films like The Shining or Cabin In The Woods just know it increases my liking of the horror genre. Now rarely today will I find a horror film that I will extremely like or even like at all. It's almost now a 1/3 ratio were I'll actually go into a horror movie and find it to be a decent film. Don't Breathe not only expands a new level of intensity in horror or thriller films, but if it makes enough money it could inspire new waves of actually really good horror movies. Don't Breathe blew me away I was so immersed into this film that I almost felt like I was in the horrible situation that the characters in the film were in. There was so many times were I was on the edge of my seat and even sometimes holding in my own breath when the actors were holding their breaths. The premise of this film isn't very new it's kind of borrowed off of films like Panic Room but I think with horror films like The Conjuring, it's okay to borrow off cliché premises if the film itself is done right. The two main characters played by Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette have great character development. When a horror movie gives characters good development and likability it just makes the film way better. Cause now that I have these two characters that I actually care about it'll make me care about what will possibly happen too them throughout the runtime of the film. Now Stephen Lang's character I thought was very menacing as this Blind man. He had a great back story and he was a threat to be reckoned with. Also the way the camera focuses or moves around from scene to scene or place to place is done so well that it brings the intensity level to a more even pace. There's even a lot of long shots in this film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Now I do have one complaint with this film and that is about, no spoilers of course, the ending. The ending I think went on for too long it could've cut off at least 15 minutes earlier and the film would've been better. The film just kept dragging on and it felt unnecessary. Also just a heads up if you haven't yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend not seeing it cause it actually spoils part of the movie. Other than that I had such an amazing time with Don't Breathe and if your a fan of the horror genre, definitely go into it and if you are interested in having a exciting experience at the movies go and see this film. This is easily one of my favorite films this year and I'm going to give Don't Breathe a grade of an A and a IMDb score of a 9/10.",7,27,52,30 August 2016
Sicario," Suspense Captured With Perfect Precision
","Decided to rewatch Denis Villeneuve's Sicario in preparation for Sicario 2. I still consider Sicario to be one of the best movies ever made in terms of 'technicality.' Nearly all the editing and visual aspects inserted in this film are perfectly crafted in my opinion. It has a nice, slow, steady pace that Villeneuve has learned to master exceptionally at this point. Performances are top notch, and the third act of this film blows me away every time I witness it. It's indeed, a traumatizing look into the world we live in today and the dark incentives the human mind will develop. (Verdict: A)",9,2,3,29 June 2018
Rosemary's Baby," The Pinnacle Of Psychological Horror
","Being a humongous fan of Chinatown, one of my all-time favorites, I had contrived myself with massive expectations for Rosemary's Baby-which I have been anticipating for many many months-and I'm completely appalled that this film somehow, effortlessly exceeded them. The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that the characters provided in the story don't feel like actors/actresses portraying a part, they feel like real people attending their everyday lives. I felt like I was baselessly peeping into the lives of real people experiencing real traumatic events, and that's saying a lot since some seriously berserk stuff goes down in this film. Rosemary's Baby is doubtlessly one of the most persuasive, and unsettling dramatic thrillers I have ever gutted. It's parallels to difficult and more burdensome themes that other films wouldn't dare explore, are boldly risky yet decidedly respectable. Rosemary's Baby is the upholding standard (or literal definition) of flawless 'psychological horror.' Despite my considerably negative feelings towards Polanski as a person, as a filmmaker, I can give him top-credit for his masterful direction and perfect writing that can simply not be compared with against any other household name during the era in which Rosemary's Baby was released (AKA, the 60s). (Verdict: A+)",10,1,3,9 August 2018
It Chapter Two," Xavier Dolan
","I really couldn't care less whether I liked or disliked the movie, or found it to be a good use of my time or a complete waste because I'm just kinda psyched that Xavier Dolan was at the beginning of this movie. I love that dude.",3,1,3,7 September 2019
The Wrestler," Another Aronofsky Hit
","The Wrestler is another, powerful, deep-rooted, Darren Aronofsky confection that I-like I tend to do with his films-ate up like a mad dog. It's drama taken to new levels of intensity and will most presumably, tug at just about anybody's heart strings. It's one of Aronofsky's most tame films, but despite that, one of his most humanly connective. Beautifully done. (Verdict: A-)",8,1,1,25 August 2018
Kong: Skull Island," A Film That Contains Some Extremely Entertaining King Kong Throwdown Scenes, But Has Everything Else At A Dull
","I kept an open mind going into this film considering the trailers caught my attention since they made the film look extremely energetic, but there still was a possibility of this film flunking. I know it kills me to say this since I actually wanted this film to be solid, but I honestly think Skull Island was mediocre at best. This is an action film that is full of some super entertaining monster and of course King Kong action, destruction scenes, but in its entirety, it was a very flawed film. Now what I did however like about this film were a couple of things. One was the whole idea of the Skull Island aspect. All the monsters in this movie look super cool and have a very intensifying aspect to them that caught my attention. A majority of these monsters also have some pretty cool chaos scenes. Also Kong in this film had some pretty cool moments of destruction particularly the first time you see Kong. The scene lasts around 5 minutes and it is glorious, I absolutely loved that scene. Now that I've got that out of the way, I'm going to tell you why this film really didn't work for me. This film feels like it was rushed. For one the characters in this film are extremely poorly developed, I honestly couldn't care about any of them. The acting in the film from most of the actors and actresses, were for the most part really good. It's just that there was nothing for me to latch onto, or relate to with these characters since they have such vague character development. There is no sense of suspense when these characters are in danger, because I really couldn't care if they died, and that was hugely disappointing in my opinion. The only character that was slightly developed was surprisingly, John C Reily's character. Even so, John C Reily's character still didn't have that much of a pull on me, he was just the only character the film actually tries to make you care about. Now one thing that really upset me was Samuel's Jackson's character. Now I am a huge Samuel Jackson fan I've loved almost all of his performances in every film he's been in even the bad ones. For the first time ever I actually think I have found a Samuel Jackson role I have hated. Samuel Jackson's character in this film at first is just alright, but then he progressively becomes this over the top, un-charismatic, and unintelligent character who does some really stupid decisions with his military men, that bothered me so much. Something else that really bothered me in this film was the comedy. For me at least, 10% of the jokes land, and they are actually pretty funny. The other 90%, feels extremely forced. Almost every single scene in this film is always trying to be funny and it just got super annoying and repetitive after a while. This film also contains a really good soundtrack, with some extremely good 70s war songs. Well, unfortunately this movie decides to play these songs whenever they want at the most random times. Kind of like Suicide Squad, the soundtrack is good, but the way they interconnect that soundtrack with the film is done poorly. Also, some of the editing and plot points in this film are done a bit poorly. The editing isn't choppy too many times in this film, but when it is it's very noticeable. There are also some really bad green screen usage in this film. Some of the green screen looked really fake. This film at times looks very artificial an unrealistic, and I really wish they actually used natural backgrounds more often for this film. Even some of the CGI looks bad at times, which is bad considering this film mostly relies on CGI. But by far my hugest complaint about this film is without a doubt, the final decision that happens at the very end of the film. I have scene many movies in my life, but the certain decision that a couple of characters make towards the end, is one of the most random, unanswered, and pointless decisions, I have ever seen on film. I don't want to spoil it in case you haven't watched the film but when you see the film you'll know it. Hint, its the extremely random decision that is made 'after' another group makes a stupid decision. My final flaw with this film is that at times it tries to be Jurassic Park. I know I shouldn't compare a film like Jurassic Park, with a simple monster movie like this one but I need to mention this. A couple of scenes in this movie are almost exact rip offs of scenes from Jurassic Park, and if you've scene Jurassic Park you will most likely know what scenes I'm talking about. Guys, Girls, I don't think I have to say anymore, Kong Skull Island was a huge disappointment. Right now at the time I'm writing this review, it's got a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7.1 on IMDb. To be honest I don't understand why this film is getting solid praise, especially from critics, but honestly if you like this movie, good for you, I am legitimately happy for you. To me though, I honestly found Kong Skull Island to be a huge mess that contained some really awesome monster destruction scenes thrown into it. If you like films like Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you might like this film cause it falls under the same line as a mindless CGI extreme action festive. I'm going to give Kong Skull Island a grade of a C- and a IMDb score of a 5/10.",4,0,3,7 April 2017
Halloween," The Most Important Landmark In Horror Movie History
","So I'm going to be marathoning the Halloween movies leading up to David Gordon Green's new incarnation coming out later this year.

The Iron Giant," An Animated Classic
","I'm about 99.9% sure The Iron Giant was chiefly contrived to give viewers a severely backbreaking time to not sob throughout its totality.

Iron Man," The One That Started It All
","I can now reminisce what made the first Iron Man so clever after rewatching it. It arguably has the best screenplay out of any of the MCU entries, and Robert Downey's performance is striking.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman V Superman Is a Film With Many Flaws But Some Incredible Pros
","(Introduction) I was pretty excited for this film even though I wasn't a huge fan of the trailers, my love for Batman sucked me into the anticipation. And the question is, Was it Worth the Wait? Is Batman V Superman A Good Movie? Well, I'm pretty mixed on all those questions. This is a film I really have multiple opinions on. There are so many aspects of the film I liked and so many aspects I just hated. There is just so many Pros and Cons of this film that the film just seems so mixed and variant but in a negative and positive way.(Performances) Let's get right into the acting performances. Ben Affleck as Batman is 'Phenomenal.' I will most likely get a lot of hate for this, but Ben Affleck just might be my favorite Batman. I'm still mixed on this decision but it just tells you how much I loved Bruce Wayne/Ben Affleck in this film. Every scene with Batman in it is so perfect, Batman in this film is definitely my favorite aspect of this movie. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams did great in their roles and did solid performances. I also enjoyed Jeremy Irons performance as Alfred and I can't wait to see him in the next DC film. Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, really didn't work for me. His character just came off as very 'Jokerish' which sounds like that's a positive thing but it just comes out as 'Over the Top.' I can tell he was very committed to his role which I can respect but his character as Lex Luthor was just not serious enough. His role was not something that speaks the character 'Lex Luthor.'(Plot/Script Writing) The plot and pacing of this film is the hugest problem I have with this film. This films plot is so messy, everything is just all over the place. The first hour and a little more than a half is so unnecessarily long. The first hour and a half is just a bunch of random scenes that tie up into this huge bundle of bore. Like the first half of this film could have been condensed into 20 to 30 minutes and this film would have been way better. Nope, there's just a ton of unnecessary scenes that could have been just gotten rid of the film completely. The problem is there isn't enough links to the main event which is 'Batman V Superman.' The actual Batman VS Superman fighting doesn't happen until like almost 2 hours into the film which is disappointing because the lead up for them fighting is really lazily made. Also the tie-ins to the Justice League film is really lazy as well. It just feels like the script writers and plot developers of this film cared more about tie-ing in other future films than actually working on what should've been the main story which is Batman fighting Superman. (Action Sequences) Now on to the positive, holy whatever, some of the action scenes in this film are absolutely perfect. Zack Snyder knows how to make a good-looking film, maybe not a well plotted one, but a good looking film. This film is amazing in action ways mainly having to do with Batman. Every scene with Batman in it, is perfect and I love it. The look of Batman in my opinion is the best looking Batman ever! The action scenes especially the hand to hand combat with Batman in it, is just pure entertainment. I cannot critique anything about most scenes with Batman in it. Also when Batman and Superman fight (Don't Worry No Spoilers) is absolutely worth it. When 'Batman VS Superman' actually happens, it is epic. Also Wonder Woman in this film is pretty sick in most the scenes she is. I like Gal Gadot as Wonderwoman and it makes me pretty excited for her stand alone film. So what is pretty much keeping this film from being a complete fail is the action and Batman in this film. I couldn't ask anymore of Batman in this movie and I think the majority of the action is top notch. The only problem I have is that in the end (DON'T WORRY NO SPOILERS I PROMISE) there is a certain character (That is shown in the trailers so I assume you know who I'm talking about) is so poorly CGI'ed and introduced that it kind of took me out of the story. Also the final battle and 3rd act was absolutely horrific. Like the 3rd act of the film really just took everything downhill. The fight scenes in the last act are somewhat interesting to watch but it just comes off as an excuse to add more action and CGI. There is also a choice they make with a character in the end that was ballsy to make, but in the very end they totally dis that choice and it just comes off as unnecessary and stupid.(The Overall Pros) Affleck is a Phenomenal Batman Batman is a Perfect Batman Action Sequences are Terrific Batman Fight With Superman is Very Entertaining Cavill and Irons Commit Great Performances(The Overall Cons) Terrible Plotting Okay Script Writing Slow Pacing for the First Half Lazy Justice League Tie-Ins Some Very Lazily Exposited Motivations An Okay Lex Luthor (Jessie Eisenberg's Performance) The Final Act and Character Choices(My Overall Rating and Thoughts) Overall I actually wasn't expecting that much of the film. I was more than happy with Batman in this film. Batman was way higher than my expectations could ever reach. The movie looks visually fantastic and has some fan service in it. The lazy plot and script writing though really took me out of the film. So overall I'm going to give Batman V Superman and overall rating ofÂ…Grade: C+ IMDb Score: 6/10 Stars: 3/5",4,2,4,26 March 2016

A Nightmare on Elm Street," One, Two, Here's My Nightmare On Elm Street Review...
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of those movies that gets progressively better and better as it runs along. At first it all appears like your typical cliché horror but eventually, by the near end of it, you've been hit over the head with an insanely explosive, unforgettable, and frantically aggressive finale. Wes Craven's original horror classic challenged the concept of a 'slasher killer' and introduced us to one of the most notorious icons ever: Freddy Kruger. The idea of a serial killer only having the ability to kill victims within their dreams is devilishly dexterous and might I add, effective. Additionally, some of the more dramatic moments-especially in argumental sequences involving Nancy and her mother-are actually quite efficient and add to the trauma of the film's present situation. The score is as overdone as it is vibrantly energetic and the horror kills have never been so ingenious! This movie however, certainly isn't without its flaws-whether it be the at times, mediocre acting or the cheap jump scares or the glaring plot-holes. It's still none of the less, a horror flick that never, ever gets tiresome. (Verdict: A-)",8,3,4,3 August 2018
Godzilla," One of the Most Satisfying Remakes of All Time
","Before I talk about anything about this movie I just have to say, Godzilla is the best giant monster/robot fighting in a city movie I have ever seen. Yes, it was better than Pacific Rim. Godzilla was definitely a must see movie this year. If you think its going to be like Godzilla (1998) then you our wrong, that movie was bad. This movie is just so awesome! Like in my other reviews I'm going to divide it up because I feel likedividing it up.Comparison from 1998 and the Original - Gozilla 1954 was one of the most famous classic movies of all time. And its a good movie especially for people who watched it in the 50s. Godzilla 1998 was bad and it basically ripped of every Jurassic Park Scene. Plus they made Godzilla look like a skinny, small dinosaur. This Godzilla is no doubt the best of them all. And if your like,'But the Classic ones are always the best,' well then your wrong. Because you have to admit you didn't fall asleep as much as you did in Gozilla's 1954. So I have to say this is the best Godzilla film I have ever seen.Characters - First character I am going to talk about is of course Godzilla. How they made Godzilla was exactly what I wanted him to look like. He looks pretty accurate to the classic Godzilla which is good not like 1998 where he looked like a horrible CGI dinosaur. They pot rayed Godzilla so well in this movie, its almost like you can really see him stopping around your city. So i am very satisfied with how they made Godzilla. Mothra was actually in this movie. Mothra is actually a old classic character to and it was really cool how they put her in it. Yes its a she because the creature was pregnant at the time of the movie. That character was portrayed very well too, kind of reminded me of Pacific Rim aliens for some reason. Bryan Cranston did a very good job making the audience have feelings for him, he seemed to be very into his character. The problem was that he wasn't in the movie a whole lot instead Aaron Taylor- Johnson was in it most of the movie. He didn't seem to catch the audiences attention as much as Bryan did but he did a pretty good job at being in the movie because he had to. Also Ken Watanabe, who was the scientist, wasn't that much of a main character, but he did a good job playing the scientist because he seemed to be so into Godzilla and knowing about him.Story - The story was a bit long in the beginning but overtime it makes you grow excitement and eagerness to see Godzilla beat the living lives out of city buildings and gigantic monsters and this eagerness makes you love Godzilla a lot once he finally appears on screen. Then overtime the story gets pretty good and the scenes get you pumped up and excited and its a fairly, pretty good plot. The story about the monsters are also really good too but you don't get a whole lot about the creatures origins. Scenes/Action Sequences - Again, best gigantic Robot/Monster fighting in a gigantic city scenes I have ever seen. I thought it was better scenes in Pacific Rim just because the robots were quite slow and it wasn't as exciting as watching the flying Mothras beat the you now what out of Godzilla. Godzilla is just such an iconic character you just can hate fight scenes with him in it. I can't spoil about the fight scenes but I wish I could because they are so amazing, but trust me, when you see this movie, you're are going to walk pout of the theater saying,'That was Freaking Awesome.' Mainly the action scenes were what made this movie so good. No its not like Pacific Rim were its a awesome dumb robot fighting movie, this is an emotional awesome monster fighting movie right here. The monsters actually pot rayed some emotions which was absolutely great! Yes, the monsters devoted some heart into the film which really helped make this more than a giant monster/robot fighting Pacific Rim movie. Even with the humans there was a lot of heart devoted into the film with them.Pros And Cons -Pros -Amazing Action Sequences Great Plot and Story Developing Suspense Great Characters Superb CGI Animation Cons -Bryan Cranston is in the movie to little Long BeginningOverall - Overall Godzilla was one of the greatest satisfactions in a movie remake I have ever seen, because movie remakes are never really that good. I am satisfied, and if your looking for a good action packed summer film Godzilla is your #1 option. (A)",7,12,25,19 May 2014

The Cabin in the Woods," HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS MOVIE?
","Give me one good reason not to give Drew Goddard's black-comedy horror flick Cabin in the Woods five stars. Yeah, that's what I thought. The first time you watch it, it's a profound and unforgettable trip of twists and turns like no other. On repeat viewings, it gets even crazier when you start noticing all the tad-bit easter eggs thrown into about every single frame of the film. The third act to this day, still features the nuttiest, most blown-out of proportions, most far-fetched finale I've ever witnessed, and probably will ever witness during my time on this here planet. Cabin in the Woods is the most unconventional conventional movie of all-time. Originality can't quite peak farther than this, especially within the horror genre. (Verdict: A)",8,9,14,7 October 2018

","Man, I've been putting off this space epic for WAY too long! Moon-a directorial debut that spotlights one of the crappiest movie posters I've ever seen-happens to be wildly creative from the dawn of its launch, till its emotive touchdown. This inventiveness is especially showcased when it comes to Sam Rockwell's 'solo performance'. It's (kind-of) the Cabin in the Woods of science-fiction with a hint of schmaltz.

Her," That's The Power Of Love
","Many may say that Her is the most accurate depiction of probable romantic relationships within the future, but I almost took this as a hidden depiction of even today's statements of love and what it is. The fanatics behind love, the expectations of love, the meaning behind love, the everlastingness of love, and the purpose of love. Joaquin Phoenix transcends into a completely different persona-as always-and plays a character that I think almost every human being can relate to at one point in their lives. This is a charmingly arranged romantic drama that encompasses realistically authentic, dystopian features, and it nearly brought me to a morbidly placid dysphoria.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Ladies and Gentlemen I Present To You...The Greatest Action Film In Over A Decade!
","Mad Max Fury Road is directed by George Miller starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult and is a continuation to the Mad Max series making this the 4th film. Ladies, Gentlemen, Mad Max Fury Road, was Mind-Blowing. I haven't seen such amazing action sequences in a movie since movies like the Indiana Jones Trilogy, Aliens, Die Hard, Terminator 1 and 2, Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2, and the Matrix! This movies action is unbelievably revolutionary and original that it will make you so pumped to see the movie again and again. Now what makes this movie feel so unique, and so action packed, is its beautiful shots and smooth paced action shots. The big plus is that most of the action in this film is made by practical effects! Lately we have been watching lots of movies with unbelievable amounts of CGI, which is not a bad thing in some ways. I enjoy CGI once and a while it can sometimes be amazing and sometimes terrible. I recently saw Avengers 2 which was full of CGI and I hugely enjoyed the film. But the practical effects in this film were by far better than any of the CGI effects ever released out in the Cinematic Universe! Characters - Tom Hardy plays Max who is a man mentally troubled by his past, trying to find a path of hope through a futuristic post apocalyptic deserted world. Tom Hardy as Max I felt was a really good cast, especially since Hardy has been doing hugely well in his career. I didn't though feel like his character wasn't too impressive, but he still did a great job as Max. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa a women who is trying to escape with a special group of (I won't spoil what) cargo. She was a really badass character in this films and was a surprising addition to the Mad Max Universe. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux who was honestly my favorite character in the film because I found him the most relatable too. Nux is a member of Immortan Joe's settlement known as The Citadel, but later tries to ally himself with Max and Furiosa. Nux is corrected man who believes that he is destined for something great. I felt Nux was the most emotionally touching character that you can truly care for. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe who is the main villain who I felt was a pretty badass villain in the film. He wasn't anything real special to the film, but I think he is a terrific addition to the Mad Max series.Plot - The plot is overall pretty simple. Furiosa is trying to get away from the settlement 'The Citadel' with a special cargo when she later runs into Max who doesn't know whether to ally with her, or not. While this occurs, warriors from the Citadel chase down Furiosa throughout a straight through action packed, consistent film. This movie is straight forward action, there's not a ton of dialogue but it works and leaves the audience drooling with 'Ahhh'.Score/Soundtrack - I'm not really big on listening to a musical score in a film, but in this film the score is so pumping and exhilarating, you can't help but notice it. Like in Indiana Jones, there is consistent music that just pumps you up and makes you really really excited. This film had that kind of score that can greatly improve your enjoyment for the film.Action Sequences/Special Effects - The action and effects in this film is what makes Mad Max Fury Road, Mad Max Fury Road. The action in this film is so well directed with smooth and beautifully paced camera-work. Amazing stunt work that just can't make you not geek up and get excited. There was a man with a electric guitar that shot out huge flames playing on a truck with huge surround sound. Tell me that's not awesome!!! The practical effects in the film made me so amazed. Every shot you saw in this film could be a humongous poster that you can put on the Movie Theater walls. Every shot you see you can look at with 'Wow' because its so beautiful and awesome! There's this one shot in particular that shows most of the vehicles lined up with a very mixed color sky background that was probably the most enjoyable landscape shot I have ever scene in a film. I am going to see this film in Theaters so many more times just to see the action in this film.Pros: -Great Casting -Fabulous Action Unlike Anything! -Amazing Effects -Great Casting -Motivating Original Score -Beautiful Landscape Shots -Interesting Narration -Very Unique to Many Action Films of TodayCons: -I COULDN'T FIND ANY!!!!!!!Guys, if you miss Mad Max Fury Road you will be missing out on the 2015 ride that you need for this year. It is by far the best film in over a decade and by far the best film so far and I will be quite surprised if this film beats any of my top films for 2015. Mad Max Fury Road Gets A: A+ 10/10",10,4,12,20 May 2015
The Social Network," 'I like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look so tough.'
","The Social Network, to this day, still encompasses, in my mind, possibly the most well-inscribed screenplay of all-time. Fincher and Sorkin have managed to make, seemingly, the most mundane anecdote into the most dramatic, prodigious, (loosely) based-on-a-true-story, cutthroat tale of the 21st Century.

Back to the Future," The Most Fun You Can Possibly Have From A Movie
","I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have money. But what I do have, are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long (but not really that long) career. Skills that make me a nightmare for the people like you. If you admit that it is absolutely splendid now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if it is true, that you despise the movie Back to the Future, I'll look for you, I'll find you and I'll educate you on the most likable movie ever conceived...

Princess Mononoke," Studio Ghibli Fest 2018
","I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)",10,6,7,22 July 2018
