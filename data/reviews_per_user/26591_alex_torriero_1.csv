Angels & Demons," Interesting concept and executed brilliantly!
","Unlike the much-hyped 'The Davinci Code' that I had entered the room, completely aware and ready to compare with to the book, this time I had the privilege of viewing Brown's 'Angels & Demons' with no more knowledge than the fact that it would be somehow related to Christianity. Put simply, I was 100% oblivious of what the movie was about - I just knew it was the follow up and that was anticipation enough.And I must say, I found it brilliant!!! The concept of answering the much debated Science and Religion controversy in conjunction with the abduction and execution of cardinals was indeed NEW and engaging. From the beginning, I was caught in suspense, and that suspense augmented as the plot thickened. Maybe it was because I had never read the book (thank 'God'), but nonetheless, it remains one film that I have not been able to forget about, and will ponder about for at least the next coming months.Well done Howard!",9,4,9,16 May 2009
