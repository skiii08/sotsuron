Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Classic Tarantino
","First i must say this is just classic Tarantino. There is little violence in this movie but the dialogue is what makes it. I'm also a big fan of Madsen so him just being in the movie made it great. It has classic characters such as the Pei Mea(SP?), Budd, Elle, and Bill. The story has been greatly improved upon since the first half. The silly blood spray that was in the first half is now gone, which is not a bad thing. Bill and the Brides past really is well done and makes you think Bill isnt really that bad of a person. If you ever are able to free up a few hours go see this movie right away. Thank You Tarantino for this wonderful masterpiece of a movie. I recommend this to everyone 10/10",10,1,2,16 April 2004
