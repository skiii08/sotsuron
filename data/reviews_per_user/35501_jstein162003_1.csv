The New World," One of the worst movies!
","The New World was a very bad movie. The acting was awful. The movie was so boring. It was the first time I wanted to walk out of a movie. The only good thing about this CRAP movie was the cinematography. By far one of the worst movies of all time. Colin Farrell is in the worst movies (S.W.A.T., Alexander, and Daredevil) and The New World is no exception. This movie was waist of film, time , and money. I give it a 1 out of 10. If I could give it a 0, I would. This movie was nothing like the trailer. If you have not see it and you are basing the movie on the trailer only, DO NOT SEE this movie at all. The movie is GOD awful. It is not ever worth seeing for free.",1,5,14,5 February 2006
