Skyfall," An old agent of M's comes back for revenge and his chase forces James Bond to use his old past to protect M.
","This movie is unlike any James Bond I have ever seen.That is both a good and bad quality for this film.The film starts out with a bang like any other typical Bond film, but then it slows down quite a bit. One can clearly tell that its director is from a darker, drama background rather than a high-octane Michael Bay resume. This is great news because it gives James Bond a much more human character than any previous movie. Bond actually feels like a man that can bleed, be scarred, be drunk, and get feeble. But this darker, more in-depth look at Bond and M comes at a price, and that price is pacing. This movie doesn't so much sprint and stops to catch its breath, but rather, it gently trots along and sprints every now and then. Most of the action is in the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. The entire middle section has sporadic action, but don't expect the usual Bond spectacle that we've all gotten used to. This is good in a way because it also doesn't get as ridiculous with the typical I-have-an-antimatter-satellite-in-space-made-out-of-gold Bond villain.Javier Bardem plays a fantastic villain with a very simple goal: kill M. His character required him to play a man that's bitter but also eccentric and genius. He gets it perfect. He makes playing the character effortless. Daniel Craig also plays a less secure Bond than he did in first two. He was confident and arrogant, which made him seem naive. His Bond in this film is much more mindful that he's a bit more frail than he lets others see. He is more vulnerable this time around, and Craig carries that over seamlessly. But lets not forget Judi Dench in this movie because this is the most we have ever seen M. The story is actually from her point of view, and she has the most screen time out of any Bond film. It's nice to finally see M show more emotion and depth past handing out briefings. She comes off as a flawed boss who is more callous than Bond originally thought, but he is loyal to her nonetheless.As a final note, the visuals in this movie are amazing. The colors and the compositions are of a true master director. Scaling landscape shots, saturated colors, silhouettes of fight scenes, and framing techniques make this film a treat for the eyes. The composition of shots stand out as startlingly interesting, and the color palette has a darker but saturated mood. This is a beautiful movie to watch. It is also physically darker than the rest, but I think that was a conscious choice by the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes.The script slowed down the action and excitement quite a bit to explore more depth and drama within Bond characters that we've never gotten a chance to see, but that drags the movie down at parts and you will definitely notice it. Don't go into this movie expecting the same kind of exciting action adventure Casino Royale brought to the table, but be prepared to have a slower feast that will probably leave you feeling more full at the end.I recommend you see it for the fantastic acting, amazing visuals, and character depth. Just remember to see it with an open mind for change in the Bond formula, and don't go for just pure action or a super engaging script.",7,0,5,9 November 2012
Dark Shadows," Barnabus Collins scorns a witch who loves him and she turns him into a vampire and destroys his family's fortune. He returns 200 years later to revitalize it all.
","I really do not understand why this movie is getting such a bad reputation.My theory is that people were expecting something that this film was not: they wanted it to be true film adaptation to the original soap opera source material, they wanted to see Nightmare Before Christmas 2, they wanted a dark horror movie, they wanted a hilarious fantasy comedy, or maybe they expected Batman Returns Again.If you watch this film with ANY expectations like the above, then you will be sorely disappointed. That is not to say that this film is bad because I actually love this film and think it's very, very good.Tim Burton is really at the top of his directing game here because this movie is actually a blend of silly comedy, dark fantasy, 70's period piece, and revenge. These are drastically different genres but Burton sews them together very smoothly. One scene will have Barnabus trying to 'fit in' to the 70's with silly results, and the next will be a blood- sucking murder of one of the characters. This movie has ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and somehow they all cohesively fit together without trying to kill each other for attention for the audience.You can also tell that the script has been polished and fine-tuned to a brilliant level. I never once got tired of action or tired of the drama because Burton and his writers spaced things out and paced the movie very well. You never feel rushed to the end of the movie or dragged slowly through the mud; this film changes the pace accordingly to the ultimate climax at the end.Of course none of this would work out if you didn't believe in the film's main character Barnabus Collins. Johnny Depp anchors this film with his truly amazing acting. If you reread his lines in this movie, you will know that a lesser actor will have audiences laughing at the ridiculousness of his words. I always thought Depp was good in general, but I am not a huge obsessive Depp fan. But he deserves high praise here because you can tell he takes his craft very seriously and it pays off. Depp plays Barnabus very straight-faced with no theatrical 'wink' to the audience; he reads his lines as if he really were an 18th century merchant who turned into a vampire and has resurrected in 1972. Equally important in this acting category is Eva Green, who plays Barnabus' former lover and the witch who turned him. Her character is more 'out there' in terms of villains and she needed to act with the appropriate grandiose bad guy and obsessive-ex-girlfriend levels at the same time. She is fantastic here because she shows vulnerability as an ex who wants Barnabus back but also a cut-throat businesswoman out to destroy him. Oh yeah, I forgot she also has to play a villainous witch on top of those two qualities. She shines and plays a great counterpart to Depp.In this movie, I found myself laughing, curious, and creeped out at the various times. I also came into this movie expecting nothing more than to be entertained, and it delivered more than that. I know Burton has a history of doing certain types of movies, but please don't go in expecting this and that. You have very polished and solid writing, very good acting, and silly comedic reliefs throughout the film. Just open your minds and go on a fun ride because this movie will surely keep you entertained if you don't label it beforehand.",9,2,4,10 November 2012
