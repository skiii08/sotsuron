Requiem for a Dream," Give Ellen Burstyn The Oscar Now!
","I never thought I'd see a performance to equal(if not surpass) Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Reese Witherspoon in 'Election' so soon, but Ellen Burstyn has done it here.  Her 'reason to get up in the morning' monologue is one of the most powerful 3-4 minutes in film history.This is a very harrowing story about drug addiction, and not for everyone. David Aronofsky shows he can make the leap from small budget films and can handle dark material without being exploitive or glamorizing(although some of the editing and visual effects are borderline in this regard).  Great cameos from Paul Gullette and Keith David.Based on a novel by the author of 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' so you should be prepared; there are no laughs, like in 'Leaving Las Vegas' or 'Trainspotting'.  The editing and visual effects are much better than the repulsive 'Natural Born Killers'(though again, borderline cutesy and repititive).  Great score by The Kronos Quartet.If you liked BDC, LETB, LLV, T'ing, Bad Lt. and Drugstore Cowboy, go see this.  Both RFAD and Christiane F. should be mandatory viewing for Jr. high students, but our govt would rather have a 'War On Drugs' and 'Just Say No'. Pathetic and tragic.Note to reviewer below; Burstyn was not in 'Cuckoo's Nest'(that was Louise Fletcher); she was in 'The Exorcist'.See Christiane F.(subtitled version if possible) if you liked this.Jennifer Connelly is the most beautiful woman in the world, period.",9,0,0,24 December 2000
