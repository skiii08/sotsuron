Mission: Impossible III," Missing Inpuddle
","This movie sucked. It was even boring except for a few minutes. It is better than MI-1 however, in which Mr. Phelps is killed off and is revealed as a villain. Come on! Mr. Phelps a villain? That still leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I sit down to this boring movie. Acting is good. Hoffman a genius. Cruise is winsome. Plot doesn't hang together. Camera work is the worst I can remember for a big budget movie. Love story between Cruise and his wife dragged it down. Only descent parts were from the Vatican in Rome. Bad bad movie. Dumbest part was the twist in which the director turns out NOT to be a turncoat. Movie attempts to be funny when team discussses Cruise's (Hunt's) marrying his girlfriend during the time they are setting up their un-clever stunts. All this really does is highlight how unbelievable the movie is. I felt sorry for the Chinese people Cruise murders in the building in which he steals the McGuffin (sp?), that is the rabbits foot, that is the unidentified bio-weapon he is stealing. This movie will not go over well with Chinese people.",3,7,21,6 May 2006
