Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I was totally blown away.
","When I first saw The Phantom Menace, (12:01 a.m., May 19, 1999)I was totally blown away by the entire experience.  While I had tried to stay away from the reviews, I'd heard enough about them to go in with lowered expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the critics were either wrong... or just didn't get it.  The Phantom Menace is a movie to experience, to enjoy, to have fun.  Even after seeing it a fourth time, I'm still amazed at the complexity of every scene... there's always something I didn't notice before.I can hardly wait for the next episode.",10,5,7,7 June 1999
