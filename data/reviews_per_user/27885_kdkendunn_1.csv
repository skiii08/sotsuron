The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Jennifer Lawence: A 10 of 10 Star Performance
","As a stand alone movie, Part 1 is a good movie made great by Jennifer Lawrence. HOWEVER, as part of an epic that began when Katniss volunteers to be a tribute, to her ultimate destiny, this is a GREAT MOVIE. If you are a Hunger Games fan, disregard any criticism or shortcomings written by movie critics. Mockingjay 1 is a delicious appetizer that is the bridge to what will be, undoubtedly, the culmination of the greatest, most prescient movie(and books)of the dystopian genre. Kudos and praise to Suzanne Collins. But it is Jennifer Lawrence who transforms Suzanne Collin's Katniss Everdeen into the greatest female leading role in the history of movies. (And, to add, which male leading role surpasses Jennifer Lawrence's stellar performance in what will be 4 movies)'My,oh my', to use a phrase that Caesar Flickerman once said to Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence may become, blossom into, the greatest American actress in the history of cinema. I've seen the greatest of the greats during my 60+ years: Meryl Strep, Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Betty Davis, Audrey Hepburn, etc. In life, we often look back and only then realize that we witnessed greatness. Be grateful and appreciate the fact that right now, at this time in your life, you are witnessing greatness in the performance of Jennifer Lawrence.",10,21,59,21 November 2014
