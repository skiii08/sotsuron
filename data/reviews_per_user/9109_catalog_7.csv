The Blair Witch Project," Truly Chilling
","This is the first movie in a long time to actually scare me.  Any movie can go for cheap scares with things that jump out at you (Haunting remake), but thankfully Blair Witch doesn't do that.  Instead, it created tension by NOT showing you what is terrorizing the main characters, and letting your imagination do the work. I found all of the actors very convincing, and the point-of-view camera work really puts you into the action.  The last sequence, with its chilling final shot, is unequaled in all of movie history. This is truly a landmark film, something that must be seen in the theater, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.",9,1,1,9 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Smartest and Funniest Comedy of 1999
","South Park: B, L & U is like a giant middle finger being flipped in the direction of the MPAA Ratings Board.  That's what I loved about this movie: it points out the absurdity of the MPAA while entertaining you at the same time.  The U.S. declares was on Canada.  It's a musical.  What more could you want?Seriously, South Park is one of the best movies of the year.  It takes all of the crudeness of the television series, turns it up about six notches, and delivers a thrill-ride of foul language, crude sex, and fourth graders out to save the world.  Although it does have a huge amount of gross-out humor, it always feels savvy and satirical, and doesn't come off as cheap.I went to this movie expecting a big screen version of the TV show, but instead I got a full-blown musical.  All of the songs are funny, and they are directly aimed at the Disney animated musicals of recent years.  Satan sings a song called 'Up There' that mocks the Little Mermaid perfectly.  All this makes it one of only two musicals that I can stand to watch (Blues Brothers being the other).For adults who can stomach the foul language and general crudeness of the TV show, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut comes highly recommended.",9,0,0,29 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The best movie I have ever seen
","Saving Private Ryan is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  Period.  Show me another movie that starts off with the most intense thirty minutes ever put on film.  Show me another movie that entertains me for another two hours after that opening sequence.  If you show me that, I'll show you some ocean-front property in Wisconsin.  I have seen this movie several times now, and it never fails to move me.  The only thing I could possibly complain about is the sappy Grandpa frame story.  It is completely unnecessary and contradicts the rest of the movie. But if that's all I've got to complain about, that's okay.Spielberg has made THE masterpiece.  But then again, every movie he makes should be a masterpiece.  No one else has the funds or the creative freedom that he does.  He should never, ever make a bad movie.  Give me $100 million and free reign from the censors and I'll give you a watchable movie.  Give it to Spielberg, and he'll give you Saving Private Ryan...or Hook (shudder). Let's hope the Hook days are behind us.",10,0,1,8 November 1999
The Insider," Epic Drama
","The Insider is a fascinating look at the story of Jeffrey Wigand and how he revealed to the world that tobacco companies were lying about cigarettes. Russell Crowe gives a very good performance as Wigand, and you feel sorry for Wigand because he has sacrificed his career, family, and good name for a cause he believed in.What keeps this two and a half hour epic from becoming boring is the quality of the acting throughout the picture.  Even the least important characters are played well, except for that annoying Pepsi girl who plays one of Wigand's daughters.  I couldn't watch her on screen without wanting to punch her in the face for those stupid commercials.  But I digress.Al Pacino gives an amazingly understated performance as the producer of 60 Minutes who gets Wigand's story on the air.  After Mann's last collaboration with the actor on Heat, I expected a little more over-acting, but was pleasantly surprised.The only fault of the movie is that it does run a bit long.  Unnecessary scenes could have been cut to bring the run-time down, but it's obvious that Michael Mann believes in this material.  In the end, The Insider is an involving movie that patient viewers will not be disappointed with.",8,0,0,8 November 1999
The Iron Giant," Great for Kids and Adults
","Why was this movie a flop in theaters?  Probably because there wasn't a complete toy line, collectible card game, and Burger King tie-in to coincide with the release.  It's really unfortunate too, because The Iron Giant is one of the few movies of recent years that is great for kids.Blending traditional cel animation with a completely digital character (the Giant), this movie is a feast for the eyes.  The story, while simple, contains so many levels that both children and adults will find something of interest.  Children will react to the story of a small boy with a robot for a pal, while adults will see how the movie mocks the Cold War paranoia of the 50's.There are no musical numbers.  There are no talking bears or raccoons.  Just a good story that is backed up with excellent animation and a big heart. This movie is one of the best animated movies of the decade, and hopefully audiences will discover it on video.",8,0,1,2 December 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good Ideas, Poor Execution
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the original horror movies. It contains some genuinely creepy moments, but looking at it now, it does show its age. It is a landmark film that helped usher in the 'slasher age', but that doesn't make it a good movie.The whole concept of a monster that kills people in their dreams is a wonderfully original idea, it's only too bad that the execution is less than stellar. Wes Craven was still in his directorial infancy here, and it shows. The terrible acting doesn't help matters, but the characters really don't have anything interesting to say, either. The ending drags the film down further by not giving the film a conclusion of any kind.What's good about the picture is Freddy. Here he is a monster, plain and simple. No one-liners, just a cold-blooded killer out for revenge.In short, this is a good movie from a historical perspective. Obviously, the concept of the series is sound in order to carry through six sequels, but the direction and poor acting drag down this particular effort.",6,14,23,23 November 1999
The Matrix," Quality Filmmaking
","When I first saw the trailers for The Matrix, I had visions of Johnny Mnemonic 2.  Fortunately this is not the case.  While not being terribly original, The Matrix is a movie with interesting ideas, spectacular FX, and stunning action sequences.  The Wachowski Bros. have quickly risen to the ranks of the best action directors, showing an eye for detail and quality that is on par with James Cameron.I despise Keanu Reeves with every fiber of my being.  That is why I am surprised by how much I like this movie.  The rest of the cast does an admirable job in the acting department, and helps Reeves maintain a screen persona that does not make you want to throw up.The Matrix is exciting, intelligent, beautiful, and one of the most entertaining movies of the last few years.",9,0,0,21 September 1999
