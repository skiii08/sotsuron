It," 'Hi Georgie, would you like a balloon?'
","From the insane mind of Stephen King comes IT, which was originally a novel from 1986, than the 1990 mini-series starring Tim Curry that everyone know's, to the long anticipated R-Rated feature film that was released September 9, 2017. The film explores what the mini- series couldn't do, with a more expanded story-line and more dark humor that is like the comic relief besides Richie, also the fact that in the background you see Tim Burton's 1989 Batman is playing at the movie theater. That's pretty cool how they included that I think also how they kept true to the novel and the mini-series is important to me as it show's consistency work's in this situation, while obvious changes were made for good reason's. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise was amazing as it introduced a new, next generation, creepy clown. And the balloon's were good but used a little bit too much as in the beginning they were good by the end it was okay. The acting was solid with the kid'shaving actual lines that kids nowadays would use (authentic). Andy Muschietti directing and his wife Barbara Exutive Producer P.G.A., a ton of writer's and Stephen King's seal of approval make this a fine film to watch not only for it's reputation but to enjoy.",7,1,1,28 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," 'Yes!! We know each other from work'
","Marvel yet again has pulled off another fantastic movie as Thor: Ragnarok is full of action, strong acting, a clever script, and yes comedy. We finally find out what happened to Hulk after The Avengers: Age of Ultron. With the directing of Taika Waititi joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he pull's off a minor cameo of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Steven Strange, connecting it to the post credit scene in last year's Doctor Strange. The special effect's are excellent as the effect's were done right not rushed. Jeff Goldblum also joins the MCU as the Grandmaster the leader of the planet Thor get's sent to where he battles The Hulk. Jeff Goldblum's performance was solid, as he was seen as funny and idiotic. Stan Lee makes a minor cameo as he always does in Marvel movies, but this one made me laugh for a while. This Thor might have been the best of the Thor movies, as Thor's full power's are shown. The movie show's how he doesn't need the hammer, but without it he show's he deserves the title The God Of Thunder. Loki's up to no good as usual you think you can trust him but there he goes causing trouble and making you think he finally changed for the better but he's still The God Of Mischief, but this time Loki doesn't think about the consequences of his idiotic action's as Thor can see through his trouble. Thinking deep inside Loki's a good person. The movie doesn't get boring as it will entertain the viewer who's watching it. Marvel movie's take a lot of time, effort, and planning. Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost who were the producers of the movie wasted no time making this movie what it is. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor as he's built like Thor, his acting will cement him as Thor forever as he makes you feel like Marvel cast the right man for the job back in 2010. Cate Blanchett's Hela/ Goddess of Death will give you goosebumps, she's the ultimate villain for Thor to face matching his strength. She beats Thor at the beginning take control of Asgard, and about to launch chaos/war in Asgard. But Thor takes her down, with the help of Surtur who was created from CGI, Hulk, and Valkyrie who was once part of an army of women who protected Asgard but becomes a booze-addled buffoon who remember's who she is and fight's next to Thor. Tessa Thompson did a great job as Valkyrie by acting like she was the character convincing the audience she took the effort to learn the character's history comic book history. The story sync's together as it doesn't leave any controversies after watching the film. Creating the soundtrack to make you feel like it also add's to the story and the mood of the scene. Thor: Ragnarok will always be remembered as the movie where you see Thor's full potential and the long awaited battle between The Hulk and Thor and Thor becoming the King of Asgard and the 80's music is good as it oddly fits.",8,1,8,10 November 2017
The Terminator," 'I'll Be Back'
","Before The Terminator, James Cameron wasn't to well known as he had previously done Piranha 2: The Spawning, which received negative reviews from critics and audiences. But that led him to The Terminator, it started off as he was having a dream about being chased by a killer cyborg while he was on directing the Piranha sequel although he'd been bed ridden because he got sick from the food poisoning. Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a body builder not really an actor. Originally Schwarzenegger wanted to play Kyle Reese the man sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner. But it ultimately went to Michael Biehn. This is for the best as Schwarzenegger's terminated is known now to be one of the best movie villain's of all times. James Cameron originally plan was to only have one movie but the success critically and commercially led to four sequels (one of which he directs). The visual effect's for the movie are amazing as for the time of the initial release no one had ever seen anything like it making James Cameron a legitimate filmmaker in Hollywood. The acting is strong and is easy to follow, the ending of the movie is what you wouldn't expect leaving you with hope. If you thought this is another low-budget crappy sci-fi thriller you'd be wrong as this movie launched James Cameron's career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton's and with Bill Paxton's cameo. With James Cameron's direction the film is what it is today a classic that never get's old.",8,3,3,28 October 2017
Justice League," It was okay
","Justice League was okay,nit was a step up from Batman V Superman.The movie's cinematography was good as each shot was fit into the movie. Not just thrown in there randomly. With the action sequences and shots done by Fabian Wagner, who previously did cinematography for Game of Thrones from 2014 to 2016, also he did cinematography for Starz's DaVinci's Demons, and recently 2015's Victor Frankenstein which starred Daniel Radcliffe as Igor and James McAvory as Victor Frankenstein. Zack Snyder directed this movie and wrote the story with Chris Terrio. Zack Snyder previously directed 2004's Dawn of the Dead, 2006's 300, 2009's Watchmen, and 2013's Man of Steel and 2016's Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice. His movies may not be great but are entertaining and fun to watch. He was producer for Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman. He wrote the story for Wonder Woman and that was a good movie because of Patty Jenkins directing. And a clever script. Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay along with Chris Terrio and with them working together on the script it was okay as it didn't fully add up the story felt rushed a bit as it wasn't properly planned out like what Marvel did, but still a movie like this there's gonna be things that don't add up.Ben Affleck was executive producer for the film and also was Batman,Christopher Nolan was also a producer he directed/ wrote/ and produced two of the three The Dark knight films and this year's blockbuster Dunkirk, his movie's take time and effort and so did Justice League as the money was well spent despite the movie not being critically acclaimed and sagging a bit in its storyline as the character's weren't developed as two of the Justice League character's movie's haven't came out yet, but with Jason Momoa's Aquaman and Ezra Miller's Flash these two character's felt like they were good for their characters. Henry Cavill came later in the movie but when he came on the screen the movie was reaching the climax. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was great how she introduced her character in Wonder Woman with such emotion and enthusiasm. Overall the movie was fine but is one of the better movie's directed by Zack Snyder despite it's plot holes and not to much character development",6,0,0,12 December 2017
The Thing," New in sci fi
","John Carpenter's The Thing was released in 1982 to initial negative reviews from critics and audiences alike but over the years people now understand this film has led to new alien sci fi movies that have proved to be successful because 1982s The Thing started it. The film's intensity and suspense will keep the viewer hooked on the film. The practical effects for the time were great as over time CGI took over but before CGI John Carpenter proved that practical effects can work for a budget of 10 million dollars. From the success from 1978's Halloween John Carpenter was able to make 1980s The Fog, 1981;s Escape from New York, and of course The Thing. You know what all these movies have in common they're all movie classics. John Carpenter's careful direction and patience led to a masterpiece, as so did as six years later another John Carpenter classic was released, 1988's They Live. But none the less The Thing's lead actor Kurt Russell is a classic boss and not a clich√©. The film's ending will keep you guessing what just happened but you'll understand the ending after you watch it. Nonetheless this movie is an all time classic and I urge anyone to watch it if they have not seen it.",6,0,1,2 December 2017
Caddyshack," Oh the 80s
","Caddyshack started out as a National Lampoon's Animal House-like movie. Caddyshack has so many classic scenes like the pool scenes, the 'hey everybody we're all gonna get laid' scene, and the gopher.Harold Ramis made his directorial debut also co-writing the film with Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) and with Douglas Kenney. Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney both were writers for National Lampoon's Animal House. They had based the character of Danny Noonan and his family on the famous Murray family, and when creating the character Ty Webb, they had one person in mind for the job and they also semi-based it off him Chevy Chase. The movie at the time was the movie with the most crude humor, but that humor is now part of cinematic history along with Cindy Morgan who played 'the hot chick' That every guy wants. Caddyshack established Rodney Dangerfield's acting career as before he did some stand-up comedy. But over the years people still remember his quote, 'Oh, this is the worst-looking hat I ever saw. What, when you buy a hat like this I bet you get a free bowl of soup, huh?' As he played Al Czervik whose the obnoxious but lovable newcomer to the club. Bill Murray also largely contributed to the movie as the infamous Carl Spuckler, who in the sub-plot of the movie, is ordered by his Scottish boss to kill all the gopher's on the golf course. Bill Murray's character will make you start laughing from the beginning. Michael O'Keefe star's as the young Danny Noonan who is a teenager planing to go to college but can't afford it and is a caddie at the country club.",10,2,4,28 October 2017
Pulp Fiction," 'Ah man, I shot Marvin in the face.'
","Everybody know's this movie one way or another, with the famous dance scene between John Travolta as Vincent Vega and Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, to the minor cameo of Steve Buscemi as their waiter, Bruce Willis (Butch Coolidge) as the boxer who fight's the gimp and saves Ving Rhames as the crime boss Marsellus and a handful of other well-known actors. Samuel L. Jackson star's as the preacher hit-man partner of Vincent as Jules who has his own plan's for his future. But the one thing I love about this movie is it's not like any other Quentin Tarantino movie I've seen, this movie isn't in chronologically order as the beginning start's with the end, after that it goes to the beginning, than starts another story all these stories intertwine with each other. The dialogue for the movie is perfect for the actor's portraying the character's. The drug effect's for the movie all great you'll feel like your right there in the scenes when the character's indulge in drugs. Quentin Tarantino fits: crime, drama, thriller, action, and dark comedy. Yes that's right I said dark comedy, Mr. Tarantino pulled it all off, with a budget of $8,000,000. Quentin Tarantino makes a minor cameo as Jimmy as he help's Jules and Vincent with their situation. Harvey Keitel portray's the Wolff who's 'the guy who will fix your problem's no matter what it is' I couldn't imagine another actor portraying this character than Keitel did. Roger Avary co-wrote the stories with Tarantino they had previously worked together on Reservoir Dogs, also Tarantino directed and wrote, with Keitel co- produced. With the love-hate running gag about what's in the briefcase and Tarantino's constant clues that imply what's in the briefcase. The movie will entertain you throughout as the comedy eases the unusual situations",7,0,2,29 October 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 'Welcome to the freaking guardians of the galaxy'
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 proves that high expectations with marvel are successful but major sequels and marvel are a phenomenon with a Baby Groot dancing, the reveal of Star Lords dad, and a comedy that feels like Deadpool, but for kids. The special effects are amazing, while the ending is emotional, while the credits roll you will forget about the sad scenes and start laughing hysterically",7,1,3,5 May 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," murder on a train type of deal with Johnny Depp
","Murder On the Orient Express seemed to be exciting and with a clever plot in the trailer. Kenneth Branagh starring as the detective, with a murder on the train and everyone is a suspect. The film tries to recapture the mystery drama and the element of the train into that genre. But the story felt a little sloppy as by the end of the movie you try to piece together the clues to see if they add up. Kenneth Branaghs acted brilliantly as the lead role of the film, but the can't save the film from it's plot-holes and rough script. The movie's reveal of the killer isn't what you'd expect, some may like it, other may not. But with Daisy Ridley's performance, Willem Dafoe's, Michelle Pfeiffer's and Penelope Cruz's the film was entertaining but wasn't expected from the source material of the novel it's based on. Kenneth Branaugh's directing and producing wasn't what it was when he directed Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Macbeth, and Cinderella. Also he was producer of Thor: The Dark World. Michael Green wrote the screenplay for the movie previously he did Green Lantern back in 2011, this year's Blade runner 2049, Alien Covenant and Logan. With a resume like that and improving himself from the boring script of Green Lantern you'd think the script would be smooth but not so much. Overall the film has it's problem's it really come's down to opinion.",5,1,2,25 November 2017
Scream," 'What's your favorite scary movie?'
","Wes Craven bring's back the horror/thriller/slasher and adding the mystery genre to make Scream. The director of A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Hill's Have Eyes 1 and 2, Swamp Thing, and another installment of A Nightmare On Elm Street called New Nightmare. All these before Scream, but the slasher genre wasn't doing so great, but Wes Craven worked his movie magic and with his directing came Scream, a movie about teenager's in a small fictional town called Woodsboro, California, who are being stalked by a mysterious killer, it could be anyone? That's one of the hook's to see this movie another one is the new faces introduced to film: Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and more. Also with familiar faces of Courtney Cox, David Arquette,Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. This movie bring's the modern day teen's into the world of horror. As with partying and acting like teen's in the 1990's. With the shocking, but obviously reveal of the killer make's the movie clues about the killer actually make sense. Kevin WIlliamson's script make's this movie a cult classic along with Wes Craven's directing. And with Bob and Harvey Weinstein executive producing the movie with their movie production company Dimension Films. And now GhostFace is now part of cinematic history and his famous phone call's before he 'slices and dices' his victims. Almost 21 year's later it is still very influential with how it's filmmaking.",7,1,1,28 October 2017
Straight Outta Compton," The beginning of gangsta rap
","In F. Gary Gray's docudrama biopic, Straight Outta Compton, it tell's the story how six men from Compton, California (Eazy-E (singer), Ice Cube (songwriter, singer), Dr.Dre (DJ), DJ Yella (backup vocals), MC Ren (backup vocals), and The D.O.C. (backup vocals)) rose to fame their debuting album Straight Outta Compton by their band N.W.A. previously they all worked together on the hit- single Boyz In Da Hood by Eazy- E. After Boyz In Da Hood blow up, Eazy-E met with music manager Jerry Heller who was played by Paul Giamatti who I think did a great job playing the manager. Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr. play's his father in the movie and does a good job at it acting like his old man and capturing his charm, eventually the manager Jerry doesn't pay Ice Cube the money he deserves and the legal representation to sign a record contract. So Cube leaves the group and start's his own music label and becomes a film actor starring in Boyz N the Hood and also becoming a film writer for the 1995 movie Friday and the film show's both these event's. Before Ice Cube splits the group their controversial song f the police show's the crew getting arrested and fighting for their freedom of speech. Leading to other rapper's basing their material to what N.W.A. did. Dr. Dre would leave and would discover Snoop Dogg, Tupac, 50 Cent, and Eminem which I personally loved how they introduced them. N.W.A. would now just be Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, Eazy-E now finally realizes that Jerry was screwing him over from the beginning and Dre and Cube were trying to tell him but he didn't listen, he tries to reunite N.W.A. without Jerry being involved which I think is pretty cool, he reconciles with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but find's out he has HIV/AIDS dying shortly after he's diagnosed causing the group to grieve, but people will always remember him, finally Dr. Dre leaves Death Row Records because Suge Knight wasn't fair to him and starts his own label Aftermath which becomes very successful. The music for the movie was perfect, what wasn't was they never explained what happened to Jerry Heller after he was fired by Eazy-E. N.W.A. led a movement of modern day rap to let it be what it is, N.W.A. wasn't afraid to have changes in music which is what's great about the group.",8,1,6,28 October 2017
Deadpool," 1 Word Fantastic
","Deadpool is a classic. One of the highest grossing movies ever, it will be one for the ages. Telling the origin story of Wade W. Wilson, a mercenary turned anti-hero, who uses his raunchy and off-color humor along with his fourth-wall breaking.If there's an R-Rated movie that's hilarious and action packed than you should definitely watch it.It's also sort-off a love story too because Deadpool has to safe his fianc√©, Vanessa. From the evil scientist Francis 'Ajax', who tortured Wade Wilson in the Weapon X Program to cure is Cancer. Wade gets rid of his Cancer but he becomes horribly disfigured causing him to wear the red costume, and dub the name Deadpool.",10,1,5,18 September 2016
Goodfellas," Almost 30 years later and still one of the best movies
","Goodfellas has it all a solid story, terrific actors, and music to help fit with the mood, help make it one of the greatest movies of all time. With the viewer actually feeling bad for these bad people. As you see Ray Liotta's character enters a world of luxury, he sees the downside of what that life has on him and his family. This movie is definitely a home-run for Martin Scorsese. Especially this film will keep you entertained until the end and will answer all your questions. For a terrific performance,Joe Pesci earned himself an Oscar award for his supporting rule as Tommy DeVito, who is a psychopath you come to like by the end of the movie as he meets a fatal death. Martin Scorsese gives you twists and turns that will make you keep watching this movie over and over again",10,0,0,28 January 2017
