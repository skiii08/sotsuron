Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," much more depressing than funny!
","is this a comedy? sure, it has it's funny moments, but overall it is a rather depressing mirror for the dominating culture on this planet at this point in time. i would categorize it as something between a drama and a documentary.anybody who knows contemporary USA (i spent many years in USA and with Americans outside of USA) will immediately recognize the accuracy of the mirror cohen holds up in front of us.USA is probably the most sick and sickening society and 'culture' on this planet today. the ruling emotion in the American psyche is fear - deep-routed, overwhelming fear. and the dominating force in that country (the disgusting dictatorship of big money) is exploiting that fear every which way it can. mind you, i am talking about the overall American psyche. this is not a racist statement. i know many really good human beings in USA, thoughtful people who have not lost their humanity to the 'American way of life'. but the American psyche as an entity is just sick and sickening and infecting the rest of this planet.and that is exactly what cohen is showing. and he shows it with a clarity that i find more depressing than anything else. i find it hard to laugh about really sick people.but hey, don't take my word for it. go and see this movie. it certainly is not a waste of time.",6,0,4,11 December 2006
The Departed," terrible overacting, heartless
","orlando jones once said: 'Someone I met years ago explained to me the difference between a personality and an actor, a personality being Eddie Murphy or Roseanne Barr, and an actor being Morgan Freeman and Alfre Woodard or Marlon Brando. And in the shrinking world of sound bites, the Internet, and other mass media, there were going to be fewer actors and more personalities.' (From PopMatters interview, 2000)if you apply this to 'the departed', you'll see that there are hardly any actors in this soulless and empty piece of Hollywood entertainment.granted, the craftsmanship of scorsese is evident and made me sit through the 140 minutes of this film.is it a masterpiece as some here said? definitely not! art is supposed to make you think or feel on a higher level. this film does nothing of the kind. it leaves you empty because it is without any heart or soul.as for the acting: dicaprio's performance was just embarrassing. terrible overacting! i couldn't believe it.matt damon was as he usually is. this guy just cannot act. period. he's a good-looking 'personality', but not an actor by any stretch. he often compensates by overacting.same goes for wahlberg. emberassing overacting. who hired that guy?sheen was decent. he is an actor.i was surprised by jack nicholson, however. he has never really been an actor but a very interesting personality. but there are scenes in this film where he actually acts well! seems he took some acting lessons in his old days.the plot was very convoluted in the setup but got more streamlined in later parts.this was not a good movie by any means and certainly no masterpiece. just another piece of empty, soul- and heartless Hollywood 'entertainment'4 out of 10 for scorsese's craftsmanship.",4,0,1,2 December 2006
