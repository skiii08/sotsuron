Walk the Line," Good Movie
","This movie is excellent, whether you like Johnny and June, or not. This is just good film making. It makes Johnny Cash's rocky career accessible to the common man, while at the same time allowing for his fans to get a few glimpses of him that are hard to see without a lot of money spent on a huge collection of DVD's and books.Reese Witherspoon does not sound as much like June as Joaquin sounds like Johnny, but performs well nonetheless. Joaquin even gets the growth of the gravel baritone by slowly building the voice from the beginning of the movie to the end. His portrayal of the first audition with the higher, less confident voice set up the rest of the movie very well.The clincher for me was Folsom Prison, when Joaquin used Johnny's rifle shot guitar playing movement. That said it all. Great movie.",9,0,1,1 December 2005
