Catch Me If You Can," Great movie
","Maybe a bit long, but really fascinating story and good acting.",Null,1,2,18 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not my thing
","It's well done and spectacular, but I couldn't really get into the story. All these beings, monsters, etc. made it difficult to focus. Well, it's just no my taste, I guess.",Null,0,0,18 January 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Enjoy the ride
","Spectacular movie, nice stunts. Just what you need to relax after a hard day. Hard day? Not really.... THEY are having a hard day 😊🤣👍.",Null,1,1,17 April 2020
