Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest adventure movie of all times.
","Raiders of the lost Ark is, to me, where the minds and hands of Spielberg, Lucas and Kasdan peaked, and never quite succeeded to get even close to this high ever again. The movie simply hits every point, the characters are fully developed (for an adventure movie of course, it's no cinéma vérité), the plot is interesting and the visual effects are just the best you could get back then. Not to speak about the actors, Ford is just perfect as Indiana Jones (and that's why he will always be Indy for the rest of his career), Karen Allen was a strong actress and the supporting roles really work as friends or baddies. Comparisions with the two sequels are hard, this one is way too much better filmed, written and acted. The latest, useless installment is not even a challenge to me, being the lowest point of the Lucas-Spielberg franchise, and the gravestone of the great late Indy character. In the end, even if you don't like the genre this film is good entertainment for two hours.",10,2,4,30 September 2008
Chinatown," One of the best noir thriller ever
","I watched this movie recently for the first time and I'm 26 (I know, shame on me). I didn't know anything about it and didn't even read the cover of the DVD, so it came as a surprise to me. Well, it's an amazing thriller with very good acting all along. First of all, Jack Nicholson portraits a great character, very different from the types we got used to see him playing later on. John Houston is also very believable in a role that could have easily turned into a stereotype. The LA setting in the '30s is very suggestive, and Polanski's direction follows the story with a objective eye that suits the film perfectly. I recommend this masterpiece to anyone who likes good cinema.",9,3,5,3 March 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Would make a good tourist ad
","I just have to say, I currently live in Catalunia. And I'm a bit fed up with all the Catalan nationalism I'm surrounded by. But this hasn't much to do with the film, actually there's hardly anything 'Catalan' in the it, only the fact that Cristina is studying 'Catalan identity' just because she likes Gaudí (quite absurd, I like Mondrian but I'm not gonna study dutch identity because of that!). The whole movie looks more like a 'visit Spain!' ad than anything else, the scenes in Oviedo are merely a touristic walk with all the Spanish stereotypes you can think of, Spanish guitars and all. The actors are good, but they struggle to make believable a script that is preposterous and ridiculous, especially Penelope Cruz has the worst character of her carrier. Allen seems to have lost not only his touch, but also common sense, putting films like this (or Cassandra's Dream) in his CV. It seems like he has to change city every 5-6 years to give some fresh air to the same old plots he has. For the ones who don't know, the film is set in Barcelona only because the government paid good money for it, otherwise it would have been somewhere else. It's just so hard to me to believe he is the same director of Manhattan.",4,22,39,1 February 2009
