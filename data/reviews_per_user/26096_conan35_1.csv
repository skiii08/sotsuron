Mission: Impossible III," M:I:3 the best yet!
","This was the best of the franchise. If J.J.Abrams stay on board, this could rival the Bond franchise! Cruise is a super spy, we need to see him do this kind of action more often. I wish we could see more of Ving Rhames, he has a present on the big screen, that you can not ignore. Also it was good to see the big man as the tech expert and not the muscle. Owen Davian, (Philip S.Hoffman), is a villain you love to hate. The talk between Owen and Ethan on the plane was awesome! He needs to be in M:I:4. Musgrave, (Billy Crudup), made for a very good plot twist. The trusted friend turned bad ... as pointed out by Ethan to Julia, how important trust is to him. Another fun part is when Ethan is explaining to Julia about using a gun ... 'it's just point & shoot' To bad Keri Russell is dead, she was interesting as an agent of IMF. Another character that needs to come back is the tech guy, who helps Ethan find his wife via the cell phone.",8,0,1,8 May 2006
