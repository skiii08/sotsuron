Vertigo," Olive oil on rubber plant leaves
","'Vertigo' (1958, Alfred Hitchcock﻿), deserves its reputation as the greatest American film ever made. Despite its ridiculously far-fetched story, it mesmerizes even after dozens of screenings. As great as Hitchcock's form is here, Bernard Hermann﻿'s beautiful, symphonic score is also essential to the experience. It would be nice if some of the growing numbers of young head-down-and-texters would venture over to the revival theater showing this cinematic landmark in order to understand how much farther great culture can lift a soul than a QWERTY keyboard can. 'Vertigo' opens with an enigma: How does San Francisco Detective John 'Scotty' Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) survive hanging from a rain gutter from a great height? No hint is provided. The murder plot is similarly perplexing. For example, how could a murderer risk easy exposure if the intended witness manages to overcome acrophobia and climb the stairs of a steep tower? We toss away plausibility when experiencing Hitchcock's universe, but the payoff here is huge.The famous reveal in 'Vertigo' is the subject of much scholarly discussion. (The film's twist is revealed about 25 minutes before it might have used as a surprise.) According to legend, every leading figure involved in the production disagreed with Hitchcock on the reveal, including Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had to fend them off. In his subsequent interview with François Truffaut﻿, he explains his preference for suspense, not surprise.There are several very widely-read biographies of Alfred Hitchcock with co-workers all saying he was impossible to like on a personal level. In 'Vertigo', the two leads have a strong argument. Despite how effortlessly the very gifted Jimmy Stewart﻿ plays Scotty, Hitchcock is said to have blamed Stewart's premature aging for 'Vertigo's' box office failure. Hitchcock never worked with Stewart again, breaking up a legendary collaboration (of four superlative films). In addition, Hitchcock was unhappy with Kim Novak﻿, and is said to have publicly criticized her after 'Vertigo' was released. (Novak maintained a dignified silence.) I don't know what Hitchcock said about Novak, but it seems that Hitchcock has some thin department-store models showing off female clothing to Scotty and Madeleine. Also, when one of the sales women tells Scotty that Judy can wear a particular woman's suit after 'alterations,' perhaps the comment and the slender models are both knocks on Novak's weight.Still, Hitchcock's characters show tremendous depth. Scotty's former love interest Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is uniquely endearing. The scene where Midge tearfully destroys her witty painting (a spoof on Scotty's obsession) is really heart-wrenching. So is Midge's final appearance, the somber walk down the hallway in the sanitarium. Hitchcock really connects with lonely hearts through Midge. It is ironic that an artist as universally disliked by the people who worked with him could produce such profound moments with common people as we see him portray Scotty's forgotten ex-girlfriend. People tend to forget this when teeing off on Alfred Hitchcock, the man.If you have watched 'Vertigo' a few time notice how Hitchcock manipulates point of view. For example, when we first see Scotty after the opening predicament, he is in Midge's apartment. Seated but physically diminished, Scotty is balancing a cane when he says, 'ouch.' The background is particularly busy. There is visual chaos all around Stewart's outline. It looks as if the background objects just fell from a height, not Scotty. Scotty is being under-appreciated. It is also interesting when another point of view (besides Scotty's) is being represented. For example, we see the floating petals from Madeleine's flower just before she jumps into San Francisco Bay. Another example is when Madeleine revisits the murder with her flashback. It lasts a few seconds but her side of the story is clearly identified. (That is, it appears filmed in a manner that conveys her as a reluctant pawn in a larger conspiracy.) Hitchcock is never just pointing a camera at a set where some action is taking place. He plans every visual detail before filming begins. Cinephiles already know what a great film 'Vertigo' is. It is a perennial pleasure that never gets stale. However, please don't take any ill-advised leaps across rooftops getting to the revival theater showing it.",10,4,6,8 December 2014
Chinatown," Past and Future Tense
","***User reviewer Sergio_Falco ('What to say?', Sergio_Falco from Australia, May 2012) has an interesting commentary that mentions the layers of evil. Mr Ghostface ('A wonderful, classic film', Mr Ghostface from London, England, 8 October 1999) has good background info.***Chinatown (1974, Roman Polanski), a homage to Film noir, is one of the world's great film treasures. Many reviewers describe it as one of the elite film noirs. (I would disqualify it for not belonging to the genre well enough.) 'Chinatown' is often used as curriculum in film schools. This is high art, and is particularly great fun to view it on the big screen when the opportunity exists.Robert Towne is credited with the original screenplay. Although it was inspired by the water wars that occurred in LA in the early twentieth century, it is set decades later (1937). The director, Roman Polanski, changed Towne's desired ending. The plot meanders and has holes, but there isn't a dull scene. The entire cast functions very well. Polanski makes a director's cameo that rivals any other. The supporting characters fit in effortlessly. (My favorite is John Hillerman as Yelburton.)The principal three characters are all at a high level. I am fond of Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulray; same with John Houston as Noah Cross. However, Jack Nicholson is masterful as J. J. Gittes. Towne wrote the screenplay for Nicholson, and Gittes appears in every scene. Nicholson's Gittes is a smart, acerbic, dogged private investigator who breaks rules without hesitation while making his share of blunders. He is also a magnet (i.e., almost always the center of attention). The acid-tongued Gittes is haunted by an event that is never revealed to the audience. It occurred when he was a beat cop in Chinatown. While Gittes is irked with civil servants generally (e.g., the man at the Hall of Records), he has obvious contempt for his former police colleagues. There seems to be a connection between the intensity of Gittes's loathing of each cop with that character's contribution to the conclusion. So, there's no need for us to know what happened in Chinatown previously because it is the same destination as the future.Personally, I can't respect Towne's decision to have Gittes slapping Evelyn around before she reveals her secret. I don't think it is very challenging for a filmmaker to show a stronger man beating up a woman. On an unrelated note, it is also kind of hilarious to imagine people nonchalantly smoking everywhere in 1937, including government offices. (BTW, 'Chinatown' repeats the phrase, 'as little as possible.' This is in response to the question, 'what did you do there?' This line can be explained by making what today is likely construed as a racist statement: A white policeman working Chinatown will find the locals so inscrutable it is impossible to know whether law enforcement is causing or preventing a crime. So, the beat cops do the least amount of policing that is required of them.)Above all else, 'Chinatown' is dazzling because of Polanski's vision. He uses the entire frame, and is conveying point of view. (My favorite image is probably the final one of Yelburton; Gittes suggests he is due for a great future and it appears the reverse is in store.) Polanski is expert level at varying the size and position of Gittes, while employing a very precise focal length. (It is worth noticing when the background is blurry.) Polanski also employs a visual leitmotif. He frequently shoots Gittes from the back while Gittes is spying on someone else. The frequency of watching Gittes from behind, with Gittes seemingly making no effort to be discrete, makes the audience feel like a voyeur. Considering the film's pivotal surprise, the voyeur feeling takes us closer to experiencing the sordid details.'Chinatown' is too good to miss. Cinephiles are encouraged to head over to the nearest revival theater to see it again, steering clear of whatever diminutive, maniacal, switchblade-bearing directors that are encountered.",10,2,3,18 June 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Carole Lombard and Other Points of Interest
","***User reviewer theowinthrop ('Swan Song in Warsaw', theowinthrop from United States, 12 November 2005) has an interesting review that covers most of the bases which follow here.*** 'To Be Or Not To Be (1942, Ernst Lubitsch)', a comedy about the Nazi invasion of Poland, is worthwhile escapism. It is a product of the time it was made. Completed in 1941, the producers withheld it from release until the US was at war with Germany. When it was being made, the US was still neutral regarding the conflicts raging in Europe. So the Nazi subject matter (e.g., many digs at Adolf Hitler, the references to concentration camps, the Gestapo, etc.), was fairly new to Western audiences. There is a strong propaganda element throughout, and the leading actors are handicapped by the need to kiss up to the Allies while demonizing the Axis powers.This film may have inspired 'Hogan's Heroes' which arrives 25 years later. For both, the Germans are easily defeated. 'Hogan's Heroes' also has a Colonel Schultz who is particularly dim-witted.Even though the Saturday crowd was laughing out loud, many of the gags seem pretty antiquated today. What makes 'To Be Or Not to Be' enjoyable is the performance by the three principal leads. Also, the Edwin Justic screenplay is energetic.In the tradition of 1930s screwball comedies, Robert Stack as Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski is a very handsome young man in pursuit of love but inexperienced at it. He is more than a capable bombardier and soldier, but love is a more difficult battle altogether.Jack Benny's Joseph Tura, a pompous actor obsessed with his wife's presumed infidelities, is quite brilliant. Even though Tura repeats himself frequently, Benny has the skill to keep it interesting. Benny might have become a clown to rival Bob Hope if he had made more films. However, for many reasons Carole Lombard (as Maria Tura) is obviously the main attraction here.Lombard did not live to see this film released. She was killed at age 33 while flying to a war bond rally. Her departure was a terrible loss for world cinema. Not only is Carole Lombard breathtakingly beautiful, she is vastly talented. She excelled in comedic repartee. Her Maria Tura thinks very fast on her feet while captivating throughout. Carole Lombard was an elite performer during the fabled Golden Era of Hollywood.Cinephiles will enjoy 'To Be or Not to Be.' Just don't board an aircraft with an unpressurized cabin getting to the revival theater showing this.",8,0,2,18 January 2015
North by Northwest," Grant's nightmare is our gain
","***Nycritic has an interesting discussion comparing NXNW with the James Bond franchise ('What an Action Thriller Should Be', nycritic, 11 April 2005). Also, Ian Harrison has a good discussion about identification with Cary Grant ('Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!', Ian Harrison from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, 25 December 2000).***'North by Northwest' (1959, Alfred Hitchcock), a travelogue, has inspired many. This includes Ian Fleming who created the character of James Bond as a derivation of Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill. Many young filmmakers have also studied this film to unlock its secrets. Despite its ludicrous plot (which is a Hitchcock characteristic), it is overflowing with style. NXNW is exquisitely fine art with strong appeal to the masses. Someday, Alfred Hitchcock may dislodge William Shakespeare in public regard.As with every film by the Master, each image was carefully designed before the filming. The sequences are dazzling with precision. The sublime crop-duster, auction, drunken-driving and Mount Rushmore scenes all reach a level of quality that is hard to believe. NXNW is of course, best viewed on the big screen. Since the Charles Theater has completed renovating its showcase theater this is a great opportunity to luxuriate in the new seats and experience a real gem.There are sight gags aplenty. We know from Francois Truffaut's famous interview with him that visually Hitchcock was mocking Grant's sexuality. Ergo, making Cary appear uninterested in women is a prominent visual leitmotif. (Although he always denied it, Grant was widely believed in Hollywood to be bisexual. He shared a house for a decade with fellow actor Randolph Scott, and the two were often observed relaxing as if they were lovers. It seems worth noting that the media of the 1930s largely let 'sleeping dogs lie'; i.e., Grant suffered little exposure in the press. It may be difficult for people living in this Peeping Tom era to imagine the privacy people in the 1930s enjoyed.)Here, Cary Grant is never better. The rest of the cast is noteworthy. Silky-voiced James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) is wonderful to listen to. Hitchcock's villains are always charming, but Mason's particular voice is so sonorous it is the perfect antidote to Grant's mega-watt charisma. Eva Marie Saint (age: 35) is also very effective as a sultry spy. Martin Landau plays the obviously homosexual assistant to Van Damm. Leo G. Carroll, the actor with the most appearances in Hitchcock films (5), is the sympathetic spy master. Jessica Royce Landis, (believed to be) only 8 years older than Grant, plays his mother with comedic flair. Bernard Hermann provides another great film score.Studio executives quarreled with Hitchcock over NXNW's running time (136 minutes). The bean counters wanted to trim scenes, particularly Cary and Eva Marie in the woods. Hitchcock had his way because his contract granted him final cut. Good thing the brief hospital scene was not left out. When a startled female patient immediately falls in love with passing-through Grant, the moment never fails to bring laughter. Even today, Cary Grant will likely poll as the most handsome actor in cinema history.The last time I saw NXNW screened in a theater I was very surprised how much more thrilling and emotionally warm experiencing it is instead of watching it on a TV screen. The next time this appears at a movie house near you, do not hesitate to arrive by bus, cab, train and airplane to experience it; avoiding offensive crop-duster pilots on the journey.",10,1,3,16 July 2014
Slap Shot," funny, complex, sexual and kind of creepy
","I recommend people read 'Hilarious, oddly influential dark sports comedy' (ggh6; 27 July 2001). Also, 'Funny, cynical and irreverent' (JohnRouseMerriottChard, 27 September 2008); 'Enjoyable romp' (Big Neil-2, 20 July 2002) and '...a hockey game broke out (Gary M. James; 8 May 2001).'Slap Shot' is a very complex movie. It works very well as a sports comedy that that can seen in a party setting. For many people, that is all it needs to be.I really like how it looks. The extensive use of natural lighting, the grainy quality of the film is appealing. I also admire George Roy Hill's visual style. There are a number of interesting compositions.The opening credits begin in a cutaway section of what was previously the blue square of an American flag. The finish concludes with a parade for the Charleston Chiefs. The Chiefs win using disreputable tactics. It is hard to deny that Slap Shot is making a statement about the falsity of American life; i.e., Americana.Then there is the homophobic quality (which Gary James mentions in his 8 May 2001 review). If one reads between the lines, Slap Shot can be viewed as an out-of-the-closet statement for Paul Newman. (If not Newman, then his character, Reg Dunlap.) Contrary to what many have written, Newman's Reg Dunlap does not originate the idea that if the Chiefs become a goon-squad it will bring in a financially depressed crowd. Reg Dunlap is a classic weather vane. What he thinks this minute is determined by who is around him. He cannot decide which woman he wants. He also repeatedly contradicts himself about what style of hockey he wants his team to play. (He even tells the police he thinks the Hanson brothers should be locked up, then works for their release.) Given the transient nature of Reg Dunlap's opinions, and the clearly identifiable scenes where Dunlap encounters the subject of homosexuality, it seems easy enough to interpret these scenes as Newman (or Dunlap) acknowledging that he has a gay impulse, regardless of what Dunlap says about homosexuality in scenes where he is more in control.Slap Shot depicts not not just the corruption of hockey, but also with American society. We are made to believe both are acceptable. Like the team's fanatical boosters, we are rooting for the Chiefs to win by using disreputable tactics.There is a powerful sense of indoctrination in Slap Shot. It does make the audience welcome thuggishness and the breakdown of civil society. (If the CIA made it that would explain why.) I laughed from start to finish, and the introduction of the Hanson brothers to ice is a riot. Slap Shot is amusing. There are many layers of interest beyond the mirth.",8,3,4,25 May 2013
Rosemary's Baby," Superb Supernatural
","***User reviewer Vince-5 ('One of the ultimate horror classics', Vince-5 from northeastern PA, 2 May 2001) has a well-written review worth a look. Tedg ('Devils', tedg from Virginia Beach, 15 March 2001) brings up Farrow, Polanski, Lennon and Manson. Reviewer Violetmoreviolent ('Terrifying, A Timeless Horror Classic That Still Evokes Chills', violetmoreviolent from Portland, Oregon, USA, 30 August 2007) has a good commentary that parallels the review below. Finally, reviewer Poseidon-3 ('Virtually flawless piece of storytelling with Farrow's best work', Poseidon-3 from Cincinnati, OH, 16 August 2005) has good background about the casting.*** 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968, Roman Polanski﻿), a chronicle of the arrival of Satan's spawn conjured up by a witches coven﻿, is sublime. Polanski's film is an elite supernatural experience. With only two major scenes of genuine horror, most of the tension is building around moments, if removed from context, might otherwise seem banal. This is possibly why 'Rosemary's Baby' has so much public appeal: It teases us by delaying the switch from the conventional to the surreal. Also, the central betrayal on display smacks harder because we are living with these characters.Rosemary and her struggling actor husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavettes), move into a centrally-located, New York City﻿ apartment. (The building is the Dakota, where John Lennon﻿ later lived and was assassinated.) Guy's difficulty in getting his career established is postponing their intention to raise a family. While doing laundry, Rosemary makes friends with a recovering drug addict who also lives there thanks to the generosity of the Castevets, an elderly couple. The untimely demise of this laundry friend leads to Rosemary and Guy forming a relationship with Minnie and Roman Castevet. Rosemary finds the eccentric pair intrusive, particularly Minnie (who among other transgressions is always handing her mysterious concoctions to drink). Although he is initially reluctant to meet him, Guy immediately takes an interest with the worldly Roman (Sidney Blackmer). As Guy and Roman become close buddies the chief obstacle in Guy's acting career is suddenly removed. Tasting success, Guy and Rosemary decide the evening she is most fertile that it is time to create their baby. Minnie interrupts (yet again) by providing the couple a chocolate mousse. Rosemary doesn't like hers and shortly afterwards passes out. She then has a very odd nightmare where she is being raped by a demon while her husband and her neighbors watch. She wakes up, and imagines she has uncovered a Satanic conspiracy which involves everyone around her.The dream sequence is incredible, one of cinema's best. 'Rosemary's Baby' is great visually. Polanski superb color choices throughout. He blocks actors superbly. While never appearing staged, his mise en scène is very detailed. The result is uniquely watchable, and can only fully be appreciated in a movie house.The cast, led by Mia Farrow as Rosemary, is excellent. Farrow deserved (but did not receive) Oscar recognition as the resilient young wife with a penchant for noticing small details. Farrow handles the task of conveying Rosemary's encroaching madness exceptionally well. She accomplishes this performance despite her real-life husband, Frank Sinatra, serving her with divorce papers which were delivered by a big-shot lawyer with the cast and crew observing. (Polanski offered her a day off to compose herself but Farrow gamely refused. The party scene where a crying Rosemary is on the kitchen floor being consoled by her friends was apparently filmed shortly after she was humiliated by Sinatra.) Another standout cast member is Ruth Gordon (who won an Oscar) as the scene-stealing Minnie Castevet. Minnie simply won't say no; she is the epitome of annoying friend who Rosemary knows she will never be able to get rid of. Sidney Blackmer as Roman is a very convincing Satanist. Ralph Bellamy is also effective as Dr. Sapirstein, a charismatic and manipulative physician who does not actually relieve Rosemary from the unusual, recurring pain of her pregnancy. Reviews are a bit mixed on John Cassavetes as Guy, with some complaining that he appears about 15 years older than his character. However, Cassavetes is a convincing betrayer. By the way, when Farrow phones the actor who had the role that suddenly fell in Guy's lap, she recognized but couldn't fully place the voice (Tony Curtis). Polanski kept the surprise from Farrow to bring out more confusion in her voice.Cinephiles should wear a good luck pendant containing some musty (but charming) Tannis Root and head over to revival theater showing this to observe this exquisite horror classic unfold on the big screen.",10,1,3,16 September 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," Mary Badham should have won
","I enjoyed reading dweck (An Unforgettable Drama, 9 December 1998) and sylviastel@aol.com (Please Don't Remake This Film!, 23 February 2008).'To Kill a Mockingbird' is an acting showcase, where everyone who appears is very good. Three actors I have enjoyed from 'Star Trek' and 'Twilight Zone' and who fit into the landscape here are Paul Fix, Frank Overton and William Windom. Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill are good children actors. James Anderson and Collin Wilcox Paxton as the Ewell father and daughter are both filled with spite. Brock Peters is convincing as the accused rapist. Robert Duvall makes a memorable appearance as Boo Radley very late in the show.The two acting standouts are Gregory Peck as Atticus and Mary Badham as Scout. Peck immerses himself so thoroughly as Atticus that it is difficult imagining anyone else appearing here. Atticus is cinema's limit as the dignified and moral lawyer struggling to prevent mob rule from holding sway.Mary Badham should have won the supporting Oscar she was nominated for. She has great depth and range for a child actor. (It is a pity her career was so limited.) The credit sequence is pretty interesting. Elmer Bertstein's music, with jazzy piano, is also well done.The trial scenes are effective despite how easy it should be to defend a man accused of being a left-handed rapist who can't use his left arm at all.The only weakness that 'Mockingbird' has is the direction. There isn't a single image from director Robert Mulligan that is uniquely memorable. He's competent but not elite. His Oscar nomination is difficult to understand.'Mockingbird' is an important film for people to see today. Before Guantanamo Bay eviscerated it, America used to be a Constitutional Republic. In the 1960s there were many cultural references on behalf of the US legal system. While America continues to advance the use of illegal, extra-Constitutional star chambers (e.g., Guantanamo Bay), 'Mockingbird' shows us that it was once considered shocking for justice to be so clearly denied.",8,0,0,20 April 2013
Blade Runner," Humane Robots
","***User-reviewer jaywolfenstien ('A frame to die for', jaywolfenstien from USA, 2 February 2008) has a good commentary.***'Blade Runner (1982, Ridley Scott) Final Cut', a dystopian sci-fi, is enjoyable. Adhering to the now ubiquitous visual plan of contemporary fantasy/horror cinema, we see a lot of colorized smoke along with moody and/or pulsating lighting. It is described as neo- film noir; and two noir characteristics are washed out streets and freely burning tobacco. While the story is uneven it has an unusually beautiful principal cast. Just as there are multiple versions of 'Blade Runner', it seems that everyone has their own opinion about where it belongs when ranking all-time science fiction.It is set 37 years from the film's release (2019), in a Los Angeles that is majority Asian. This Los Angeles also possesses a formidable skyline with many tall, imposing buildings featuring grim architecture. The Tyrell Corporation, a totalitarian central command structure in complete control over the human population, is manufacturing replicants. Replicants are robots intended to labor under dangerous conditions on other planets. They are engineered with physical powers superior to humans. They also have consciousness. To keep them down, the latest firmware grants them only a four year lifetime. If replicants ever set foot on Earth it is up to a Blade Runner (i.e., a contract assassin affiliated with the LAPD) to 'retire' them ASAP, typically by use of a loud, high- caliber handgun. As the story begins there are four replicants who have stolen a space ship and escaped to Earth. Gloomy and weary Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to retire them.A Blade Runner can distinguish a replicant from a human by means of a test (named Voight-Kampff) that is delivered orally. The questions are hypothetical and from what we know, always contain triggers that recall the Milgram experiment. (BTW, there has never been a psychological experiment more important than Milgram. Every school on Earth should teach it. But I digress.) At the urging of Mr. Tyrell (the hands-on CEO of the mighty empire) Deckard gives the test to Tyrell's assistant Rachael (Sean Young). Although she believes she is human, Deckard concludes that she is a machine with implanted memories. Normally, this is cause for Deckard to use his gun. However, he hesitates to retire Rachael. The relationship between the pair is vital to the story. It also drives speculation and debate among 'Blade Runner' fans over whether Deckard is actually a replicant himself. The Final Cut version of the film does not conclusively inform us one way or the other. The replicants all seem intentionally more interesting than Deckard. So do Decker's work colleagues Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). While Deckard has a dogged persistence that is admirable, as he retires one replicant after another, it is usually the machine which wins the heart of the viewer. While trying not to spoil things, three of the targeted replicants make things easy for Deckard by breaking off a physical attack that would take advantage of their insurmountable strength. One replicant responds to the threat posed by itchy-trigger-fingered Deckard by demonstrating a killer set of fast-moving handstands. This is fun to observe but not effective in battle against an armed hunter. Generally, it seems that the replicants are the ones offering some humanity to the atmosphere while the brutal Tyler Corporation is suppressing it. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the leader of the four mutinous replicants, is occasionally very appealing (even though we also see him kill a human by crushing the victim's skull). Roy is most empathetic when he clamors despairingly for a longer life. As this is in clear contrast to Deckard's misanthropy, the replicant leader garners interest at the expense of the protagonist.An issue I have with 'Blade Runner' is Ridley Scott's dull direction. I am not fond of how modern sci-fi/horror films look. There is no single image that seems to stand out and/or inspire a second glance. It is tempting to say it appears as if were filmed through a Coke bottle. Blade Runner also has innumerable close-ups and cutting back and forth between characters. Scott's imagery just is not distinctive to where 'Blade Runner' can be regarded as an elite science fiction film.Still, there may be nothing more appealing to many cinema-goers than watching a contract killer removing elements of society who are inconvenient to power. If you don't mind occasional eruptions of extreme violence, the beautiful cast and the prospect of experiencing a world (slightly) more authoritarian than ours today makes this a fun diversion. Yet, I don't recommend bringing kids to it. (Not unless you want them to grow up as contract killers. But why not? All that matters is getting paid.)",7,0,3,26 January 2015
The Martian," Intense but Fun Ride
","'The Martian (2015, Ridley Scott)' is pretty good overall, but riddled with enough flaws you want to warn people about.It is occasionally more intense than pleasurable. (For example, Matt Damon's injured astronaut performing desperate surgery on himself. We get prolonged looks at the bleeding gut.). Also, it is often a tepid music video, particularly during the schmaltzy sequence when David Bowie's 'Starman' is heard. The propaganda elements are also all over the place. The head of NASA (played by Jeff Daniels) actually cares about whether a lone astronaut stranded on Mars lives or not. What a nice guy. Also, nearly every woman working at NASA is really hot. I also get a kick out of the plot turn where an odd, reclusive wonder kind uses a supercomputer to verify a gravity assist algorithm--and he's the only person at NASA who had thought of using what would seem to be a common maneuver.The science is interesting but dumb in crucial places. What confuses me the most is how initially it takes hours to communicate to Astronaut Matt Damon on Mars, when later that communication is instantaneous. (As evident by the Times Square euphoria.) Did Matt build a new Internet?However...the good side is The Martian shows us a doomed character using his wits to postpone his fate. There is also a lot of admirable teamwork, and resistance to authority when necessary.The acting is very good. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain really show up. They both are larger than life; just what we expect in movie stars. (But isn't Matt Damon a bit old to be an astronaut assigned a Mars mission?) I wasn't keen on Ridley Scott's direction, but the Martian landscape is always enjoyable.If you can handle the shocks and intensity of a modern US movie, you will like this. Otherwise, avoid.",8,4,10,17 October 2015
The Godfather," joining the underworld
","The Godfather is a great film made with gusto. Most of the participants are at their career best. Nina Rota's magnificent score and Francis Ford Coppola's direction tie things together very well. Al Pacino is the greatest performer of a top-shelf cast. The decision to cast him as Michael is a stroke of cinematic genius. (Supposedly, Marlon Brando threatened to quit if Pacino wasn't cast, and this tipped the scales in Pacino's favor.)Another diminutive actor playing Michael might have emulated James Cagney a bit, with bounce and swagger in his step. Pacino never seems worried about his physical stature; instead, his Michael is very articulate. Pacino and Brando are putting on a Method acting show; and their chemistry together is sublime.The Godfather foreshadows Michael's destiny exquisitely. For example, consider the hospital sequence. Michael enters a room looking for the detectives protecting his father and we hear the musical soundtrack repeating the number 'two.' Michael opens the hospital door to his father's room--and it is clearly marked with the number two. The association of the number two with Vito when Michael is present foreshadows the rise of Michael in the family business. (That is, Michael is #1.) In addition, the actor playing Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei) has a strong resemblance to Pacino. When Michael throws Enzo's carnations away (on the steps outside the hospital) this is another clue that Michael is destined to chuck away the lover boy side of him and rise in the underworld.Marlon Brando's performance is a lightning rod for criticism, praise and satire. It is difficult to imagine any other actor of his time portraying Don Vito with all the knowing looks and gestures that Brando makes. It is another brave portrayal from Brando.The conflict between brothers Sonny (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is well explored. Sonny is all testosterone and action while Tom Hagen is cautious and inexperienced in underworld affairs. Since Hagen is adopted, he is both an insider and an outsider. The audience needs him to help understand the Sicilian logic at play.Having seen The Godfather dozens of times, it is fun pointing out the implausibility with the story. For example, it seems very hard to believe that a brother-in-law, already having been savagely smacked around in public for hitting his wife, would beat her again knowing that his wife's hot-headed brother would chase after him without his bodyguards. How much could Carlo have been paid to willingly absorb the risk that his brother-in-law exercises usual caution?Another implausible is that Barzini is doing something in public the day of the Baptism. Forgetting that Baptisms usually occur on a Sunday, what happens to Michael if Barzini is staying at home that day?The Godfather has us rooting for Michael even as he descends into evil. The transformation that Michael makes is shared by the viewer; we are also joining a criminal conspiracy. It is a uniquely memorable and pleasurable ride.",10,0,1,14 November 2013
