The Expendables 2," This is cartoon/video game movie
","The violence is so over the top as to be comical. The villains are evil and the good guys are heroic. The movie is full of corny jokes and hilarious cameos. Expendables 2 dwarfs it's predecessor on every level. I've seen people bash this movie for what it is...What were they expecting? This isn't a thoughtful tear jerker that might help you get laid. This a rock 'em, sock 'em, shoot 'em up that doesn't just glorify violence it worships it. The story line is just interesting enough to propel the viewer forward into even more precarious scenarios. No one is winning an Oscar here except for maybe Special Effects. This movie rocked musically as well with classic 60's rock tunes parsed out over the perfectly timed 1:40.",9,2,8,19 August 2012
