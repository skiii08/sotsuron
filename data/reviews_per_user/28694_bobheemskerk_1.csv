First Man," Made me cry tears
","The intro got you right on the edge of your chair and gives you a good view of how it would have been to be a test pilot in those years. It was interesting to see how it was back then. It feels like you get a correct image of that time... of the politics and the way that people lived back then. Also, how those pioneers, and their families, had to sacrifice a lot and how big the risks were. The musical score was outstanding. The movie is a little slow paced, but that didn't bother me.What made me give this movie not a 7, but a 9, was how well the movie (especially thanks to the perfect acting) shows the grief of a father without him mentioning his daughter twice. The greatest fear is of men is not dying, but losing those who are closest to you.",9,1,2,6 January 2019
