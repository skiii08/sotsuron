28 Weeks Later," surprisingly satisfying sequel
","Perfect? No.But better than most sequels.I didn't find the characters as engaging, perhaps because the attrition was so intense: they die as you're getting to know them. And I had the usual quibbles, like the exasperating way that the medical officer really fails to communicate the importance of the carriers (the mother, the children) to her superiors.But golly the *feel* of it was vivid, horrific, and I was interested from start to finish. And, as with the first film, that's so, so much more than I can say for other films in this category.",8,1,3,12 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," tedious direction and acting
","There is a serious problem with sluggish dialogue and transitions in this film. Not only is it too long, but most of the excessive length consists of dim, lingering shots of not much, and painfully awkward pauses between lines of wooden dialogue. We are given enough time to think for quite some time about what characters have said. Time and again, replies seemed so slow that I wondered if I'd accidentally hit pause. Nor was the wait worthwhile: the replies rarely added much. It is also relentlessly morose — not 'dark' or even 'bleak,' just depressing — which one might forgive if the shreds of comic relief weren't so trite and half-hearted.",Null,0,0,18 August 2011
District 9," Does District 9 deserve the hype? 9 responses to 9 criticisms of District 9
","I heard a few anti-hype warnings that District 9 was 'not all that great,' but after seeing it I think that the hype about this film is deserved. I read every negative comment posted on IMDb about the film (as of Aug 22), and did not agree with many of them.  Most gave no reason for disliking the film and focused instead of creative ways of saying how much they hated it. Here are my responses to nine specific criticisms I did find, some of which were repeated many times (especially #s 1, 2, and 3):CRITICISM #1: Too long!RESPONSE: It's true, some scenes could have been cut, and I don't think this criticism is incorrect.  But I was never bored. Something is almost always moving District 9's plot forward. It compares favourably to many other films in this regard.  It doesn't have interminable exposition like the Matrix sequels, or interminable space shots like 2001, or interminable hobbit-gazing like Return of the King. There is a long action sequence that starts to eat away at the film's intelligence, but I also think it's a minor concern.CRITICISM #2: Too much gore!RESPONSE: I thought the gore was an appropriate extension of a more integral element of the story: the grossness of the slum.  Everything in this film is dirty and disgusting, and for good reason!CRITICISM #3: Too much swearing!RESPONSE: Yes, Wickus definitely did swear a lot, but objecting to it is prudish and naive.   As any soldier or veteran knows, the F-word is used like punctuation in violent situations.CRITICISM #4: The film hits you over the head a bit with simplistic moralizing. The apartheid analogy is too blatant. At a couple points, one of the interviewed experts tells us exactly how we're supposed to be interpreting the action, and it's heavy-handed.RESPONSE: I agree that there are couple moments of expositional bludgeoning, but I can only think of a couple.  The rest of the film is pure allegory, and I see no reason why it needs to be subtle. Just because the analogy to apartheid is clear doesn't make it illegitimate. Lots of great films about racism have been blatant with their moral message! District 9 is no more morally simplistic than any other cautionary tale about racism.  Blomkamp tells the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story of apartheid in an original way — not simplistic at all.CRITICISM #5: Too many implausible that's-so-fake moments, especially the amazing command that racist humans seem to have of the prawns' clicky, glottal-stoppy alien language. No universal translators here, and yet they have no trouble talking to each other at all!RESPONSE: The language barrier is a nearly impossible SF problem to solve.  Realistically depicting a language barrier with aliens is so tedious that it will destroy any story. Blomkamp chose his compromise, and it's no worse than a lot of others, and maybe better: the aliens have been there for 20 years, after all. Maybe some communication is plausible.  While a racist is not normally interested in learning the language of an oppressed minority group, these are alien visitors: the human interest in learning would have been high, even for racists.CRITICISM #6: It makes no sense that the prawns fail to use their superior physical strength and powerful weapons to overthrow their oppressors.RESPONSE: Of course it makes sense!  Again, it is the critics who are being simplistic and naive, not the film. It's a matter of clear historical record that poverty and hunger can pacify almost any population, preventing organized resistance, and that oppressed minorities are surprisingly passive and underestimate their own strength.  Not only is it realistic, it's actually one of the major moral points of the film — a point overlooked by the same people protesting that the film is too 'morally simplistic' for them.  Furthermore, the story makes it clear up front that most of them are 'workers' who aren't too bright and take no initiative.  Thus it is to be expected that prawn violence is erratic and impulsive and not an effective resistance.CRITICISM #7: The cat food thing 'trivializes' the prawns and the moral message.RESPONSE: Get over yourself!  It was a bit of comic relief.  Who knows what aliens will want to eat?CRITICISM #8: There are several SF clichés in the film.RESPONSE: Yes, there are, but the measure of an SF film is not whether or not it has clichés but how many and how much it depends on them: District 9 only has a few. Yes, a big hovering mothership has been done in many (many, many) other first-contact movies.  And you can hardly go to an SF film anymore without seeing the ol' infected-with-alien- DNA thing.  However, after decades of highly productive SF storytelling — 700+ films since 1970! — anyone who thinks that SF is only good if it's completely original is pretty much doomed to be disappointed.  There's just no such critter any more.  The problem with most bad SF films is that they are mostly or entirely driven by their clichés. District 9 contains a few, but it is not limited to them, and a great deal of originality mitigates their impact.CRITICISM #9: I hate hand-held camera work!  It makes me dizzy and sick!  Why do directors do that?RESPONSE: Because it's effective and interesting and it doesn't bother most people. If you're one of the unlucky ones, just don't watch it on the small screen, and don't blame the film!CONCLUSION: District 9 offers a much that we bemoan the lack of in science fiction: an original setting, an original premise, intricately conceived aliens, no-name actors, quality FX that are there to serve the story, lots of uncomfortably gritty realism, and action that makes sense for the situation. District 9 is undoubtedly the best SF film in several years, and one of the most unusual and interesting ever made.",9,4,8,21 August 2009
The Mist," stilted attempted to be a 'deep' horror film
","Hard to believe this is the same director who gave us Shawshank! I wish Darabont had just tried to entertain/scare us, instead of trying to add depth to this horror film. The characters are all paper-thin walking clichés, but not for lack of trying to make something more out of them  trying much too hard. Most of them talk like they are trying to make a philosophical point to the audience.Much of the action of the film concerns their shocking degeneration under pressure, and this is one of the main complaints about the film I've read in other comments: people don't think that's realistic. But that's not the problem.Here in Vancouver in 2006ish, we had a 'boil water advisory,' and ACTUAL FIST FIGHTS broke out at local stores over bottled water. Fist fights! There was no actual water shortage mind you ... we were just supposed to boil before drinking it. But people actually attacked each other. For real. Welcome to the human race. We really DO get violently bonkers under pressure.So the crazy human behaviour wasn't really the problem with the film. But the plausible psychology doesn't forgive clumsy, irritating dialogue, plus several other problems:* Generally goofy-lookin' monsters. Too rubbery! Can't we do better than that these days?* Inconsistent monster powers! Monsters that can rip some poor guy's chest off ... but then a moment later can hold 'em off with a broomstick!* Giant spiders? Really? Arg. It's been years since I read it, but I could pretty much swear that there were NOT giant spiders in the novella.* The old monsters coming out of the body cliché is irritating enough in any movie that isn't Alien(s), but this film did NOT need to do that, and actually went out of its WAY to do it. Groan.* Completely irrational 'don't go in there' character choices.Etc. Just a bunch of stereotypical lame horror movie stuff ... with a failed attempt to be deep and meaningful spread all over it.",2,5,15,13 May 2008
The Dark Knight," as usual, Batman bores
","Heath, Heath, Heath, yada yada yada. Yes, he did a lovely Joker. So what? The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them. The obvious problems:* Too long!* Shallow stabs at moral seriousness.* Absurdly over-processed Batman voice.* The usual barely-there female characters.* Heath's Joker was just another lunatic villain, and we've seen plenty of similar quality over the years. *gasp*  heresy!Yes, in my opinion, Heath was merely okay.Making a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to 'make the world burn' is not 'deep.' It's not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character. Yes, he had some game. Yes, of course, I enjoyed lines like 'I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one.' This movie wasn't completely awful. I'm giving it five stars, after all (which guarantees no one will read my comment, but oh well).But neither Heath nor the film as a whole was 'amazing.'I'm not a superhero movie hater, and I've actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life (unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film, I think). But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time, so this is no surprise. I can't even wrap my head around this one being fun, light entertainment (or any other kind of entertainment), let alone a 'classic' as so many are calling it.A classic? As GOB would say, 'Come on!' If you are calling this movie a classic, you can't possibly have seen many movies!",6,10,20,23 August 2008
The Good Shepherd," tedious and fragmented
","Beware of flashbacks! It's a rare film that bounces around in time without losing its audience. Not only did I lose my way, but I lost interest. Matt Damon's character was too self-contained to care about, and it simply went on being fragmented and confusing for far too long.As with many films about spying, this one tried so hard to impress us with the complexities of being a spook that I was mostly just baffled by the twists and turns. I kept asking myself a lot of questions like 'Now who's THAT?' and 'Why's he doing that NOW?'It's possible I'm just too stupid to understand, but I suspect that it's like a mystery novel, in which there's a tempting notion that you can somehow deduce who the murderer is from clues in the story, but in fact you really can't until key facts are revealed at the end. I'm a bit skeptical that any viewer without specialized knowledge could ever really follow this film.I had the same problems with Syriana, but at least it lacked the flashbacks.",3,2,4,10 August 2008
Iron Man," in defense of sexism, violence & iffy science
","Sexist? Hey, c'mon, she looked really good standing around at the end there! Really, REALLY good.Violent? Sure, Stark's idea of a solution to a violent situation was just smarter, cooler weapons. But they worked, man, they WORKED. It's not wrong when you can smart-target only the jerks!Iffy science? Maybe Tony Stark is just SMARTER than Isaac Newton. Ever think of THAT?! Huh? I mean did ISAAC build body armor? Noooooooo, I don't think so!I totally had fun at this movie. But it's ridiculous that people are calling this a 'thinking man's' superhero film. Those are some seriously low standards ... ;-)Ask yourself: how good would it have been without Mr. Downey? Seriously? Would have been the slightest bit interesting without him? Be honest. This was not a 'good' film  it was just a fun film.",6,2,5,13 May 2008
Signs," i second 'ultimately dumb'
","There's no need for me to come up with my own clever review title, because someone else said it perfectly: 'ultimately dumb.'This movie had so much going for it that I was particularly ticked off that Shyamalan dropped the ball. I went into this movie with little respect for Shyamalan. (Unlike most people, apparently, I never liked The Sixth Sense: thought it was tedious.) By half way through the Signs, I was thinking maybe I'd underestimated him. The storytelling idea here is really good: an alien invasion from the lonely perspective of ordinary people, who have no idea what's going on. The mood is fascinating.But Shyamalan snatches defeat from the jaws of victory!It's often been said that stories, like planes, are easy to get of the ground and fly, but very difficult to land. Shyamalan crashes this story with what may be the dorkiest plot fumble in the history of otherwise-good SF stories: the critical alien weakness turns out to be a severe allergy to water.Oh, dear.Back in my youth, I was an aspiring SF writer. I submitted a whole bunch of stories to SF magazines. Nearly all were rejected without explanation. The few polite notes that did explain the rejections all slammed me for numerous basic storytelling misdemeanours. Those editors easily picked up on practically any shortcoming as the basis for a rejection.Shyamalan's dorky climax wouldn't have gotten past even the most forgiving of those editors. And yet he gets to make movies for millions.The world is weird.",3,9,18,22 August 2009
