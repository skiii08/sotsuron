Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," funny travel
","I'm just out of the theater near Sydney Australia. I came out of the theater with very mixed feelings about the movie. I had never been aware of this guy existence(character or actor) but usually I am open to most things. I certainly had quite a few laughs during the screening session. Just the same about half way through I really wanted to be somewhere else. My out-bringing (like my feelings)was quite mixed with a religious spell during my late teens with some relapse later on but somehow kept away from any during the second part of my life that is about three decades. I have rolled in the dirt many times and feel rather immune from it, yet something about this movie did not sound right. As the movie ran in Sydney perhaps for its fourth week the crowd on the day was reduced to 7 people in our session; this in my view did not foster the right atmosphere. We were 2 couples, my wife usually fairly straight, to my amazement had a reasonable good time; as for my mate, he had definitely a negative experience but a '10' for his wife of a totally different conviction (a passionate reader). So our conversation around our supper table following the screening was rather animated! Bakc home I got straight onto IMDb and read all those wonderful reviews and had to go through a few pages to see some negative feedback. No, I did not read 64 pages of reviews, but enough to see how divided people could be about this film. Many review seemed quite intelligent on both sides of the feelings. And I must say I was uncomfortable to situate myself in this debate. As some one said in one review 'you 'must' like this movie to be cool' or something to this effect. I must admit that today social issues demand a lot more examination as we live in an ever more mixing and moving population. Examination and willingness to accommodate each others despite very contradicting background and values. Therefore such confrontation of our feelings if we care to explore its implication may have very positive outcome. But the point here is to try to see beyond the impact of what we are dished out and that may be a thick layer of dirt over our eyes and mind to deal with! I did laugh I did get bored I did get nauseated I did talk about I don't want to rate it I do not regret to watch it I don't want to see it again I don't think it was a waste of my time Byt I don't want to recommend it to anyone And I don't think anyone cares whether I do or not. Pehaps I should use Voltaire's philosophy here. 'I don't want to see this movie again, but I would do all I can for you to have the right to see it'! (Voltaire would have gone further!)",Null,2,6,7 December 2006
The Equalizer," Bang Crash Boom They're all dead
","I usually don't mind Denzel and was looking forward to see this movie... Slightly intriguing at first although somehow already predictable. And then it became so tedious, like if it was superman with a magic wand! There was some good effort with mood, music and sound but at times it was out of syn-ch. with the action, or rather the lack of it. I think I could have watch it in FF one step and save time for the same result I think. Such a shame to waste good actors (for me one good actor) for such a flat story. Wow I need more line I thought I said enough and I have nothing more to say about this film I found so bad and a waste of my time",Null,1,1,17 November 2016
In Bruges," Bruges in Belgium
","The tittle appealed to me being a great fan of French singer Jaques Brel as he mentions this city in one of his songs, Yes far fetch but true and completely useless as far as this movie is concerned! Another reason I have seen this movie is because it was run in an independent theater where I often go and see non English movies and I do so partly because my origins are in Europe but also because I have great difficulty to hear and foreign movies are usually subtitled. Now we're getting there, this movie is entirely in English but what English! Irish sputtered a the speed of a machine gun! So I really missed many gems from a clever dialog that got much response from the audience. The language was very strong and this certainly did not impressed my wife. Of course the language I'm referring too is the one that even deaf people will hear! I know this language is a real part of a certain world, so if you don't approve or belong to this world you may have some difficulty in enjoying this movie. Despite these difficulties I have thoroughly enjoyed In Bruges. The beginning, I imagine, intended slowness creates a contrast for fast action.following The comic events are just delightful, but behind all this there is a strong display of contrasting characters. If I was to complain about hearing difficulties , I probably would feel like a blind person complaining about image quality, however I hope in the future those with such impairment will have text facility to enjoy full dialog. With such big screens one would think there would be enough room below for a black strip to include white text. I know I'm driving a hard bargain knowing that screen area is a little like prime real estate. Just the same sometimes it would be good if movie makers would have some thought for those infortunates! Yes a hard bargain, next will have special request to create operas for half deaf people!",Null,0,3,20 September 2008
Monster," Ugly!
","Thanx to Sydney Channel 7 in Sydney who started the broadcast at 22:10 when it was programmed at 22:30, it saved me a tinny bit of agony, not much really as they are more and more generous with their commercials! I picked up the story just before the roller skating scene. Yes I thought it was ugly. What an incredible piece of acting, I watched the new 'italian Job' only a few night before and could not believe I was looking at the same person. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with horror and horrible stories. Yes I'd prefer the Brady Bunch. Sometimes I wonder if we are really trying to make this world better when we continuously glorifying evil. If all this had no affect on us, why are we bombarded with adds/commercials (I hear the French government want to get rid of it on free TV, it will be interesting to see how far it'll go...money is not something to disregard!) But OK let's be mature, if I disregard what I have just said, I'll have to agree with most of the reviews I read. It's very sad, very well acted, and very touching. I too felt some sympathy for the character, quite a lot of sympathy actually. And I think she's got it right when she says that people do die all the time for the reason she quotes which is not way out, neither the right reasons. When one looks at misery it can make one biased, we almost forget the victims. I also remember experiencing similar ambivalent feelings with 'the accused' (jody foster) the situation was quite different yet there was in it something I was not comfortable with, that kind of message that's OK to do what you want but others should not take advantage of it. Yep you should have the right to be in the wrong place doing the wrong thing without being in trouble at all. Yep it should be a unique privilege that does not extend to others. Here we're dealing with a story I believe closely following a real event. But how much reality do we need these days. I guess I'll have to cling onto what I have heard very recently. It's the sin that is very ugly, not the sinner. And why it takes 14 years for capital punishment?",8,0,1,2 February 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Ingloriously bad and good
","I was kind of looking forward to see this movie, 'kind of' because American / Hollywood cinema is so often... 'blank'! Still I could not see Brat Pitt getting himself in something worthless, so...Well, Brat Pitt did not work at all for me! But I can see, although I'm not alone in this, that the majority enjoyed him. Pulp fiction, and Reservoir dog, I have not seen and don't think I have any desire to do so, perhaps even more after watching IB. By now I probably gave the impression that I did not have a good time watching IB. In the contrary I did have a great time because there were fantastic moments, fantastic acting and good cinema. But I had to twist my values a little bit, and reach for my sense of humour, usually pretty free, to bypass certain scenes that were pretty ugly. Well this is 2009, nudity, gore and language are nothing anymore to be offended with. I probably should also add that there are no more taboo topics...everything is 'art' these day. And nobody forces anyone to be present, no, you're paying for the privilege! For my money and taste and give an idea where I stand in cinema, I enjoyed 'The Life of Others' immensely more(M.A.Y.B.E.S.P.O.I.L.E.R) I'm a little bit of a sour grape with the beginning, and would have like 'my' French man to be a little more heroic, but in this case there was no surrealism so he did exactly what I most probably would have done myself (and run to the nearest confessional box!)Whilst in spoiler mode, toward the end I thought the behaviour of our main character, was actually quite out of character when he jumped on the German actress and strangled her. No comments I read seemed to pick on this? (E.N.D.)! But as some said this movie should be seen, although perhaps these days when everything is tolerated by and large; like on the packet of cigarettes, a word of warning would not go astray - such as 'might make you throw up', 'if you're not already mad you may suffer terrible nightmare' 'if smiling or belly laughing is not one of your hobby, don't think about it', 'if you like the truth, nothing but the truth we forbid you to purchase a ticket'.One comment, although very well written, puzzled me a little when it referred at a may be intended pun; stating that in French the word cow could have a double meaning. For the life of me I could not find any basis for this. I spent nearly my first 30 years in France, then searched various dictionary and could not see any 'vaginal' meaning for the word cow. Well there's always something to learn!Regardless I don't think you will die if you indulge and have a go at 'Inglorious Bastered'.",Null,2,5,17 September 2009

Crash," tutti fruity!
","Wow, I saw this movie last night on TV and the more I think of it the more I like it. I'm amazed at the divergence of opinions I can find in the reviews (only read a few but that sample was enough to show me some extreme thoughts on it) I'd love to write but don't really know how to, this is confirmed here by some very well written reviews. I must add, mainly the positive ones, some of the others somehow seem too bitter for me to... But I felt quickly this was an intelligent and honest account of what happens in a multi culture society...Funny the night before I saw an episode of George Gently based around racial prejudice, however this movie reachess much further and points out, regardless of their origin, people aren't 100% good of bad. Well this can also mean there is always a fork on your road and things will differ as you take either of those paths. I enjoy what this movie left me with and feel a little sad for those who did not experience the same. But as it is often said - That's how it is!",Null,0,2,3 February 2016
The Bodyguard," Body and Guard become soul mates
","I too have seen this movie at the theater a long time ago, and the memory of it was on the positive side as I've always appreciate K Kostner's work and don't mind W Houston voice although I would not go as far as declaring myself one of her fans. Yet her rendition of the song is so powerful, it has to be taken noticed of! So today when it was screened on our TV screen I decided to have another go at it and certainly do feel it was a worthwhile decision! I enriched my feelings about this film, beside my own, reading very interesting entries in IMDb. I understand now why Kevin Kostner reminded me so much of Steve Mc Queen. I won't repeat what others have already very well said and what is also fairly well documented in that regard. I am a little surprised too by the low average rating of what I think is a very entertaining movie and do share the thought that someone expressed already here; something like: There are too many snobs 'would be critiques' who look at this kind of work as it it was a piece of art fated to go in a dusty museum shelf and studied under a microscope for every possible imperfection, instead of its entertainment value. I consider myself having been well entertained and I guess I should give it a 10 just to rectify the balance, but who's counting! I did not feel W Houston acting was that bad either and what she delivered, to me, was fairly appropriate. A successful, talented singer who enjoyed the ride and wanted to make the best of it. Something I believe she did with her career anyway. So she probably just had to be herself anyway.",Null,2,5,11 December 2009
The Book Thief," hard time through children experience
","The book thief, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson! 2 actors I admire much... So I got rid of the TV commercial and prepared myself for a great viewing. I did get it; I have seen quite a few movies from this era and this topic. The first one would have been the one with its haunting music and a favourite introduction to classical guitar debut 'Jeux Interdits' (forbidden games) TBT is set 4 years before I was born therefore depicts a lot of things that are buried somewhere in my aging mind but, yes, ring a bell and wake up some emotions. As much as I enjoyed the film I was uncomfortable with some aspects of it. I did read a few comments before I wrote mine, knowing that each of us is entitled to his/hers opinion, and found some that like me beg questions. I don't read much so at least was not worried about how the film was loyal to the book yet wonder why in certain cases filmmakers seem to corrupt a well known book with changes that really don't do anything for the film... Some did comment about the accent, and the use of German words thrown about English spoken sentences. I too agree it was disturbing, especially when I could not understand the meaning of some of these words. I guess that in a book (read these were also used in the book) it's quite different, you can pause and, today via internet search, get the answer in seconds. This is not so at a theatre, even in my case watching the recording, you seldom read a book in one go, but a movie should not be interrupted. As for the accent I was not too demanding I took it as a little 'salt and pepper' in the mix to get a German flavour. I do prefer a foreign film with subtitle but here this is not the case, and I'm not sure if plain English accent (and which one!) would have had the same impact. All the same I repeat I enjoyed it very much",Null,0,0,6 March 2016
American Sniper," Snappy
","After gauging the feel regarding this A Snipper I know I will be in the minority with a negative review. I'm still watching and don't hope for much improvement.
I always felt Eastwood direction was not what I enjoyed the most about his career.
No one in their right mind would think war is a picnic and there are some very realistic moment in here but others, like phone call to the wife in mid action....
I also find it difficult too to avoid to see the irony of the bad guys in their own country and i guess trying to defend it, being so labelled.
As for the realism thank you for promoting once again a language I deplore having adopted. I mean every second word is F....k all this with a bible nearby.

Lion," And a hankee for me too!
","Heard of it 'Lion' with 'our' Nicole Kidman, so was looking forward to see it. I forgot it was the story of this Indian boy who got adopted but many years later had the urge to look for his mother. I had seen some excerpt of that story on TV and realised I was not going to see any safari! But what I saw was great. Dave Patel has become a true blue Aussie, but some memory about his youth come to haunt him and he has to act on it. At time it's very emotional. I always enjoy Nicole Kidman and was please to see the laconic David Wenham. Here he has not much screen or character time but it was good to see him. As for the young actor who plays the part before D Patel takes over, he's a joy to watch. You experience the life in a big city in India comparing to a privilege area in Australia and the contrast his huge, not that Australia does not have areas that you'd rather avoid. But it makes you ponder.",Null,0,0,14 February 2017

","Chasing big money by trying to sell no info can be really frustrating and also very funny. Yes I did laugh. But to me what a waste of good talent, I'm sure b grade actors would have managed just as well to get a good result. I certainly did not share the buzz some found in it. And I was a little surprised to see such heavy and intended language. Oh Adult it is! So I imagine that is how we hope our kids will become adult in their time ( i guess that they would need to reach this age first)! Yes I was aware it was a spoof, but going down the gutter with it because it's fashionable , it's nothing smart for me. We all deplore the bad language yet most of us. I'm not prudish and do curse more than my share. But it does not please me to get it in film. Perhaps I need to do an adult course to realise what it is exactly.",Null,2,4,11 April 2010
The Italian Job," Ini Mini Maxi Fun!
","Well almost! But I enjoyed writing this! Before getting here I read a few comments, I usually do! So I'll follow one of these's advice. I'll light up so, accept I had fun after all. One week ago I hired the 1969 version with M. Caine, for memories sake, I like Michael and did enjoy the return.(I'm over 60)Then the TV screened this one last night. Well I did the unthinkable I kept comparing them with a fairly biased attitude too with lot of knit picking, and almost spoiled it for myself. What really got me is that I actually forgot I had already seen it! Which probably means that I went through a fairly similar experience on the first watch and subconsciously tried to erase it out of my mind, How that for self control! But the minis came on, the bad guy coped it fair and square, the girl looked and drove 'good'. That's right what more do you want. I was wandering why they did not try to make a new movie on its own right rather than a remake (I understand it's claimed not to be a remake) well without the minis it would not in my way of thinking, and perhaps it would have been a more interesting work. Again without the minis...What would it have been? MB",6,0,2,11 March 2007
American Beauty," Pristine beauty!
","Really, what a beauty. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey before I came to see American Beauty. Here in his dead end role he is absolutely brilliant and so is the script. For those who think life is going the wrong way, here they may find comfort watching AB and realise that things can be far worse! In the leading role he find himself totally disconnected from his wife in a midst of a kind of artificial living style where he seems to have lost his identity and become just an accessory he finally shake it off and start a new life for himself. His teenager daughter also disconnected but really more like any one of her age unwillingly introduces her friend to him also contributing to his 'rejuvenation' However this friend may not be all what she seems to portray. His daughter also enters in a relationship with an unusual neighbor who himself has an unusual relationship with his unusual family. And this is all the unusual beauty of American Beauty. I would not say this is for everyone especially those not completely at home in the western society, or those being very sensitive to certain moral issues. I found it to be very honest with its sarcasm in exploring situations that some of us will recognise as real.",Null,0,1,6 October 2011

I had a little trouble to spot John Voight and did need midb to confirm he was... well by process of elimination I actually got it right. I did not mind either the romantic side of it, the improbable situation was a little uneasy to accept for me although I admit in such a mess as a war lot of things are possible and reality at time may surpass fiction. My last remark is about the second entry, I think (jan 2003), Some guy from London must have had in mind to dazzle other readers with his summary in French. I can assure you it does not make any sense and it's just as well because if it did and was offensive, it seems the moderator would have missed it.",Null,0,0,4 February 2006

Revolutionary Road," Mr&Mrs Unhappy, make others unhappy too
","I saw this movie last night and was looking forward to see it with such actors as Decaprio and Winslet. Although conscious of the period I had trouble to cope with over articulated, almost stage like dialog, perhaps a contradiction in term from me as I wish so often speech was clearer and so miss so much of dialog in many movies!Some praise the acting, to me it was a little more like 'days of our life'. I could not feel much spontaneity from the characters as if someone was whispering the lines for them to utter. Many have criticised the children absence, this one of the remark our group made during the viewing. So although it had something to retain your attention I think the name of the actors was the main drawing card. Having said this I think this particular theme and its treatment would have been better served with actors not so popular. I started to read others comments with the default filter (set to Best first) and was, I was going to say 'surprised' but not so, rather filled with a feeling of 'what did you expect'. Although there were some comments I did think rather fair, they did not reflect my feelings. So I turned the filter to ' I hate it' and there I found that there were quite a few people who shared my appreciation of this film. At both end of the spectrum as usual there were exaggeration. On the flip side I enjoyed seeing those great stars even on the day it did not tickle me pink. The fact it was a depressing story did not bother me, I like a laugh and a bit of action, but I also like people struggle story very much too, and I then accept it's not always a happy ending - just like in real life. So let's say it's not for all taste.",Null,0,0,28 May 2009

","Well those well wishers who wanted the film to go abroad, your wish is on the other side of the globe I presume. I have just seen it in Sydney Australia, mind you not in the big theatres, in an independent theatre with a modest crowd too. As for our viewing experience...Wondurbar (excuse my German attempt). Yes wonderful, I won't go over the plot, the characters etc. for two reasons. 1)I'm not too gifted in that domain, 2) It's all there many times in many pages if you care! What I can talk about is the way I felt during the screening and after. I was totally engrossed by the story, and for the story itself too, not for its credibility although I'm convinced it's in the scope of reality but for the way it was delivered. I did meet someone in relation to my job who told me what it was like to live in these days and this situation. He was from Hungary, if you've seen the film you might appreciate what Hungary must have been like in comparison to East Germany. Well yes in the final analysis it's a feel good movie but thanks to the clever direction it receives and takes. I appreciated so much the way the end is handled. I recently started to do something different with my visit to IMDb before 'putting my 5 cents' I read the default setting comments that is best first. Then I change the filter to 'Hated it' Because it's interesting to read why some people don't like a mostly popular movie. I did not tick their comments as helpful, yet in someway they were but I don't think they put their comments to win a popularity contest and I have little knowledge about the subject to take side, yet I can imagine the difficulty one would have to appreciate a work that portrays something quite different to what one believes to know very well. As for me the story worked very well the characters were so well represented and the ending somehow contributed to restored some faith in human beings",8,1,2,30 March 2007

It's something refreshing when you're presented with people who stand for what they believe and are influential enough to make an impact out of it.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Karma at its best
","Recently flicking through the TV channels... Oh 'The boy in the striped Pyjamas' I remembered this was a movie I did like! So I watched almost from the beginning as it had already started. This is a very sad film, and the saddest thing about it...NO spoiler here, is that I have seen it before and could not remember much about its details, only that it made me remember that it was a very good movie to my liking. And this is sad indeed, I have some difficulty to accept that it was almost new to me again, and how could that be, when some of the scenes are so powerful and well acted. Today I read a few comments here on IMDb and it's quite interesting how they express almost extremes opinions. One that seems to pop up a lot is the choice of language. Some feels that it should have been expressed in German or with some sort of Germanic accent or words perhaps. I disagree with this. Recently I saw the 'Book Thieve' and I found so inappropriate the use of a few German words here and there even if I wasn't too bother by the 'would be' German accent at the hand of English speaking actors. I personally feel that the transfer to a fully educated English dialog reflected better than otherwise the depth of the situation. After all if it had been a book wouldn't it be in pure English? Reason for this choice are said to be because it is a British film, this alone is a good reason as the Irish writing is the original therefore its thoughts are expressed correctly and not translated to its nearest meaning. Then if it is presented to an English speaking audience it's definitely a good choice. I do understand though that each country has its personal characters, and language with its own peculiarities of which cultural influence is one of them, thus may have a different flavour written in another language, but this is only of value when one is familiar with these differences, I don't believe the majority of the viewers would. Other comments do speak of improbability of certain situations in the plot... I don't believe this work claims to be a factual account of what went on during these terrible times. But it certainly is inspired by the horror of it. And it brings it through the eyes of the age of innocence in a very touching way. Innocence from those who could not know better because of their young age, but also innocence from those who were conned in believing they were doing a humanitarian salvage. In France I have been raised with negative feeling towards the Jewish presence and I did not need this film to tell me what Jews were, I believe most of Europe was also holding the same perception. Of course, to hold such thoughts is still a long way from acting on it as the SS did, but it certainly part of it. But let's not forget that human behaviour has not changed all that much. We're still not very comfortable with anything not familiar or posing a challenge. Race is still a problem, Sport, nationality, status etc. So anything that may be identified as a threat, a disadvantage or a suspicion may give rise to undesirable thoughts or actions. Some suggest we should read other work about the Holocaust instead of 'melting' over this story... I would say, some don't even believe or want to believe that such event happened. And here the brutality of these days I believe is factual, the unbelievable outcome of these event is also well documented and most reasonable people would accept it happened. The discordance between the German is also to be believed. I think each of them dealt with what happened then in their own way, mostly faced with a very difficult and dangerous 'hot potato' But some were brave enough and some lost their life to keep to their belief. I saw all this in this film...Will I remember it next time?",Null,0,0,17 March 2016
The Dark Knight," Total Chaos!
","Given vouchers to experience 'Gold Class' cinema, we ended up seeing this movie. I'm not really in comics state of mind so may be a little biased for starter. But my friends kids thought a lot of it and my wife wanted to see it so we went for it. I was not disappointed in my disappointment - Very loud, theatre shaking, story all over the place, dialog at time too soft for our 'seniors' ears - I was thankful for the great comfort and the 'Sunday' that turned up half way through the screening. Perhaps all these kind of movies should be shown only on Gold Class, at least you get other things to enjoy, and if by chance you like it you're really in for a great outing then. I'm very found of Heath Ledger, and like many will miss him dearly - Although he did a very good job with his role, I sincerely hope that it is not how people will remember him. I enjoyed some other older but famous actors, even if I thought they weren't doing themselves a professional favor. But as goes the saying it takes all kinds, only a few days ago I saw a guy on TV that had screwed little still horns on his head and wanted to upgrade this with, if I remember right, real bull horns. He was very rational about it and explained himself to the audience in a very intelligent and educated manners. So when I read the comments here that by the default were sorted by 'Best'. As such there were some ecstatic comments written with the full power of the English language. This was very impressive. However, since my feelings weren't so inclined towards this movie after reading some eloquent comments I switched the search to 'hated it' (I was looking for 'worst' but that what was available} and was 'pleasantly' surprised to find equally well written comments very much relating to what I felt about this movie. There is no doubt people will like it had it has a lot in it in way of action and special effects. I would recommend it to people who don't feel the need to feed their brain with something more substantial. Yeah, I'm trying to be a snob MM",4,4,10,30 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," Rubik Puzzle cinema
","I finally watched Pulp fiction! Somehow I thought it would not be a movie for me, and I was right. It did two things for me. It explained why I should not come here and put a comment although it also entertained me thoroughly. This could be conflicting statements but it just what happened. Yes I watched and understood very little but seeing those dead pan actors I enjoyed often in many of their movies was really a rewarding experience, yet it certainly did not enhance my self-esteem! For more understanding I read, here, Kilopod's review, the first fairly comprehensive review I scrawled to and found it very enlightening but it also may have led me to a sad conclusion about myself. I don't know if it is my hearing defect or my thinking defect that left me in the 'noir with that 'comedie noir'. There was a suggestion that one should see this work several times to fully appreciate it. Perhaps I'll need to hire a version with subtitle for my next viewing as dialogues in it are said to be 'the icing on the cake'... And perhaps for this particular movie 'spoiler'warning should be lifted or recommended as the more you know about the story possibly the more you will enjoy it.",Null,0,1,18 November 2016

","Several people get shot at random but in one action...Why and the story starts. This was my third viewing and I still enjoy it. Don't ask me about the book, was there one? I'm told yes there is one and the guy in it is huge! Wow I hope the readers enjoyed this. But frankly dears, I don't give a dime, I enjoyed the film as it is, I liked Tom in it, I like Rosamund P too and had a great time re-watching this, catching a few more details. I did not find it perfect. I did not expect it to be perfect so, for me all is good. Yes there was some unexpected semi comic portions that weren't really needed but what the heck, packages often come with extra. Yes this and that could have been done differently...Isn't this always the case anyway? Have a go at it, the chances are you will have a good time.",Null,0,0,26 October 2017
A Beautiful Mind," You've seen a summary many times
","Although I very much enjoyed the movie, there were a few things that held me back. Russel Crows unlike in 'The insider' is too much Russel Crows for my liking and I probably would appreciate more an unknown actor for the part. The other drawback, I have spent most of my working life in mental institutions as a nurse; although I do appreciate RC's effort to mimic schizophrenia it did not work for me and I had to imagine it was OK to go with the story. I remember having similar feelings for Jack Nicholson in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Mental illness is not often very glamorous or entertaining (but nonetheless, yes it has its moments!) I wonder though if the movie had any influence on mental illness services anywhere in the world? I would guess, probably not. Mb",8,2,6,15 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Allien invasion and destruction!
","I was looking forward to see this movie after enjoying Jeff Wayne (with Richard Burton's narration)cd treatment. But I was very disappointed. I read a few comments that did little to change the way I feel about the movie. OK great visual and special effects. But many times in the story these two words were knocking on my mind :'As If!' I would have preferred to see some realistic responses and events appropriate to such a situation, not that there weren't any, just some were anything but. The idea of treating the story revolving around a particular family with their own particular and today trivial situation was rather embarrassing to me as if there was a lack of sense of proportion and priority.",5,0,1,7 June 2006
12 Years a Slave," It's OK for some to be free of to be slaves
","Reluctantly I taped and watched 12 YaS, reluctantly because somehow I was prepared for it. It's not a very entertaining topic unless you have a taste for it. I read one of the comments stating he enjoyed the performance of the 'evil' wife...To each their own! Once again the disparity of the comments shows how we can differ from each other's. Some acclaimed this work with such enthusiasm whilst other saw another Hollywood stunt for success. In my state of mind I wanted it to be done and over with just to get an idea of what it really was. ...***And then comes Brad Pitt, I could not believe it but it was- I'll say no more about it! The fact being it's a true story does not rate high in my estimation. I don't think anyone believe slavery is a fiction, and I kept thinking all along the film - so it's OK for those genuine slaved to endure this hell and ***SPOILER***thank God and Brad Pitt (hoops did I...) this guy nearly became a white man again. Off course I realise I must I missed the point.",Null,0,1,16 October 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One goes against the grain
","2007, I re-watched this movie that left me with a great impression. When I first watched it, it was I think a little after my 1973 psychiatric nursing training in Australia and may well be the year it was made (1975). From hearsay I had learn that conditions in mental institutions were already much improved from previous years yet quite an eye opening for me. At the conclusion of the film I had mixed feelings about it. I found it much exaggerated to what I did know and experienced. Just the same I could identify so many situation that the movie recreated with such perfection that it was uncanny. The patients themselves were much convincing. The group therapy sessions also reminded me what I had resented in some of our own group session where patients were being manipulated to suite the session and or empower the leader rather than the 'client'. The revelation to the main character that many of the patients were voluntary is very well included and worth to remember to be true, well sometimes with a dash of coercion. Randal may be the hero there and may have many points right, none the less is no angel and his sanity is also questionable. I'm not too sure I go along mental health act regarding Illness versus Criminal behaviour, but won't go any further on this subject.I feel some comments got it right. He is a dangerous misfit who's being assessed about possible 'insanity' So we almost end up with a contest with the righteous psycho Vs the wrongful psycho. So back to 2007, I hired the DVD and enjoyed it immensely this time. I've alway been a fan of J. Nicholson, from '5 easy pieces' milk bar scene till now hardly ever a disappointment(I'm thinking of something Witches of ...) As for Nurse Ratched, no wonder she won an Oscar for best actress too. Denis de Vito...I thought that guy looked so much like him! I'm retired now and don't have that feeling to protect the image of this industry, not because or retirement but somehow I feel more comfortable about the present situation regarding patients (clients!) treatment these days. (Actually I almost feel that the scale is tilting the other way now). Mental health Care is a very complex situation, still with a huge stigma attached to it despite all kind of attempts to rename, disguise institutions and terminology. Let's face it who would like to have any of those patients discharged from the institution and become their neighbourg? Empathy has its limits. Saying this I also thought of our hero here; Would you like him to become your neighbourg too? But if movies generates a little awareness and soul searching into some of us this is something positive. On my DVD was also a commentary that seems to run along the movie again from producers, and other people. this was very interesting. It said that all (acting) patients. were actually actors, and so realistically that when J. Nicholson who turned up latter through the rehearsal was it seemed a little concerned. Another interesting thing is about him again and his dedication to his work, his 'homework' to his role that made it look so natural. His 'tirade' on the fake baseball game, I think, occurred 12 years earlier! And that apparently lasted much longer that what was taken for the film. Well I would recommend anyone to look at this as much as the movie itself, perhaps if it is your second go at it, watch this first then the movie to appreciate it even more.",8,0,2,23 March 2007
The Green Mile," Hell and Heaven meet on Death Row
","I'm pretty sure you did not wait for this commentary to find out about this masterpiece. And I'm not so sure you'll ever get to this if you're like me. That is after a few pages I usually don't have that much time I want to consecrate to more reading even if I'd like to. This being said, and what follow not said as well as I'd like to put it after reading other's brilliant and well deserved commentaries. All the same I'd like to add:'Please do yourself a favor and give it a go, you won't regret it' From the mousse to the giant they're all so good. They're all exceptional. The length of the movie may be much for some, It was fine for me. It certainly isn't a quick snack, it's a main meal! Just one thing, I had some 'plumbing' problems and I can assure you I was not fit for the fire brigade, but again I was not Tom Hank, Still I wonder how he managed...the distance.

The Reader," Bonjour Tristess
","I have difficulty to come here and give my two cents worth when I read such eloquent and so well written accounts of this work. I usually don't repeat the story for 2 reasons, one explained above and the second I know that there is usually a synopsis of every movie already given. So I just come here to share my feeling I resented watching movies. Here, like many, I reacted positively but with lot of pain and sadness. Thought provoking? Certainly as this film deals with many facets of our 'humanity' or the lack of it. The holocaust was such a surreal events that people who live with ordinary reality had trouble to perceive or accept. And the many who somehow were part of the tragedy, save the victims, weren't necessarily evil people as well. 'human' is such a quality or rather an adjective that can have extreme representation, the good Samaritan or the serial killer with almost everything in between. I personally saw an interesting introduction of this person who dealt with life the best she could but with lot of respect for what she was doing, and this was acknowledged by her peers and superiors at work. Her secrete handicap led her in a different direction although she applied the same integrity. Her logic defied those with higher intellect. The conclusion is well handled and fitting, and the acting all around was brilliant. Well this may already amount to 2 cents so I'll leave it to that.",Null,0,0,24 April 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," A man and a woman
","I recorded the movie and finally watched it not really sure what it was going to be. After watching it I came here, IMDb, as I was curious to see how it was received. Well I only read 3 'pages' of reviews and realised it was not very well received at all, but was happy to see some comments that seemed very positive, and honest to me. I did not mind it at all, I though it was an interesting portrayal of an unusual situation between two people. I do believe they were very attracted to each others. Our man was powerful with unusual desires but he just found someone quite special who may have been innocent and naive as some perceived her, yet quite her own person, however ready to take chances and explore unknown territories. People who crucify this film should perhaps have another look at their idol actors and find out what some of them were up to - or may be it is only rumours! I do grant those who have had a very sheltered life that they may not see anything interesting or pleasurable about 50 s of g. But personally even though I had to research 'BDSM' to understand it. I did not think this movie was a waste of my time or an abomination. Yet I felt the use of strong language in rare occasion was out of place and unnecessary here (Don't misunderstand me, there is not a single day I live without using strong language). I liked the look of both actors and did see some chemistry, a lot of chemistry between them....there must have been if there is a sequel! Sorry usually i omit the score bit!",Null,0,0,10 March 2017
Casino Royale," Did we really need another 'Bond'?
","I enjoyed the event very much, but why Bond? I have the impression that the producer felt the same too... ****SPOILER****! 'Stired or shaken?' Frankly my... sorry he did not say that - but he replied 'I couldn't care less'. ****End of Spoiler**** Well done! - James Bond like many I guess, for me will always be S. Connery then P Brosman would be my closest resurrection of it. Haven't we over done it yet? I really feel the movie was good enough in its own right without the need to be a James Bond movie, mind you I enjoyed the music theme at the end and join those who felt we could have heard a little more of it! But I missed the JB style that we nearly got to enjoy a little before the villain destroy is tailored suit. (oh no another spoiler!)

La Vie En Rose," Not all that 'Rose' after all!
","As an 'ex' Frenchman (firs 27 years of my life) I was pleased to attend a private screening of this film. I must admit I was very fond of Edith Piaf and knew her mostly through her songs. I always had some reserve about knowing too much about artists, my last deception was about Marlene Dietrich, whom I enjoyed much and somehow has a reference in this movie (this is actually a little odd, when justified comments mentioned the lack of exposure on other people who mattered so much in her life) Yes I'm not an historian and rather see people's art rather than their ups and downs, but somehow I may be alone in this department. In Sydney we had a show 'A star is torn' that revolved around great people with a tragic life and as you can imagine, Edith Piaf was not omitted! All this said I enjoyed the movie very much and the power of the french word in a french born mind were cause for very emotional feelings. I can't appreciate how it went for the majority of the audience who had to deal with the french translation but I did witnessed a lot of emotion there too. How one can measure the difference of appreciation? I had moment where it was a little too much for me, we were fairly close to the screen as we were treated with 2 live songs from a local performer before the film started. (I think she was local as I had not heard much of her before)and so we chose to seat somewhere in the center of the first ten rows. A friend of mine who also enjoyed very much the film summarised the (ordeal)this way. 'This was so much in your face'! and it really was. I'm thankful for some of the other comments I read that were so well written and gave me more insight in this movie adding to my enjoyment and also refreshed my memory of important parts of Edith's life that were somehow omitted. Well go and find it for yourself, I can't imagine you'll regret it. Lastly there was a mention of my favorite Edith's song, the one given by the soldier about to be sent to the front. Did she really had no regrets?",7,3,4,30 June 2007
The Deer Hunter," A grand movie about people affected by war conflict
","I have seen this movie quite a few times, and for my concern movies should be seen several times as there are so many things to see,discover,comprehend and remember in such a short time. I read a few comments by others, not all of them for they are too many to deal with. I see a movie with emotional eyes and this one worked so well for me. The critic often made about the weeding scene and the length of time and questioning its need to be there may hold for some. But if one goes to a museum one would see that some of the visitors are on the go at all time whilst others pause and take time to look at certain display. In a cinema this isn't possible one is at the mercy of the film speed, so I guess it's up to the director to make those choice for us. In this case it work for me. I won't go in detail why since it's been commented already by many previous entries. All I'll say I liked very much the 'display' of the wedding and found it fundamental to this work. Although I feel it has lost some of it's freshness, The Deer Hunter somehow remains at the top of my list. MB",9,0,0,4 April 2005

You'll get a laugh or thousand as it's built all around fun and funnies, yes little serious in this! When I open the IMDb site I was surprised though not to see Helen Miren in the cast list. I did not open the 'All' cast list as I don't think she should have been buried there! But I was so disappointed with the absence of coarse language... How can you make a movie without it? What were they thinking of? Didn't they worry about the adverse effect it might have on people who might experience withdrawal symptoms? I really felt like making a formal complaint- but I'm tired to complain about nearly everything I'll just let someone else do it for a change. Oh I'm sorry I realise only now this is a real spoiler.

After yawning a few times through it and pretending I was not hearing the inappropriate language, (Yes it was there just like people will put ketchup on any kind of food). The end came with some kind of relief. I did not entirely dislike it though and realised we don't have all the same taste. I have never seen Kick Ass which was mentioned by many reviewers and since I've almost stop drinking probably will never see any of them.

Green Book," Anyone would take a leaf out of Green book
","Green book...Nominated and winning this that and the other...'must be something I should see. So on this very Monday, midday, we went to Hoyts Sydney having a gift card for Hoyts and Green Book not showing near our place in these particular cinemas. Then I read it was a comedy? This did not sound as good as I thought it may be, feeling more interested in a racial conflict I understood it was... We got our tickets and in due time entered a little cinema. Little but so well furnished with spacious and reclining chairs! Our ticket also mentioned 'coarse language'; something not rating high on my wife's taste, how would she cope with this? After some 20 minutes of the 'usual' (allowing for some shut-eye on my part) the movie finally started.
I really hadn't read much about it at all, so did not expect to see a mismatched pair embarking in an unforgettable journey. I was so glad not to have any real idea about it. Yes racial difference it had, but it had also indifference of race and it was so wonderful. Why oh why were they only a handful of people watching with us? Yes it was a Monday and day time; still I would have expected more people.
Both main characters were so likeable in their own make up. You grew with them through the story and fell for them. Although they underwent some changes they remained themselves till the end. I have never heard or seen these actors before, so it was another bonus for me. It was not 'Guess who's coming to dinner' or 'Intouchable', but a charming yet thought provoking epic. If you were a little more curious than I am you would have to know it is about a white Italian American Bouncer in need of a job that is channelled to drive for a black 'gentleman' concert pianist who despite his talent and reputation is not immune to racism as we found about it during his epic tour about various 'united states'.
Both actors are so pleasing and I would not want you to fear about the coarse language, I did not resent or even remember hearing it. There were a couple of appropriate violent moments but quite obliterated by the good nature and familial portraying.
As for the comedy...There were a few very funny episodes.
This shows that it is still possible to deal efficiently with gritty topics without indulging in over used vulgarity and profane language.
And it was nice to leave the theatre rewarded with a contented feeling, again from me no rating since I don't believe in rating.",Null,1,3,18 March 2019
Atonement," Regrets don't always fix errors of jugement
","I really should have waited a little longer to gather my thoughts! I just switched off the TV and grew to enjoy this film very much. I was not really in the mood for a film but since it was recorded I decided to give it a go. I had to stay alert to keep up with the twist and turn of the beginning. Then I found it more and more interesting. Both females lead were giving such a good, but intriguing performance and the male lead was in the same league. I caught on early with what went on. However it did not spoil the story for me and enjoyed the development to the full story. I also liked the conclusion that made a lot of sense for me. I was haunted with the soldier character whom I could not remember the name but knew I enjoyed in some other work...IMDb helped me, it was Daniel May I had seen in Ronald Big TV show. 'Vera' a detective story whose episodes I enjoyed a lot gives a good appearance as the young man's mother.",Null,0,0,14 May 2016
