Walk the Line," Magic
","This is why movies exist. This is movie magic: It's alchemy, something that cannot come true without something unexplainable, and that something must be love. One other ingredient is story. Best stories, the only stories that matter, come from life. Life of human beings. Life of REAL people, LIVING people. And stories of real people don't get written down or made to any form of art too often. The reason is that real people are not too frequently any kind of artists.Artists themselves are not very often what I would call living human beings. In my experience they are many times more or less mentally 'ill' people, who run away from their lives rather than people who would confront it and live it. Which is of course totally contrary to the idea, that at least I have, about what an artist should be. Personal therapeutic art is a different case, but that is not meant or made to any other person than the patient.But Johnny Cash is a real human being. And I say IS, because in this movie, he lives. I don't know or even care about who got the Oscars, Oscars are sh*t anyway, same as every other prices: Nothing more than politics, if not even less. But Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is something more than an actor: He IS Johnny Cash. If you squint your eyes just a little bit, there he is. And that's a miracle: I really felt like I went to Johnny Cash's living life. I don't remember ever having that feeling in a movie. At least not in ten years or something. And Reese Witherspoon... It's so beautiful.From Mangold I've seen before the movie 'Girl, Interrupted', which I love (love, love). On the basis of these two movies, I say that Mangold is one of the three most important movie makers active and ALIVE today. I've seen maybe two thousand movies, but this is one of the few that matters.",10,3,5,18 April 2006
Hostel," A truly sick movie
","First of all, this movie made me wanna go to Amsterdam. All the fun seems to happen there. But it seems to be kind of fun that you need money to. Let's get serious. The set-up for this film is fascinating: It's realistic. The actors/directing are bad, but that doesn't ruin anything, as a matter of fact that fits to this kind of film. Also the photography seems a little pretentiously 'artistic' or 'raw', but that's also the usual standard in new movies. The 'after-effects' (coloring etc.) added to the pictures are also really ugly. (The pretentiousness brings to my mind Steven Soderberg, especially 'Traffic'.) It seems like no-one in the film crews today has any kind of artistic interests, or anything they want to say or do. They just do their job without thinking anything. Actually it's an ugly film in every way; Also the people and the portrayals of the human relations (and of course the 'human condition') are quite cynical. For example: All the women in this movie are brainless prostitutes. At least to me it remains unclear if the director wants to say something or not. The script is already so bad that I think no director could do a good movie of it. Or even want to try. It's a mystery to me why make movies (with millions and millions of dollars) without the slightest idea, point or inspiration, or any need to do something. Or maybe they just have to make up some work for the thousands of people who work in the film industry. The factories has to keep rolling, even if no-one would need their products. There is no life in this movie. I don't know is this movie supposed to be exciting or scary? The characters are so artificial and plastic that I cannot relate to them as human beings. I'm not interested at all what happens to them.A funny idea came to me while watching this film: Fassbinder could have done this. It has the same kind of overall feeling of total negativity and nihilism that he had in his films (except 'Angst essen seele auf' maybe). Of course Fassbinder's movie wouldn't have included this many 'exciting' or 'entertaining' plot turns or events, and it would have been visually even uglier than this. This is one of the most disturbed movies I've seen; It doesn't have any humor or balance (which for example all the 'gore' of horror movies I've seen do have), only total darkness and pessimism. I'm not the biggest fans of Tarantino, but I noticed that he has produced this film (and they try to sell it with his name for no doubt). I really wonder why he wants to support this kind of ****. He could put his money on charity or something. Or give them to me.If you want to see a movie that takes place in a hotel or a hostel, see 'Hotel Rhuanda' instead.",1,9,18,30 January 2006
The Italian Job," The robbery entertainment at it's best
","Very well made, smooth and light action-comedy entertainment. Good actors. This is maybe what Steven Soderberg would do, if he just could. This is not just some brainless buddy-comedy, like the movies of the mentioned (I mean the 'Oceans'11,12,13...'). This movie's characters are a little more realistic: They have dreams, pasts, feelings and everything. One problem with movies that have as much (main) characters as this, is that of course the characters cannot be very deep or developed.The money fetish is an interesting issue in these movies. But maybe it's just as good fetish as anything: People must have (or at least they very often want to have) something that gives their life some goals, excitement, hobbies... And like in this case, the money comes connected (after a tragic incident) to everything in these people's lifes, so deeply that they are ready to risk their lifes for it.I would say this movie is very much like the best few of the James Bond movies. The same kind of entertainment. Of course there is nothing political here, like in the Bond movies. It's all about the money...",9,0,4,9 April 2006
"I, Robot"," Secretly intellectual entertainment
","Proyas has become one of the most interesting and intellectual movie directors working today. And he's young also. His first, 'Crow', was quite simple romantic story. 'Dark City' and 'I, Robot' are very serious and deep, and on top of that, very entertaining.However Proyas' is not a very deep actor-director. His characters are straight from some comic books, kind of hollow and too simple. But that fits to the package, it doesn't disturb. It's his style. Someone else might do these stories in totally different style. But Proyas masters his own style perfectly.Surely this must be 'Big Willie' Smith's best acting role. Not Proyas' best, but very good anyway. There are very interesting themes in the movie: How other people don't (want to) believe somebody who knows something (maybe 'too much' of something), and tries to warn others. And in the end, when the truth comes out, the guy was of course right. And conspiracies... Not that this is the only movie handling these themes, but it's one of the best.",7,0,1,13 March 2006
Dark City," The power of the mind...
","This is an entertaining movie. It has to some degree the same kind of themes as for example 'Matrix' or 'Truman show', but I think this might be the best of these films (you could see them as a genre). This film brings to my mind some big and important works from the last decades, for example Paul Auster's 'New York'-trilogy. The casting is good, quite unknown actors. The bad guys, which are clearly a tribute to Clive Barker's Cenobites, are to my opinion a little bit ridiculous and not scary at all. They feel somehow artificial, but on the other hand that fits to the idea. This is not only the deepest and best of the films mentioned before, it is also one of the most intelligent films made recently. Respect. Recommended for everybody.",9,0,2,27 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Absolutely great movie
","I haven't read Wells' book. This was anyway happening in contemporary world, and some changes must have been made to the original story.As in the other 'dark' scifi films of Spielberg: 'Minority Report' and 'A.I.', the visuals are very beautiful and well made, just like everything else in this movie also. Spielberg must be the biggest film maker today in many ways, and in some way also the most important. He's the real mainstream voice of the world. Cruise is very good, of course, has he ever been anything else? Also Dakota Fanning, although I had some suspicions towards her, because of the 'child-actor' thing. This must be her best role this far.What was surprising to me, considering the story of the film, was that it wasn't in any way made to represent some 'problems of today': The aliens aren't symbolizing anything, they're just aliens, and the horror comes from the story itself. That's a great and brave choice.I think Spielberg has really become a movie director in the last years. His newer movies are deep, thought and important. Deep respect to him.",9,1,2,12 March 2006
