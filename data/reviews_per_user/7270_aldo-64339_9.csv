Hereditary," Very good movie
",Very good movie. Doesn't rely on horror cliches. Stellar performances all round. Turn off the lights and be prepared to be disturbed!,8,2,6,31 August 2019
A Star Is Born," Sickly Sweet.
","This is what happens when deluded, arrogant Hollywood actors think they can direct. Coopers performance is just awful; mumbled voice and his drunk acting is just so bad!
Lady Gaga is okay, but she doesn't come across humble enough in the beginning for her journey to be believable.
The whole film feels saccharine; sickly sweet. Even the cinematography is cheesy with all the lens flares etc.
Overall, the songs are okay, but I was never sold on the fact that Coopers character was an alcoholic nor a bonafide rock star. Without these things the film just remains pointless for me.",3,2,2,6 May 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese does a Coppola.
","If Scorsese had made The Godfather.. this is what it would have looked like. Great performances all round, but Pacino steals the show. A great movie that gives us an insight into the murky and corrupt world of US Union leader Jimmy Hoffa.
The effects are brilliant and to see Pesci, De Niro and Pacino all together is a dream! Recommend!",9,1,5,29 November 2019
The Godfather: Part II," One question....
","Undeniably, the greatest sequel ever made. However, one thing I will never understand.... Bruno Kirby. Why?",9,0,0,2 October 2018
The Revenant," Will be hailed as one of the greatest in years to come
","Sublime filmmaking and cinematography is probably some of the finest you'll see. Acting and story are both strong. This film is about mood; a barren landscape where characters are locked in a doomed wasteland. It takes you right there.. you can feel the cold, the anguish and struggle with every frame. This is art, not just a film. In years to come this will be seen as the masterpiece it is. Superb.",9,0,1,16 January 2020
Aliens," A mess and the CGI doesn't work.
","Compared to the first Alien, this movie is just a mess. Too many characters and the pacing feels off. I didn't like the CGI - felt like it tried too hard without the technology being available at the time to do it justice; it all just felt and looked fake.
The first Alien was classy, measured and the acting was a cut above this one.
I found it forgettable.",5,5,16,28 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Infinity War still untouchable
","Almost but not quite Marvel. A good effort, but way too many issues.
1. Why would Hulk take the stairs??? Huh??
2. No Hulk / Thanos rematch???
3. Why didn't Captain America sacrifice himself for Iron Man??? After all, Stark had a family etc. Instead we are focused on arguably the dullest Avenger.
4. Thanos was way too weak! Why???I could go on.... but anyway, you get the picture. Overall, it fell somewhat flat. The first hour is a little boring and by the end it feels like you've watched some kind of American propaganda video.
Must try harder Marvel.",6,2,3,28 April 2019
Joker," Makes The Dark Knight look like Disney.
","Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing.",9,11,20,13 October 2019
Stranger Than Fiction," Brilliant!
","This was a real surprise! I was hooked from the beginning. I won't go into the plot as you may already know what it's about.
This is a very unique movie, funny but darker than your typical Ferrell film. The cast are faultless and Dustin Hoffman must too get a mention here as he shows his class adding weight to an already talented bunch.
One slight criticism would be Maggie Gyllenhaal, I felt her part was slightly overplayed and a little cliche. Apart from this, a really entertaining movie!",9,2,2,8 August 2019
