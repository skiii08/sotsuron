Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The craziest Movie ever
",It is an anti-depressant. Has worked for me every time I watched it. Creativity in nonsense; ask Sacha for the answer. It is a way of life...just be stupid and see how life treats you. 'Sacha' I am begging you; for a sequel. This is needed very badly. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Borat talks to a person about the Parade (he has no idea that it is a Gay parade) and that these were the best people because they treat him good and accompanied him home. When the person tells him that this was a Gay Parade he exclaims 'You telling me the man who try to put a rubber fist in my anus was a homosexual?'
