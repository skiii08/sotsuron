E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Only one to detest this movie?
","I must stand out as the only person who detested this movie.  I found the 'in your face' sentimentality intollerable in the extreme - it was emotional manipulation of the most blatant kind.  I was irritated also by the assumption that aliens will be benign and harmless - the reality may be quite different as Independence Day shows.  I felt the  authorities were quite correct to take the precautions they did. While our record on pollution is far from brilliant, who knows what the aliens may be carrying? When I saw this movie in 1982 (in a packed house - rare in Britain at the time) I felt so different to those around me that I wondered if I were an alien!",8,2,4,16 April 2001
Full Metal Jacket," One of the most powerful, hard-hitting movies I have ever seen.
","This is one of the most powerful, hard-hitting war movies I have ever seen. From the opening, apparently innocent, haircut sequence we are led into the shock of basic training under a brutal sergeant.  We are shown the dehumanising experience of living in a closed world under the total control of this man.  We are shown what happens to individuals who are picked on by the sergeant (Private 'Pile'); the recruit is singled out for humiliation at every opportunity, including having to quick-march with his trousers down to his ankles.  In the end he is 'punished' by his fellow recruits with towels and soap.In the second half of the movie we are led into the real world of active service in Viet-Nam. Action scenes are shown against a sound track of popular music of the time, including Surfin Bird.  In the end we are shown the brutal death of a Viet-Cong fighter.This film is of significance to myself.  My generation in Britain escaped military service. But, my family nearly moved to the US in the fifties and I would have been of military age at the time the film was set!After 2001, Kubrick's best work?",10,0,0,6 May 2001
Independence Day," Healthy counter to ET
","I found this work a healthy counter to ET.  Where the latter shows aliens to be benign and harmless, and the authorities to be buffoons, Independence Day shows what may happen if we are complacent and the aliens have everything but our best interests at heart.  A good work.",9,0,1,16 April 2001
