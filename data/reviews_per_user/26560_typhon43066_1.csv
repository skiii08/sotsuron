The Ring," uggh
","This film isn't nearly as frightening as everyone touts it to be.  There are dozens of other horror films out there that build suspense and keep the viewer guessing much more effectively than this waste of $8.  You want to be scared?  Go look in a toilet at a frat house the morning after a kegger. If you want to be mildly amused and maybe get a 'first date' girl to latch onto you faster than she would otherwise, by all means see this movie.",Null,0,0,28 November 2002
