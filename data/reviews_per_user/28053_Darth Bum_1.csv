Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie... but you may have to see it twice to agree.
","I admit, as a Star Wars fan who stood in line 6 hours to get tickets, and arrived at the theater 2 hours prior to the first showing, my opinions may be clouded.The first time I saw TPM, I thought it was pretty good.  Definitely better than most critics had made it out to be; however, I did have several problems.  I felt that Jar Jar, and CGI characters in general, were overused and detracted from the film.  The pacing seemed to be a little off.The second time, later that day, I went into the theatre expecting these new changes.  The Phantom Menace is not A New Hope, and it is not The Empire Strikes Back.  I actually laughed at Jar Jar, and since I could expect what was coming next, the pacing didn't seem that bad and I could truly enjoy the film.The action sequences of this film are absolutely incredible, and the lightsaber battles blow the first three films out of the water.  The pod race was exhilarating.Think deeper than the surface layer of plot (which simply serves to introduce the characters for the next two movies in the series), and you will find many layers of political subterfuge, deception and extensive foreshadowing.  When Episode II and III appear, perhaps then will the critics realize the importance of The Phantom Menace.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
