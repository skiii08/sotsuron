The Rock," If you're going to San Fransisco, be sure to wear a Hazmat suit while you're there.
","Having stolen missiles containing a lethal nerve gas, a disgruntled war hero and his team of mercenaries seize control of Alcatraz, where they threaten to launch the lethal rockets at San Fransisco unless the government agrees to pay compensation to the families of dead US soldiers. With the help of ex-Alcatraz prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy Seals, chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) tries to prevent them from succeeding.I've been having a bit of a nostalgia trip as of late, re-watching some classic action films of the 90s; sadly, my second-hand DVD of The Rock was scratched, meaning that the picture regularly froze or skipped. After viewing, I put the bloody thing in the bin—which is ironic, I guess, since it's one of the few Michael Bay films that doesn't really deserve such a fate.Save for one frustratingly poor car chase scene between a Humvee and a Ferrari through the streets of San Francisco, during which Bay succumbs to his irritating habit of waving his camera around like a madman and cutting every two seconds, The Rock is a super-slick slice of big-budget gung-ho excess—extremely preposterous, highly explosive, and seriously over-dramatic popcorn entertainment, which its stars gamely play along with: Ed Harris shines as war hero turned terrorist Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel; Sean Connery plays Sean Connery (yet again); and Nicolas Cage acts like a lunatic as only he can.There are, of course, better action flicks from the 90s—this is still a Michael Bay film, after all—but it's good enough that I could be tempted to stump up one more pound coin should I see another copy at my local car-boot sale. Providing it's the 2-disc edition and it's not scratched, that is...",7,2,2,1 February 2012
The Devil's Advocate," Keanu gets a devil of a job.
","Hot-shot Floridian defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is head-hunted by New York's most powerful law firm, unaware that his new boss (Al Pacino) is The Devil.For The Devil's Advocate, director Taylor Hackford breathes fresh life into several well-worn satanic horror themes, skillfully weaving them into a slick, big-budget horror/thriller that delivers on many levels: it's smartly written, sexy, intelligent, and well-acted, with a particularly fine, lip-smacking performance from Pacino, who owns every scene he is in. Above all else, though, The Devil's Advocate is thoroughly entertaining throughout.The film is perhaps a little light on scares and gore for some horror fans, but there is a genuinely creepy atmosphere to compensate, the script is gripping and imaginative enough that one soon forgets about the lack of stuff like bowel-loosening jumps and exploding heads, and to top it all, Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen both get completely starkers. Great stuff!",8,11,14,18 February 2012
Ford v Ferrari," It's a winner!
","I'm no petrolhead. What little knowledge I have of classic cars I gleaned from playing Top Trumps as a kid. I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.In the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).Matt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).A classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.The legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!).",8,13,35,5 November 2019
The Blair Witch Project," Please excuse my incoherent ramblings: I was up late last night watching an over-rated horror film.
","I had always thought that arachnophobia—the fear of spiders—was the most common of phobias, but thanks to The Blair Witch Project, I now know better: the irrational fear of small twigs and pebbles is far more prevalent. It's the only explanation I have for the phenomenal worldwide success of a horror film in which stick figures and tiny piles of stones are considered to be the stuff of nightmares?Whilst I am, of course, fully aware that big sticks and stones can break your bones (as the childhood saying goes), inanimate small pieces of rock and the lesser of branches hold no real fear for me. As a result, I didn't find The Blair Witch Project anywhere near as frightening as the millions who are afflicted by Stickstonophobia (surprisingly, I could find no official scientific term for this widespread condition, so I coined this one myself!).Admittedly, I did find some of the strange noises that occurred during the night fairly creepy (after all, they might have been made by big spiders), and the way that the film-makers were unable to find their way back to their car was unsettling (I've lost my bearings in the woods myself, and this brought back bad memories), but the ending—when Heather and Mike enter the dilapidated old house at the end of the film—was simply frustrating: surely everyone knows that derelict houses are deathtraps.Sure enough, both characters lose their footing on the obviously rotten floors and die. Or something like that.",5,2,8,2 August 2010
The Mask," You'll love it when Carrey does the chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom!
","Not only does Chuck Russell's The Mask deliver one of Jim Carrey's best performances, a shed-load of brilliant anarchic humour, special effects that still look fresh today, and some excellent musical numbers, but it is also the film that introduced movie audiences worldwide to the charms of the delectable Cameron Diaz. In short, The Mask is SMOKIN'!Carrey plays mild mannered nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, who happens upon a strange mask that, when worn, enables the wearer to become a suave, indestructible heroalbeit a very mischievous one. Unfortunately, it also helps to get Stanley into a whole heap of trouble, after his wise-cracking alter-ego upsets local gangster Dorian Tyrell, first by ruining one of his heists, and then by making out with his gorgeous girlfriend Tina (Cameron Diaz).Director Russell expertly handles the non-stop madcap action, which is heavily influenced by the manic cartoons of Tex Avery and Looney Tunes (both are referenced in the film), and funny man Carrey gives his career the boost it so badly needed with an unforgettable turn that perfectly showcased his manic style, bringing him to the attention of Hollywood's big hitters.Packed full of eye-popping make-up and visual effects, and an even more eye-popping debut from Diaz (who sets the screen alight from the moment she saunters out of the rain, sexily clad in a figure hugging red dress), The Mask is 97 minutes of pure unadulterated fun for lovers of outrageous, zany, slapstick humour.",10,0,0,20 October 2007
Insidious: Chapter 2," The Further adventures of the Lambert family.
","After being scared s**tless by a series of spooky supernatural happenings (see Insidious: Chapter 1), Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) moves her family into her mother's house, but husband Josh (Patrick Wilson)—recently returned from the dark dimension known as The Further—isn't quite himself: his body is now host to the evil spirit of a serial killer known as The Bride in Black.Writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan's sequel to their atmospheric horror hit Insidious offers up several expertly executed scenes guaranteed to give goosebumps (although there's nothing quite as freaky as Tiptoe Through The Tulips), but the movie as a whole simply doesn't work as well as the original, being a rather muddled affair that jumps messily from one creepy scene to another with little regard for decent storytelling.The film frustratingly plays it fast and loose with its ghostly rules, its characters able to enter the spirit world at whim, or if they're only 'mostly dead' (as Miracle Max would say). Some dreadful attempts at humour from bumbling psychic investigators Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) also grate on the nerves.A cliffhanger ending leaves things wide open for the inevitable part three, but I sincerely hope that more attention is paid to the narrative next time around.",5,0,0,2 September 2014
The Benchwarmers," Warning: this comment contains gratuitous baseball terminology!
","If you love your comedies real stupid, then The Benchwarmers will leave you rolling in the dugout with its screwball humour. Right off the bat, this little gem, from Happy Gilmore director Dennis Dugan, delivers the zany laughs and oddball characters that should appeal to fans of similar 'whacky' movies (if you love Anchorman, Zoolander, Deuce Bigalow or Napolean Dynamite, then you should love this too).Rob Schneider plays Gus, a lovable landscape gardener who is friend to two nerds, Richie (David Spade), a video shop clerk, and Clark (Jon Heder), a newspaper boy. When Gus rescues a kid being bullied by the local little league team, he starts a chain of events which sees the three grown-up losers entering a baseball tournament, representing dorks all over the USA. With the games broadcast over the internet, the three quickly become the idols of geeks everywhere.But Gus is harbouring a secret which threatens to ruin his friendship with Richie and Clark, and their chance of winning the competition: at high school, he was a bully himself...Starting off as silly and quickly progressing to outright dumb, this movie managed to keep me laughing for the majority of its running time. Schneider is his usual reliable dopey self, Heder plays a character that is Napolean Dynamite in all but name, and Spader is great as the movie geek who rates a film's success by how many lesbian sex scenes it has. Joining these no-hopers is Jon Lovitz, who plays the ultra-nerdy billionaire who funds the tournament.The humour isn't very sophisticated (but then neither am I) and if you don't enjoy jokes about farts, bogies and midgets, then you would be best advised to steer clear. But for the rest of us who do, The Benchwarmers definitely hits a home run!And if the film drops the ball somewhat towards the end with a slightly overly saccharine finale that preaches forgiveness and understanding, it doesn't matter too much; the rest of the film is such dumb fun that it's easy to be a little forgiving yourself (see, even I learnt something from the film's message!)",8,0,1,7 February 2007
The Avengers," What a load of Chitauri.
","Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes—operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)—who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichéd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality.",4,4,9,21 April 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Nonsensical, but loads of fun.
","Judging by the amount of websites devoted to them, everyone seems to enjoy a good conspiracy theory (well, everyone except for the 'people in charge'); Disney's National Treasure movies take this obsession with all things secret, throws in some Indiana Jones style action and some pretty preposterous hypothesizing, and delivers a healthy dose of lightweight entertainment that it's difficult not to enjoy, no matter how silly it all gets.A star studded cast joins Nicholas Cage as he once again takes the role of treasure hunter Ben Gates, who this time must unravel all manner of hidden clues in order to discover the location of a lost city of gold and clear his family's name (which has been besmirched by rival treasure seeker Mitch Wilkinson, who links the Gates with the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln).This half-baked plot merely serves as an excuse for more far-fetched problem-solving and adrenaline-packed adventure, the likes of which made the first National Treasure so much fun: Ben and pals break into Buckingham Palace and the Oval Office, kidnap the President of the USA, career through the streets of London in a car whilst being chased by the bad guys, and ultimately uncover a lost temple laden with booby traps.Jon Turteltaub directs with gusto, ensuring that the story whips along from scene to scene at breakneck speed, and the excellent cast all do a great job, obviously having loads of fun in the process.My only minor gripe is that the character of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) is poorly defined: at first he is shown to be a ruthless villain, attempting to shoot the heroes and endanger the innocent; by the end of the film, he is portrayed as a misunderstood adventurer who is willing to lay down his life to save his rivals. Still, with so much else to enjoy, I'm willing to be a tad forgiving (at least no fridges get nuked in this film!!!).",7,2,3,15 November 2008
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The series is back on track.
","Rather ironically, the extremely disappointing Catching Fire all but extinguished my interest in The Hunger Games franchise, delivering more of the same, but with less regard for logic. Yesterday, I begrudgingly watched Mockingjay Pt 1 with my son, and was surprised at how much I liked it.What makes this penultimate chapter so much better than its predecessor—despite being rather light in the action department—is the progression in the story, which is now far more epic in scope, following Katniss as she leaves the confines of the Hunger Games arena to become The Mockingjay, the face of District 13's rebellion against President Snow and his dictatorship. What started out as a rather blatant teen version of Battle Royale has developed into a complex, gritty political drama wrought with emotion, its star Jennifer Lawrence now able to deliver a powerful performance worthy of her talent.Having fanned life back into the once dying embers, I hope that Mockingjay part 2 will end the series with a bang, packing in some of the action that this one clearly held back from delivering.",7,1,4,23 November 2015
Vertigo," I love Hitchcock but...
","Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold.James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond me—I struggled to stay awake.",5,13,22,26 September 2013
Black Swan," Not at all what I was expecting (I certainly wasn't expecting Kunis to do that to Portman!).
","For some reason I had been expecting Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning Black Swan to be an overly complex psychological horror/thriller, a real head-scratcher that would leave me thoroughly perplexed; instead, I was surprised at the simplicity of the basic premise: an obsessive ballerina spirals into madness whilst preparing for the lead role in Swan Lake. What makes the film so impressive is not so much the story—the descent into insanity has been tackled many times before—but rather the complexity and skillfulness of Aranofsky's direction, and the sheer power of Natalie Portman's tour-de-force performance as Nina, the frigid dancer who struggles to let go of her inhibitions to perfect the part of the Black Swan.Aranofsky's visuals are absolutely stunning, each meticulously choreographed scene executed with style and precision, the dizzying camera-work putting the viewer on the stage amidst the twirling dancers. Portman has never been better, utterly convincing as a fragile artist whose quest for perfection takes a terrible toll on her sanity. Her dancing is absolutely breath-taking, while her sexier moments—a sneaky spot of masturbation and an oral sex scene with fellow ballet star Lily (Mila Kunis) reveal an actress willing to take considerable risks to nail her role (while giving her straight male/gay female fans something to fantasise about for years to come).",8,0,2,10 March 2015
Scarface," Make way for the bad guy.
","Recently, Calais has been under siege from refugees/immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe/Africa, desperate to get into the UK via the Channel Tunnel. This put me in mind of the opening scenes of Brian De Palma's Scarface, in which thousands of Cuban refugees flood into Florida looking for US citizenship. Time for a re-watch, methinks (any excuse).Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who, having arrived in the US, does anything it takes to live the American dream. Working for a local crime boss, Tony gradually climbs the gangster ladder of success, accruing the wealth and power he desperately seeks, eventually becoming a major player in the cocaine smuggling business—but he makes more than a few enemies along the way.Scarface, by director Brian De Palma, is a dark fable of greed, corruption, violence and power, the moral of which is that, in the end, crime never really pays, the film culminating with a nihilistic finalé in which almost nobody lives happily ever after. Oscar winner Oliver Stone's script is far from subtle, a deliberate exercise in excess; De Palma directs accordingly, with grandiose visuals and OTT violence aplenty, while star Pacino delivers a suitably larger-than-life performance, making his brutal coke-snorting Cuban one of crime cinema's most unforgettable and enduring characters.The film also benefits from solid support from Michelle Pfeiffer as Montana's love interest Elvira, Robert Loggia as Montana's crime boss Frank Lopez, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's sister Gina (owner of Florida's biggest hairdo), plus a wonderfully atmospheric synth score from Giorgio Moroder.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,2,5,13 August 2015
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I like.
","Sacha Baron Cohen brings his best creationthe Eastern European TV presenter Boratto the big screen in 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', a movie which follows the (somehow) likable Jew-hater (accompanied by his friend Azamat Bagatov) as he makes his revealing documentary about life in the USA.Cohen cleverly (and rather bravely) uses his naive, racist and sexist Kazakhstani character to expose the bigots and idiots that often give the US a bad name, whilst simultaneously delivering some of the funniest cinematic moments in recent memory.Whether it is an average Joe on a subway train, a group of frat boys on a road-trip, or a room-full of people at a seminar, absolutely no-one is safe from Borat as he reveals a country brimming with hatred, distrust, and intolerance: it's a sad moment for the human race when Borat politely introduces himself to a stranger, only to be met with threats of violence.Of course, Borat's style of comedy is not going to be to everybody's taste: the more conservative of viewers may balk at the toilet humour and bad taste gags; rednecks and religious extremists will more than likely froth at the mouth at particular moments; and many Eastern Europeans probably won't like Cohen's portrayal of one of their own. The rest of us, however, should have a whale of a time.Some of Cohen's schtick might seem a little old hat to those familiar with Borat from UK TV, and, occasionally, the film has the tendency to feel somewhat staged (the Pamela Anderson segment is rumoured to have been set-up), but the movie's outrageous highlights more than make up for these minor quibbles.And if you're intending to watch this film on DVD, make sure to catch the hilarious deleted scenesone word: cheese.",8,13,24,18 March 2007
Alien 3," An interesting, but ultimately disappointing, third Alien movie.
","***This review is of the original theatrical cut of Alien 3***James Cameron's slam-bang all-action blockbuster Aliens was always going to be a hard act to follow. Relative newcomer to the director's chair, David Fincher, bravely stepped up to the plate, delivering a dark, moody and rather Gothic third chapter which featured a single creature and a cast comprising mainly of British thesps. Audiences everywhere, expecting an adrenaline rush similar to the second movie, were sorely disappointed and Fincher got a smack-down.I have mixed feelings about the film: whilst it is true that the film certainly has its problems (in particular, poor pacing and a lack of effective action), it is still an interesting effort, with some fine performances, beautiful art direction and a well developed nihilistic atmosphere.The opening credits sequence sees the cryogenic pod aboard the Sulaco, containing Hicks, Newt and Ripley (and the remains of Bishop), ejected into space after a face-hugger runs rampant and causes a fire.The pod crash-lands on a planet inhabited by dangerous criminals and, in a plot development that I find rather inexcusable, both Hicks and Newt bite the big one (kinda makes Ripley's actions in Aliens seem rather pointless, don't you think?). Ripley (and the unseen face-hugger) is transported to a nearby colony where the inmates have formed a kind of religious order; these sex starved nutters are dismayed to see a woman enter their domain, viewing her as a threat to their vows of celibacy.But after the sneaky face-hugger finds an unfortunate mutt in which to shove its ovipositor, and a hungry alien eventually emerges, the prisoners become rather thankful for the ever-resourceful Ripley's presence.Fincher's confident handling of characterisation and careful development of a pervading sense of doom is certainly admirable, as is his eye for a well framed shot, but it is in his handling of the later action scenes, in which survivors attempt to lure the alien into a trap, that he becomes rather unstuck. Overusing his novelty 'Alien-cam' POV shots, the novice director delivers endless tedious shots of people running down corridors whilst screaming. Difficult to follow, due to the dizzying camera-work and muddled editing, these confusing sequences lack tension and excitement. It's a misguided attempt to tackle chase scenes in a new way, that just doesn't work.A downbeat finale, in which Ripley dies, also receives a mixed reaction from this viewer: part of me sees her high dive into a furnace as dramatic and poignant, representing the ultimate sacrifice (with Weaver adopting a Jesus Christ pose as she dies); the other part of me sees her demise as totally unnecessary and a very disappointing way to finish off a really great character.Supposedly, the longer 'Director's Cut' of Alien 3 is an improvement on the theatrical cut, and it seems to have its fans, but I imagine I would still deem it to be something of a letdown in comparison to Alien and Aliens.5.5, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,1,8,17 May 2007
Gremlins," Joe Dante's magnificently manic monster movie.
","Director Joe Dante proudly wears his influences on his sleeve in this excellent Spielberg-produced demented comedy/horror about mischievous creatures that run riot in the sleepy town of Kingston Falls.Referencing all of his favourite films and cartoons, including The Wizard of Oz (the film's villain is Oz's Mrs. Gulch in all but name), Looney Tunes (check out the sound effects Dante uses), Disney (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs features heavily in the story), and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Joe has a blast allowing his toothy critters to (very amusingly) wreak havoc in typically Spielbergian small-town America.Hoyt Axton plays Rand Peltzer, a less than successful inventor who buys his son Billy (Zach Galligan) a most unusual Christmas gift: a creature called a mogwai (which he names Gizmo). This impossibly cute bundle of fur comes with a strict set of rules which are inevitably broken. The result is a horde of vicious foot high monsters that set out to cause trouble wherever they can.With the help of Gizmo, and gorgeous workmate Kate (the always stunning Phoebe Cates), Billy sets out to destroy the gremlins.Although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters (the kitchen attack scene, in particular is quite frightening), Gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages. My kidsaged four and sixlove this film (although I admit that I have been gradually conditioning them: one of the toys they have had from birth is a bendy Gremlin!). It really is hard to resist the movie's non-stop manic and zany comedy (the Gremlins are a hoot as they break-dance, get drunk, play poker, and sing Christmas carols!).Sure, some moments are perhaps a little too daft (personally, I don't understand that rule about not feeding a mogwai after midnight, and I can't fully accept the scene where Gizmo drives a fully functioning Barbie car) but excellent animatronics courtesy of Chris Walas, a nifty script from Chris Columbus, loads of in-jokes for fans of fantasy films (look out for blink-and-you'll-miss-them appearances from Gremlins producer Steven Spielberg and animator Chuck Jones, an appearance from Forbidden Planet's Robbie the Robot, a stuffed ET toy sat between a cuddly Sylvester and Bugs Bunny, and the Time Machine from the 60s George Pal movie) all go to make Gremlins an unmissable treat.And its got Phoebe Cates in it too! Which means it gets the full 10/10.",10,1,4,3 September 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Better than the first two.
","J.J. Abrams is the director for part three in the Mission: Impossible franchise, meaning that there is an excess of lens flares but also a surfeit of top-notch action making this one yet another small step in the right direction for the series.This time around, retired agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes back in the field to try and apprehend Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a sadistic arms dealer who is trying to get his hands on a device code-named 'The Rabbit's Foot'. In doing so, Hunt not only puts his own life at risk but also that of his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan).Where parts 1 and 2 were sparing with their action scenes, Mission: Impossible III's pace is much faster, Abrams going all out for tension and excitement, including a superb helicopter chase through a wind-farm, Hunt breaking into the Vatican to capture Davian, an explosive attack on a bridge, and a perilous leap for our hero from one skyscraper to another. As slam-bang Summer blockbusters go, it definitely doesn't disappoint, even though the plot does tend to get a bit silly at times (yes, the rubber mask disguise routine makes an appearance and is still as daft as ever).In the supporting roles, Hoffman makes for a very credible villain, Monaghan is likable as Hunt's Achilles heel, Simon Pegg is reasonable enough as comic relief tech geek Benji Dunn, and Maggie Q supplies the glamour as IMF agent Zhen Lei (while also adding appeal for the Asian market). Billy Crudup and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, on the other hand, are forgettable and Ving Rhames is sorely wasted.",7,3,4,31 March 2017
Lucky Number Slevin," Not as clever or as stylish as it thinks it is.
","This makers of this film really wish it was Pulp Fiction. They've tried to emulate Quentin Tarantino's non-linear story telling, his staccato rapid-fire dialogue and his offbeat characters...hell, they've even got Butch on board, with old Bruce playing a Tarantinoesque assassin. What they haven't got, though, is the ability to take all of these ingredients and whip up a feast for the eyes and ears the way old QT can.Writer Jason Smilovic's best moments don't even rival QT's worst, and the overcomplicated plot isn't half as clever or as slick as Smilovic obviously thinks it is: a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (played by Brad Pitt-alike Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a gang war waged by two crime lords, The Boss and The Rabbi. Slevin must use his wits (and the help of a feisty neighbour, played by Lucy Liu) to ensure his survival.What Smilovic obviously thinks is witty and clever, sounds stale and hackneyed, and Paul McGuigan matches the writing perfectly with a half-assed attempt at 'stylish' direction, in which he incorporates every contemporary (and overused) trick in the book. A great cast, which includes Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, struggle to make the script work, but even they can't save this wannabe from being anything other than average.",5,10,21,15 August 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Gave me a headache. Pass the tablets
","Jared Leto plays Harry, a junkie who, along with pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), hopes to make a killing buying drugs and reselling it on the streets; meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) becomes dependent on uppers in a bid to lose weight ready for an appearance on a TV game show. As time passes, Harry winds up with an infected arm, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) resorts to prostituting herself for her next fix, his mum goes completely loopy, and Tyrone ends up in prison.I understand that, having graduated from film school, a young director will be keen to show off some of what they have learnt. In Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky goes all out, chucking in everything including the kitchen sink. Not one second goes by without a 'cool' film-making technique being thrust in the viewers face, whether it be split screen, time lapse, rapid repetitive editing, or Snorricam. It's all there, to such an extent that it pulls the viewer out of the film, as opposed to immersing them (which I believe was the intention).Aronofsky is so enamoured with his clever visual trickery that he neglects to develop his characters beyond the basics or tell a decent story beyond the bleeding obvious: that drugs are bad.",4,0,7,11 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Meesa not alika thees!
","The Phantom Menace: just the title alone is enough to send shivers up the spine of anyone raised on the original Star Wars trilogy; just what was George Lucas thinking as he penned and directed this long awaited prequel? (being a cynic, I imagine it was the umpteen gazillions of dollars he would make from the sale of toys and commercial tie-ins).Perhaps the most notable thing about the film is it's distinct lack of fun: trade embargo negotiations, taxation, and treaties are enough to bore the restraining bolts off an Artoo unit, and the majority of the cast perform their roles with the dry seriousness expected of a Shakespeare play at the Old Vic, rather than a pulp space opera.But even when his actor's aren't sending us to sleep delivering their monotonous political discourse, good old George fails to entertain, with action scenes ruined by an over reliance on cartoonish CGI and embarrassingly bad slapstick humour (delivered by one of the most irritating creations ever to grace the silver screen, Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best).Also serving to irritate is Jake Lloyd's pivotal performance as Anakin 'Ooops' Skywalker, which is absolutely dire, the supposedly cute moppet eliciting feelings of murderous rage within this particular viewer rather than the presumably intended sense of pathos at his character's ultimate fate (it's no coincidence that this film marks the end of both Best and Lloyd's movie careers).And don't even get me started on the 'midichlorian' nonsense that robs the whole franchise of its sense of mystery and wonder, Anakin's accidentally saving the day, the woeful waste of the film's best character, Darth Maul, or the film's supposed highlight, the pod race, lacking genuine excitement thanks to its predictable outcome...Oh well, at least John Williams' score was good.",3,9,18,12 September 2010
Sucker Punch," Big-budget, steam-punk flavoured junk.
","After attempting to shoot her abusive stepfather, but accidentally killing her sister instead, blonde hottie Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent to a home for the mentally insane where dear old step-daddy pays a member of staff to organise a lobotomy for the traumatised girl. In the five days leading up to the operation, Babydoll plans to escape with the help of several equally attractive female inmates (played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung), but repeatedly retreats into an elaborate, make-believe realm to help her cope with her situation.Director Zack Snyder was the man responsible for the historically inaccurate, CGI-laden, homo-erotic movie adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', which bored the hell out of me thanks to an over-reliance on CGI effects, the absence of anything resembling a decent plot, waaay too much slow motion, and the fact that buffed-up Spartans really aren't my thing.Sucker Punch thankfully replaces the lightly oiled pectorals and abs with tantalising shots of scantily clad babes (an exposed thigh here, a bare midriff there), but still suffers from a glut of digital trickery (to realise Babydoll's amazingly detailed, steampunk-styled, imaginary world), a total lack of substance, and Snyder's continual misguided belief that playing out matters at half-speed (to the strains of a dreadful emo-goth-pop soundtrack) somehow lends emotional gravitas or dramatic intensity to proceedings. Also a major detraction is the fact that at no point during the film are the girls ever in real danger, all of the incredible action—the battles against stone samurai, zombie Nazis and fire breathing dragons—only ever occurring in the mind of Babydoll.But perhaps most irritating thing of all about Sucker Punch are Snyder's desperate attempts to disguise the film as anything other than the masturbatory fantasy it so obviously is, the thin veneer of female empowerment, confusing 'dreamworlds-within-a-dreamworld' set-up, and emo-friendly themes of sacrifice and redemption not fooling this viewer for a second.",4,4,11,2 July 2011
The Expendables 2," A big improvement over the first film (not difficult, I know).
","A team of highly trained mercenaries, led by grizzled battle veteran Barney Ross (Sly Stallone), are tasked with retrieving a computer that details the location of a stockpile of Russian weapons-grade plutonium. Their mission is a failure however when The Sangs, an army of brutal killers (boo hiss!), led by the sadistic Villain (ah, why not go the whole hog and just call him Villain?), snatches their prize, killing The Expendables youngest member, Billy (Liam Hemsworth), in the process. Mightily upset, Barney and pals go looking to settle the scoreThe first Expendables movie was a bloody mess, thanks to a weak plot and Sly Stallone's excessive use of scrappy CGI, digital blood effects, and grainy shaky cam, a technique that made every action scene impossible to follow; when you make a Jet Li fight scene look unimpressive, then you've got problems. The iffy CGI and digital gore is still present in Expendables 2, but this time around it's Simon West (Con Air) behind the camera, and although he's never been nominated for an Oscar, he does a much better job than Sly at delivering the action-packed goods. The level of enjoyment to be had is so much higher when you can actually tell what is happening.For maximum satisfaction, ignore the moral dilemma of both The Expendables and The Sangs essentially being cut from the same cloth, both sides being bloodthirsty killers for hire, happily blasting their way through countless adversaries in order to line their own pockets—just settle back and admire the excessive cartoonish chaos. It's all very silly at times, of course, and not what you could ever describe as genuinely thrilling, but there's so much outrageous violence on offer that any self-respecting action movie fan should be more than happy, especially with Arnie, Bruce and even Chuck finally getting in on the explosive action as well.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,0,0,31 August 2014
Skyfall," Double 0-verrated.
","After the disappointment that was Casino Royale, I decided to give Quantum of Solace a miss altogether on account of the very mixed reviews (to date, it is the only Bond film that I still haven't seen); Skyfall, on the other hand, had been getting such unanimous glowing praise that I simply had to check it out for myself, if only to confirm my suspicions that viewers had been letting their sense of relief that it didn't suck as much as the last two films to seriously affect their judgement.Just as I imagined, those who have been claiming that this is the best Bond ever are only fooling themselves. The film begins in great style with an incredible chase scene, one that really gets the adrenaline pumping, but this promising starts only serves to highlight just how badly mishandled the rest of the film is. With far more conversation than chaos and a running time of well over two hours, Skyfall really drags in places.The introduction of Javier Bardem's Silva, an intriguing mix of John Malkovich from In the Line of Fire and both Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, improves matters slightly, giving the plot some much needed focus, but the overall lack of action and adventure is still all too apparent (the only other memorable set-piece being a spectacular underground train crash/chase scene), as are the script's more convoluted elements and irritating plot holes.The final act, which culminates in a showdown between Bond and the baddies at his family pile in the Scottish highlands, fails to save the day, being atypically Bond in almost every respect: the locale is dreary, the cinematography is dark, the weaponry outdated, and the overall tone way too sombre.It's a shame, because Daniel Craig makes for a good 007—I just hope that they give him the Bond project that he deserves before he gets too old to play the part.",6,13,30,2 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Comic-book cinema how it should be: fun!
","So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn, means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they are as enjoyable as this one.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,18,30,11 January 2015
The Ring," Verbinski's Horror Succeeds
","Journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates the existence of a strange videotape that, according to an urban legend, causes the death of anyone who should watch it, thus making it the ultimate video nasty. After locating a copy of the vindictive VHS, Rachel not only decides to watch it, but also lets her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) have a gander, and leaves a copy laying around for her son Aidan (David Dorfman) to see!!! Needless to say, the legend proves to be true, the tape allowing the vengeful spirit of freaky murdered girl Samara to literally scare viewers to death.As someone who can actually be bothered to read sub-titles, I generally dislike it when Asian horror hits are remade to appeal to a Western audience, particularly since very few of them turn out to be as effective as the originals. Gore Verbinski's The Ring, however, is a genuinely worthy effort, because instead of simply being a quick Hollywood 'cash-in', it is actually a lovingly crafted movie.Storywise, Verbinski's film stays fairly faithful to Hideo Nakata's Ringu and effectively replicates its creepy atmosphere, but The Ring avoids being just a slavish copy by expanding on certain plot points, providing a few crowd pleasing jump scares along the way, and best of all, by being as visually impressive as possible, with coloured tints and CGI effects used to great effect throughout (I usually moan about such things in modern horror films, but here they actually work).I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Ring is better than the original, but I think it is equally deserving of a watch.",8,3,3,11 January 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Even Spielberg doesn't make 'em like this anymore.
","Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. René Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!! Now that's what I call quality family entertainment!",10,7,12,19 June 2010
Spartacus," I don't like Braveheart much either.
","I don't want to come across as a philistine, but Spartacus doesn't half go on a bit and is one hell of a downer. I know that the film is intended to make the viewer feel inspired by the indomitable spirit of man in the face of terrible persecution and oppression, but after three hours of such, I found myself struggling to care. The dull political machinations of the Roman senate and the aimless wandering of the slave army do little to help matters; I've never been so grateful for an intermission (the DVD retains the original mid-movie break, during which I splashed my face with cold water to wake myself up).It all starts off well enough, with slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) sent to gladiator training camp, where he gets a crash course in survival before escaping his confines to lead others in revolt. But then it really starts to go pear-shaped, star Douglas doing his utmost to outdo Heston in the historical epic stakes by spouting over-sentimental, moralistic dross about the importance of freedom in countless maudlin scenes that virtually deify his character—after which he lets down his thousands of followers by leading them into battle against the Romans like lambs to the slaughter.The best thing about Spartacus is its impressive cast, which not only includes heavyweight performers like Olivier, Laughton and Curtis, but also includes tens of thousands of nameless extras, allowing for some wonderful vistas of the Italian countryside swarming with slaves, and a brilliantly staged (and brutal) battle scene, proving that, as clever as CGI is these days, nothing looks better than the real thing. Peter Jackson, eat your heart out!",5,4,7,28 November 2015
Resident Evil: Afterlife," More of the same... so I'm happy.
","Having sat it out for parts two and three, Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the director's chair for Afterlife, the fourth film in the Resident Evil series; rather unsurprisingly, his film is another slick, effects packed horror/sci-fi hybrid with the emphasis on glossy 3D action set-pieces rather than character development or plot progression. As such, the film is unlikely to alter the opinions of those who haven't enjoyed the series thus far, but the rest should have a blast...Anderson occasionally goes a bit over the top with his Matrix-style visuals, particularly in the film's opening scene, which utilises an excess of bullet-time effects and gravity defying acrobatics, but for the most part his handling of the action is pretty impressive. There are loads of effective scares, the slow motion gives Jovovich and Larter fans plenty of time to appreciate the stars' physical form, and what the film lacks in originality, it sure makes up for in energy.The film might owe a lot to other genre classics for inspiration, but once the action kicks in, Afterlife proves to be a very entertaining time-waster indeed. Not all of it makes sense, but with survivors of the zombie apocalypse seemingly comprising of at least 50% hot women capable of kicking major butt (check out that shower room scene with the massive monster vs Alice and Claire for sheer awesomeness) this proves to be another satisfying entry in a consistently fun franchise.",7,7,13,7 July 2012
Deja Vu," Much, much better than the last Washington/Scott movie, Man On Fire.
","Even Tony Scott's irritating tendency to over stylize his direction cannot stop Deja Vu from being a great piece of action cinema. The complex and involving story, coupled with great performances from its talented cast (including Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel) ensure that you soon learn to ignore Scott's annoying visual techniques and concentrate on the story being told.Washington plays Doug Carlin, an ATF agent called in to investigate a terrorist explosion on a New Orleans ferry. Impressed by Carlin's efficiency, FBI Agent Andrew Pryzwarra asks him to join a special team who are utilising a high-tech piece of surveillance equipment to try and solve the crime.The boffins on the team tell him that their top secret gadget reconstructs the crime scene in 3D via some satellites and a whole load of computer imaging software. Carlin (quite rightly) suspects they are lying to him, and eventually manages to get them to tell him the truth: the machine is able to warp the fabric of space, enabling them to actually see into the past.Carlin wonders whether it might be possible to use the machine to actually travel into the past in order to prevent the ferry disaster, and also to save the life of a beautiful woman who somehow holds the key to the identity of the terrorist.Starting with the simply amazing destruction of the ferry (one of the most impressive cinematic explosions I have ever seen), Deja Vu keeps the momentum going right to the exciting climax in which Carlin is sent into the past to confront the maniac responsible for the bombing. Like many time-travel tales, the story throws up the possibility of all manner of paradoxes, and one is advised not to question the science too much, but just sit back and enjoy the ride.",8,1,2,10 December 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Super-schmaltzy Spielberg sci-fi.
","Nearly 25 years ago, Steven Spielberg gave us this hugely successful blockbuster about a boy who befriends an alien stranded on Earth. As a fourteen year old, I lapped it up and thought the film was brilliant. A quarter of a century later, how does the film stand up to the test of time?Not as well as I had hoped, actually, it being one of Spelberg's most schmaltzy and saccharine movies ever, with several scenes feeling more than a little contrived. To this now older and wiser viewer, the film feels less magical than I originally thought it was.Spielberg gets great performances from his cast (particularly from some of the younger, less experienced ones on whom the film heavily relies) and delivers plenty of iconic moments, but parts of the film tend to drag whilst, if you analyse the movie enough, other moments make little sense. Only Spielberg's ability to expertly manipulate his audience allows him to get away with some otherwise unforgivable 'plot devices'.I don't wish to dwell on these 'niggles', suffice to say that it's hard to believe that a superior intelligence would allow itself to be stranded in the first place, and that a creature able to communicate telepathically and make objects fly would need to rely on a 10 year old boy for help.Those that are less pedantic than I will undoubtedly have a great time, but the more I think about the film, the less I like it. If you saw it as a child and loved it, my advice is not to watch it againyou may come away disappointed.",6,1,2,26 December 2006
It," The Right Stuff.
","It's a brave man who takes on the role of Pennywise the clown after Tim Curry's scene-stealing turn in the original miniseries, but this second adaptation of Stephen King's novel sees Bill Skarsgård making the character his own, turning in a memorably different take on the shape-shifting monster that preys on the kids of Derry, Maine (this time in the summer of 1989).Buck toothed with glowing eyes, a disquieting voice and a truly sinister smile (plus a few impressive dance moves), Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise sure is the stuff of nightmares, the actor more than deserving of the praise he has garnered. His is not the only great performance in director Andy Muschietti's re-imagining of the King classic: the kids who play the plucky youngsters who fight back against the monster are all excellent, with Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard putting in a particularly memorable turn as wisecracking Richie Tozier (he gets all of the best lines!).Fright-wise, I can't say that I was ever on the edge of my seat, nor did I jump (years of watching horror films has made me difficult to scare), but I was thoroughly entertained throughout. My daughter, on the other hand, frequently hid her eyes behind her hands, as did the woman sat next to her, so the film clearly had the desired effect on those two.I rate It an impressive 8 beeps out of 10, and look forward to the next movie.",8,6,16,9 September 2017
Hereditary," I couldn't relate.
","Horror films are supposed to create a sense of dread, deliver scares or gross the viewer out: Hereditary did none of these things for me. I spent over two hours watching a simple tale play out at a snail's pace and became very bored in the process. Save for the 'accident' that sees little girl Charlie (Milly Shapiro) losing her head, there's very little of note that happens until the big reveal at the end, which really doesn't come as that much of a surprise (watch Rosemary's Baby, The Wicker Man, and Race With the Devil to see how to do this kind of thing properly).Judging by the reviews here on IMDb, Hereditary is very much a Marmite movie, but I fail to understand what its supporters are so fascinated by. Several questionable plot points alone make this a failure in my book (seriously, who would drive off leaving their sister's head on the roadside?). I put it on a par with production company A24's other slow-burn horror The Witch, which also left me scratching my head wondering what all the fuss was about (at least I could understand what they were talking about in Hereditary, which is something I suppose).",3,4,14,7 October 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Too goddamned orange and blue.
","There are many reasons why I hate this film—it's unexciting, far too serious given its dumb premise, full of overblown CGI sequences, and gets far too bogged down with trying to cleverly integrate the fanciful with the factual when it should simply be content with entertaining the viewer—but most of all I hate this film because it is so orange and blueNot content with p**sing me off with his terribly dull storytelling and ridiculously showy directorial techniques, director Timur Bekmambetov sees fit to tint almost every scene orange, blue, or a combination of the two. Why, I'll never know, but any enjoyment I might possibly have gleaned from this mess was totally ruined by the fact that I was too preoccupied by trying to guess which colour was coming next.",2,1,6,20 October 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," There's fun to be had for classic cartoon buffs, but it's not great.
","Contrary to popular belief, not everyone loves 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'. I appreciate the creativity and imagination involved, but there are several things about the film that have always bugged me.Firstly, and most importantly, Roger himself: I really dislike his voice and mannerisms - he should have been loveable, but instead he's thoroughly irritating. When much of the film revolves around such an obnoxious character, we're not off to a good start.Secondly, the animation: it's clever the way it is integrated into real-life (although not as ground-breaking as it is claimed to be - remember Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks?), but I hate the soft shading used to give a supposedly realistic 3D effect; I'd much prefer simpler cel shading or none at all.Bob Hoskins always seemed to me like a strange choice: he doesn't suit the role of a tough, hard-drinking noir-style detective. He's too short and pudgy.The plot is kinda dull: some tommyrot about a missing will, real estate deals and a plan to build a freeway. Yawn.And the run-time of 104 minutes is unnecessarily long.On the plus side, Christopher Lloyd is great as villain Judge Doom (scary enough to give young kids bad dreams), Joanna Cassidy as Eddie's love interest is yummy, there are some fun cameos from classic cartoon characters, and the final fight that makes use of lots of Acme products is inventive.On the whole, I find the film to be passable entertainment, but it's not one that I like to revisit all that often.",5,0,10,22 August 2019
Minority Report," Full of imagination.
","Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo's H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story's inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg's occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it's not 'nuke the fridge' bad).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the 'sick stick' a police baton that makes the victim projectile vomit.",8,9,12,7 December 2016
John Wick," The subtitles got on my wick.
","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a bad-ass: an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement after the son of a Russian mafia boss steals his car and kills his dog (a parting gift from his dead wife). Busting out his weaponry, Wick cuts a bloody swathe through countless bad guys en route to his target, always finishing with a shot to the head.The problem is that Wick is TOO much of a bad-ass. At no point did I feel like he was in real danger. Even after receiving a gash to the stomach the size of my fist and taking a severe beating, Wick makes Liam Neeson in Taken look like a pussy, escaping every situation with a flurry of fists and feet and umpteen carefully aimed rounds. It's as though he doesn't feel pain. It's hard to feel a genuine sense of excitement knowing that our hero (if a ruthless killer can be called a hero) is virtually indestructible.The action is well staged, and the level of violence is high enough to please many fans of the action genre, but I was left feeling more than a little empty. In fact, I was hoping that Wick would die at the end to finally be reunited with his wife (and his dog), but seeing as there is already a John Wick 2, the chances of that happening seemed quite low.5.5/10, rounded down for the novelty subtitles. Really, ordinary subtitles would have sufficed.",5,2,4,8 July 2017
Kung Fu Panda," A bad ending spoils this otherwise enjoyable film.
","Po is a panda (voiced by Jack Black) who dreams of being a kung fu master; however, being a little on the large side and just a waiter in a noodle shop, the chances of him realising this fantasy seem relatively small. But when Po leaves work to witness the selection of the Dragon Warrior (the mighty martial artist who is destined to save the valley from dreadful danger), he somehow finds himself chosen for the position.Now, with only days before the arrival of the villainous Tai Lung, a powerful snow leopard with destruction on his mind, can Po learn the secrets of kung fu in time and become the hero he so desperately wishes to be?Although Kung Fu Panda has a lot going for itcool animation, great characters and some wonderful gags (which work particularly well if you're a fan of martial arts movies) I'm going to go against what seems to be the general consensus, and declare that I thought the ending sucked, and spoilt what might have been an otherwise excellent adventure.Following loads of wonderful action, plenty of laughs, and some mystical mumbo-jumbo about a magical scroll that contains the secret of unimaginable power, Kung Fu Panda turns into a weak morality tale, preaching that real strength comes from belief in oneself. Whilst I think that being confident and comfortable with who you are is a wonderful sentiment, I do think that a positive mental attitude only gets you so far, and that the mighty rhino-bashing Tai Lung would've torn Po a new one! End of.Some fans argue that Po used his weaknesses (ie., his fat) to his advantage, deflecting his enemy's more powerful moves; others say that after Tai Lung realised that he could not improve his powers through the use of the Dragon Scroll, he lost his confidence. I say 'hogwash!'.Tai Lung was a highly trained juggernaut of rage who easily fought his way past guards twice as bulky as Po and defeated five of the best warriors in the country (does that sound like someone lacking confidence to you? I don't think so). Po should have been turned into panda paste.Of course, there is the theory that once Po worked out that he all he needed to do was be himself, he finally realised his destiny and became the fabled Dragon Warrior. If this is the case, then it's a lame, wishy-washy idea that isn't explained very well .Either way, the ending spoils the film. And that's a real shame.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,6,10,21 July 2008
Gravity," The effects are unbelievable, but so is the script.
","Astronauts Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are stranded in space after a freak accident.There that's the story out of the way, now let's concentrate on the real reasons why this film is being heaped with praise: the spectacular special effects and awesome 3D.With every shot of Gravity begging the question 'how the hell did they do that?' and some really great use of the latest 3D technology, this big budget special effects extravaganza is a sumptuous feast for the eyes from the very first frame to the absolute last, director Alfonso Cuarón pulling off feats of visual trickery even more unbelievable than Ryan's ability to survive the film's repeated disasters.If you're able to ignore the script's sillier moments and some glaring scientific plot-holes, Gravity should prove to be a stellar experience; if you're looking for something resembling a great story, or have an particular interest in space exploration, prepare yourself for the possibility of crash and burn.7/10 purely for the visuals.",7,3,7,19 November 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Don't crucify me, but I don't think it's that great.
","What I am about to write might upset some people. Hell, many comedy fans would even say that I was being blasphemous, but here goes...Life Of Brian isn't THAT funny!There, I've said iteven after multiple viewings, I still find the Life of Brian, Monty Python's tale of an ordinary man who is mistaken for the Messiah, to be rather disappointing as far as belly laughs are concerned.Sure, it's a very quotable film, the sets and cinematography look great, and it certainly has a lot of valid things to say about the stupidity of religion and it's followers (who are, let's face it, often pretty stupid!), but I honestly feel that much of the movie's comedy just doesn't work, and actually feels rather laboured. I mean, is a speech impediment really THAT hilarious?I'm not saying that I am not amused by any of the Python's silliness: there are definitely laughs to be had, particularly at some of the more absurd moments (after all, who can keep a straight face at the phrase 'wolf's nipples'?), but, with the complete adoration that Life of Brian receives from it's fans (particularly from students), anyone would think it was the second coming.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,26,57,31 December 2007
Mulan," Not one of Disney's best, but still good fun.
","When China is attacked by the Huns, the emperor enlists one man from every family to help fight the savage invaders. In order to save her father (the only male in her family) from what would probably be certain death, beautiful Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place. Aided by Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon, and a 'lucky' cricket, Mulan learns how to be a soldier, saves the day and still has time to steal the heart of a dashing captain.Disney's adaptation of the Chinese legend of Mulan is a well animated and entertaining tale, but one that may not appeal to younger children due to its rather slow start and historical setting. Technically the film is superb, with some lovely stylish oriental flourishes to the animation and superb action scenes, but the unmemorable songs are less than impressive and many of the supporting characters lack the 'personality' we have come to expect from recent Disney films.Although definitely not a 'classic', Mulan is nevertheless still entertaining fare and, let's face it, even a poor Disney movie usually has enough merits to warrant a viewing (unless it's the Black Cauldron or Cars, of course!).",6,1,2,25 September 2006
Se7en," This ain't a seven: it's got to be at least an eight or a nine.
","I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon—more specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against—a masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision—a visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie.",9,1,4,11 February 2012
Wayne's World," 20 years old—which makes me middle-aged (why, God, why?).
","Wayne's World—which it's hard to believe is two decades old this year—still provides me with a good time, Mike Meyers' unique brand of surreal humour still managing to tickle my ribs, the music still causing my head to bang (only perhaps not quite as hard), and Tia Carrere still making me wanna go 'Schwing!' . I don't know how much of this enjoyment is down to nostalgia—I was a metal/heavy rock fan in my twenties when I first saw the film—but my kids seem to enjoy its random, scatter-shot craziness just as much as I do, despite not understanding many of the 90s cultural references (and, thankfully, some of the more 'adult' humour).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for being able to whisk me back to a time when torn jeans, mullets and rock music ruled (I listen to BBC Radio 1 these days and I silently weep for the modern generation).",8,1,1,9 April 2012
Unbreakable," A different kind of superhero film.
","The first time I saw Unbreakable, I desperately wanted it to finish with Bruce Willis's character drowning in the swimming pool, his first attempt at being a true hero also being his last: it would have been exactly the kind of dark, ironic twist that I like. Having just watched the film again, I'm now more comfortable with M. Night Shyamalan's chosen ending: it's just as perverse, with it's pitiful villain Elijah—clearly insane—having killed hundreds, if not thousands of people simply to validate his own existence. Now that's dark!While not quite as brilliant as M. Night Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense—the pacing is perhaps a little too slow at times to make for the perfect experience—Unbreakable is still extremely compelling, telling the tale of a seemingly ordinary man, David Dunn (Willis), who has lived his life with a nagging sense of dissatisfaction, but who gradually comes to realise that he possesses extraordinary powers and finally answers his true calling. Instead of going down the corny comic-book route of having its hero sporting a spandex uniform to patrol the city streets, Unbreakable tackles the subject with a sense of realism, and is all the more riveting for it.Star Willis puts in yet another very credible performance under Shyamalan's impeccable direction; together the pair have made what must be one of the most intriguing and innovative superhero films ever made—and without the aid of any (discernible) expensive special effects.",9,0,1,18 June 2016
Star Trek," Set phasers on 'Disappoint'.
","I don't speak Klingon, I know nothing about the technical specifications of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and I can't recite the complete history of Starfleet. Hell, I don't even know what the correct term for a Star Trek fan is (is it Trekker or Trekkie? Beats me!). I do, however, have an affection for the original TV series, having watched it as a youngster in the 70s (at teatime, after school), and I really wanted to like this film.Oh well...Beyond some clever casting (the majority of the actors assembled here convincingly playing younger versions of the Enterprise's original crew) and the inclusion of some nerdy details designed to appease die-hard Trek fans, this is a failed exercise—another seriously flawed and over-worked piece of mainstream Hollywood nonsense. The film's unnecessarily complex and confusing time-travel story is riddled with irritating contrivances and plot-holes big enough to fly a Romulan mining craft through, while the rapid editing and an over-reliance on 'everything-including-the kitchen sink' CGI effects only add to the chaos.If this is the standard of film-making we are expected to endure, I can only hope that this rebooted franchise will not 'live long and prosper'.",5,12,20,5 June 2012
Fight Club," Scrappy.
","After whinging to his doctor about his insomnia, a frustrated office worker (Edward Norton, whose character is simply called The Narrator) is advised to attend a support group for testicular cancer to see what real suffering is like; there, he experiences an emotional release that finally allows him to get some much needed shut-eye. Consequently, The Narrator becomes addicted to support groups, feigning illness to attend, but the appearance of another such 'tourist', Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), makes him feel awkward about his dishonesty, and he once again struggles to sleep.While flying home from a business trip, The Narrator strikes up a conversation with travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The pair part company at the airport, but when The Narrator discovers that his apartment has been blown up in a freak accident, he calls the number on Durden's business card. The guys meet up and strike up an unlikely friendship which sees The Narrator discovering another solution to his sleep issues: bare knuckle bouts with Durden. Eventually, other guys looking for a release from their mundane existences join in the fun, and Fight Club is born.For a film dealing with ***Spoiler Alert!!!*** dual personality, it seems only fitting that I'm in two minds about Fight Club.I appreciated the sentiment that 'you are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank, you are not the car you drive, you're not the contents of your wallet', but disliked the script/story as a whole, which is full of contrivances, inconsistencies and quasi-intellectualism.I loved the dark humour and the brutality of the fight scenes (although cannot accept for one minute that men would line up to be beaten to a pulp), but I hated director David Fincher's showy approach to the rest of the film, which is over-reliant on slick CGI trickery (that actually looks very dated by today's standards).I admired Edward Norton's performance, but disliked Pitt's, and hated Bonham Carter's.I hated the silly twist that could be seen a mile away, but was amused by the subliminal image that appears seconds before the end, and enjoyed hearing The Pixies over the closing credits.To reflect my mixed feelings about Fight Club, I give it a middling rating of 5/10.",5,1,4,31 January 2016
Train to Busan," First class all the way.
","Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.Using his confined location—a packed intercity train—to maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,18,31,18 September 2016
Citizen Kane," Essential viewing for fans of classic cinema (along with films like The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Babe: Pig in the City).
","It's been nearly 80 years since the original release of Citizen Kane and I imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows the secret behind 'Rosebud', the final word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) immediately before popping his clogs. But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.Somehow, I made it to the ripe old age of 52 without seeing Citizen Kane, but finally popped it in the DVD player to see what all the fuss is about, and while I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece myself (I believe I have very different criteria to most for that accolade), I did enjoy the film, finding it an engaging study of a powerful character, brilliantly portrayed by Welles, who goes convincingly from cocksure youngster with big ideas to an old man with more than a few regrets over the course of two hours.Told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances of Kane, to a reporter trying to unravel the meaning of Rosebud, the film flits back and forth through the wealthy man's life: his childhood, when his parents became filthy rich and sent him East to be schooled; his building of a news empire; the Great Depression; his two marriages; a failed political career; and old age, as a recluse in his sprawling Florida mansion, Xanadu. It's a rocky ride through the ups and downs of Kane's life, in which the happiest moments were before a shed load of gold made him one of the richest men in the world (which should be a big clue as to what Rosebud refers, if you've spent your life living under a rock and don't already know).The lack of a gratuitous sex/shower scene, ninjas, barbarians, talking animals, cyborgs, exploding heads and dwarfs mean that Citizen Kane doesn't get full marks from me, but even though it's far removed from my usual fare, I still had a good time (Welles had a great eye for an interesting shot, that's for sure). 7/10 -- glad to have finally ticked it off my list of essential classics.",7,1,2,27 March 2020
Monster," A rather skewed account of a killer hookerwatchable thanks to Theron and Ricci.
","Based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, man-hating hooker and serial killer, this film is intended to show how society, through lack of care and compassion, can create a monster.Sexually abused as a child, and treated badly by nearly all men ever since, Aileen (Charlize Theron, almost unrecognisable with lank greasy hair, buck teeth and carrying a little extra weight all over) is a prostitute whose hopes and dreams of a normal life have long since been crushed. However, after meeting Selby, a lonely lesbian (Christina Ricci), she develops her first meaningful relationship, and begins to make plans for the future: to quit whoring, get a job, and settle down.But since Aileen's only qualification is a degree in giving head from the University of Life, getting a real job is next to impossible, and pretty soon, she goes back to walking the streets for a living.Then, after one particularly nasty john gets rough, her pent-up anger finally boils over and she shoots the man. Finding his wallet loaded with cash, she realises that she now has a way to get her hands on enough money to enable her and Selby to afford a decent life: all she has to do is kill a few more loathsome customers.Although the film has been lauded by many critics, I found Monster to be a rather unexceptional film, being rather dreary, with an over-long running time, and a script that is seemingly economic with the truth in order to suit its own agenda (from what I have read, Wuornos was far less deserving of pity than is shown in the film, having never actually acted in self defence).However, thanks to a solid central performance from Theron (for which she won an Oscar), and good support from Ricci, who makes a believable dyke, Monster is still worth a watch. Theron's transformation from screen goddess to white trash is truly incredible, and the actress effortlessly manipulates her audience, allowing them to feel sympathy towards her character (we understand her plight and can even forgive her for her actionsat least until she begins to blow away less 'deserving' victims).It is also probably our only chance to get to witness a prolonged tongue session between Theron and Ricci (although both actresses are unfortunately looking far from their best).",6,0,3,28 December 2007
The Maze Runner," Cube for kids
","My immediate thought while watching The Maze Runner was just how close the whole premise was to Vincent Natali's sci-fi horror Cube (1997), both films featuring a group of people who wake to find themselves in a strange environment with no memory of how they got there. The big difference is that, where Cube was a brilliantly executed low-budget thriller with nail-biting tension and a thought provoking ambiguous climax, The Maze Runner is a mega-budget blockbuster that, for much of its running time, moves like molasses, and which ends leaving questions that we know will be answered, just so long as we shell out more cash to see the next couple of instalments.Obviously, at 47 I'm not exactly in the intended demographic for this film, but I do feel that this one missed the opportunity to be a hugely entertaining adventure for all ages. When the characters are in the maze, running for their lives from the grievers (metallic insectoid monsters), or dodging the changing architecture, the film is actually very enjoyable, but far too much time is spent in the relative safety of 'the glade', the idyllic green area at the centre of the maze where the boys first wake up. With my son currently reading the series of books, it's almost certain that I'll have to watch the sequels; I just hope that they make it a little more exciting next time around (and don't cut the film to reduce the UK rating to a 12 certificate. Grrrrrr!).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,3,4,3 April 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Bold, brutal and brilliant.
","Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude.",9,0,0,22 May 2014
Underworld," Slick, undemanding fun.
","A comic-book style monster flick designed to appeal to goths, teens, teen-goths, and middle-aged men (my demographic!) who like hot young women in figure-hugging rubber outfits, Underworld squeezes sexy Kate Beckinsale into a shiny black costume, equips her with some serious firepower (a pair of hand cannons almost as big as she is) and sends her out hunting werewolves. The result is a slick piece of mainstream horror that, despite lacking any really effective scares or a genuine sense of excitement, still offers enough fun to make it worth a watch.Beckinsale plays Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior embroiled in a centuries-long conflict against a race of werewolves known as 'lycans'. Driven by a desire for revenge against the creatures that she believes slaughtered her family, Selene has dedicated her life to destroying the lycan, but after rescuing a human from an attack by her hairy foes, the sexy bloodsucker discovers that all is not as it appears to be between the two races...Director Len Wiseman's cast are all ridiculously attractive and impossibly cool, sporting the the latest in Gothic chic; the blue-tinted, rain-drenched cinematography is far more impressive than the rather forgettable plot; and nobody does anything without looking great whilst doing it. However, although Underworld is undoubtedly a case of style over content, it still manages to be pretty entertaining.The script, by Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, writes its own rules and includes such inventive gimmicks as ultraviolet and silver-nitrate bullets (for use against vampire and lycan respectively); there are some very impressive CGI werewolf transformations; the wonderful Bill Nighy gives a terrific performance as head vampire Viktor; and lots of noisy shootouts and fights (during which Selene never seems to be in any real danger) mean that things rarely get dull.Films like Underworld won't change the face of horror cinema, but at least they're enjoyable for the duration.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,0,0,30 January 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Star Wars Universe is back on track.
","I'm a little late to the party, but for what it's worth, here's my two cents on Rogue One, the direct prequel to the original Star Wars, which shows how a brave group of rebels risked all to acquire the plans to the Empire's latest weapon, The Death Star.After the disappointment that was The Force Awakens, I went into Rogue One with low expectations, which only served to make a very good film even more of a pleasure to behold. What we have here is a vast improvement over J.J. Abrams' unimaginative retread of A New Hope, a standalone spin-off story that is surprisingly dark, violent and gritty, especially considering that it is a product of the House of Mouse. Director Gareth Edwards tells his gripping tale of hope, bravery and sacrifice with an assured hand, delivering engaging characters (with a droid—K-2SO—stealing every scene 'he' is in), pathos, humour and, of course, excitement, the excellent action set pieces a marvel to behold (the rebel X-wing fighters attacking the Imperial Star destroyers is breath-taking).If this is the standard that Disney has set for future films in the Star Wars Universe, then I'm back to being a faithful fan. 8.5/10, happily rounded up to 9 for IMDb despite the patently CGI Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.",9,5,18,24 December 2016
Coraline," A stunning 3D fantasy.
","Having already watched and loathed two movies based on Neil Gaiman tales—Mirrormask (1/10) and Stardust (3/10)—I was extremely hesitant about seeing Coraline, but was ultimately lured by the promise of an extra dimension (I'm a sucker for a gimmick).And to my amazement, I loved every minute of it.The perfect viewing choice for anyone who adores dark, twisted fantasy—or for parents wishing to warp their children's delicate minds (the film contains disturbing imagery guaranteed to upset kiddies of a nervous disposition)—Coraline is an absolute tour-de-force of exquisite story-telling, stunning 3D visuals, breathtaking animation, wonderful music, and brilliant voice-work (from a cast including Dakota Fanning, desperate housewife Teri Hatcher, and my least favourite comedy duo of all time, French and Saunders).Gaiman's freakish story follows 10-year-old Coraline, the frustrated daughter of inattentive parents, as she ventures through a mysterious hidden door in her new home that leads to a seemingly perfect alternate world, complete with extremely considerate and caring versions of her mother and father. The fact that everyone in this doppelganger dimension has buttons for eyes is a little unnerving perhaps, but Coraline doesn't mind, so long as she gets to keep her eyes.So when her new, button-eyed parents offer to keep Coraline forever, just so long as she agrees to a new pair of plastic peepers being sewn onto her head, the little girl decides that perhaps her real home isn't so bad after all. However, her alternative mother is keen to hang on to Coraline, hoping to feed off her life-force, and isn't about to let the girl go without a fight...Other bizarre and memorable characters include Wybie Lovat, Coraline's 'stalker'/friend (who helps save the day), Mr. Bobinsky, the gangly legged owner of a musical mouse circus (who provides the highlight of the film, as his talented rodents put on a spectacular show), and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two strange, old actresses with a collection of stuffed Highland Terriers (and whose past performances include the dubiously named 'King Leer' And 'Julius Sees-her').Although I highly recommend seeing this film in it's full 3D splendour—the FX definitely add impact to the visuals—Coraline's narrative is so engaging that, even without the added depth, it proves to be unmissable stuff.",9,1,3,17 May 2009
This Is the End," Hell is watching this film for all eternity.
","What a great concept for a film: the biblical Rapture occurs, leaving behind a group of self-obsessed, degenerate actors and celebrities to cope with the Apocalypse. What a shame, then, that the on-screen 'talent' involved are—in my humble opinion—amongst the most over-rated performers in Hollywood today, making this a virtually joyless experience for yours truly and anyone else who has ever suffered through a Seth Rogan film and been left wondering how he, and his regular co-stars, came to be quite so successful.According to the trivia section here on IMDb, about 50% of the film was ad-libbed, and it really feels like it, opening with a full 15 minutes of utterly inane chit-chat between undeservedly over-privileged stoners Rogen and Jay Baruchel that only a fellow partaker of the weed could possibly find funny (but then, when you're high, anything seems funny). The scenes of chaos as the Apocalypse occurs provides some relief from the unscripted drivel, with a few fun deaths for some of the stars (seeing Rhianna fall down a huge chasm to her doom was like a dream come true), but the film soon settles back into puerile garbage mode, the guys discussing each others dicks and ejaculate ad nauseum until the appearance of a couple of well executed CGI demons that sadly fail to rip the obnoxious survivors to bloody ribbons of flesh.",3,8,17,24 September 2013
Dawn of the Dead," This is how remakes SHOULD be made!
","One of the few remakes of recent years that is actually worth watching, Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead takes the basic plot from George Romero's 1978 original, in which survivors of a zombie outbreak barricade themselves in an abandoned mall, and strips away the social commentary whilst cranking up the action, delivering a white-knuckle ride of flesh-eating terror.A nerve-shredding pre-titles sequence see Ana (Sarah Polly), a pretty nurse, narrowly escaping with her life after her neighbourhood is rapidly over-run by the living dead: nasty, snarling, nightmarish creatures that, unlike in Romero's movie, can run like the clappers. All around her, chaos is erupting as the zombies rapidly increase in numbers, and Sarah eventually loses control of her car and crashes into a tree. Cut to black. Cue titles...I haven't seen such a great opening to a film since Raiders of the Lost Ark!And what follows is just as intense. The remainder of the film sees Sarah team up with a tough cop (Ving Rhames), a TV salesman (Jake Weber), and a young couple expecting their first child (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina), who are travelling to the relative safety of a nearby mall. But once in the sprawling shopping centre, the group realises that zombies are not the only threat to their safety: the white trash security guards that patrol the building are not too keen on sharing their sanctuary with outsiders.Very gory, and damn scary (a scene in a pitch black underground car-park being my favourite creepy moment), with characters that are developed enough for us to care about, Dawn Of The Dead is a triumph. Its narrative contains enough differences from the original to make it constantly surprising, the special effects are top notch, with truly unsettling zombies and some disgustingly realistic gore, and the cast are utterly convincing as the terrified survivors of a nightmarish apocalypse.I first saw this film at a late-night screening in my local multiplex. Afterwards, nerves extremely jangled, I had to walk through a nearby shopping centre in order to get to my car, which was parked in a large and quite poorly lit car-park.I'm not ashamed to say that I've never moved so fast in my life!",10,1,3,18 November 2007
Iron Man 2," More mega-budget metallic mayhem.
","The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,2,3,8 October 2012
Alien: Resurrection," Alien Desecration.
","With Joss Whedon's annoyingly smart-ass script delivering annoying comic-book characters spouting annoying one-liners, and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's annoyingly incongruous visual style, Alien Resurrection is a truly dreadful film that besmirches all that has gone before. In shortit is annoying.With characters that wouldn't seem out of place in Whedon's terrible Serenity, some very bad CGI, awful acting (Wynona, how did you ever manage to become a film star? Sigourney, were you having a laugh or what?) and an ending so bad I was unsure as to whether I should laugh or cry, this film is a failure on almost every level.Ripley, having died at the end of Alien 3, is cloned by the military, so that they can lay their hands on the alien queen that is inside her (is it just me, or does this make no sense whatsoever?). The new Ripley's DNA, however, is a fusion of alien and human, meaning that she now has superhuman strength, cool basketball skills and a liking for leather pants.With a queen now in their possession, the military scientists quickly grow themselves a batch of aliens, using some poor saps, kidnapped by a bunch of unlikeable space rogues, as hosts for their creatures. However, once 'born', these aliens prove smarter than your average ET, and they soon escape to cause all manner of bloody mayhem .Ripley, along with the rough and ready 'pirates' and an android terrorist, must try to escape death whilst also ensuring that the aliens do not successfully make their way to Earth.I will confess to enjoying the gratuitous gore in this chapter of the franchise but, between them, Jeunet and Whedon have loaded this film with so many naff elements that fans of the series will surely curse their names for what they have done.",2,3,8,17 May 2007
World War Z," Much better than I expected.
","A major studio, PG-13 zombie flick starring Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt: rather unsurprisingly, I opted to pass on this when it was in the cinema, preferring my undead movies to be very gory and very scary. But with the film released on DVD in an unrated version, curiosity got the better of me, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed what I saw.The script isn't perfect, certain plot developments being hard to adequately explain, and Brad Pitt's character must be the luckiest sonuvabitch alive to survive so many encounters with zombies (and a plane crash!), but disengage the brain and accept the less likely aspects of the story and there is a huge amount of fun to be had with this spectacular, fast-paced horror offering.Lots of brilliantly realised scenes of zombie mayhem, delivering plenty of scares and tension, go to make World War Z a thoroughly thrilling flick from start to finish, with the superb set pieces including a breathtaking race to the top of a tower block, an awesome 'zombie swarm' in Jerusalem, and the discovery of a stowaway zombie on a packed jet in mid-flight. Throw in a few superbly executed jump scares and what you have is a hugely entertaining movie, despite the questionable moments in the narrative.",8,3,8,22 September 2013
The Hunger Games," Wonders will never cease.
","A PG-rated Battle Royale. The Running Man with mood swings and acne. The mere thought of a Hollywood adaptation of the latest novel to grace every teenagers' bookshelf was enough to make me shudder in fear (I've seen Twilight; that was enough for me). How could they possibly make this derivative, undoubtedly tame, and probably sappy nonsense appeal to anyone other than hormonal adolescents? Amazingly, they have.I've just finished watching The Hunger Games with my 11-year-old daughter (who kindly gave me a running commentary on exactly how the film compares with the book) and was amazed at just how much I enjoyed its grim dystopian vision—a post apocalyptic world where freaky future-folk with crazy multi-coloured hair happily watch a group of kids killing each other with a variety of sharp/pointy things in an arena where genetically altered killer wasps, computer-controlled forest fires, and mutant man-eating dogs also present a very real danger.With decent direction from Gary Ross, a fine central performance from the rather lovely Jennifer Lawrence (who reminds me of a young Renee Zellweger, which ain't a bad thing), plus memorable supporting turns from Woody Harrelson (so cool), Isabelle Fuhrman (so scary), and Donald Sutherland (so loathsome), I have to admit that the film was a lot more fun than I expected it to be.",7,0,3,16 September 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Not perfect, but still hugely enjoyable.
","Electronics salesman Shaun (Simon Pegg) finds his monotonous existence getting a bit of a shake-up when a zombie outbreak sees him becoming the leader of a small group of desperate survivors.The first time I watched this romantic comedy with zombies (or rom-zom-com, as this small sub-genre has apparently been dubbed), I felt a little disappointed: I suspect that the hype surrounding the film was to blame somewhat for raising my expectations unreasonably high.However, after a second viewing, I can now report that Shaun of the Dead is actually much better than I at first thought, being packed with plenty of witty dialogue, quirky humour, likable characters, and loads of fun horror film references. Whilst I still believe that the ending loses it's way a little (with much of the comedy being ditched in favour of gore, action and attempts at emotional drama), as horror comedies go, this is definitely one of the best.The deadpan and often surreal humour certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but those who enjoyed director Edgar Wright's TV series Spaced and who have watched an unhealthily disproportionate amount of zombie films will be guaranteed a good time, as Pegg and friends lampoon the 'dead' films of George Romero with an obvious and genuine affection for the genre.Best moment: when Nick Frost shouts 'We're coming to get you, Barbara'. Pure class!",8,0,1,30 August 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Arrrrrr! It be a whole lot worse than the first one, me hearty.
","Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow, pirate and captain of The Black Pearl who, after making a deal with the supernatural scourge of the seven seas, Davey Jones, faces a bleak future as one of the undead crew-members of The Flying Dutchman. His only chance of avoiding this terrible fate is to try and locate a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones. But even with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), and his loyal crew, the quest will be a perilous one.With an amazing cast and amazing production values, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is simply bursting at the seams with amazing stunts, amazing special effects and amazing action set-pieces. But what is most amazing about this film is that director Gore Verbinski still somehow fails to deliver a finished product that is equal to the sum of its parts.This sequel to his own 2003 blockbuster, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest is an overlong, incomprehensible mess of a movie, which has all of the right elements but no decent story on which to hang them. The dreadfully structured and convoluted plot jumps from one event to another with seemingly no attempt at a coherent narrative and totally wastes its wealth of great characters.At nearly two-and-a-half hours long, the film pads out its extremely ill-conceived script with endless, and ultimately very dull, fight scenes and a glut of admittedly impressive, but often unnecessary, CGI effects. In fact, if as much effort had been put into crafting a decent tale as was obviously put into realising the movie's monstrous villains, Dead Man's Chest might have been a whole lot better.As it stands, though, I'd rather be keelhauled than be made to watch this bilge again.",3,4,6,20 February 2007
Rocky V," Not the greatest.
","It's a Rocky movie, so I had some fun with it, but there is plenty that Rocky V gets wrong in my opinion.Firstly, the whole riches to rags story feels like a punch to the gut after all that has happened. His entire wealth gone because of a bad decision by Paulie (Burt Young)... is this even possible?Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison, sporting a bad mullet) is a forgettable, personality-free opponent, especially when compared to the likes of Creed and Lang. Even Drago had more charisma.The '90s rap/dance music is dreadful; what's wrong with the rock music of the previous instalments?Rocky ignoring his son in favour of Gunn goes against character. I know he sees a chance of reliving his youth through Tommy, but it doesn't feel right.I hate the way Robert (Sage Stallone) goes from being the ideal son to a street punk in a matter of days (his dangly ear-ring gets on my nerves too).The street-fight feels anticlimactic compared to all of the final boxing matches in the previous films.Lastly, there are too many turtle-necks in the film.Rocky V is still watchable thanks to Stallone and the other familiar faces (Talia Shire, Young), but it's definitely my least favourite of the series.",5,0,1,7 September 2019
Hostel," Don't believe the hype!
","With Hostel, Director Eli Roth set out to make the most horrifying film that he could. Pre-release announcements promised that the film would be 'wild', 'ultra violent', 'sick' and 'disturbing' and close in tone to Takeshi Miike's 'Audition' or Tobe Hooper's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The wonderful marketing, including a suitably grimy website and the inclusion of industry whore Tarantino's name on publicity material, suggested that the film would be a milestone in grindhouse horror. Expectations were high, to say the least.Sadly, Roth has failed in every way possible to achieve his goal. The result is a good example of how a great premise can be thrown away by a poorly developed script and bad direction.The story follows three backpackers who travel to Bratislava in order to find a hostel in which the women are reputedly super hot and up for sex 24/7. The guys soon wish that they had followed their original plan to go to Barcelona when, one by one, they are abducted, taken to a charnel house and attacked by sickos who have payed for the pleasure of inflicting pain, misery and death.A talented writer and director could have crafted a gruelling terror classic from this interesting premise, but Eli Roth is neither and he screws up from the word go. The first 45 minutes or so (roughly half the total running time) is spent following the sexploits of the three young men as they sample the delights of Amsterdamn. There is plenty of nudity, but nothing that can be classed as 'wild', 'sick' or 'disturbing'. In the next 15 minutes, we follow the annoying trio to the titular hostel, where we get more nudity (and absolutely no horror).Finally, Roth decides he has had enough of filming tits and ass and begins the bloodletting. For a while, the film delivers on its promisesthe backpackers are abducted one by one and we get to witness some great gore courtesy of make-up maestros Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger; leg drilling, tendon slicing, chainsaw slashing and assorted bloody gunshots drench the screen with blood.However, it is not long before the film enters the realms of idiocy again with the escape of the final backpacker. Having freed himself and made his way to a car undetected (it even has the key in the ignition!), our plucky survivor turns back to rescue someone he hardly knowsa Japanese girl he met the day before, who is already being worked over by a maniac with a blowtorch. From this point onwards, any semblance of logic and plausibility goes out the window and the audience is treated to a trio of classic unintentionally-funny moments: the three-in-one hit-and-run, the street children attacking the bad guys in exchange for bubblegum and the 'tragic' suicide by speeding train.With Eli Roth citing 'The Vanishing', 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance', 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', and 'The Wicker Man' as influences, one does wonder what the hell he was thinking whilst making Hostel, a film that has absolutely nothing in common with these masterpieces. Hostel is entertaining in a hokey waytits, ass, guts and blood are classic schlock horror elements and all score points with mebut it is far from the gruelling and relentless shocker that Roth had promised to deliver.",5,3,4,3 May 2006
Green Room," Punks vs Skins
","After stumbling upon the brutal murder of a young woman, the members of a struggling punk rock band (the late Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Callum Turner) find themselves fighting for survival against a gang of highly organised, Neo-Nazi skinheads led by cold-blooded, white supremacist heroin dealer Darcy (Patrick Stewart).A no-frills example of siege thriller/survival horror, Green Room offers very little in the way of surprises, but delivers more than enough tense thrills and bloody brutality to ensure an entertaining time. With the punks locked in the titular 'green room' of a grubby venue deep in the woods, and the skinheads doing their best to break in, the scene is set for some good old-fashioned ultra-violence, handled with aplomb by director Jeremy Saulnier.As is standard for the genre, the desperate punks are whittled down via gun, machete, and the jaws of some vicious hounds, before finally turning the tables on the skinheads by devising a risky plan. Formulaic, yes, but very satisfying.",8,7,19,2 July 2016
The Babadook," What is The Babadook? You decide.
","A supernatural horror story about a malevolent book character who enters reality to persecute a single mother and her emotionally troubled son, or a psychological drama that charts the behavioural issues of a fatherless child and the consequent mental breakdown of his stressed out mother? Eerie Aussie movie The Babadook is open to interpretation, refusing to give any concrete solutions to the many questions raised, making it both an intriguing experience and a rather frustrating one at the same time.Given the evidence, I'm convinced that The Babadook, the dark creature that invades the home of Amelia (Essie Davis) and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) after they read a mysterious children's pop-up book, must be a figment of the imagination, a monster of the mind that stems from a case of severe depression, repressed guilt and sheer exhaustion; for the most part, the film certainly works best when seen this way (the alternative being too silly to comprehend), but as the film enters its final act, this viewpoint still raises issues for which I fail to find satisfactory answers, particularly in the effects laden final act that sees Samuel thrown about the house by an invisible force and Amelia suddenly reverting from raving lunatic back to caring mother after confronting the monster (after which she keeps it in the basement and feeds it worms?!?!).Thankfully, despite the whole ambiguous 'is it real or is she barking mad' approach being a well-worn horror cliché (The Shining, anyone?) and not working quite as well as it might, writer/director Jennifer Kent conducts proceedings with such an assured hand that the film still proves an entertaining watch, conjuring up some excellent macabre imagery and a chilling atmosphere of foreboding, helped immensely by a convincing lead performance from Davis as the extremely fraught Amelia and a passable turn by youngster Wiseman as her thoroughly irritating son (by the end of the film, I wanted to feed him to The Babadook as well!).",6,7,31,1 December 2014
Us," Double trouble.
","When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to Santa Cruz, the site of a childhood trauma, with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), she finds her family stalked by a group of doppelgängers intent on doing them harm.My initial thought: that's no way to play whack-a-mole. You don't just stand there and hit the same mole over and over. Couldn't the actor be bothered? Still, I'm a reasonable person and can let that slide just so long as the rest of the film is good.Unfortunately, it turns out that iffy whack-a-mole tactics are the least of this film's problems.Character development is fine-I liked the central family, and their obnoxious friends were fun, but once the shadow people appear, it all starts to go a bit pear-shaped...I understand that the home invasion scene is intended to be dark comedy, which I'm fine with, but I'd liked to have had some genuine tension and a few solid frights along the way. At no point did I feel scared, which is disappointing when you've signed on for a horror movie. I also don't understand why the doppelgängers don't kill the family straight away (other than for the convenience of the plot), but that's just one puzzler amongst many.Peele finally hits his horror stride with the attack at the neighbours' home, and the fight against the shadow twins, but once it becomes apparent that the phenomena is nationwide, the film takes a serious nosedive. Rather than leave the nature of his villains mysterious, Peele gives us a ridiculous back story to the shadow people that makes very little sense whatsoever.The viewer is expected to believe in the creation of thousands, nay millions, of underground shadow people who control the population above through puppetry. These people live in a network of tunnels and, so I understand, eat raw rabbit meat. This premise leaves countless unanswered questions, none of which are adequately addressed. It's a half-assed attempt at an explanation which would have been best left unsaid.Peele then expects us to swallow the idea that the countless shadow people have been organised into an army by Adelaide's evil doppelgänger. Clad in red jumpsuits and armed with scissors (acquired from a subterranean red jumpsuit and golden scissors warehouse, no doubt), she plans for her people to invade the world above. To what end? To overpower their more privileged doubles and then hold hands in a chain across America, as an act of defiance and solidarity.All of this is intended as a metaphor for class divide in America, mirroring the fight between the haves and have-nots, and the struggle for equality, but the subtext comes at the expense of logic and narrative cohesion. Peele closes matters with a silly twist ending that only raises further awkward questions.My closing thought: could have been great, but the whack-a-mole incident is just the start of it.",5,53,73,26 March 2019
The Girl Next Door," The Girl Nexxxt Door.
","If you've seen the 1983 Tom Cruise sex comedy Risky Business, then you'll no doubt get a strong sense of deja-vu whilst watching The Girl Next Door, for the plot is almost identical, albeit slightly tweaked in places and updated for today's audiences: where Tom Cruise's preppy Joel Goodsen fell in love with a hot hooker, Emile Hirsch's Matthew Kidman hooks up with hot porn star Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert); Risky Business's sleazy antagonist, Guido the killer pimp, becomes adult film producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant); instead of having the contents of his parents house stolen, Matthew loses a $25,000 fund for foreign student Samnang; and rather than running a brothel to recoup his losses, Matthew and his geeky pals decide to use their new contacts in the adult film biz to turn their luck around.However, despite screaming 'rip-off' at every turn, it's very hard not to enjoy this film. Director Luke Greenfield handles his material well and the appealing cast all do a great job: Hirsch is perfect as uptight Matthew who eventually learns to cut loose (to paraphrase Joel Goodsen, 'Sometimes you just gotta say 'What the fk!!'); Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and oozes sensuality (although she doesn't get nekkid, which is a real shame!); Olyphant is brilliant as he effortlessly switches between charming rogue and utterly menacing villain; and Chris Marquette impresses as Matthew's film-student pal Eli (is it just me, or is this guy a dead ringer for a young John Cusack?).The Girl Next Door does suffer a little during it's more emotional scenes, which lack conviction, but these less effective moments are easily counterbalanced by the film's genuinely funny moments that capitalise well on the film's lewd premise, including Matthew imagining Danielle getting it on with his parents, a fracas at an adult film convention in Las Vegas, and Matthew's run in with a friend of the family at a lap-dancing club.Although The Girl Next Door is far from original, and never reaches the levels of perfection achieved by Cruise and Co. (let's face it, Risky Business is a classic of the genre and a very hard act to follow), it passes the time well enough, offering some quality eye candy for us blokes, a bit of mushy, sentimental, lovey-dovey pap for the ladies, a decent pop/rock soundtrack, and a heartwarming outcome for all of its characters.",7,2,3,7 November 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Game over.
","Disney's The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a film clearly designed to appeal to the entire family: for the mums to drool over, we have a buffed up Jake Gyllenhaal; for the dads there is the beautiful (but incredibly wooden) Gemma Arterton; and for the kids there is plenty of video game style action. Oh, and there's an ostrich race, and who doesn't like an ostrich race?Shame that they forgot all about a decent plot.The 'scribbled on the back of a napkin during a power lunch' story that has been built around the popular video game series sees Gyllenhaal's Prince Dastan trying to prevent a magical dagger that can reverse time from falling into the wrong hands. This allows for tons of ridiculous stunt-filled action in which Gyllenhaal's character performs impressive, nay impossible, feats of physicality, a fair amount of mild violence, and a little romance (although Gyllenhaal and Arterton share zero chemistry). Sadly any sense of genuine excitement or fun is swamped by the sheer predictability of proceedings (Ben Kingsley is the real villain? You don't say!) and the glut of CGI enhanced action set-pieces that only serve to bore.",3,1,3,15 November 2016
Ted," Bear-faced low-brow fun.
","As the result of a childhood Christmas wish, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) has been best friends with his walking, talking, very-much-alive teddy bear Ted (Seth MacFarlane) for the past twenty seven years; together, they hang out and enjoy the finer things in life, like quality weed and repeat viewings of camp sci-fi classic Flash Gordon. Things look set to change, however, when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Mila Kunis), suggests that the time has come for her boyfriend to become a more responsible person and for Ted to finally find a place of his own.With Ted, writer/director/performer Seth MacFarlane has made one of the few films to star Mark Wahlberg that I actually like (the others being Fear and Boogie Nights). Of course, my enjoyment of Ted has very little do with its leading man, but a lot to do with MacFarlane's laugh-out-loud, unapologetically politically-incorrect script, his confident direction and hilarious voice-over work. It doesn't hurt either that the film features the lovely Mila Kunis as John's love interest, a brilliant self-mocking cameo from none other than Flash Gordon himself, Mr Sam Jones, and top-notch special effects that ensure that the film titular character is someone (something?) you can really care about.7.5/10, happily rounded up to 8 for having Ted beat the crap out of Wahlberg.",8,1,3,21 July 2015
Knives Out," All is not forgiven, but it's a good start.
","After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,3,20,26 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Spidey's back for more web-slinging fun.
","Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film.",8,0,2,4 July 2014
Batman Returns," Burton Bores.
","In the first Tim Burton Batman movie, Jack Nicholson stole almost every scene he was in as The Joker, but the film was still very much about Batman.Three years later, and Batman returned, but on the strength of this sequel, perhaps it would have been better if he had remained hidden away in his bat cave.Nowhere near as much fun as his original, Tim Burton's follow up focuses less on the bat and more on the villains: the Penguin (Danny De Vito), who emerges from the sewers, ostensibly to discover who is parents were, but in reality, to wreak terror on the people of Gotham City, with a little help from unscrupulous industrialist Max Schreck (Christopher Walken). And Catwoman, psycho secretary Selina Kyle, who loses her marbles and turns nasty after being pushed out of a window by Schreck.Michael Keaton, as Batman, hardly gets a look in.As well as featuring not nearly enough of its hero, the film also suffers from an air of unrelenting grotesqueness (Burton going overboard on the freaky stuff), a really drab aesthetic (the winter setting leading to lots of dreary grey and blue visuals), and a boring plot in which the Penguin runs for mayor. At over two hours long, I felt my eyelids drooping a lot.4/10, minus one point for Walken's crazy hair and the unconvincing mechanical penguins/men in penguin costumes, some of the Stan Winston Studio's worst work.",3,49,82,24 June 2017
Blade," A Marvel-lously enjoyable vampire flick.
","Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a thing, director Stephen Norrington gave us Blade. Based on Marvel's comic-book series about a vampire hunter who is part bloodsucker himself, the film starred Wesley Snipes in the title role, with Stephen Dorff as his nemesis, nasty vampire Deacon Frost, who is attempting to take over the world by resurrecting an ancient 'blood god'.Norrington does a great job in translating the comic to screen, delivering wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, plenty of stylish visuals, a smattering of gore, and a pounding techno soundtrack, with only a smidge of unconvincing CGI to occasionally ruin the effect. Snipes, a solid actor and skilled martial artist, fits the character to a 'T'; able support comes from Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor Whistler and N'Bushe Wright as helpful hematologist Karen, who is unwittingly caught up in the battle between good and evil.Also joining in for the fun are cult favourite Udo Kier as 'pure-blood' vampire Dragonetti (who has the best death scene of the film), Donal Logue as Frost's rowdy right hand man Quinn, and Traci Lords as sexy vamp Racquel (whose screen-time is all too brief, her character destroyed in the film's blood-soaked opening nightclub scene).8/10. Still holds up as a very worthy Marvel movie.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Creed," Two-fisted entertainment.
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has retired from boxing but his story continues in Creed, as the one-time heavyweight champ is talked into becoming a trainer by Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. Bounced around care institutions as a child, learning to use his fists in the process, Adonis has won a series of boxing matches in Mexico, but wants to make a name for himself in the professional boxing circuit. To do so, he enlists the help of the Italian Stallion, who teaches the young man to not only improve his technique in the ring, but also to come to terms with his legacy.Creed sees the Rocky franchise returning to its roots, with the focus on character development and drama, whilst adding a renewed sense of realism to the action. The script sees Stallone's iconic slugger facing a new fight, this time against a form of cancer, which adds depth and pathos to the movie, whilst Creed battles not only with his identity but also struggles to balance his relationship with pretty singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson) with his boxing career. Director Ryan Coogler handles the drama and the fighting with aplomb, getting an excellent performance from Sly and delivering a superb final match for the ending, Adonis going the distance with Scouse champion 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew). Adonis doesn't get the title, being defeated on points, but in my eyes he's a winner, the young fighter successfully taking on the mantle of boxing superstar from one of cinema's most enduring and beloved characters.Also worthy of note is the wonderful score by Ludwig Göransson, which makes the movie feel like an epic spaghetti western at times, the composer only occasionally turning to Bill Conti's instantly recognisable theme for support.",8,0,0,8 September 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Spectacular superhero fun.
","I'm no expert on Marvel Comics characters and have only seen two of the X-Men movies so far, but I'm pretty confident in saying that if you enjoy super-hero films in general, then X-Men Origins: Wolverine will provide 107 minutes of solid entertainment.Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine makes for a very charismatic hero, and the character's back-story is more than worthy of its own movie—a compelling tale of sibling rivalry, betrayal, revenge and self-discovery. The film also boasts some great secondary characters in the form of his fellow mutants who display an impressive array of incredible supernatural talents, allowing for some really impressive action set-pieces.If I was going to be picky, some of the digital effects are not quite up to the standard that I have come to expect from such fare—Wolverine's claws in particular looking pretty dodgy from time to time—and the final battle is perhaps taking things a step too far, even for a comic-book based movie, but I won't let that stop me from rounding up my rating of 7.5 to an 8.",8,8,12,9 October 2011
Hot Fuzz," Silly, dumb, stupid, daftand quite a lot of fun.
","Over-hyped. Yes! Over-rated. Probably.But, for those with a quirky sense of humour (and an appreciation of small town mentality), Hot Fuzz is still loads of fun.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the creators of the hugely successful zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, reunite for this rather silly, but still enjoyable tale which sees a top Met police officer, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg), transferred (thanks to his jealous colleagues) to the sleepy country town of Sandford.At first Angel is bored by the lack of action, but he is soon back in his element after several of the town-folk are killed in mysterious circumstances. Aided by PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), he sets out to discover who is responsible for the gruesome slayings.Utilising the offbeat, quick-fire comic style of Wright and Pegg's TV series Spaced, blended with the flashy editing techniques prevalent in much of today's Hollywood action movie output (which gets mercilessly mocked), Hot Fuzz is always amusing, occasionally hilarious, and eventually extremely daft.Referencing an endless array of other movies (movie geeks will have a field day spotting these) and featuring some enjoyable scenes of OTT gore and the occasional hi-octane gunfight, Wright and Co. are obviously having a great time lampooning a genre they love. Only occasionally does the humour miss the target; most of the time it hits dead centre.Perhaps the film takes a little too long to get going, but it eventually slips into gear and becomes much more enjoyable. Then, just as you think it has come to a satisfactory ending (at a point which is reminiscent of The Wicker Man), it becomes an all out OTT action flick, completely dispensing with reality and delivering one of the most ridiculous shoot-outs ever committed to film. How you process this part of the film depends entirely on your particular sense of humour (and, perhaps on your nationalityI think it helps to be English), but fans of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead are the most likely to 'get it'.Initially, I am going to rate Hot Fuzz 7/10, which I imagine many might say is not high enough. Perhaps after another viewing, with my expectations not quite so ridiculously high (thanks to the hype), my rating might go up.",7,1,3,7 May 2007
Orphan," Annie she ain't!
","Orphan not only belongs to the 'evil kid' category of horror (The Bad Seed, Bloody Birthday, Village of the Damned, The Omen), but is also part of the 'cuckoo in the nest' sub-genre (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, The Stepfather, Pacific Heights, The Good Son), where an outsider is accepted into a household only to destroy it from within. In this case, a couple coming to terms with the still-birth of third child Jessica have their lives shattered after adopting Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a seemingly perfect nine-year-old Russian-born orphan girl, who inevitably turns out to be a manipulative, home-wrecking psycho with a terrifying secret.The format may seem familiar, the script is occasionally predictable (that rose bush was destined to get trashed!), and the film might rely rather too heavily on formulaic false scares to keep the tension running high, but Orphan is still a winner thanks to some brilliant performances (particularly from the young and very talented Fuhrman, who is definitely 'one to watch'), slick direction from Jaume Collet-Serra, and one hell of a twisted denouement that goes to prove that Hollywood still has the power to shock when it really wants to.At just over two hours, the film takes a fairly leisurely approach for much of its running time, allowing viewers to get to know the family intimately before the nasty stuff begins: we learn that mother Kate (Vera Farmiga) is a recovering alcoholic whose booze addiction was almost responsible for the death of her deaf daughter Max (Aryana Engineer), and that father John (Peter Sarsgaard) has not long admitted to having an extra-marital fling. Meanwhile, son Daniel is at the age where he is desperate to be accepted by his peers and is jealous of the attention lavished on the newest member of the family. Despite these characters' weaknesses, however, they are all extremely likable individuals, which makes it all the more horrifying when Esther begins to exploit the cracks in their relationships to terrifying effect.Towards the end of the film, Collet-Serra picks up the pace, dropping the psychological horror in favour of slasher-style scares, complete with a house plunged into darkness, bloody knife attacks, and a seemingly dead Esther repeatedly returning for a few more stabs; but with flawless execution, a few genuinely unforeseen deaths, and a twist ending that, although perhaps a little preposterous, is both inventive and perverse, Orphan is a real treat for fans of frightfully freaky films.",8,2,7,20 November 2009
Terminator Salvation," Lacking in emotion.
","In a near-future ravaged by robots, resistance fighter John Connor (Christian Bale) searches the post-apocalyptic wasteland for teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the key to mankind's survival. Meanwhile, executed prisoner Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) inexplicably finds himself both free and alive, caught in the battle against the machines.There is no doubt that Terminator Salvation is sorely missing Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence, lacking the humour and personality that the Austrian action-star brings to the series. An impressive cast has been assembled to take his place, but they are no match for the man who has defined the franchise. Simply put, Arnold IS The Terminator!Of course, a decent plot wouldn't have hurt either, but the fourth film fails fans in that department too, with a bland story that involves an executed criminal brought back from the dead for a chance at redemption, a narrative that lacks the efficient simplicity of the first film, nor the mind-bending complexity of the second, falling squarely in mediocre territory, with an over reliance on big-budget CGI set-pieces to drive things forward.Director McG undeniably handles the action with technical prowess pulling off some stunning visual trickery, and if all you're after is an endless tirade of explosive eye-candy then you'll be more than satisfied, but as a whole the film lacks the emotional charge necessary to successfully reboot the franchise. I sat, I watched, but like a robot, I felt nothing.",6,2,5,29 July 2016
Aquaman," Water load of fun.
","Okay, I definitely could have done without the octopus playing the drums, but Aquaman isn't the dud that many claim it to be. It's certainly better than many of DC's dark and dreary superhero movies, a visually impressive treat for the eyes (and I'm not just talking about Amber Heard in her green skintight costume!) and, ignoring a few contrived plot details, a hugely entertaining romp.Director James Wan has created a DC movie that, for once, looks and feels like a comic-book come to life, with jaw-dropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful. The story is clichÃ©d baddies versus goodies nonsense, but I think that's the point: this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made Nolan's Batman films such a bore. It's got Willem Dafoe riding a shark, for Christ's sake - it's not meant to be taken seriously.Jason Momoa plays Arthur, son of a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman). When he grows up, Arthur is convinced by stunning redhead Atlantean Mera (Heard) to claim his rightful place as king of Atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers. Unfortunately, his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is intent on war...At almost two and a half hours long, this could have easily run out of steam, but Wan keeps things moving at a lick, introducing more and more bonkers action, building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the shark-riding Atlanteans, with Momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths. Oh, and Nicole Kidman spends twenty years in Jurassic Park at the centre of the Earth! It's all so gloriously daft, and so stunningly rendered that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.The film does overstep the mark occasionally, with some the humour falling flat, and I struggle to believe that a) Aquaman and Mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to Sicily, and b) the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years, but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead Heard.",8,2,6,7 April 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Slap on your snow shoes and get burning your books—The Day After Tomorrow could be sooner than you think (huh?).
","2012 is just around the corner, which according to the Mayans spells disaster for Planet Earth; evangelical Bible-thumpers insist that The Rapture will commence on the 21st of May this very year, leaving us heathens to suffer in torment on Earth for five months before the world is finally destroyed in flames; this week Japan has suffered the fifth most violent earthquake in recorded history, leaving thousands dead from the resulting tsunami. So what the hell made me think that tonight would be a good night to watch environmental disaster flick The Day After Tomorrow?Well, what better way to hide from the horrors of reality by immersing oneself in a patently fictional disaster, a piece of glossy escapist entertainment (albeit with an important message at its heart) which at least offers a faint glimmer of hope for humanity, and where the spirit of mankind prevails against all odds? Roland Emmerich's film is the perfect antidote to the constant portents of doom and the very depressing images currently playing on my TV: in this big budget Hollywood vision of 'the day after tomorrow', the future may be bleak, but it isn't over for good; and even though the planet may be frozen, the warmth of a father's love for his son can never be extinguished. So, despite all the death and destruction, it's actually a feel-good movie—just what the doctor ordered.Plus, only in a CGI-laden disaster film like this can you see an awesome sight like a tidal wave crashing through the streets of New York before turning into a massive block of ice WITHOUT dying as a result. And that's gotta count for something.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,5,8,12 March 2011
Deadpool 2," Dead cool too!
","If you enjoyed the heck out of the first Deadpool film, there's a very good chance that you'll be thoroughly entertained by this sequel as well. It's essentially more of the same, without being exactly the same. We get more extreme violence, more smart-ass quips courtesy of the main character, more breaking of the fourth wall, more in-jokes, and more expletives; all of this is wrapped up by an easy-to-follow plot that sees Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) trying to find a reason to carry on living after a split second mistake results in the death of his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).Director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) does a fine job in emulating the style and tone set by Tim Miller's original, and ably delivers plenty of giggles to go with the action (although none of the gags made me laugh quite as hard as the gaggle of nerdy Marvel fanboys in the seats behind me, who clearly wanted everyone else in the audience to know that they got ALL of the clever references). An excellent soundtrack adds to the excitement, with everything from AC/DC's Thunderstruck (which accompanies the beginning of one of the film's funniest action scenes that features almost as many sudden superhero deaths as Infinity War), to Skrillex's dubstep anthem Bangarang.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the X-Men cameos, an appearance (or should that be 'disappearance') from Brad Pitt as The Vanisher, and a hilarious Basic Instinct-inspired shot during the scene in which Deadpool grows a new pair of legs.",9,4,13,18 May 2018
X-Men," A great start to the franchise.
","Telepathic, follically-challenged, wheelchair-bound genius Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) aims to promote the peaceful co-existence of mutants and humans, teaching students at his School for Gifted Youngsters how to control their powers. Angry metal-bending mutant Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) has other ideas: he wants to transform the world's political leaders into genetic freaks so that they will no longer show prejudice against his kind.'This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard'— Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), X-Men.That may be so, Wolverine, but it makes for great entertainment. A smart script that explores interesting themes is expertly brought to the big-screen by director Bryan Singer who uses every special effects trick at his disposal to brilliantly realise the incredible world of the X-Men, giving us just the right balance of drama and action (the film culminating with a fun battle atop the Statue of Liberty (very apt, given the film's motif of tolerance and freedom for all).X-Men also benefits from excellent casting: distinguished thesps Stewart and McKellen possess the necessary acting chops to effectively portray two such powerful and complex adversaries, Hugh Jackman makes for a very likable hero, Anna Paquin is adorable as troubled mutant Rogue, Halle Berry is hotter than a July heat-wave as weather-controlling babe Storm, Famke Janssen is super-sexy as brainy telekinetic Jean Grey, and Rebecca Romijn looks gorgeous even though she is blue and covered in scales (must be something to do with the fact that she's completely starkers under all that paint!).",8,2,3,28 March 2014
Spider-Man 3," And it was all going so well
","He did such a good job with Spiderman 1 and 2 that it's kinda hard to understand how director Sam Raimi could screw up so badly with part 3.It doesn't take long for the problems to start, with a meteor falling within spitting distance of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as they lay staring at the stars on a giant web hammock. Forget the astronomical chances of just being in the same vicinity as a falling meteor; what are the chances of a superhero with heightened senses being in the same vicinity as a falling meteor containing a malevolent symbiotic alien and remaining completely oblivious, even as the creature latches onto the back of his moped? Unbelievable, huh?Unfortunately, it only gets worse from here-on inJust like 'the man of steel' in part 3 of the '70s/'80s Superman movie series, this chapter in the Spiderman franchise sees Peter Parker turning bad (after the symbiote attaches itself to his costume), only here the transformation from superhero to super-jerk isn't handled anywhere near as successfully, Maguire unable to pull off 'menacing' anywhere near as convincingly as he does 'dorky'. Putting a bit of dark makeup under the eyes and allowing the actor's hair to flop down at the front simply doesn't cut it.Meanwhile, Mary Jane and Harry Osborn (James Franco) are getting close once again, having a quick snog after an impromptu twist dancing session in the kitchen. If this scene doesn't strike you as awkward, then howsabout the god-awful sequence that has Peter strutting down the street, doing the 'wink and gun' gesture to all the pretty ladies? Embarrassing doesn't even begin to describe it. This is followed soon-after by Peter visiting the bar where MJ works and shaking his booty with Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), girlfriend of his Daily Bugle rival Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). Jeez, Sam, couldn't you see how bad this scene would be when you wrote it?The cringes continue as Brock becomes the next victim of the symbiote, turning into Venom and teaming up with Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) to try and take down Spiderman once and for all. The pair of super-villains kidnap Mary Jane and suspend her in a giant web between skyscrapers to lure the webslinger into a trap. If, like me, you thought that earlier fight scenes stretched plausibility to breaking point, what happens next will have you choking in disbelief. The level of violence that Peter Parker can endure without severe injury is most impressive, the guy withstanding physical punishment that would even have the Incredible Hulk throwing in the towel.Just as things actually start to look bad for Spidey, his good-friend-turned-archenemy Harry turns up to help in the battle, having finally been told by his butler that Peter Parker wasn't responsible for his father's death. Hooray for the butler! The little kids watching the fight shout 'Awesome!' and 'Wicked Cool', Kirtsen Dunst does her best (but fails) to look scared, Spiderman defeats Venom through the use of sound-waves and one of Harry's explosive devices which conveniently limits its blast radius to a few feet, and Sandman says he's sorry and floats away on the wind. All of which is as bad, or if not worse, than it sounds.Oh well, at least after this debacle, Raimi wisely returned to the safety of the horror genre, giving us the entertaining Drag Me To Hell as his next movie. Let's be thankful for small mercies.",3,2,5,5 July 2014
Resident Evil: Extinction," Alice in Zombieland
","In Extinction, the third instalment of the Resident Evil series, the deadly T-Virus has escaped the confines of Raccoon City and contaminated the rest of the world. Zombies now outnumber the living and, as the number of survivors on the planet's surface gradually dwindles, Umbrella Corp experts deep beneath the Nevada desert attempt to perfect an anti-virus.Meanwhile, genetically enhanced zombie-killing babe Project Alice (Milla Jovovich) travels the country searching for other uninfected humans.Sporting the latest in sexy post-apocalyptic desert-wear (which naturally includes stockings and suspenders), the drop-dead-gorgeous, high-kicking, gun slinging, slayer of the undead cuts a swathe through legions of shambling corpses (and zombie crows!), rescuing a rag-tag convoy of demoralised people in the process.Alice convinces their leader, Claire Redfield (Heroes hottie Ali Larter), to lead her convoy to Alaska, where she believes they will be safe from contamination. But first they must head for Las Vegas, where they hope to find enough fuel to last the journey North.Unfortunately, nasty Umbrella Corp scientist Dr. Isaacs, who has been tracking Alice via satellite, has a nasty surprise in store for our heroine and her new pals when they eventually reach Vegas: he's prepared a container full of extremely nasty zombies to greet them!Helmed by hit-and-miss director Russell Mulcahy, and written by the equally unreliable Paul W.S. Anderson, Resident Evil: Extinction could have gone either way. I am pleased to report, however, that the guys were on form with this film, and deliver a hugely enjoyable and visually impressive sci-fi/horror yarn that, despite being rather derivative (Day of the Dead, anyone?) and occasionally a little too silly (Alice's telekinesis), is packed with enough action (great stunts, explosions, crashes), gore (juicy zombie bites, knife attacks, bullets in the head), and scares (yes, I admit that I jumped) to guarantee horror fans a good time.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,15,29,11 January 2008
Zodiac," The J.F.K. of serial killer films.
","For those deeply interested in the mystery of the Zodiac serial killer, this portrayal of one man's obsession with discovering the murderer's identity will no doubt qualify as essential viewing, dwelling as it does on the minutiae of the infamous unsolved case for a solid two and a half hours. Every possible avenue is examined in-depth; the script—based on the bestseller by Robert Graysmith—is exhaustive, charting the investigation of the killer's activity from the late 60s through to the early 90s. In its attention to detail, Zodiac is hard to fault.Unfortunately, in concentrating so hard on delivering the facts whilst avoiding sensationalism at all cost, director David Fincher neglects to engage those members of the audience who wish to be entertained as well as informed. With the exception of a brief moment of tension in a potential suspect's basement, the film never attempts to engage the viewer on an emotional level, and the result is a very dry watch—dare I say it, even boring at times. It's certainly nowhere near as memorable an experience as Fincher's other classic serial killer flick, Se7en (1995).",5,0,1,5 August 2013
The Terminator," A landmark moment in sci-fi/action cinema.
","A big, bad-ass cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to try and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), mother of the man who will—in forty years time—lead the human race to victory in a war against computers. Only one man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future, can help her her to stay alive...The Terminator, the film that rocketed James Cameron to A-list director status, and gave Arnie his most iconic role (the one which saw him coin his catchphrase 'I'll be back'), is such an accomplished piece of action/sci-fi in almost every department that, even after 25 years and many, many viewings later, it never fails to impress me.A top notch cast (which also includes Cameron regulars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton), excellent Stan Winston effects, and a terrific score by Brad Fiedel, combined with Cameron's flawless handling of his material and Schwarzenegger's suitably mechanical performance, all adds up to one of the finest movies ever made. Whereas many time-travel tales invite the viewer to search for paradoxes, I find that this film moves at such a cracking pace and delivers all the adrenaline-pumping action I'm after, that I never stop to worry about such trifling matters.",10,4,7,8 November 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," An inventive fantasy treat.
","I didn't like first Hellboy film, so wasn't really looking forward to The Golden Army, sequels rarely being as good as the original. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations that I actually ended up enjoying this one much more. It's still distinctly Del Toro, with the director's trademark steam-punk aesthetic (so many cogs!), and the plot isn't particularly innovative, but the bizarre characters, surfeit of creative Lovecraftian creatures and impressive production design more than make up for a so-so story.Ron Perlman dons red make-up once again to play the titular character, a demon working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence. Together with his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) and amphibious man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Hellboy tries to prevent elvish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) from activating The Golden Army—a battalion of metal soldiers—and waging war on the human race.In the process, Hellboy and pals encounter a swarm of ravenous tooth fairies, fight a massive elemental forest god, travel to the troll market where all manner of magickal monsters do trade, and, of course, duke it out with Prince Nuada and his mechanical army. All of this is realised with a stunning array of state-of-the-art special effects, making the film a feast for the eyes, while a keen sense of humour helps to ensure a good time even when the narrative is treading water.",7,1,1,7 April 2017
Cloverfield," Who cares where it came from; it's big, ugly and mean, and that's all that matters.
","The impressive teaser trailers for Cloverfield revealed some stunning footage of the destruction of New York, but refused to reveal the film's title, creating much conjecture and discussion about the true nature of the project amongst film fans. Ironically, it was this well orchestrated hype that made me give this one a miss at the cinema, for I had fallen for this kind of marketing ploy before and wasn't about to be duped again. It's a shame, because for once, the film lives up to the hype and I would have dearly loved to have seen this in all of its big budget, blockbuster glory on the silver screen.Written by J.J. Abrams, the man who created compulsive but confusing TV series Lost, Cloverfield has been described as The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla, a summary that proves to be very accurate: utilising hand-held POV camera-work (video footage supposedly shot by one of the characters) to achieve a sense of naturalistic realism, the film follows several 20-something New Yorkers as they try and escape from Manhattan after it is attacked by a huge and very destructive monster.Director Matt Reeves imagery is deliberately reminiscent of footage taken during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and instantly brings to mind the horror of that unforgettable event; this connection with something so real and terrible makes Cloverfield all the more harrowing. Add to this Abram's well constructed script featuring credible and occasionally witty dialogue (my favourite lines: What was that? I don't know... something else, also terrible), an impossibly good looking but largely unknown cast who all give very plausible performances, and superb special effects that merge seamlessly into the live action, and the result is a surprisingly enjoyable experience from start to depressing finish (like REC, Cannibal Holocaust, and The Blair Witch Project, which also used the documentary style to great effect, Cloverfield ends on an extremely downbeat note).",8,1,4,29 September 2009
Silent Hill," Play the game instead!
","Silent Hill is a big screen adaptation of the very popular and disturbing video game, in which a frantic father, Harry Mason, searches the terrifying titular town in an attempt to find his missing daughter.In Christophe Gans' movie of the same name, the character of Harry is replaced by Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell), the little girl's adoptive mother, but pretty much everything else remains the same and will be familiar to those who have experienced the game. Silent Hill emulates its source's sinister setting and spooky sound design to perfection, producing bags of eerie ambiance. Unfortunately, it also replicates its extremely confusing plot, and, without the benefit of the direct interaction that game-play allows, the result is extremely boring. It's a bit like watching someone else play the game for two hours solid without once being allowed to take part in any way.Aided by a tough and sexy cop named Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), Rose desperately wanders the streets and dwellings of Silent Hill looking for her girl, defeating a variety of hideous monsters on the way, and eventually doing battle with a nasty religious cult who were responsible for the death of an innocent girl many years before. Meanwhile, Rose's hubby Christopher (Sean Bean, giving a coma inducing performance) tries to discover the truth behind the town's terrible history.Whilst rabid fans of the Silent Hill games might possibly find something to enjoy about this tedious cinematic offering, anyone else will most likely be bored witless at the protagonist's endless tramping through mouldy corridors, abandoned buildings and deserted alleys. A couple of scenes deliver some rather nifty and unsettling CGI creations, and even a touch of OTT gore, but it really isn't worth sitting through this dreadful mess for these occasional (and all too brief) 'good bits'.",2,6,14,31 May 2007
Ready Player One," As bad as War of the Worlds.
","There was a time when a Steven Spielberg movie virtually guaranteed a great time, but more recently he's either concentrated on Oscar bait, or delivered mainstream entertainment that has seriously missed the mark (War of the Worlds, Crystal Skull). Ready Player one is his most disappointing film yet, a loud, garish assault on the senses with a derivative plot (Avatar meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), a glut of headache-inducing CGI-laden action scenes, and countless references to pop culture that will probably fly over the heads of many an audience (especially the younger viewers).Based on the New York Times bestseller by Ernest Cline, the film is set in the year 2045 and stars Tye Sheridan (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse) as Wade Watts, who, like most of the world's population, escapes the drudgery of reality by immersing himself in the virtual world of Oasis. Wade, as avatar Parzival, takes part in a contest created by Oasis's creator Halliday (Mark Rylance), the winner of which will be given complete control of the popular online playground. As the first to solve stage one of the game, Parzival comes to the attention of powerful corporation IOI, who are dedicated to finding the ultimate prize: a hidden 'easter egg'. What follows is a breakneck rampage through the various digital environments of Oasis, with 90% of the action consisting of computer generated characters, none of which possesses the excitement or tension of a real-life movie.Spielberg seems to have completely forgotten how to tell a coherent story, his film a mess of ideas that prove difficult to follow, hindered by an orgy of chaotic, colourful visuals that do little to aid comprehension. There are also several comedic moments that fall incredibly flat. It's hard to believe that this is from the same man who gave us timeless classics Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park.",2,8,21,8 April 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I'm in with the outlaws, I go where the outlaws go.
","Movies have been guilty of romanticising the lives of ruthless criminals for decades, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perhaps the most blatant example, the film portraying the infamous outlaws as loveable rogues -- best buds who are simply enjoying their chosen vocation: holding up banks and sticking up trains (or is it 'sticking up banks' and 'holding up trains'?).While I generally prefer films based on historical figures to be as factually accurate as possible, and get narked should they stray from the truth, I cannot help but warm to this revisionist western's dubious duo: as played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, the affable anti-heroes share a bond that is hard to resist, engaging in breezy conversation as they go about their business, charming even the most pernickety viewer (i.e., me!) into submission in the process.Writer William Goldman and director George Roy Hill clearly intend for their audience to side with Butch and Sundance, and for the most part, that is precisely what happens - at least until the showdown against the Bolivian army in the final act, when the outlaws gun down numerous soldiers while trying to flee. Up until this moment, the pair had only killed a vicious gang of payroll bandits, but it's much harder to forgive the shooting of men who are trying to uphold the law.The ending sees the daring partners in crime making a final bid for freedom despite being vastly outnumbered. In keeping with the general light-hearted nature of the film, we don't see the men cut down in a hail of bullets and blood (as in Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch); instead, they are caught freeze-frame as they leg it, leaving just a glimmer of hope that they somehow survived (to date, no-one has been able to say for sure that Butch and Sundance died that day in Bolivia).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Burt Bacharach's 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head', sung by B.J. Thomas -- anachronistic, perhaps, but still a timeless classic.",8,2,2,28 January 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Raimi's Spidey is still the best (not including Part 3).
","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.",6,4,18,4 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Give me Ewoks over Gungans any day!
","Return of the Jedi is often regarded by fans as the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, and whilst this is probably true, this in no way means that it is a bad film; on the contrary, with this episode, director Richard Marquand delivers a hugely enjoyable family movie that is packed with thrills and incredible special effects sequences from start to finish. It's just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors.Han Solo, trapped in carbonite, has been delivered to the palace of Jabba the Hutt (by bounty hunter Boba Fett), where he is displayed as a trophy by the huge slug-like space criminal. However, Han's rebel pals successfully carry out a daring rescue mission and, with the gang reunited, an attack is launched on the Empire's new improved Death Star, which is nearing completion.Luke's somewhat strained relationship with his old man is explored further, and it is also revealed that another member of the Skywalker family exists (providing the bad guys with an additional potential convert to the dark side of The Force).Return of the Jedi may not be perfectthe overly-cutesy Ewoks who aid the rebels are hated by many viewers, whilst the final attack scene is really nothing more than a rehash of Episode IV's assault on the original Death Starbut it is still a damn sight better than the abominations that are the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The visual effects are superbly executed, the action sequences genuinely exciting (in particular, the speeder bike chase gets the old neck hairs standing on end) and the whole movie looks great. If you can overlook the occasional silly 'comedy' moment and the odd lapse of logic (how did those Ewoks get those elaborate traps set up so quickly?), you'll have a blast!Just make sure not to watch the 1997 Special Edition, which saw Lucas add several nasty GGI 'improvements', including a terrible new musical number set in Jabba's palace, a poorly realised Sarlacc monster, some naff celebration scenes, and the iffy inclusion of Hayden Christensen as Anakin's 'ghost'.",9,0,4,4 March 2007
Fast & Furious 6," About as dumb as big action flicks get. And quite a lot of fun as a result.
","At the end of part 5, the F&F crew split $100million between them; somehow, a share of that haul bought Roman (Tyrese Gibson) a lear jet, a luxury yacht and a penthouse apartment, with cash to spare. Talk about getting the most from your money. Still, this is one of the least unbelievable things in a film that doesn't just ask the viewer to suspend disbelief, but rather grabs them by the neck and demands that they do so or else.This chapter in the dumb but entertaining blockbuster franchise sees Dom (Vin Diesel) reassembling his crew to help special agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop an international criminal from obtaining the components to build a bomb that will be worth billions to the wrong people. To paraphrase one of the characters, it's some '007-type s**t', but taken to extremes, with action set-pieces that not only defy logic, but also the laws of physics.For some viewers, it will all be a step too far, although judging by the film's cumulative worldwide gross, this is exactly what many want in a summer blockbuster. Me? I fall somewhere in the middle: there are moments that are extremely well handled (Gina Carano's fist fight with Michelle Rodriguez is excellent); a few scenes are exhilarating popcorn nonsense that I cannot help but enjoy for their sheer audacity (the tank crushing cars on a Spanish highway); but others push credibility beyond even what I can accept in a silly summer action flick (the ridiculous finale on the world's longest runway).That said, I'd much rather watch this than another Michael Bay Transformers film.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Carano (who should have nabbed the Wonder Woman gig instead of Gal Gadot).",7,1,3,22 July 2018
The Expendables," What's the matter, Arnie... been pushing too many pencils?
","I'm not stupid: I realise that 'x' times the number of action stars does not necessarily equal 'x' times the amount of action, but with the biggest names of the genre together in one supposedly bad-ass, big budget, testosterone fuelled film, directed by Rambo himself, I at least expected to feel a mild rush of excitement at some point during the whole thing. Instead, I just found myself cringing throughout, which was a tad disappointing, to say the least.Not only does The Expendables have a plot so weak that it probably would have been rejected for the A-Team (not the film, but the TV series, and we're talking Season 5 here), but it also suffers from charmless performances from its stars (who are not exactly helped by the absolutely dire dialogue), a very dull first half hour, and some of the most ill-considered action direction, lousy cinematography and scrappy CGI effects I have seen in years.The photography is inexplicably grainy and frequently out of focus, the scatter-shot editing is absolutely diabolical (does any shot last more than a second?), and the digital blood splats frustratingly unrealistic, but it is Stallone's overuse of 'shakycam' that is particularly appalling—seriously Sly, what's the point of signing up such an impressive all-star cast if you're going to turn every action sequence into unfathomable visual mincemeat?Oh, and Arnie.... next time, either grab a gun and get stuck in, or just stay behind the desk.

Scary Movie 2," Two down, two to go.
","Once again, the Wayans brothers have trawled the murkiest depths of toilet humour and smut to put together another crude collection of puerile fart, tit, willy and sex gags, loosely tied together by a scrappy horror-based script that parodies everything from genre classics (The Exorcist) to modern clunkers (The Haunting remake), as well as unrelated big-budget blockbusters such as Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission Impossible 2.As with the first film, there has clearly been zero attempt at quality control in the gag department, with even the most utterly moronic and totally cringe-worthy of jokes making it into the final film (there were only two things about Scary Movie 2 that I would describe as genuinely laugh-out-loud funny: the opening scene featuring James Woods and Chris Elliott's inspired performance as Hanson, a crazy caretaker with a withered hand. Still, that's two more than the original, so I guess this silly sequel could actually be considered an improvement!).Thankfully, the charms of a pre-blonde, pre-surgery Anna Faris and the ample curves of busty babe Kathleen Robertson provide just about enough impetus for guys to persevere to the end (the girls stripping to their underwear is worth the wait); female viewers aren't catered for in the same manner (unless you count Shawn Wayans posing semi-naked with his todger tucked between his legs—eeek!).3.5 out of 10 (marginally more than I gave the first film), but not good enough for me to round it up to a 4.",3,2,3,6 July 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," The best film about a labyrinth since Labyrinth.
","Spain, 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War: a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), travels to the countryside with her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), to meet her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López), a staunch Falangist who has been assigned to hunt down the band of rebels still holding out in the forests. While exploring the land surrounding her new home, Ofelia discovers a strange labyrinth where she meets a faun, who tells her that she is the reincarnation of a princess, and that she must perform three tasks in order to return to her magical realm.Has the girl retreated into a world of make-believe influenced by her storybooks? Or is the faun very real and telling the truth? Either way, director Guillermo Del Toro's movie is utterly compelling viewing, expertly blending the cruelty of war with its supernatural elements. With imagination to spare, brought to life by an array of incredible special effects (both animatronic and digital), and excellent performances from all involved, Pan's Labyrinth is an unforgettable journey into dark fantasy, where the supernatural horrors faced by Ofelia as she performs her tasks are more than matched by the unspeakable acts perpetrated by the sadistic Captain Vidal (his cruelty making the film unsuitable for the kiddies, despite the fairytale plot).Unforgettable scenes include the brutal killing of a hunter and his son, an encounter with a giant toad, Ofelia pursued by a freaky child-eating creature with eyes in its hands, and the haunting ending, which is either happy or sad, depending on your point of view.",8,1,5,15 June 2018
Final Destination 2," Dying for more of the same?
","If you loved the original Final Destination, then you will almost certainly enjoy the sequel, a virtual carbon-copy of the first film, except that everything is bigger and much, much bloodier.This time around, a group of travellers narrowly avoid being involved in a spectacular freeway pile-up thanks to an eerie premonition experienced by driver Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) as she waits on the on-ramp. Feeling cheated once again, Death alters his grand design to try and claim the lives of those who escaped his clutches. As the survivors of the accident begin to die in the order witnessed in her vision, Kimberley realises what is happening, and tracks down the sole survivor of flight 180, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), for help.Despite working with material that rarely explores new territory, director David R. Ellis directs with gusto: his freeway pile-up is an absolutely jaw-dropping piece of cinema—a brutal, bloody and disturbing set-piece—and the subsequent death scenes are masterfully orchestrated pieces of mayhem that tease the audience with several possible bloody conclusions, before delivering their always impressive pay-off (gory fatalities are caused by a falling ladder, a sheet of glass, a faulty elevator, an air-bag, a flying wire fence, and a barbecue!!!).In amongst the graphic bloodletting, Ellis also finds time to throw in some very nice visual touches (such as the tree shadows which resemble clutching skeletal hands) and lots of delightfully dark humour (gotta love that final shot!). A thoroughly entertaining piece of OTT popcorn horror, Final Destination 2 gets a very respectable 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,6,6,12 December 2009
Knocked Up," Not as funny as I had been lead to believe.
","With a film going by the title of Knocked Up, from the makers of The 40 Year Old Virgin, I was expecting a unsophisticated-but-fun laugh-a-minute film packed with hilariously crude jokes. What I got, however, was an unsophisticated, occasionally funny, romantic comedyShe's Having a Baby for the new millennium.And whilst it was okay for what it was, I felt rather cheated. All I wanted was a vulgar comedy about sex. I had been tricked into seeing a vulgar comedy about sex that also explored emotions, fears and the uncertainty of life.Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a 23 year old waster whose 'job' is to record nudity in movies for a website (that isn't even online yet). On a drunken night out, he somehow hooks up with gorgeous TV presenter Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl). After a single night of passion, the two go their separate ways. That is until Alison discovers that she is up the duff! At over two hours long, Knocked Up soon gets tiresome, with not enough genuine laughs to help the time fly. And although Rogen and Heigl make a likable couple, endless scenes of arguing followed by reconciliation followed by more arguing really gets tedious.And, for the record, Katherine Heigl displays no boobs and definitely no bush, despite several sex scenes. What a con!",5,1,4,14 October 2007
Alien," Ridley Scott's superb space scare-fest.
","Just two years after mega-blockbuster Star Wars made sci-fi popular once again with cinema-goers, Ridley Scott presented us with an altogether different kind of space movie—a bloody scary one! Alien follows the luckless crew of the space-tug Nostromo, who are re-routed by their ship's computer when it picks up what seems to be a distress signal. Following the suspected S.O.S. transmission to a desolate planet, they set out to investigate the wreck of an alien craft unaware of the horror that awaits them.Whilst Alien is essentially just a 'monster on the loose' movie (albeit with a big-budget) what makes it such an effective film is the loving attention to detail in all aspects of its production: the script (by Dan O'Bannon) presents us with a set of well developed characters who react believably to their unusual situation; the set design makes the claustrophobic Nostromo a totally realistic working environment for a crew on a long space haul; and the alien (based on concepts by H. R. Geiger) is a convincingly nasty critter which rapidly grows from a toothy chest-bursting snake-thing into a 7ft bio-mechanical monstrosity.Scott takes his time developing the story before getting down to the really good stuff, his slow-burn approach allowing the viewer to familiarise themselves with the characters and drink-in the stunning visuals. But when things do start to go pear shaped for the crew of the Nostromo, he cranks up the tension to breaking point, delivering non-stop suspense and shocks right up to the closing credits.The film also benefits from a very talented cast: the brilliant John Hurt is Kane, the poor schmuck who becomes a human incubator for the monster after poking his nose too far into an alien egg chamber; a young Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley, the tough heroine of the movie; Ian 'Bilbo Baggins' Holm is the nasty science officer Ash; and Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto play alien fodder.Occasionally Scott relies a little heavily on mechanical scares (Jones the cat is responsible for a few too many false alarms) and some elements require a little more explaining for very picky folk like me (such as 'how the hell did a face-hugger manage to latch on to the big 'space jockey' alien seen in the wreck?'), but seeing as we get to see Sigourney Weaver in the universe's teeniest pair of pants, I'm willing to overlook these trifles and award Alien a whopping 10/10.",10,2,8,6 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Nothing to get into a lather about.
","Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a talented barber who returns to London after 15 years to wreak bloody revenge on Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and his nasty cohort Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall)the men who imprisoned him for a crime he didn't commit, and took away his wife and child.As Sweeney Todd, the vengeful barber sets up business above a run-down pie shop (owned by his admirer Mrs. Lovett, played by Helena Bonham Carter), where he plans to lure his unsuspecting victims and cut their throats with his trusty open razors.After a practice throat-slashing session on a unscrupulous business rival leaves him with a body to dispose of, Todd develops a convenient working relationship with the infatuated shop owner below, who is always in need of a fresh supply of cheap meat. As the barber's seething hatred for mankind grows, and he proceeds to provide 'very' close shaves for all of his customers, so Mrs. Lovett finds herself with a never-ending supply of filling for her pastries.With plenty of practise under his belt, and a nifty tip-up chair for sending victims directly to Mrs. Lovett's basement, Todd concentrates his efforts on evening the score with Turpin and Bamford.Based on the Broadway show by Stephen Sondheim, Sweeney Todd is a violent, dark, and twisted musical about unrequited love and retribution, as seen through the eyes of Hollywood's resident goth director, Tim Burton. The result is a rather uneven offering: a very imaginative and visually impressive movie (as one might expect from Burton), but one unfortunately marred by the director's tendency to concentrate on style over content, poor casting of the lead roles (Depp and Bonham Carter look the part, but struggle to carry a tune), some occasionally leaden pacing, and not enough in the way of memorable songs.The film also suffers from too much coincidental plot contrivance and a rather long running time.But it's not all bad news: there are some great turns from some of the supporting players (Sascha Baron Cohen proves that once again he is a force to be reckoned with, as rival barber Pirelli; Spall is brilliantly slimy and loathsome as Beadle; and newcomer Ed Sanders gives a confident performance as Toby, the young lad who discovers the terrible truth about Mrs. Lovett's secret ingredient) and the bloodletting is delightfully juicy, with plenty of arterial spray to please the gore-hounds amongst us.6.5 out of 10, but not good enough to convince me to round it up to 7 for IMDb (at least until I've watched it a couple more times).",6,2,4,25 March 2008
Blades of Glory," Ferrell and Heder go for gold.
","I'm a fan of Will Ferrell and John Heder, and the mere idea of the two as disgraced rival ice-skaters forced to team up and compete as a pair made me grin like an idiot. But would the film be as funny as the concept?Well, whilst it might not be a perfect 6.0, the comedic duo definitely go for gold, putting in a couple of terrific performances that get a winning score from this judge (I'm giving it 9 out of 10 on IMDb).Ferrell is sex addict super-stud skater Chazz Michael Michaels; Heder is his spoilt, effeminate rival Jimmy MacElroy. When the two are awarded joint Gold in the Olympics, they begin a fight which results in them being stripped of their medals and banned from men's singles figurative skating... for life!However, several years later, they become aware of a loophole in the skating rules which allows them to take part in world competition once more... as a pairs team. Together, they attempt to win gold once more, taking on the Waldenbergs, a brother and sister pair whose suggestive (and somewhat incestuous) ice dancing makes Ferrell and Heder's routines seem almost normal in comparison.From the moment that Heder takes to the ice, resplendent in his sequined Peacock costume, this film is a relentlessly funny, gag-fest that, whilst perhaps not quite reaching the greatness of Anchorman, is certainly on a par with Ferrell's Talladega Nights and slightly better than, although not quite as quotable as, Heder's Napolean Dynamite.Sure, there is no denying that Blades of Glory is low-brow, OTT (and some might even say homophobic) humour, and it will not be to everyone's taste, but fans of dumb comedy (think along the lines of Benchwarmers, Zoolander or Dodgeball) should find this movie hilarious.And even though cinematic comedy is very subjectiveone man's Chevy Chase is another man's Pauly ShoreI defy even the most pretentious film-lover not to crack a smile at the sight of Ferrell and Heder, with face in each other's groin, performing their 'fire and ice' routine.Go on, admit it... it's making you chuckle just thinking about it.",9,1,2,6 September 2007
Horrible Bosses," Consistently amusing throughout.
","Have you ever wondered what adorable 'Friend' and rom-com favourite Jennifer Aniston would be like as a domineering, slutty, sexual predator? Yeah, me too.In Horrible Bosses, we get the opportunity to find out, for the lovely actress gets down and dirty as a reprehensible dentist who makes life very uncomfortable for her male assistant Dale (Charlie Day), pestering him for sex at every available opportunity. While that might not sound all that horrible to you and I, Dale isn't happy with his boss's behaviour; his best buds Nick (Jason Bateman) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) also have very good reasons to hate their own bosses (played by Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey), and so, while out for a drink, the three pals decide that it might be a good idea if they got rid of their problematic superiors once and for all.The plot for this unsophisticated comedy might just be a comedic spin on Hitchcock's classic thriller Strangers On A Train (which gets referenced here), but it it's still a winner thanks to fun performances from a solid cast, and a script that, while not laugh out loud all the way through, provides more than enough decent chuckles for a good time. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day make for a likable trio of dopes, but it is Aniston, Farrell and Spacey who are most memorable, Aniston for being so incredibly sexy, Farrell for being so utterly sleazy, and Spacey for being such a total tosser.",7,1,2,6 December 2014
Closer," I guess depressing drama just isn't my thing.
","Lent to me by a friend who has got this major thing for Ms. Portman, Closer is indeed compulsory viewing for all fans of the pretty little minx; after all, it's probably the closest you'll get to seeing Queen Amidala in her undies, without trawling the internet for candid paparazzi shots of her on the beach.But even witnessing young Natalie sexily cavorting in a spangled bra and tiny G-string didn't compensate for subjecting myself to this rather pretentious waffle about life, love, and betrayal. Mike Nichol's study of the complexity of relationships features four of the most unappealing characters to ever appear in one film; great to look at maybe, but still unappealing. They lie and cheat to those they care about and, although that maybe the point, I guess I'm an old romantic at heart and spending 104 minutes watching people betray those they are meant to love is just not my bag. If I wanted to spend that long seeing how much idiots can hurt each other, then I'd watch Jackass The Movie.However, it must be said that the talented leads (Jude Law, Ms. Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen) are extremely good in convincingly portraying the four screw-ups destined to never be content with their lot, and if morose drama is your cup of tea, then I guess you'll love this movie.",4,5,10,12 August 2006
Suicide Squad," Dismal Crap.
","As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful.",3,1,4,19 November 2017
Elf," It's OK, but I'd rather watch Scrooged.
","Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichÃ©s in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.",6,1,3,27 December 2009
Taxi Driver," A classy character study of a disturbed individual—but what is the point?
","Insomniac Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job driving a New York taxi cab, becomes obsessed with beautiful political campaigner Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who gives him the cold shoulder after he tries to take her to a skin flick on a date. Bickle then becomes obsessed with underage hooker Iris (Jodie Foster), buys lots of guns, and goes trigger happy on her pimp (Harvey Keitel).As a fan of gritty 70s movie-making, I find it hard to believe that, until now, I hadn't seen Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver; I think perhaps the problem was that, having heard so many good things about the film, I didn't want to risk disappointment. Unfortunately, that's precisely what I felt when I finally got around to watching the film.It's not that it's a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination—on the contrary, it's a skilfully assembled character study of a self-destructive loose cannon that boasts excellent cinematography, great music, and superb performances—BUT in the end it just didn't grab me as much as I would have liked. The story progresses very slowly, which in itself isn't a massive issue for me, but the payoff simply isn't as satisfying as I felt it needed to be given all that has gone before.After all of his stalking, inane rambling and meticulous planning, Travis Bickle's rampage is over in a flash, after which he is proclaimed a hero and freed to roam the streets once more (unless you prescribe to the theory that everything after the shootout is in Bickle's mind as he slowly bleeds to death). Perhaps Scorsese's point was to show us just how easy it is for a dangerous loony like Bickle to be overlooked by society until its too late—but it sure felt like a letdown to me.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Keitel's hair.",7,2,4,5 April 2015
Shutter Island," At least it didn't go the Lynch route.
","While investigating the disappearance of a murderess from a hospital for the criminally insane, US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to suspect the staff of using the prisoners for medical experiments.Halfway through Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island and two possibilities crossed my mind: the first and most disconcerting was that the film would be a totally incomprehensible piece of self-indulgent surrealistic nonsense; my other concern was that, after two and half hours, it might finish with a supposedly clever but actually rather trite explanation for the events that had occurred—like the main character being one of the institute's patients, for example. But this is Scorsese, I reasoned, he surely wouldn't pull a Lynch or a Nolan on me.Think again, Brett After much confusion, Scorsese does indeed wrap up matters by revealing that Leonardo DiCaprio's character is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, having lost his marbles after shooting his wife for drowning their three children. It's far from the most unpredictable of twists, but—and this is a BIG 'but'—Scorsese's masterful direction (there's creepy atmosphere in abundance) and a strong central performance from DiCaprio ensure that the film is still a reasonably entertaining ride despite the frustratingly foreseeable denouement.",6,1,2,3 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Slam bang superhero fun.
","Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) is now a full-time agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., the high-tech law-enforcement agency led by eye-patch wearing champion of justice Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). After Fury is attacked by a mysterious metal-armed assassin known as The Winter Soldier. Accompanied by agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and pal Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Rogers sets out to discover who is behind the violence and finds that evil organisation Hydra has been thriving within the very walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is regarded by many comic-book fans to be the best superhero movie to date. X-Men Days of Future Past currently holds that title in my opinion, but I do agree that there is much to enjoy about this second cinematic adventure for the super powered, shield-flinging patriot in the snazzy stars and stripes uniform. The story is solid and the cast superb (it's particularly nice to see old-timers Robert Redford and Jenny Agutter on board), the special effects are extremely impressive, and the film's stunt-packed set-pieces are spectacular, combining fast and furious fight action, incredible vehicular carnage, blistering ballistic mayhem, and death-defying acrobatics.Unfortunately, in their effort to provide as many jaw-dropping thrills as possible, directors Anthony and Joe Russo occasionally misjudge matters, allowing proceedings to go way over the top, thereby preventing the film from being the masterpiece that it otherwise could have been. Cap's plummet onto a concrete pavement and Sam Wilson's leap from the 40th floor of a building into a waiting helicopter might look impressive, but their sheer preposterousness serve to take the viewer out of the movie, if only for a moment: suspension of disbelief can only go so far.8/10. Not perfect, but for the most part, another very entertaining addition to the Marvel cinematic universe.",8,1,4,8 September 2014
Doctor Strange," The visuals make it worthwhile.
","I was reasonably entertained by Doctor Strange despite not fully following the plot; my enjoyment was largely thanks to the sheer spectacle of the whole thing, the film featuring several jaw-dropping set-pieces that make the absolute most of modern digital technology. The basic story sees talented but arrogant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeking help from a mystical source when traditional methods fail to help him recover from a devastating car crash. Trained by a sorcerer known as The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Strange learns powerful magical spells that come in handy when he and his new friends are attacked by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who is trying to help a dark being from another reality take over Earth.While the script might be lacking somewhat in originality and clarity, every last cent of the budget is up there on the screen, director Scott Derrickson delivering mind-bending special effects sequences that really grab one's attention, from the opening fight in London in which buildings fold and distort, to the spectacular car crash that claims Strange's dexterity, to the astounding finale in which our heroes battle the bad guys while time runs backwards (words can't do this incredible technical feat justice: it needs to be seen to be believed).While not the greatest film in the MCU, Doctor Strange is a worthy enough entry that provides enough eye-candy for the duration. My rating: 7/10",7,1,2,25 December 2018
Interstellar," Disappears up its own black hole.
","As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.",7,28,53,10 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," J.J. fails to rise to the occasion.
","After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case.J.J. Abrams, who also directed the fair-to-middling Episode VI: The Force Awakens, gives us another visually impressive movie full of breathtaking worlds and amazing creatures, but his film suffers from a mediocre plot full of elements that make very little sense and which will annoy the hell out of Star Wars purists.The basic storyline sees Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her rebel pals trying to find where the evil First Order are gathering their forces, so they can launch a final assault and end the tyranny of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) once and for all. Along the way, Chewie (now played by Joonas Suotamo) is taken hostage, C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) gets his memory wiped, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) realises that, hey, perhaps being bad isn't for him after all.The whole thing rushes clumsily from one scenario to another with little care for logic, the makers clearly hoping that the dazzling on-screen spectacle will distract the viewer from the fact that nothing here is all that original, and that the narrative is choppy and often confusing, with many contrived moments that are there purely to further the plot, or to retroactively explain away mistakes in the previous movies.My biggest gripe is the scene in which Rey crosses a stormy sea (very impressive digital effects) to the wreckage of the death star. That's right... either the same death star that was blown into a gazillion atoms by Luke Skwalker in A New Hope (or perhaps the second one in ROTJ, also obliterated). Somehow, this massive chunk of debris crashed onto a planet and just happens to hold the artefact required to guide the rebels to the enemy. Talk about convenient. The most pointless scene is an Androcles-inspired encounter with a subterranean serpent. And the most blatant act of back-pedalling comes in a short scene that shows Leia training as a Jedi, so as to excuse her sudden 'space flying' ability in The Last Jedi.Of the bits that actually work, a chase scene involving our heroes on speeders and stormtroopers on caterpillar-tread bikes is exhilarating, a Pasaana festival (celebrated every 42 years! Geddit?) features some wonderful dancing Cthulu-like aliens, there's a cute Anzellan droidsmith called Babu Frik who guarantees a few giggles, Richard E. Grant makes for a nice new villain, and the physical psychic connection between Ren and Rey adds a new twist to the power of the force.Unfortunately, as someone who has been there from the start (I was 9 when Star Wars came out in '77), I cannot help but find Episode IX a disappointment. It's not quite as bad as The Last Jedi or Attack of the Clones (both 3/10 from me), but it's not the rousing finale that we have all been waiting for. Average just isn't good enough.",5,53,106,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Jaeger-bomb!
","In the near future, the Earth comes under attack from gigantic creatures that emerge from an inter-dimensional gateway in the Pacific seabed; the world's nations put aside their differences to fight back, developing massive robot warriors (called Jaegers) piloted by a pair of humans with a shared consciousness.With Pacific Rim, the battle is well and truly on. I'm not talking about the battle between robots and monsters around which the film revolves, but rather the battle between Guillermo Del Toro and Michael Bay to see who can make the most expensive, most tedious, most special effects driven piece of mainstream blockbuster drivel humanly possible.In an attempt to go one better than Bay's Transformers series, Del Toro's Pacific Rim not only features massive mechanoids causing untold damage but also throws in enormous monsters (known as Kaiju) for good measure. The result is a charmless mess of bland performances, difficult to follow, state-of-the-art digital mayhem, and nonsensical plot developments designed to please those viewers for whom logic, narrative cohesion and convincing acting are of little importance just as long as stuff gets destroyed on a massive scale.Transformers 4 and Pacific Rim 2 will no doubt up the ante even further—and probably prove all the more terrible for it.",4,2,3,23 March 2014
Rocky II," Do I get to win this time?
","Having gone the distance but narrowly lost his fight against heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in the first film, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) takes another crack at the world title, but not until after lots of soul-searching, melodrama, and the obligatory training montage.The film starts with Rocky, in danger of losing his sight, promising to hang up his gloves to please his concerned girlfriend/soon-to-be wife Adrian (Talia Shire). But when the money starts to run out, and as Apollo continues to goad him into a rematch (so that he can prove to himself and fans that the previous fight was a fluke), Balboa agrees to step into the ring once more, with old pal and trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) by his side.Basically a retread of the first movie, only with a different outcome, Rocky II is not as fresh as its predecessor, and suffers from some sluggish scenes: Rocky holding back on his training (his heart not in it because he doesn't have Adrian's blessing), and the boxer's anguish as his wife slips into a coma after giving birth to their son. Fortunately, solid performances from the excellent cast help carry the viewer through these slower moments, the film picking up momentum for the expected crowd-pleasing showdown against Creed.After Adrian comes out of her long sleep and gives Rocky the go-ahead, the Italian Stallion finally gets his mojo back and delivers a final act guaranteed to get the pulse pounding (helped not inconsiderably by Bill Conti's rousing score). The aforementioned training montage is a blast, the boxer turning into the pied piper of Philadelphia as hundreds of children follow him on his run through the streets, but it is the long-awaited battle with Apollo that really delivers the goods: it's pure Hollywood baloney, of course, with almost every punch hitting its target, but it's hugely entertaining and brilliantly staged, Balboa and Creed pushing each other to the limits of endurance. It'll come as no surprise that Rocky wins this time, but somehow writer/director/star Stallone still manages to make the fifteenth round edge-of-the-seat stuff, right up to the final bell.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,1,1,3 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror...
","Rather than listen to the desperate pleas of millions of Star Wars fans worldwide, George Lucas ploughs ahead with Attack of the Clones in precisely the same manner that made The Phantom Menace a disappointment of star destroyer proportions: there's even more boring political subterfuge, even more dreadful CGI, even more ridiculous OTT action sequences (worst bits being Obi Wan and Anakin in pursuit of an assassin and the very silly droid factory sequence), and even more bloody Jar Jar Binks!!And if all that doesn't make you want to hurl yourself into the nearest available Sarlacc pit in a fit of despair, then the badly written, poorly acted, sappy burgeoning romance between Anakin Skywalker and PadmÃ© Amidala will probably do the trick.About the only things that Lucas does right are to cast Hayden Christensen as the now-grown up Anakin, because his lousy acting perfectly complements the wooden performance given by Jake Lloyd in TPM, and to get Natalie Portman out of those bloody stupid queen outfits and into something a little sexierâ€”I'm not particularly a fan of Ms. Portman, finding her to be 'classically pretty' rather than smoking hot, but I have to admit that she does look rather delicious in her tight white outfit with impossibly toned midriff on display.",3,5,11,7 November 2010
Ant-Man," Small hero, big fun.
","After a three year stretch in San Quentin, brilliant cat-burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) attempts to go straight, but when he is fired from his job at Baskin Robbins, his criminal pals talk him into a potentially lucrative safe-cracking job that leads to the discovery of a special high-tech suit capable of shrinking a man to the size of an ant while increasing his speed and strengthI grew up reading DC Comics rather than Marvel, but the DC cinematic universe has disappointed me far more than it has impressed: in particular, I found the Nolan Batman films and Snyder's Superman movie overtly serious in tone, visually dreary and consequently rather dull. In contrast, the majority of Marvel's superhero films have been colourful, exciting, and, most importantly, a lot of fun. Despite a troubled production, Ant-man also manages to be all of these things.It might seem like a minor movie in the MCU when compared to the X-Men and Avengers films, which are far broader in scope, but Ant-man succeeds in delivering the requisite action and spectacle, as well as some much needed humour. The script, from Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright, is full of light-hearted moments that acknowledge the silliness of the whole concept, and director Peyton Reed keeps things moving along at a decent pace. The film also ties in nicely with the Avengers series with a neat scene in which Ant-man meets (and beats) Falcon (Anthony Mackie).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the incredible effects, best of all being the de-ageing of Michael Douglas.",8,0,1,14 February 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," All-American superhero fun.
","With its clean-cut all-American hero, beautiful heroine, nasty Nazi villains, and airborne action finalé, Captain America reminds me of Joe Johnston's earlier 1991 WWII 'superhero' movie, The Rocketeer; like that film, this Marvel superhero origin story proves to be a solidly entertaining adventure, but one that never really knocks the ball out of the park.In my opinion, Johnston has always been a competent action director, and knows how to use his special effects to best effect, and here he once again provides a very slick and entertaining popcorn movie, but he's yet to make a film that has really blown my socks off. Captain America comes close at times, but lacks that special wow factor to make it a bona fide classic of the genre.Still, it's undemanding fun for the duration, never pretending to be anything more than a rollicking World War tale designed to cleverly tie in this character with the other Avengers; and it's certainly more enjoyable than the drearier superhero movies of recent years—I'll take this film over dreadfully overblown nonsense like The Dark Knight or Man of Steel any day of the week!I look forward to The Winter Soldier, which by all accounts is even better",7,0,2,10 May 2014
Top Secret!," A generally mediocre spoof with occasional flashes of brilliance.
","Jim Abrahams and David Zucker, the creators of Airplane!, bring more madcap humour to the big screen with Top Secret!, which stars Val Kilmer as rock and roll singer Nick Rivers, who becomes involved in a resistance plot to rescue a scientist being held captive in East Germany.Kilmer, in his debut, is surprisingly good, handling acting, comedy and singing duties with aplomb, proving without a doubt that he is a major star in the making; Kilmer is joined by a wonderful supporting cast which includes more established faces such as Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, Ian McNiece and Michael Gough.Unfortunately, as talented as the cast are, the scattershot humour is far too random and wildly inconsistent to be a total success: for every laugh-out-loud moment (my favourites: a very silly dance routine, the novelty dog poop gag, the brilliantly executed Swedish book store scene, and the singing horse), there are dozens of others that will fail to tickle the funny bone.",5,4,8,23 June 2018
The Godfather: Part II," It's-a not so good.
","The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that is regarded by many to be as good as, if not better than, the original. I'm guessing that much of its popularity lies in the fact that it is not just a sequel, following Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he continues to expand his family's 'business', but also a prequel, charting Vito Corleone's life from a child in Sicily at the turn of the 20th century to powerful New York mafia don. Two films for the price of one!Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest. That's a disappointing average of 6/10.",6,23,41,7 March 2016
Predator," Pure action bliss.
","The year before he turned Bruce Willis into a bona fide movie star with his hugely successful and highly influential hit Die Hard, director John McTiernan gave Arnold Schwarzeneggar's film career a huge boost with sci-fi flavoured blockbuster Predator, an explosive, testosterone fuelled piece of gung-ho action packed with extreme violence, macho posturing, memorable dialogue, cool one-liners, big guns, and even bigger muscles.In what is arguably his finest film, the Austrian bodybuilder plays Dutch, leader of a group of highly trained commandos who specialise in rescuing hostages. After the team are duped by shady CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) into taking part in a seek and destroy mission in a Central American jungle, they find themselves being stalked by an unseen enemy: an extraterrestrial hunter visiting Earth with the intention of adding a few more human skulls to his trophy cabinet.Aided by a high-tech cloaking device, heat vision, and a shoulder mounted laser cannon, the creature kills the men one-by-one, until only Dutch is left standing, and the scene is set for an unforgettable final showdown.With taut, no-nonsense direction from McTiernan (hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the abysmal Rollerball remake), a rousing score from Alan Silvestri that perfectly complements the breath-taking action, and amazing visual effects that are way ahead of their time, Predator is a blast from start to finish (quite literally!).The film also benefits immensely from the cool-as-f@%k cast who play Dutch's impossibly tough team (which includes director Bill Duke, ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, screenwriter Shane Black, and Native American Sonny Landham), the gratuitous glorification of high-powered weaponry (let's hear it for the mini-gun!), plus one of sci-fi cinemas's most memorable monsters, designed by FX genius Stan Winston and played by 7' 2½' tall Kevin Peter Hall (both of whom are sadly no longer with us).Put simply, as far as action films go, it doesn't get much better than Predator.",10,4,6,15 July 2009
Léon: The Professional," The hit-man and her.
","An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,2,3,24 April 2017
Oblivion," I'll file this next to Interstellar: in the 'Unlikely to be watched again' category.
","2017: hostile aliens known as Scavengers wage war on the human race, blowing up the moon, causing catastrophic natural disasters on Earth. Sixty years later, and most of the surviving human population have left to start a new life on Titan (a moon of Saturn); only Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain, their job to track and repair the drones designed to protect the massive power plants that supply energy to the Earth crafts, the pair receiving their orders from Sally, who is located on an orbiting space-station called the Tet. But when Jack rescues a woman named Julia from the wreckage of a downed NASA spacecraft, he kickstarts a chain of events that will lead him to a shocking revelationThere's no denying that Oblivion is a visually impressive movie, with the post-cataclysmic scenery on Earth being particularly breath-taking, but the script and the direction leave a lot to be desired. The story is intentionally perplexing for most of the run-time, drip-feeding just enough information to keep the viewer intrigued to the finish, where loose ends finally pull together—but when all is said and done, there are simply too many contrivances, plot-holes, and unanswered questions to make it all work (Case in point: Why do the Scavs hide the fact that they are human? Why, to further the plot of course! Case in point, number two: isn't it convenient that that only survivor of the Odyssey happens to be Jack's wife?).If all of this nonsense had been flawlessly handled by director Joseph Kosinski then I might have been a little more forgiving about the iffy (and rather derivative) plot, but somehow he makes a big-budget film about Earth's fight for survival against a hostile extraterrestrial intelligence seem incredibly boring: for much of the time, it's just Cruise wandering the barren planet, fixing his machines or taking a break listening to records at his lakeside cabin, which soon gets tiresome—but even when the action scenes do kick in, the film is strangely devoid of excitement or tension. 124 minutes seemed a lot longer.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for the lovely Riseborough, who helped the time pass a little easier whenever she was on screen.",5,1,2,4 May 2015
American Pie," Even Chris Klein is good.
","Fed up with their lack of success with the opposite sex, four teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity before leaving high-school.In 1999, the teen sex comedya genre that had last flourished in the early to mid-80sreturned with a vengeance when American Pie became a runaway success at the box office. Directed by newcomer Paul Weitz, and featuring an almost unknown (at the time) cast, the film had 'em rolling in the aisles thanks to its no-holds-barred, gross-out humour. Masturbation; oral sex; premature ejaculation; diarrhoea; intercourse with baked goods; the accidental ingestion of baby gravy: nothing was considered off-limits to these guys if it had the potential for hilarity.However, what made American Pie particularly special was that, despite the fact that the film's humour consisted primarily of wall-to-wall vulgarity, it also managed to be kinda sweet in the process. The main characters, a group of likable high-school geeks who are faced with the seemingly insurmountable task of getting laid, are not presented as vacuous ass-holes with one-track minds, but rather as young adults who are simply coming to terms with the responsibilities and pressures of adulthood: something that most people have to deal with at some point in their lives.Of course, from a bloke's point of view, it doesn't hurt that the film also features some rather gorgeous women: Tara Reid is oh-so pretty; Mena Suvari is doe-eyed and innocent; Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot (and nekkid!); and Alyson Hannigan is there for all of those who dig nerdy chicks. Something for all tastes, it would seem.",9,0,1,13 April 2008
The Last Legion," The sword in the CGI stone.
","The Last Legion is a lavish, all-star mythological/historical epic with an ambitious storyline that links the last Caesar of Rome with Arthurian legend; it's also horribly miscast, boasts stilted dialogue, suffers from poor visual effects and mediocre action, and mines every hoary medieval movie cliché imaginable, all the while pandering to a family audience with its child-friendly blood-free battles.Colin Firth stars as Aurelius, commander of the imperial guard, who leads a small band of warriors (including Bollywood hottie Aishwarya Rai as sword-swinging badass babe Mira) to rescue child emperor Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) and his teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley) from exile on Capri, after which they schlep to Britannia to try and find the last of the Roman legions.Director Doug Lefler's previous experience includes helming episodes of Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess, and it shows, his film feeling more like a feature length version of one of these cheesy shows rather than the grandiose sweeping saga it so dearly wants to be. File next to Uwe Boll's In The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007) and Dungeons & Dragons (2000).",2,0,2,3 April 2017
Watchmen," I finally watched Watchmen.
","After Snyder's atrocious treatment of Frank Miller's 300 (see my IMDb review for details), I was hardly in a rush to see Watchmen, fearing another digitally graded, big-budget CGI w**k-fest with events playing out at half speed; however, being a fan of Alan Moore's work since the early 80s, I finally relented and was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.Surprised because, although Snyder's Watchmen contains more than its fair share of slo-mo action scenes, orange and teal imagery, and digitally generated nonsense, it didn't annoy me as much as I had anticipated. Surprised because, despite moving at a leisurely pace for almost three hours, I was never bored. Surprised at the extreme level of sex and violence (I thought they might water this down for mass consumption). And surprised by the intelligence of the script (Moore does intelligent easily; Snyder not so much).If I had seen Watchmen a few years ago, I would have been rather excited when it was announced that Snyder was reworking Superman. As it happens, I wasn't and Man of Steel turned out to be every bit as dreadful as I had feared Watchmen would be.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for Malin Akerman, who looks incredible both in and out of that amazing costume.",8,0,3,24 November 2013
Baby Driver," Worse than Scott Pilgrim.
","I heard in an interview that Edgar Wright compiled the music for Baby Driver before writing the script. The music (not my cup of tea, but others seem to like it) has clearly been given a lot of consideration; the script, not so much.A hackneyed tale of a young heist driver (Ansel Elgort) indebted to a crime boss (Kevin Spacey), Baby Driver is pure vacuous tripe, a severe case of style over substance, Wright once again proving that, if his film ain't got Pegg and Frost in it, it ain't worth watching.As the viewer, we are intended to empathise with kind-hearted Baby, who would rather provide for his deaf foster father and drive into the sunset with pretty waitress Debora (Lily James) than spend his life outrunning cops, but after a few minutes in his company, I wanted the irritating git out of the picture, his dancing, miming lyrics and playing air instruments quickly getting my goat. I could fully appreciate why the other criminals found him so annoying.Wright handles the car chase scenes well enough, but when the tyres aren't screeching, the film is absolutely horrible, the characters talking like rejects from a bad Tarantino movie, the rapid romance between Baby and Debora utterly unbelievable, and the endless calculated cool scenes merely grating on the nerves.My advice to Edgar Wright: give Pegg and Frost a call and break out the Cornettos.",2,6,12,20 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A short review for a very long film.
","Although it may not be entirely faithful to the book, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy perfectly captures the essence of J.R.R. Tolkein's fantasy classic: it's magical, imaginative and completely unforgettable, but also extremely long and a little hard going at times. Those who stay the distance, however, seem to agree that a bit of perseverance is well worth it in the end.The Fellowship of the Ring is perhaps the most laborious of the three films, what with the setting up of the plot, the introduction of a multitude of characters, and several talky scenes eating into the 171 minutes running time, but thankfully the film's impressive fantasy fighting action, breath-taking scenery, and amazing performances more than make up for the duller moments.All in all, I found The Fellowship of the Ring to be an admirable start for this ambitious attempt at bringing Tolkein's complex fantasy epic to the screen.",8,3,5,17 October 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," Revolutions  nice visuals, shame about the story!
","All cod-philosophy and pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo, wrapped up in a tasty CGI coating, the third installment from the Wachowski's does nothing to make sense of what went before and adds further confusion with its incomprehensible script.Technically, however, this movie is about as good as they get. The special effects are simply breath-taking  Matrix Revolutions looks fantastic and is worth watching for the visuals alone! The ending  well, I wish I could say it wrapped the trilogy up in a satisfactory manner, but I really can't. In fact, I wish I could say I knew what the hell was going on in the last two Matrix films, but I can't do that either. Still, they looked good. I did mention that, didn't I?",6,1,2,30 January 2006
Man of Steel," Even the 3D sucks.
","I loved Zack Snyder's debut movie, the thrilling 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead; it must have been beginner's luck, because everything I have seen by the guy since has been utter garbage, with Man of Steel being no exception. Two and a half hours of superficial, overblown, CGI packed nonsense that fails spectacularly to make an emotional connection with the viewer in the first hour and thereafter settles for mindless action, the film is worse than I expected—and I never expected it to be good.The special effects employed in 1978's Superman The Movie might have been crude in comparison to the spectacular mayhem presented here, but as an overall experience, the Christopher Reeve film wins hands down, director Richard Donner giving his audience humour, pathos and a genuine sense of awe, helped in no small part by the wonderful John Williams score; Snyder achieves only boredom, his huge explosions and random destruction rapidly becoming extremely tedious.Tall, muscular and handsome, Henry Cavill makes for an impressive Supes (even in his dingy 21st century version of the iconic costume), Michael Shannon is suitably imposing as General Zod, and although Amy Adams is miscast as feisty reporter Lois Lane, I never complain when she is on-screen. But as hard as the cast might try, the magic is simply not there, David S. Goyer's plot-hole ridden script and Snyder's soul-less direction making this as bad as, if not worse than, Superman Returns (2006).4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for Ms. Adams—who is as lovely as always—and that bad-ass, dark-haired Kryptonian chick, both of whom helped prevent me from dozing off.***EDIT*** I've changed my mind, this is only worth a 4 at best.",4,20,36,29 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," The return of 'The Rage'.
","Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's sequel to 28 Days Later is a scary, white-knuckle roller-coaster ride of a horror movie that is nightmarish, extremely nihilistic, gory and very grim. And to the director's credit, despite a few silly plot turns (which, with a little more thought could probably have been avoided) and the over-use of a cinéma vérité style which at times makes following the action very difficult, the film is still hugely enjoyable.In the opening scenes, set during the original outbreak of 'The Rage', we meet Don (Robert Carlyle) who, along with his wife and a few other survivors, are barricaded inside a cottage. When the infected finally smash their way in, Don makes a break for it, abandoning his wife, believing her to be a goner.28 weeks later, with all the victims of the virus now dead through starvation, Don (now in London) is reunited with his two children, who are back in the UK after being evacuated to Spain. However, his kids (in silly plot development number one) break out of a supposedly secure area in order to visit their old home to retrieve some belongings. Whilst there, they meet their mother, who (in silly plot development number two) has somehow not only survived multiple bites from the infected, but has also made it to London in one piece.The kids and their mum are rounded up and returned to the 'safe' area, where a doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne), believes the mother to be carrying genes which make her immune to the virus. Unfortunately, although she is not a slavering killer lunatic, she is now a carrier for the virus; when she is reunited with her husband and (after forgiving him for bailing out on her) gives him a kiss...well, all hell breaks loose!From here on in, the film is totally nerve-wracking stuff. With a new outbreak of 'the Rage' causing havoc, the military have orders to exterminate everyone in the area, including Don's son, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), and daughter, Tammy (Imogen Poots). Together with Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a sniper who has abandoned his post, Scarlet (who realises that Andy may also have the immune gene), and a couple of other survivors, Andy and Tammy attempt to escape both the army and the 'zombies' (including, in silly plot development number three, an infected Don, who seems to be somehow tracking his kids) and plan to rendezvous with Doyle's pal Flynn (Lost's Harold Perrineau), a helicopter pilot.28 Weeks Later is cracking entertainment, with exciting car chases, scenes of excessive gore, and a genuine feeling of pathos (helped immensely by great use of the terrific score). Yes, it is let down somewhat by Fresnadillo's frantic, wobbly documentary style (which I appreciate was an attempt to fully immerse the viewer in the situation, but I would've liked to have seen it used a touch more sparingly) and the aforementioned 'silly' moments, but it is still a very effective shocker.Even with its flaws, I give 28 Weeks Later a very admirable 7.5/10 (rounded up to 8 for IMDb) for being such a blast (and for having 'that' helicopter scene!).",8,9,21,8 May 2007
The Thing," Carpenter does his own thing.
","John Carpenter's remake of The Thing From Another World has divided the opinions of sci-fi/horror fans ever since its original release: the film was a box office failure, panned by the critics, primarily for its bleak, emotionless content and over-reliance on excessive violence and gore, but has since been declared by many as a classic for the very same reasons. Judging by the comments here on IMDb, the debate still rages...As far as Carpenter's storytelling is concerned, I'm kinda pitched between the two camps: there are some very effective scenes in which the director successfully creates an Alien-style atmosphere of paranoia, mistrust and fear between his increasingly desperate characters; and there are some equally dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks moments that simply defy logic, particularly as the film reaches its poorly conceived and annoyingly inconclusive climax.What is undeniable, however, is that The Thing does deliver some of the most spectacular and gloopy gross-out make-up effects in the history of horror cinema, and for that reason alone, the film makes my 'recommended viewing' list. Devised by FX wizard Rob Bottin, the incredible metamorphic creatures that burst onto the screen in the film's show-stopping scenes of visceral horror are quite breath-taking, and to this day, these physical effects easily hold their own against contemporary CGI movie magic.Oh, and Dean Cundey's cinematography is pretty damn good too.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,0,4,27 February 2010
Pitch Black," The plot has more holes than the hull of Fry's spaceship.
","A deep-space passenger ship is hit by meteorites that breach the hull, forcing pilot Fry (Radha Mitchell) to crash-land on a nearby planet capable of sustaining human life. Incredibly, Fry and a handful of her passengers survive the impact, including mercenary Johns (Cole Hauser) and his extremely dangerous prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).After investigating their new surroundings, the survivors come to the conclusion that they are on a dead world, all indigenous life having long been wiped out. In fact, there is one species still very much alive: flesh-eating, light-sensitive creatures that live below ground, away from the deadly glare of the planet's three suns. Unfortunately for Fry and company, they are about to be plunged into darkness by an eclipse that occurs once every 22 years, and which signals the emergence of the aliens from beneath the surface.The survivors only chance of making it off the planet alive involves transferring energy cells from their downed craft to a functioning ship discovered at a nearby deserted mining colony, a task that requires putting trust in Riddick, whose surgically enhanced eyes enable him to see in the dark.I'm willing to forgive the whole convenient 'breathable atmosphere' issue (as I do for one of of my favourite sci-fi films, Enemy Mine), but sci-fi horror Pitch Black throws up one unbelievable plot contrivance after another, completely ignoring logic in favour of thrills, thereby making it hard for me to rate it very highly despite some well handled action from director David Twohy, a memorable turn from gruff star Vin Diesel, and sexy Radha Mitchell in tight clothing.The silly plot simply leaves too many awkward questions: if the aliens have long eradicated all animal life on the surface, what the hell have they been eating ever since? How do creatures that burn up in daylight but which must come to the surface to feed evolve on a planet with three suns? Why do they even bother to come to the surface if they've already eaten everything? Just a few of the head scratchers that this poorly scripted flick fails to answer.",5,2,6,5 December 2015
Split," Lays the groundwork for Glass.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.",7,0,0,17 January 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Solidly entertaining horror, but no classic.
","With his debut feature Haute Tension, director Alexandre Aja received mixed reviews: some saw the film as a breath of fresh air and hailed Aja as the future of horror; others lambasted it for stealing the plot from Dean Koontz's book Intensity and delivering an unbelievable twist ending. I am definitely in that second camp.Aja proved to me that he certainly has no problem in delivering the requisite gore and he has an eye for a nicely framed shot, but decent ideas and an inability to create an atmosphere seem to be his sticking points. For his second movie, remaking a classic like The Hills Have Eyes didn't seem like such a wise move to me.The new version, for the most part, follows the original pretty faithfully (a family gets stranded in the desert and are attacked by cannibalistic mutants) but adds all of the bells and whistles too often expected of a modern horror movie: we get loads of extremely convincing gore, a pretty girl, some MTV style editing, and the possibility of a sequel. The result is a relentlessly gruelling experience, but Aja forgets a couple of things that would've massively enhanced the experience for me: a smidgen of tension and a tad of originality.Aja makes the mistake of thinking that, by totally disgusting his audience, he can ignore the fact that a good horror should scare. I love a decent dose of gore as much as the next splatter fan, but I like to be frightened too and feel that Aja missed a great opportunity to absolutely terrify the pants off the audience.The French director also loses his way when the movie veers too close to Texas Chainsaw Massacre territory: Doug (Aaron Stanford), the pacifist husband of eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) discovers the home town of the mutants, a dilapidated nuclear-bomb test area, whilst searching for his abducted baby daughter. In one of the decaying houses, he discovers a chair-bound freak who handily fills in the audience with some background story detailing the cannibals' existence. Doug is then captured by the freaks, and subjected to all kinds of horror in a charnel house before escaping, and exacting bloody revenge. This whole section is way over-the-top, stretches plausibility and seems completely out-of-place. It was if Aja, knowing that he wouldn't get a chance to remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (having already been retold in 2003), tried to shoehorn his version into this film instead.The Hills Have Eyes is a passable slab of modern horror; it does manage to revolt and is never boring, but I do think that Aja needs to choose his next project very carefully. I sincerely believe that he has talent and, at some point in the future, he will deliver a truly great horror film; one that doesn't rely on borrowing thematically from others or on dishing out excess gore. I look forward to that day.",7,0,3,21 August 2006
American Psycho," Businessman Bateman makes a killing, both at work and at home.
","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish.",9,3,6,6 July 2010
North by Northwest," I really like the direction Hitchcock took with this film.
","North by Northwest is a breezy espionage thriller, much lighter in tone than Hitchcock's later cold war spy movies, Topaz and Torn Curtain, and a whole lot more enjoyable as a result. Cary Grant plays Madison Avenue advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill, who is abducted by ruthless spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his cohorts, who have mistaken him for an FBI agent named George Kaplan. Unable to convince the enemy of his real identity, Roger escapes and goes on the run to look for the real Kaplan, aided by a beautiful, mysterious blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).The action moves along at a brisk pace, with charismatic lead Grant making for a likeable protagonist and Hitchcock delivering a couple of his most iconic scenes-the crop duster attack and the finalé on Mount Rushmore-both of which are excellent. It's not all perfection-the moment where Thornhill is framed for murder is laughable, the poor sap grabbing the knife buried in a man's back and then turning towards a news photographer who just happens to have his camera at the ready-but for a couple of hours of pure escapism, North by Northwest is a good way to go.",8,2,3,14 June 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Introducing the T-X.
","Schwarzeneggar is back (he said he would be) as another T-1000 cyborg sent through time to protect the now grown up John Connor (Nick Stahl), and his future wife, Kate (Claire Danes), who are being stalked by the T-X (Kristanna Loken), the latest in murderous machines hellbent on destroying the human race.Rise Of The Machines might not be the (near) perfect juggernaut of an action sequel that was Cameron's Judgement Day, but as far as edge-of-the-seat, sci-fi fun goes, it's still bloody good! Director Jonathan Mostow certainly makes the most of his mega-budget, and delivers plenty of jaw-dropping mayhem along with loads of impressive special effects. And Schwarzenneggar does what he does best: blowing things up, shooting huge weapons, and delivering cheesy one-liners.The (mostly) smart script follows on nicely from The Terminator and T2, further developing the character of John Connor, neatly explaining away the absence of Linda Hamilton in a not-too-disappointing way, and brilliantly bringing the whole affair to a satisfying, and not altogether happy, conclusion. There is blistering action (a set piece involving a massive crane causing untold damage to umpteen cars and buildings is absolutely incredible), some nice touches of humour, and a bit of quite gruesome violence (for a DVD that is rated 12!).Sure, T3 isn't quite as good as its predecessors, but how many films are? Both the original The Terminator and T2 are extremely tough acts to follow. I think Rise Of The Machines does a pretty good job and deserves a lot more praise than it gets.",8,91,147,3 December 2007
The Orphanage," Move over, Asia. Europe is back!
","From it's impressive title sequence, in which children's' hands tear away layers of wallpaper to reveal the credits, to the amazingly haunting finalé which manages to be sad, happy, and thoroughly disturbing all at the same time, The Orphanage is another brilliant film that, along with recent unmissable efforts such as The Descent and À l'intérieur, suggests that Europe is finally attempting to reclaim its title as the reigning continent for original horror.Busty Belén Rueda plays Laura, a woman who brings her family (husband Carlos and adopted son Simón) to live in her childhood home, 'The Orphanage' of the title, where they hope to set up a refuge for handicapped and needy orphaned children.After a visit to a cave system at a nearby cove, Simón begins to communicate with a group of imaginary friends: six children who just might be the ghosts of Laura's old childhood playmates. When Simón mysteriously disappears, and a weird old woman comes calling at the house, Laura is plunged into a supernatural nightmare that forces her to consider the impossible as possible, and pushes her to the limits of her sanity.Loaded with bags of atmosphere, and tons of good old fashioned 'scares' (but very little gorealthough there is one standout 'yuck!' moment!), The Orphanage is a classic ghostly yarn which, thanks to excellent direction from Juan Antonio Bayona and a great central performance from Rueda, manages to be a breath of fresh air in a genre that, lately, seems to have been rather clogged up with remakes and 'torture porn'.And then there is the ending: so unexpected, so tragic, so effing brilliant, that it'll have you thinking about the film for days, poring over plot details and constantly re-evaluating what you have seen.There are those who believe that The Orphanage is not a ghost story at all, with the seemingly supernatural events being a figment of Laura's imagination; then there are those who, like me, take the film at face value. Whatever your interpretation of the events portrayed, I can guarantee that The Orphanage will scare, shock, and surprise you like no other film has done for quite a while.Now how long will it be before the inevitable Hollywood remake?",10,1,4,11 April 2008
The Shining," It was snowing last night—perfect weather for The Shining.
","I often struggle with Jack Nicholson, finding his distinctive off-screen persona so evident in his acting that it's hard to for me to accept the bloke as anyone but himself. Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a character—not even for the Joker.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the man calling the shots behind the camera was one of the finest film-makers to have ever lived—Stanley Kubrick; if anyone could get a convincing performance from Nicholson, it was going to be Stan. With an unforgettable central turn from its star and flawless direction from Kubrick, The Shining is one of the best horrors of all time, offering stunning camera-work, unsettling music, iconic visuals, and scene upon scene of unbridled suspense and terror. In fact, it's so scary that I find I can even overlook (pun intended) Shelley Duvall's freakishly large eyes and scary teeth, and that's saying something!",9,0,2,10 February 2012
"I, Robot"," I, Entertained.
","Movies have been warning us for quite some time now: artificial intelligence will only result in the downfall of mankind, with humans either enslaved by machines or wiped out completely. In this near-future blockbuster sci-fi, technophobic cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) is convinced that the robot rebellion is underway after Dr. Alfred Lanning, creator of the advanced NS-5 robot, takes a high dive out of his office window. The death is labelled as a suicide by Lanning's boss, but Spooner calls foul-play, suspecting Sonny, an NS-5 unit who is found in the scientist's locked lab, and who flees the scene when confronted. As Spooner investigates further, and gets closer to uncovering the truth, he finds himself repeatedly under attack from malevolent machines.Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow), I, Robot is a rollicking ride with a solid turn by its charismatic star and cutting edge CGI effects (at the time), all wrapped up in an engaging story. Proyas' vision of 2035 might seem a little far-fetched, there's a little too much product placement (albeit very cool looking futuristic product placement) and at least two scenes stretch plausibility beyond breaking point (Spooner's car attacked by robots in a tunnel and the OTT finale), but I couldn't help but have fun with this one, finding the whole idea of errant AI machines fascinating—a glimpse of what the future might hold in store for us all if we're not careful.7.5 out of 10, which I'll generously round up to 8 even despite the presence of Shia LaBeouf.",8,0,1,9 December 2016

When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).10/10: one of the finest films of the 90s and well deserving of its five Oscars.",10,2,3,31 December 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," You want incredible action and excitement? No problemo....
","Seven years after he first said he'd be back, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator whose mission is not to destroy mankind, but to ensure its survival by protecting 10-year old John Connor (Edward Furlong), future saviour of the human race, from a T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a highly advanced, seemingly unstoppable liquid-metal killing machine.It's 1991: Arnie is a major box office draw, director James Cameron has spent years developing movie technology, Guns 'n' Roses are rocking the charts, and I'm only too happy to stump up some hard earned cash to see all three join forces for the follow-up to 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator. The original was a masterful piece of low-budget film-making; with a much bigger budget and the latest special effects technology at his disposal, Cameron's sequel was a must-see.It didn't disappoint.Twenty years later: even though film-making technology has advanced in leaps and bounds over the last two decades, and budgets have got bigger and bigger, very few movies have provided me with as many perfectly executed cinematic thrills as T2. An incredible action juggernaut packed with unbelievable scenes of OTT mayhem, iconic performances, and groundbreaking effects, all accompanied by an unbeatable Brad Fiedel score and Axl Rose's unmistakable wailing, this still ranks as one of the biggest and best sci-fi/action flicks ever made. Not only does the film deliver everything you could want in terms of explosive entertainment, but it also has some wonderful humour and a lot of heartâ€”and anyone who says otherwise can eat me!",10,3,4,8 November 2011
Salt," Jason Bourne in a skirt.
","Angelina Jolie is Jason Bourne in a skirt in this politically charged action thriller from director Philip Noyce. Jolie plays CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is revealed to be a Russian sleeper agent planted in the U.S. to carry out a plot called Day X. But have years of living the America way swayed her allegiance?If there's one thing I find even more puzzling than Angelina Jolie as a sex symbol (the gaunt face and puffy lip thing does nothing for me), it's her status as an action star: here, she is completely unconvincing as a highly trained special agent able to defeat countless enemy in unarmed combat, fall from great heights with nary a scratch, and leap from truck roof to truck roof on a busy freeway. Her slight frame looks as though it would smash on impact.Noyce conducts proceedings with an assured hand, and achieves a gritty realism to the violence, but the complete miscasting of his skeletal star and a number of action sequences that push plausibility to the limits make this a somewhat frustrating watch overall.",6,2,6,2 August 2016
We're the Millers," Aniston gets 'em off.
","To pay off a debt, small-time pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) agrees to smuggle a shipment of marijuana across the border from Mexico; in order to raise less suspicion, he assembles a fake family, comprising of stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) as his nerdy son, and homeless waif Casey (Emma Roberts) as his daughter.Okay, I'll admit it like most male viewers (I suspect), my main reason for watching We're The Millers was to see Jennifer Aniston doing her well publicised striptease routine, but I actually found the film entertaining for several other reasons: while not all of the gags necessarily hit the mark, those that do are extremely funny and there are enough laughs throughout to make the trip with the 'Millers' worthwhile; the cast is extremely likable and work very well together; and although it's a tad cliché, there is a fuzzy, feel-good factor about the whole thing despite the film being about drug smugglers.Although it's unlikely to make anyone's All-Time Top Ten Comedies list, We're The Millers is an enjoyable enough time waster with the added bonus of Aniston in her undies.",7,0,1,21 September 2013
Apocalypse Now," The REDUX version
","'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-pieceâ€”an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyriesâ€”is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10.",5,1,1,17 December 2015
Disturbia," A surprisingly taut, well crafted horror/thriller.
","When troubled teen Kale (Shia LaBeouf) takes a pop at his Spanish teacher, he is sentenced to three months house arrest, with an electronic tag around his ankle to prevent him from straying too far from home. His X-Box and iTunes privileges revoked by his milf-ilicious mother (Carrie-Anne Moss, who I wouldn't mind being shacked up with for three months), Kale indulges in a spot of voyeurism, which proves to be far more interesting than any video game: the man in the house opposite is having an affair with his maid; sexy new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) spends much of her time relaxing in the pool; and it appears as though creepy neighbour Mr. Turner (David Morse) has been busy abducting and hacking up local women. Enlisting the help of best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and, of course, Ashley, Kale attempts to prove that the man next door is the cold-blooded psycho he believes him to be.A contemporary PG-13 (or Cert 15 here in the UK) take on Hitchcock's classic Rear Window cursed with a silly title and Shia LaBeouf in the central role: sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it? Thankfully, Disturbia's director D.J. Caruso steers well clear of the expected trappings that blight many a modern youth-orientated horror/thriller (extremely obnoxious characters, MTV style gimmicky visuals, OTT gore) and opts instead for good-old fashioned suspense and edge of your seat thrills. Caruso successfully creates a palpable sense of tension, which he somehow sustains even when occasionally pushing the limits of believability, and his cast all give commendable performances, the younger performers actually making their characters fairly likable and the more experienced thesps providing solid support (Morse in particular gives a very memorable turn as the sinister Mr. Turner).The film builds inexorably to a well executed and nail-biting finale deep inside the bowels of the murderer's house, where some nasty surprises await intrepid young Kale (extra points awarded for the inclusion of a water logged pit full of mouldy corpses!).",7,1,2,5 September 2010
Van Helsing," Fangs for nothing, Mr. Sommers.
","At one point during Stephen Sommers' comic book horror/adventure Van Helsing, Count Dracula states that he 'has no heart, he is unable to feel joy or sorrow, he is hollow'. I know exactly what he means because that's how I felt whilst watching Sommers' film: completely unmoved by the whole experience.Sure, there's a ton of in your face special effects and spectacular set-pieces galore, but none of it connects. It's not scary, it's not funny (despite trying), and it's not exciting; it's just there on the screen, flashy, slick, and irritatingly loud, for over two very long hours. For today's gaming generation, I guess this might be enough, but I found the whole affair lacking.Hugh Jackman's titular character is a Vatican-approved vampire slayer who is given the task of hunting down and destroying Dracula before he is able to bring to life his multitude of spawn (the result of having 400 years to kill with three very hot brides). Along with trusty sidekick Carl (who is responsible for an array of technologically advanced weaponry) and beautiful Transylvanian princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale in a tightly laced corset—yum!), Van Helsing faces a series of monstrous creatures and perilous pitfalls as he battles to save the world from the evil count and his offspring.After a fairly promising opening scene—a classy monochromatic homage to the Universal monster movies of the 30s and 40s—Sommers says 'to hell with logic and pacing', slams his movie into top gear, and unleashes a barrage of outrageous action scenes and lavish computer effects that lend the film a sense of realism that is comparable to your average Looney Tunes cartoon.The result is audacious to say the least, but the director pushes his luck too far, overstepping the mark on many an occasion: against convention, his Dracula is only vulnerable to werewolves (?!?!); his plot reveals a cure for lycanthropy, a contrivance that proves very convenient for our hero; Van Helsing and Anna possess unnatural agility and superhuman resilience, performing Olympic standard gymnastic moves with ease and surviving numerous high falls without suffering so much as a scratch; Van Helsing leaps over a chasm in a horse drawn carriage; and Frankenstein's monster swings through a window on a power cable to rescue Anna from a vampire.To be fair, Sommers' mish-mash of monsters and mythical mayhem isn't completely devoid of worth—the sultry brides of Dracula are great, the set design is fantastic, and Greg Cannom's make-up is impressive, particularly for Frankenstein's monster—but the film's 'positives' are overwhelmed by the effects and the sheer unrelenting silliness of the action which stretches plausibility to breaking point.",4,2,4,24 June 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Proper nasty witches, warts and all.
","Really wicked witches have been woefully under-represented in cinema over the years, with only a handful of films genuinely doing the scary old hags justice; Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters sees Norwegian writer/director Tommy Wirkola doing his utmost to raise their profile as movie monsters, offering up more malevolent, wizened, child-eating crones than you can shake a broomstick at.With his focus clearly on the creation of these nasty witches, and their subsequent destruction by Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), Wirkola offers only the slightest of plots off which to hang the gory deaths, comic-book fighting, CGI effects, and numerous sneaky shots of Arterton's heaving bosom. Fortunately, for the majority of the time, Wirkola's handling of the action is slick enough to compensate for the lack of story, the weak writing only becoming really noticeable whenever there is a rare lull in pace.It's lead female star's tightly-corseted cleavage aside, the film's most enjoyable aspect is when it occasionally shifts up a gear to OTT, bats**t crazy violence mode, the most entertaining scenes being Hansel's bonkers battle with Siamese-twin witches and troll Edward's gory head-stomping rampage, both of which have energy and imagination to spare. If this level of enthusiasm for the bizarre and the grotesque had been applied just a little more often, I might even have been declaring a new favourite...",7,0,1,25 July 2013
Rocky IV," Rocky vs Russkie.
","Italian-American boxing champion Rocky Balboa becomes an all-American hero by taking on Russia in the ring, the Eastern Bloc represented by formidable Soviet slugger Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Having already killed Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) during an exhibition match in the States, Drago sets his sights on the reigning Heavyweight Champion of the World, keen to prove his superiority over the West. Determined to avenge his friend, Rocky flies to the USSR to train, his old-school techniques in stark contrast with Drago's high-tech regime (which includes pumping steroids: those dirty, cheatin' Russkies!).If you thought that Rocky III was cartoonish nonsense, you ain't seen nothin' yet, for Rocky IV goes even further into the realms of the absurd, with a jingoistic, flag-waving fantasy that sees Stallone putting Mother Russia in her place, as he would also do four years later in Rambo III, where he helped the Taliban fight the evil Russian army. My, how times have changed.This very silly film starts as it means to go on with Rocky and family presenting Paulie (Burt Young) with a very special birthday gift, a robot that wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Lost in Space. It really is a stupid looking thing, with an oversized head, lots of blinking diodes and an AI system that is light-years ahead of its time, but it does let the viewer know immediately that this third sequel is far from grounded in reality. Likewise, Drago is very much an OTT cartoon villain: unfeeling, almost robotic, and superhuman, punching over twice as hard as his American opponents. This fact doesn't stop Rocky from showing 'The Siberian Express' who is best, defeating the ice-cold Russian with a good old dose of US grit, determination, and, of course, the eye of the tiger!Once again written and directed by Stallone, Rocky IV knows its audience and plays to it, with clear-cut heroes and villains, and an outcome more predictable than Jeffrey Epstein's 'suicide'. But as formulaic and stupefyingly daft as it all is, it sure is fun. Stallone has never looked better, his physique even more ripped than in part III; Lundgren is suitably emotionless; James Brown turns up to sing 'Living in America' before Apollo's Las Vegas defeat; there's not one, but two montages, the first playing like an MTV music video as Rocky is lost in his thoughts while driving, and the second being the obligatory grab-bag of training scenes (also set to a rousing rock number); and the whole thing culminates in the hard-hitting fight between East and West, not in the least bit realistic, but still exhilarating.After the battle between the superpowers is over, Drago having been defeated in the closing seconds of the 15th round, Rocky delivers a heartwarming speech about how we should put our differences aside and learn to be friends. Just so long as America is the more powerful friend.",7,0,0,6 September 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Carell goes all the way to make you laugh.
","I popped my 'Judd Apatow cherry' with Knocked Up, and the experience was less than satisfying: rather awkward, painful at times, and not something I was in a hurry to repeat. However, with The 40 Year Old Virgin, I really got in the mood, and by the time the end credits were rolling (just after the entire cast had performed their excellent rendition of The Age of Aquarius), I was completely spent, having shared two hours of my life in the company of a film that really knew what it was doing!The plot sees Steve Carell's likable nerd Andy Stitzer coerced by his work buddies into admitting that he has reached the grand old age of 40 without having sex. On discovering that Andy is still a virgin, they vow to help the poor guy get laid. It's a simple premise that delivers plenty of vulgarity, nudity, and childish humour (all of which I am in favour of), but at the same time allows you to care for its characters, even managing to throw in a bit of genuine romance and drama for good measure.Carell is great as the geek who has to grow a pair and confront his fears in order to find happiness, whilst the supporting cast who play his pals (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen) are all excellent in their respective roles. For me, however, Catherine Keener was particularly outstanding as the love interest, looking very hot for a 46 year old.At nearly two hours, the film is perhaps a little overlong and some judicious trimming could have improved the flow somewhat, but, on the whole, The 40 Year Old virgin is a very funny film and recommended to all open-minded viewers looking for a laugh (unless you happen to be a 40 year old virgin yourself, in which case you'll probably spend the whole movie cringing whilst pretending to laugh at the jokes. If that's the case, avoid it completely or watch it alonewhich I guess you probably would do anyway...).",8,1,2,6 September 2008
Face_Off," John Woo proves his worth.
","A brave cop and a despicable criminal swapping faces to assume each other's identity has got to be one of the most far-fetched ideas for an action flick ever; but as patently silly and flawed as the premise for Face/Off is, it still proves to be an extremely entertaining film, it's brilliance being down to the sheer audacity of cast and director, who never allow the ridiculous nature of the story to get in the way of the fun.After the rather lukewarm reception that critics gave his first two US movies (Hard Target and Broken Arrow), director John Woo was clearly determined to restore his reputation as a master of action cinema and went all out to impress: Face/Off is bursting at the seams with brilliantly choreographed mayhem, explosive action set-pieces, and Woo's unmistakable movie-trademarks—endless shooting (including the obligatory two-handed gun-play and Mexican stand-offs), doves, churches, gratuitous slo-mo, and inner turmoil and emotional strife for goodies and baddies alike (Sean Archer's identity crisis, Castor's grief at his brother's death, Sasha Hassler's fear for her child).This ultra-stylish, uber-kinetic direction from a director out to prove his worth, combined with hilariously unrestrained performances from Travolta and Cage, more than compensates for the movie's more questionable aspects (such as Archer's lack of remorse at maiming and killing umpteen guards during his prison break) and goes to make Face/Off an absolute blast from start to finish.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,1,1,23 February 2012
Spider-Man," A great start to the franchise.
","Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spiderman—and he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously).Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the way—a real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release.",8,0,1,4 July 2014
Shrek Forever After," Do the roar!
","After the dismal effort that was Shrek the Third, I had no real expectations from this fourth outing for Dreamwork's lucrative green ogre and his fairytale pals; all I was looking for was an hour-and-a-half's mindless distraction from a very boring cross-channel ferry journey.What a pleasant surprise it was, then, to discover that this latest Shrek adventure is not only much, much better than the previous chapter, but is actually as enjoyable as the first two, with a cool 'alternate reality' storyline, a memorable villain in the form of the marvellously malevolent Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn), some terrific new characters and plenty of familiar ones, loads of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments (Donkey's party trick with a pair of eyeballs still has me chuckling a week later), and a well-worn but still heart-warming message: that we should spend more time appreciating the good things we have in life, rather than yearning for the things we don't have.On the more technical side, the CGI is excellent and really makes me wish that I had seen the film in glorious 3D to fully appreciate the impressive visuals; furthermore, the voice-work is perfect as one would expect from the talented cast, and the choice of music is inspired (check out the witches busting some moves to The Beastie Boys).With Shrek the Third, it had looked as though the fairy-tale was finally over, but if Dreamworks can guarantee to keep the quality this high, I have no problems with them spinning out the franchise for a few more adventures.",9,9,11,1 September 2010
The Machinist," Very entertaining thriller with plenty for the mind to chew over.
","Whilst watching The Machinist, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between it and a handful of other recent movies which have unravelled in a similar manner. The narrative structure borrows heavily from recent hits such as The Fight Club, Identity, Memento, Insomnia and The Sixth Sense but despite this, I still found myself gripped by this tale of a loner desperately trying to understand the strange occurrences happening all around him. Director Brad Anderson fills the film with so much for the viewer to think about that one forgives him for being somewhat derivative (check out IMDb's trivia notes for some great facts, and then watch the film again - you'll see the film in a whole new light).Christian Bale deserves much of the credit for his portrayal of Trevor Reznik, a machine operator in a factory whose life is not all it at first seems. All skin and bones, Bale is barely recognisable  his dedication to his art lead him to shed 60 pounds in order to play the part  and he gives a performance that will haunt you long after you have seen the film.The other players give equally strong performances; Michael Ironside is his usual dependable self, John Sharian is superb as the malevolent Ivan and Jennifer Jason Leigh is still looking good playing the tart with the heart.In fact, it is only the final denouement that stops the film from being a wholly successful affair; the ultimate revelation is not as immediately powerful as that in the film it most closely resembles in style, the Sixth Sense. Whereas the twist in Shyalaman's film came in a totally unexpected way, The Machinist never hides the fact that we are heading towards a 'clever' ending. Consequently, the impact is somewhat diluted (although it does linger in the mind for a some time afterwards, as you slowly digest what you have seen).But this is a minor quibble with what is a thoroughly entertaining film. Enjoy it for what it is  a competently made, well acted, above-par thriller.",8,1,3,28 February 2006
Bad Teacher," Doesn't make the grade.
","A foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, pot-smoking, gold-digging, self-obsessed teacher (Cameron Diaz) tries to raise money for a boob job so she can land herself a rich boyfriend and give up working for a living. In the course of doing so, she embezzles cash from a school fund-raiser, lures an exam-board worker to his office with the promise of sex before drugging him and stealing the latest test sheets, and frames a hard-working and honest co-worker for the possession of drugs (after stealing her boyfriend). By the end of the film, Diaz's character is still as morally reprehensible as ever, having learnt nothing about the value of teaching (except for the monetary rewards that comes with results), which makes the whole sorry mess a totally pointless exercise. The moral of the movie seems to be 'do whatever the hell you want, no matter how it affects those around you'. What a lovely sentiment!Jake Kasdan, director of the recent Jumanji movies, fails to raise many laughs, working from a puerile and vulgar script that is more embarrassing than it is funny. Diaz is there, of course, to flaunt her body, which she does a lot, and she is still in cracking shape for someone knocking on the door of 40; however, time has been less forgiving on her face, which prevents her from being the complete sexy package that she is supposed to be in this film. To sum up: zero life lessons learnt, cringeworthy comedy, and a star who looks good in daisy dukes, but whose shelf life as a sex symbol is clearly coming to an end.",2,1,4,25 December 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," The origin of Spiderman again.
","Marvel wipe the slate clean to reboot their Spiderman franchise after the dreadful mess that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. This time around, it is Andrew Garfield playing teenager Peter Parker, who develops incredible spider powers—super strength, acrobatic skills and the ability to climb sheer walls—after being bitten by a genetically modified arachnid. When his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by a convenience store thief, Parker builds himself a pair of neat-o web-slinging devices, makes a natty outfit, and goes looking for the murderer. Meanwhile, one-armed scientific genius Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) creates a serum designed to regrow his missing limb, but which accidentally turns him into a hulking great CGI lizard in the process.While this reboot isn't quite as terrible as the third Raimi film, neither is it good enough to warrant starting things all over again. The script fumbles the origins of Spidey and feels utterly contrived (Parker being able to build web-shooters thanks to a handy synthetic material invented by Oscorp, student Gwen Stacey working part-time at Oscorp, those crane drivers helping Spidey to swing across town, Gwen rustling up an antidote to Connor's serum in a matter of minutes), Andrew Garfield proves nowhere near as likable as Tobey Maguire in the role, and Mark Webb's direction leaves a lot to be desired: I didn't care about any of his characters and his forgettable action scenes are over-reliant on unconvincing CGI.I have yet to see The Amazing Spiderman 2, but the fact that the character is getting yet another reboot in 2017 just goes to show that this particular incarnation isn't doing the trick.",5,1,3,6 April 2015
Aliens," The very scary and absolutely thrilling sequel to Alien.
","Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), last survivor of the ill-fated Nostromo, returns to do battle with more nasty xenomorph critters in James Cameron's blistering action-packed sequel to Alien, Ridley Scott's creepy '79 sci-fi chiller.Fifty-seven years after her first encounter with an alien on desolate planetoid LV-426, Ripley is discovered in suspended-animation by the crew of a salvage ship (that finds her shuttle craft floating aimlessly in deep space). After discovering that her daughter is now dead, and being suspended from duty by her disbelieving company, she starts a new job as a power-loaderÂ—a far cry from her esteemed position as the member of a flight crew.However, when the inhabitants of a terra-forming colony on LV-426 go missing, Ripley is offered her old job back (by slimy company man Burke, played by Paul Reiser), providing that she accompanies a bunch of space marines on their mission to discover what has happened.James Cameron, director of the fantastic The Terminator two years earlier, does away with the slow-burn terror of the original movie; after setting up the basic premise of his film, it becomes a non-stop thrill ride as Ripley and the heavily armed soldiers investigate the seemingly empty settlement only to find it is infested with tons of toothy terrors.After half of the marines are wiped out in a first encounter with the hostile ETs, and their 'drop-ship' crashes, Ripley and her team (plus a young girl named Newt who is found hiding in some air vents) try to stay alive long enough to figure a way out of their predicament.With its brilliant cast (including The Terminator's Michael Biehn as hero Hicks, Bill Paxton as coward Hudson, and Lance Henrickson as android Bishop), top notch special effects courtesy of industry legend Stan Winston, and Cameron's breath-taking handling of the action scenes, Aliens is solid entertainment from start to finish. Even the 'director's cut', which is extended by 17 minutes, breezes by without a dull moment.The finale, which sees Ripley protecting her surrogate daughter Newt by going head-to-head (using her power-loader, of course) with a giant alien queen is riveting stuff, and such is the overall quality of this movie I find it easy to ignore the occasional inconsistency (the acidic alien blood seems weaker in this film) or silly scene (such as Ripley successfully holding on to a ladder whilst being sucked out of an air lock with several tons of alien attached to her foot).Aliens is fantastic escapist fun and a worthy sequel to the brilliant original.",9,4,7,12 May 2007
The Fast and the Furious," The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.
","A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowd—those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.",7,1,3,25 July 2015
The Exorcist," Goodbut not great!
","Adapted for the screen by William Peter Blatty from his bestselling book about a young girl possessed by a demon, and directed by William Friedkin, The Exorcist is perhaps one of the most infamous scary movies of all time. When first released in the 70s, the film caused hysteria with people fainting in the theatres and requiring medical attention (the makers were accused of manipulating the audience with subliminal imagery). In the 80s, it was caught up in the 'Video Nasty' phenomenon, and when submitted for classification, was refused a release.The late 90s saw the film released uncut on DVD, and several versions have since been released, including 'The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'. which saw the movie given a digital makeover, and 11 minutes of footage (excised from the film's original release) reinstated.But is the film worthy of its reputation as 'the scariest film of all time'? Well, Friedkin's movie is, without a doubt, an intense viewing experiencebut only in places. Linda Blair's portrayal of Regan, the girl who must undergo an exorcism after she shows all the signs of possession, is simply breathtaking and her scenes are truly amazing. Her disturbing transformation from sweet little girl to foul-mouthed, puke-spitting blasphemer is one of horror's defining moments and still has the power to shock.Dick Smith's wonderful make-up and Marcel Vercoutere's mechanical effects make Regan's possession seem only too real; they include the now-famous revolving head scene, the levitating body and, in 'The Version You've Never Seen', the amazingly creepy 'spiderwalk'.However, between these compelling 'shock' scenes, the film tends to drag and certain issues in the film are left unresolved. The prologue in Iraq, which adds very little to the story, lasts way too long. How or why Regan comes to be possessed, and exactly how this is connected to the opening moments, is vague at best. Scenes involving the desecration of a church, a silver necklace and a small clay statue require further explanation to be understood.The Exorcist is a film that any self-respecting horror fan should see. It is a classy production, with solid performances and lovely cinematography. The film's influence on horror cinema has ensured it has a well deserved place in movie history. Whether or not it deserves the all of the praise that has been heaped upon it is another matter.",7,4,6,27 November 2006
Now You See Me," Izzy, wizzy, let's get busy!
","A team of Las Vegas illusionists called The Four Horsemen pull off a series of spectacular heists, donating their ill-gotten gains to their needy audiences.I cannot say that I wasn't entertained to some degree by Now You See Me's sheer preposterousness: I find it hard to completely hate unabashed nonsense on such a grand scale. Clearly, the film's greatest trick was getting the green-light in the first place. I'd like to know how they did that!Ridiculous plot twists abound, countless scenes are left unexplained, and characters conveniently behave exactly as the convoluted plot demands. It's all so far-fetched, and yet played with such seriousness, I was sure there would be an incredibly clever and hugely satisfying pay-off that would make it all worthwhile. Sadly, director Louis Leterrier fails to pull the rug from under the viewer's feet with a mind-blowingly brilliant ending. What he actually delivers is even more ludicrous than all that has gone before. And that takes some doing.",4,0,0,21 January 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The best superhero movie yet? I still have a few to catch up on, but this looks like a serious contender.
","Having been suitably impressed by the trailers, I really wanted to check this one out on the big screen before it went to DVD, but was slightly concerned by the fact that I had yet to see X-Men: First Class. I needn't have worried: although many of the events in this latest adventure do refer to the previous movie, for the most part I found it fairly easy to fill in the blanks for myself, and am happy to report that I had an absolute blast with what has got to be one of the finest superhero films ever made.An excellent cast, mind-blowing special effects, amazing direction by Bryan Singer, a fun time-twisting plot, Jennifer Lawrence in the buff (well, covered in blue paint and a few scales, but that's good enough for me!), the secret behind the assassination of JFK: X-Men: Days of Future Past is pure entertainment from start to spectacular finish. The 131 minutes just fly by.Although the basic plot mightn't be considered all that fresh—it's the old 'change the past to alter the future' scenario—the whole thing is so beautifully written and skilfully executed that any lack of originality is easily forgiven. The entire cast do an excellent job, with special props going out to Peter Dinklage for his awesome Anchorman style hair-do and 'tache, and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who provides the film with its most enjoyable moment, using his incredible lightning speed to save the other mutants whilst taking down an entire team of armed special agents.",10,2,7,28 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Team Cap vs Team Ironman.
","I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,0,4,10 May 2018
American History X," X-cellent.
","As a wise person once said (a long time ago): 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.' This proves all too true for Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), whose fear, frustration and rage at the murder of his father by a black gang member twists his soul, taking him not to the dark side, but to the white side—a neo-nazi gang called The Disciples of Christ—where his extremist beliefs and violent ways earn the respect of his peers, but only bring him and his family further pain and torment.Redemption for Derek comes during a stint in prison, his three year sentence for killing two black men giving him plenty of opportunity to realise the flaws in his philosophy and the error of his ways; with help from his African-American high school teacher Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), Derek achieves parole and endeavours to make amends for previous actions, rejecting his right-wing lifestyle and those who endorsed it. But will it be enough to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlobg) from making the same mistakes as he did?It's kind of fitting that, for such a film—one so focused on turmoil, struggle and radical beliefs—American History X is the result of an extremely troubled background itself, director Tony Kaye attempting to disown the final film after star Ed Norton saw fit to re-cut the film against his wishes. Amazingly, somehow, the finished film bears no signs of its tumultuous past, being a nigh on perfect study of the cyclical nature of bigotry, one that powerfully drives home the futility of blind hatred.Boasting many a brilliant performance, wonderful cinematography, smart editing throughout (Norton must've known what he was doing), and some almost poetic acts of violence, plus a powerful message at its heart, this is must-see cinema that makes the viewer think long and hard about what they have witnessed long after the shocking climax has faded from the screen.",10,0,2,2 December 2012
Saw III," 3 for the gore, but please... no more!!!
","In this second sequel to James Wan's inventive 2004 low-budget shocker Saw, an ex-drug addict and a terminally ill psycho once again play sick games on those judged guilty of 'wasting their lives'. After the lamentable Saw 2, which upped the gore content whilst overlooking the need for a credible plot, I expected the makers of this one to go back to the drawing board, but instead they opted to go one step further and deliver the sickest of the series so far and saddle it with the lamest plot possible.This time around, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), assistant to creative killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), kidnaps a doctor in order to keep her mentor alive to witness the outcome of one final game. Amanda, who has somehow become a top machinist and designer in between abducting people, has created some really nasty traps this time round, and these provide the film with its raison d'être: to disgust the audience in as many ways as possible.Now I'm no stranger to gory films, and have been known to enjoy some pretty dreadful movies solely on account of their high level of bloodletting, so when I say that I found Saw 3 very tedious despite of its extremely graphic violence, you can take it as gospel that the film sucked big time.Between the unbelievable death scenes, the movie is as dull as ditch-water and very far-fetched, with Jigsaw spouting more drivel about 'giving people a second chance at life' via his sadistic games, whilst Amanda looks on adoringly. This crap is obviously seen as some kind of justification for his evil doings, but when an innocent doctor is threatened with having her head blown off by multiple shotgun cartridges, the sicko's spiel loses its resonance. Packed with the annoying grungy, MTV-style editing that is so over-used in horror movies these days, some really awful acting (particulary from Shawnee Smith), and saddled with the most ridiculous 'twist' ending since M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, Saw 3 is the kind of tiresome bilge that is giving the genre a bad name.",3,2,5,5 March 2007
Spirited Away," I get the feeling that this review won't be very popular...
","As a huge fan of both animation and Japanese cinema, I have long felt more than a little embarrassed by my ignorance of celebrated director Hayao Miyazaki. Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.Although Spirited Away is undeniably impressive visually, with stylish animation and imaginative design throughout, everything else about the film leaves A LOT to be desired, especially the trite story, in which a little girl, Chihiro, gets lost in a strange world and encounters a series of whimsical fantasy characters while trying to find her way home. It's The Wizard of Oz, but without the star quality of Garland, the amazing flying monkeys, catchy tunes, cute dog, and over-sexed dwarfs in garish outfits; it's Alice in Wonderland without the pungent whiff of opium; it's Labyrinth without the allure of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, the star power of Bowie, and the magic of Henson; it's Coraline, but.errr nowhere near as good (speaking of Neil Gaiman, it reminded a lot of Mirrormask, which also bored me to tears with its random, meandering narrative).",3,12,26,22 June 2013
The Conjuring 2," Who you gonna call?
","Supernatural sequel The Conjuring 2 is a fictionalised account of the Enfield Poltergeist, which allegedly terrorised the occupants of a council house in Enfield, England in 1977. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who, having decided to take a break from investigating ghosts and demons after the trauma of Amityville, agree to travel to England in a purely observational capacity. Of course, they become far more involved than they originally intended once they see the plight of the family involved, single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), and her four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley), all of whom have had enough of their unwanted ghostly house-guest.At 134 minutes, The Conjuring 2 is about half an hour too long, and often feels like it is dragging its heels: there's only so many times that we need to see furniture being tossed around or the kids waking up to experience supernatural shenanigans. That said, the film is a serviceable sequel that should please fans of the original and those interested in the paranormal, partly because it is loosely based on fact (with the emphasis on 'loosely'), and partly because James Wan has had loads of practise when it comes to creepiness, the director conjuring up (pun intended) plenty of atmosphere and some well crafted scares. A solid cast also contribute to the film's effectiveness, with youngsters Wolfe and Esposito faring particularly well as the Hodgson sisters, who suffer the most from the haunted happenings.At the end of the day, the film doesn't do anything to rewrite the rules of the genre, but it's a slight improvement over the original. I was entertained enough to want to see what further sequels and spin-offs might hold (the latest being the forthcoming The Nun, which is based on the demon that is causing all the trouble in this film).",6,1,2,6 August 2018
Duck You Sucker," Viva Leone!
","Amidst the chaos of the 1913 Mexican revolution, explosives expert John (James Coburn) and bandit leader Juan (Rod Steiger) join forces to break into the bank of Mesa Verde, each with their own agenda.Sergio Leone is better known for giving us fistfuls of dollars than dynamite, but in my opinion this criminally under-appreciated spaghetti western is just as deserving of attention as the director's better known Eastwood movies.As its alternative US title—Duck, You Sucker—suggests, A Fistful of Dynamite begins in a rather comedic vein, the film's less-than-exemplary protagonists trading blows and quips in a series of comical encounters; but as the pair slowly form an unlikely friendship, so the film gradually develops into a far more poignant work, exploring numerous intelligent themes—bravery, honour, corruption, politics, betrayal, tragedy, judgement, retribution, heroism, sacrifice.John's back-story, in particular, gives the film much of its profundity and pathos. Told in a series of flashbacks, it depicts him as an idealistic IRA terrorist torn between friendship and his devotion to his political ethos, forced to make a split-second judgement that will forever haunt his life and affect his future. This complexity of character, perfectly portrayed by Coburn, and brilliantly realised by Leone, helps to elevate A Fistful of Dynamite above many films of the same genre.Of course, such a film wouldn't be complete without some gratuitous carnage, and Leone doesn't disappoint in this department either, delivering plenty of death and destruction in his own distinctive style and accompanied by yet another unforgettable Ennio Morricone score: sudden outbursts of violence from Steiger's deceptively buffoon-like bandit Juan; brutal executions carried out by the movie's loathsome villain Col. Günther Reza (Antoine Saint-John); a spectacular machine-gun massacre; an explosive train wreck. All of this is, of course, highly entertaining on a superficial level, but it also serves to drive home the film's more thought provoking messages about the horrors of conflict and the questionability of pursuing a path of violence to achieve one's goal.",9,2,5,28 December 2012
Tropic Thunder," It m-m-m-mmm-m-makes me happy.
","Although Tropic Thunder's humour, a mixture of clever satire and low-brow comedy, isn't always successful, with some of the gags falling rather flat, the ones that do work (and there are a lot of them) are so good that I'm willing to forgive the occasional dud.Star Ben Stiller (who also directs) plays yet another lovable imbecile, Hollywood action star Tugg Speedman, one of the cast of an epic, over-budget war movie who mistakenly become involved in a real battle against Golden Triangle heroin traffickers when their director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) tries to salvage his film by shooting guerrilla style deep in the jungles of Vietnam.Joining Tugg in the fight are co-stars Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), who takes his craft so seriously he undergoes skin pigmentation surgery to play an African American, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), drug addled star of fart-centric comedy franchise The Fatties, rap star Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), and newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel).Exactly which bits tickle your funny bone the most will depend on your own particular sense of humour, but for me it was Stiller mistaking Cockburn's decapitated head for a studio prop, Simple Jack saying 'this head movie makes my eyes rain', the panda head-dress, and an almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise as foul mouthed, balding, power hungry, producer with all the right moves, Les Grossman.",8,0,1,31 August 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," More wish-fulfilment for nerds.
","My nerd credentials are reasonably high—I have a comic book collection; I go to movie conventions; I possess one or two T-shirts bearing pop culture slogans and graphics; and I obsessively review cult films on IMDb—but I'm still nowhere near qualified enough to connect with Scott Pilgrim vs The World, a film that proudly enters the realm of the über-nerd, a plane of existence where Manga is king, Japanese vinyl toys are objects of desire, retro video games are cool, web programmers are gods, and designing and building your own PC is the mark of a true man.The hero of this film is a pale, scrawny wimp, the kind of guy whose awkward appearance would normally condemn him to a lifetime of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. In director Edgar Wright's nerd-centric universe, however, Scott Pilgrim is an aspirational figure: his entire existence is played out in video game/graphic-novel mode, with FX lettering and motion lines accompanying his every move; he's a bass player in a rock band; he possesses awesome fighting skills; and seriously cute/smoking hot girls find him irresistible (he even dates the gorgeous Mary Elisabeth Winstead—talk about punching above your weight!!!). In short, he is the ultimate geek icon.For those who closely identify with the guys in The Big Bang Theory, this film is going to be the stuff of dreams, the ultimate fantasy come true, thus earning itself a dedicated fan-base; in time, it might even make its money back from the lucrative 'dweeb dollar'. But to anyone who has even the vaguest semblance of a life within the real world, it's endless geek subculture references, heavily stylised and often surreal action, incessant use of game-speak, and elevation of obnoxious loser to hero status will seriously grate on the nerves.",3,10,19,24 June 2012
Enchanted," Cracking family entertainment.
","Disney's Enchanted is a wonderful film: not only does it have a brilliantly simple, yet completely ingenious concept, that is packed full of great jokes, romance, adventure, and hugely enjoyable musical numbers, but it also makes a star of the beautiful and talented Amy Adams, who, if there is any justice in this world, will have a long and successful career ahead of her.As Giselle, the fairytale princess-to-be who is sent to New York by the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), Adams is absolutely perfect: heart-achingly attractive with an angel's voice. Who can really blame single father Robert Philip (played by Patrick Dempsey) for falling for her charms, even though he is about to propose to his long term girlfriend? Not I.Robert, an attorney, meets Giselle as she wanders the streets of the 'Big Apple', struggling to cope with the harsh reality of the city. After taking the confused young woman back to his apartment (which he shares with his six-year-old daughter), his life becomes completely turned upside-down: his girlfriend leaves him (fair enoughÂ—she sees Giselle laying on top of him in nothing but a towel!), and his career looks decidedly shaky (once again, Giselle does not seem to help the situation).Also throwing a spanner in the works are several others characters from the fairy tale realm, who have followed Giselle to New York: Prince Edward, who wishes to marry the pretty maiden, having spent a whole day in her company; Giselle's best friend Pip (who happens to be a chipmunk!); and the loathsome Nathaniel (Timothey Spall), Queen Narissa's right hand man, who is determined that Edward will not find his true love.With Enchanted, director Kevin Lima proves himself to be a name to watch, providing his audience with brilliant wall-to-wall family fun, and delivering a couple of scenes that are instant Disney classics: Giselle summoning the vermin of New York to help her tidy Robert's apartment; and the song and dance routine in which everyone joins in, having obviously been affected by a little of Giselle's fairytale magic.Of course, despite the villains' best attempts, everything ends happily ever after (as do all great fairy tales), but not before Giselle learns that falling in love means getting to know someone properly first, Robert learns to trust his feelings, Nathaniel realises the error of his ways, the nasty Narissa is defeated by a brave rodent, and Edward finds someone who is truly grateful to be whisked off their feet by a handsome prince.",9,0,1,29 March 2008
Die Hard 2," A runway success.
","If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps.Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eye—yowch!).Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.",9,1,2,18 August 2013
Resident Evil," Alice, what's the matter?
","When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and just a little bit wary.Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the results nonetheless.Nowadays, having seen Romero's last three chapters in his Dead series (Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked (you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson's direction is slick, without being too showy (ie., he doesn't resort to an overkill of trendy editing), there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the screen with their loveliness in the process.",8,3,4,7 March 2011
Avengers: Endgame," Forget Captain Marvel... meet The Rat!
","After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...).",7,4,11,3 May 2019
Independence Day," Yeah, I know—it's stupid, but....
","Independence Day, the massively successful summer blockbuster of '96, is a deeply flawed, predictably dumb, jingoistic, gung-ho piece of mainstream sci-fi/action nonsense that depicts the USA as the saviours of mankind in a desperate battle for Earth against hostile aliens.Funny thing is, as formulaic, clichéd, moronic, plot-hole-ridden and over-sentimental as this flag-waving claptrap is, I don't find it anywhere near as irksome as I probably should, in part thanks to the great cast, but mostly due to the simple fact that it is just so much fun, a switch-your-mind off-and-enjoy-the-spectacle, slam-bang crowd-pleaser packed with exhilarating action and top-notch special effects.Sometimes, all I need to pass the time are massive explosions (they don't come much bigger than this), slimy aliens (that they are), and a Jewish cable company employee uploading a virus to an alien mothership via his laptop, and that's precisely what ID4 delivers.",7,1,3,7 April 2012
The Butterfly Effect," Ashton Kutcher in good film shock!
","Ashton Kutcher isn't generally regarded as being synonymous with great movie-making (I can appreciate that not everyone loves 'Dude, Where's My Car?' as much as I do), but if there's one title in his filmography that genuinely excuses the guy for his endless forgettable roles in crap rom-coms, it's gotta be The Butterfly Effect—the dude puts in a sweet performance!Kutcher plays Evan, a young man whose troubled life has been blighted by memory loss; when Evan realises that by reading the journals he has kept since a child he can travel into the past, he gradually begins to fill in the missing pieces of his memory. Meddling with the past, however, is not without its risks...Admittedly, The Butterfly Effect is in danger of unravelling in a big old mess of improbabilities and impossibilities if studied too closely—that kind of thing happens with even the most meticulously plotted time-travel/alternate time-line movies— but if you allow yourself to just sit and accept things as they happen, you'll find the film a rewarding and very entertaining experience that will take you through the gamut of emotions and really drive home the importance of making the right decisions in life.",8,1,1,17 October 2010
Alien vs. Predator," AVP: Action; Violence; Power.
","In 1989, everyone's favourite chest bursting xenomorphs went head to head with the galaxy's greatest intergalactic hunters in the Dark Horse comic series Alien vs. Predator; but it wasn't until a year later, when an alien's skull was glimpsed in the predator's trophy collection at the end of movie sequel Predator 2, that excited fans began talking about the very real possibility of a cinematic merging of the franchises.Fourteen years later, and 20th Century Fox finally gave them what they had been dreaming of: a movie smack-down between the creepy, bio-mechanical critters with the extendable inner jaws and the imposing, dread-locked hunter/warriors. Unfortunately, with almost a decade and a half to develop their own ideas of what the film should be, fan-boys were less than enthusiastic when the finished product failed to meet their unrealistic expectations; other naysayers included the professional film critics, who complained about the film's lack of characterisation and clichéd dialogue.It all goes to prove that some people are never happy, because in my humble opinion, Aliens vs. Predator delivers way and above what one might reasonably expect from the fusion of a gung-ho Arnie creature-feature (albeit a fantastic one) and a sci-fi series that had hit rock bottom with its last instalment.Director Paul W. S. Anderson, who inexplicably receives a lot of flak from critics and viewers alike whatever the project, comes up with the goods as far as action, excitement and spectacle are concerned, making this film not only a hugely enjoyable piece of blockbuster entertainment, but also a treat for the eyes. The set design and special effects in particular are simply incredible, with a terrific combination of CGI and more traditional techniques bringing the nasty extraterrestrials realistically to life.As far as the performances go, they might not exactly be award worthy, but since when does a monster movie require the acting chops of a Larry Olivier or Meryl Streep? Everyone involved does what is necessary of them, with Lance Henriksen making a welcome return to the Aliens series, Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner putting in a surprising appearance, and lead Sanaa Lathan making a likable and very gutsy heroine.All in all, I liked AVP a lot. My advice is to ignore the biased sentiments of the fickle fan-boys and pompous critics, and for once, go with the popular opinion: the general public took the film to No. 1 in the box office and made it a commercial success, and for good reason—the film rocks!",8,2,5,14 November 2009
District 9," Hard-core prawn action.
","In a plot designed to mirror apartheid, a race of extraterrestrials arrive in Jo'burg where they are segregated from the humans in a ramshackle slum known as District 9. After 20 years, with tension rising between the races, it is decided that the aliens (known derisively as 'prawns') should be relocated further away from the city; city official Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given the task of overseeing the operation, but things go awry after he is exposed to alien biotechnology that slowly mutates his body.Writer/director Neill Blomkamp's first full length feature is such a technically slick film that it's is easy to forgive its glaring plot holes. The story can be picked apart like a king prawn, but Blomkamp's assured storytelling and expertise in visual effects ensure that, even though certain elements make little sense when given too much thought, the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience from start to finish. Solid performances (anyone who lets the South African accent bother them should stick to mainstream Hollywood films) and superb CGI (especially when considering the budget) go a long way to making this a hugely enjoyable piece of popcorn fun despite the obvious flaws.",8,2,4,7 September 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 5+ hours so far, with more to come.
","Peter Jackson continues to stretch out Tolkein's timeless classic, no doubt building himself a pile of treasure almost as impressive as that of Smaug in the process. In this second part of three, the thirteen dwarfs, accompanied by one brave hobbit, continue their quest to reclaim their homeland of Erebor and retrieve the precious hoard guarded there by an ancient evil dragon. On their way, they are attacked by giant spiders in the forest of Mirkwood, escape from the woodland elves in barrels, travel to Laketown and find their way into the heart of the Lonely Mountain to confront the mighty fire breathing reptile. Plus lots of other stuff that wasn't written by Tolkein.With the rather slight book (at least when compared to LOTR) being turned into a trilogy, there is a lot here that has been completely made-up by Jackson and company, a fact that will no doubt upset many Tolkein purists. Those viewers who are not that bothered about the additional new material might be rankled by the overuse of CGI, the overblown set pieces that see our death-defying heroes surviving numerous dangers against the odds, and an unnecessary romance. Anyone not bothered by these trifling matters will probably have a whale of a time, happily sitting through all 161 minutes with a big dumb smile on their face; I wish I could be so easily pleased.To be fair, I did have a marginally better time with this part than I did with An Unexpected Journey: there's not so much puerile humour or singing this time around, there are no silly battling stone-giants, and my favourite bit of the book—the barrel escape—is in this chapter (although Jackson does his best to muck it up by having the dwarfs pursued by orcs along the way). Overall, however, I still consider this another disappointment from the once great director, a ridiculously padded adventure that could have and should have been absolutely awesome, but which ends on a particularly duff note by pointlessly drawing out the confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug by chucking those bloody dwarfs into the mix for an over-the-top CGI-fest of a finalé.",6,1,1,30 August 2014
Batman Begins," Batman Begins, but the fun ends.
","I've long found the idea of Batman—a billionaire playboy who dresses as a bat to fight crime—just a little too ridiculous to take seriously (and I guess I'm not alone in that thought, given the cartoonish approach taken with the character in the past); however, after the Clooney-Schwarzeneggar debacle that was Batman and Robin, which took camp to a whole new level, a darker, grittier look and feel was inevitable for any franchise reboot.Directed by Christopher Nolan, Batman Begins portrays Bruce Wayne/Batman (played by Christian Bale) in a far more sober and reflective manner than ever before; the script, by David S. Goyer focuses strongly on Wayne's inner conflict between seeking revenge and delivering justice (while neatly addressing some of the character's more questionable issues—most notably, how he learnt to fight and where he gets his cool gadgets from).With a fine supporting cast, impressive production design (Gotham city is suitably gloomy and rain drenched and Batman's suit, accessories and vehicle are impressively utilitarian) and top-notch special effects, I certainly can't accuse Nolan of not pulling out all the stops.And yet Batman Begins still feels strangely lacking. Nolan's fussy direction is partly to blame, the action scenes a chaotic blur of close-ups and quick edits that seriously diminish the level of excitement, but perhaps the film's biggest problem is the simple lack of fun and imagination. Compared with the 80s/90s movies, Batman Begins' new approach feels frustratingly conventional, afraid to be even the slightest bit daring or playful for fear of being compared to its immediate predecessor.I'm not for a second suggesting the reinstatement of rubber nipples on Batman's body armour, but Nolan's grim vision has gone just a bit too far in the opposite direction for my liking.6.5 out of 10, but not good enough for me to round it up to 7 for IMDb.",6,0,1,15 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Expected Disappointment.
","I approached The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with trepidation, fearful that Peter Jackson, a director whose career was born of excess, would go unnecessarily way over the top, as he sometimes did with his The Lord of The Rings trilogy (particularly Return of the King), and pretty much all of the time with King Kong (unforgivable, seeing as he already had a perfect cinematic blueprint to work from).And go way over the top he does. Frequently.With the film split into three parts in order to milk as much cash as possible from Tolkien fans, Jackson is given plenty of opportunity for bloated action scenes, the adventure becoming more preposterous as it progresses, its characters surviving the most perilous situations, often with little more than a scratch to show for their remarkably lucky escape from almost certain doom. The use of crude humour is also excessive, designed to please younger audience members for whom burps and bogies are comedy gold, but a lot less funny for adults.But perhaps what is most frustrating about The Hobbit is that, despite all of the expensive CGI laden effects sequences and the silly slapstick from its band of merry dwarfs, the film's finest and funniest moment takes place in the peace and solitude of an underground cavern between just two characters, reminding us of what a great director Jackson can be when it matters. If only there had been more movie-making of this calibre during the three hours it took to tell only one third of what is a comparatively short book. Sigh!6/10, a rating which some people might think is far too high given my review, but I sure ain't giving it less than I gave that damn giant ape catastrophe.",6,3,6,14 April 2013
Non-Stop," Misleading title, but fun nonetheless.
","Alcoholic Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is flying across the Atlantic when he receives a text message on his phone: someone on the plane is threatening to kill a passenger every twenty minutes unless $150m is transferred to a specified off-shore account. Working against the clock, Bill desperately tries to figure out who is behind the threat, but as he pieces the clues together it slowly becomes apparent that he has been set-up to take the fall.The success of hard-hitting thriller Taken (2008) transformed respected thespian Liam Neeson into an unlikely Hollywood action hero. With a title like Non-Stop, one might reasonably expect this particular Neeson vehicle to be a thrill-a-minute, stunt-packed, white-knuckle ride from start to finish—but it isn't: it is, for the most part, a mystery, and only really kicks into action mode during the final act.While this might understandably upset those expecting more in the way of spectacular adrenaline-fuelled excitement, I found Non-Stop to be an enjoyable suspense film, albeit one riddled with plot-holes big enough to fly a passenger jet through. For the best possible experience, I advise stowing your brain in the overhead compartment before watching; before you know it you'll have arrived at the end credits refreshed and entertained.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,0,0,23 April 2016
Zulu," Rorke's Drift... now I know.
","I was brought up in an English village that borders army land and is home to army barracks; one of the roads in the village is named Rorkes Drift, which I knew had a connection with the armed forces, but I was never sure quite what that was (military history is not my forte). Zulu, a tale of heroism and bravery in the face of great adversity, has cleared up the matter for me - it was named after the mission station defended by 150 or so British soldiers when several thousand Zulu warriors launched a series of attacks.As directed by Cy Endfield, working from a screenplay by John Prebble, this is a fairly faithful and hugely entertaining recreation of the events that unfolded in 1879, when Lt. John Chard R. E. (Stanley Baker) successfully commanded his brave men against seemingly insurmountable odds. Endfield expertly builds the tension, as the men of Welsh 24th Regiment of Foot wait for the enemy to attack; the sound of 4000 Zulus marching, singing and bashing their shields in unison is truly frightening, and would have had me heading over the hills as quick as my legs could carry me, but these men hold fast, even though they are vastly outnumbered.It's hard to believe that so few men could repel such relentless savage assaults, but history tells us otherwise, making this film a powerful piece of cinema that illustrates the indomitable spirit of man. When the chips are down, the British rise to the occasion with a rousing rendition of Men of Harlech that more than equals the Zulus chanting, before picking up their rifles for yet more bloody action. By the time that the remaining Zulu warriors gather on the hill crest to honour the bravery of the opposition, you'll feel emotionally drained yet ebullient, astounded by the courage and tenacity that you have witnessed.The battles are spectacular and violent, Endfield making great use of his widescreen format and massive cast of extras; the bodies literally pile up as the Zulus swarm over the barricades to be met with a hail of bullets and the pointy bit on the end of the gun (one of my favourite directors, Paul Verhoeven would draw inspiration from this film's onslaught for the Klandathu bug attacks in Starship Troopers). Baker puts in a suitably strong performance as Chard, but it is Michael Caine, in one of his earliest big screen roles as plummy Lt. Gonville Bromhead, who steals the show, becoming an A-list star in the process. Also impressing are James Booth as unlikely hero Pvt. Henry Hook, Nigel Green as Colour-Sergeant Bourne, and Patrick Magee as Surgeon Reynolds, who patches up the men as the fighting rages outside.I admit that I've never been a massive fan of the war genre, but there are certain movies that demand one's attention; Zulu is definitely one such film. 8/10.",8,1,1,9 March 2020
The Transporter," Delivers the goods.
","Frank (Jason Statham) earns his living as a transporter, a driver who operates on the wrong side of the law, making deliveries of any kind, no questions asked; but when Frank breaks one of his own rules by opening a package en route, his ruthless employers decide to silence him using any means necessary.Jason Statham has some pretty lousy titles in his filmography (the preposterous and tiresome Crank movies, the disappointing The Expendables), as do director Corey Yuen (the mediocre So Close, the abysmal Blade of Kings) and producer Luc Besson (the awful Arthur and the Invisibles). The Transporter, however, sees all three on top form, their film providing an hour-and-a-half of exhilarating, knowingly dumb comic-book nonsense, star Statham playing his part perfectly, with an admirable sense of seriousness despite the patent silliness of the action (unlike his irritatingly OTT performances in the Crank films).As the story progresses, the gunfights, fist fights and explosions get bigger and better, with logic never allowed to get in the way of spectacle. Statham looks every inch the action hero and handles his martial arts scenes convincingly, the best being a hugely enjoyable battle against numerous foes that makes use of a couple of barrels of grease and a pair of bicycle pedals. Bringing a bit of glamour to proceedings is the lovely Shu Qi, who plays the contents of the package that gets Frank into so much trouble.",8,1,1,16 September 2016
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," You'll smile and laugh.
","If you're a seasoned viewer of backwoods horror and, even after all that you have seen, can still buy into the idea that not all hillbillies are out to rape you in the ass, gut you like a pig or wear your face like a mask, then Tucker & Dale vs Evil will prove to be one hell of a funny film, an ingenious, very witty and delightfully gory take on all of those movies in which good looking teens wind up suspended from a meat-hook in a dilapidated shack littered with human remains and chicken feathers.Despite looking like inbred psychos, pals Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) are actually a pair of well-meaning, beer-swilling good ol' boys who have at last realised their dream of owning a vacation home in the woods where they can rest their weary bones after a hard day's fishing; to the group of college kids camping nearby, however, they embody everything they have ever learnt about rednecks from countless slasher films—uncouth, uneducated, drooling inbred half-wits in dungarees who more than likely feast on the flesh of city-folk.When the teens decide to go skinny dipping one night (clearly having not paid THAT much attention when watching horror films), their worst fears appear to be justified when they witness one of their number—sexy blonde Allison (Katrina Bowden)—seemingly being abducted by Tucker and Dale in their rowboat. In reality, the pair have just rescued the girl from drowning, and are taking her to their cabin to recuperate, but convinced that they mean to do harm to their friend, the campers decide to fight back with disastrous and bloody results.With such an inspired yet simple set-up, Tucker and Dale could so easily have become a stale one-joke movie, but thanks to likable performances from Tudyk, Labine and Bowden and a consistently amusing and sometimes downright hilarious script that gives affectionate nods towards old genre favourites, takes a neat turn towards the end by introducing a real psycho, and even includes messages about prejudice and self belief, Tucker and Dale is a hugely satisfying, strangely heartwarming horror parody and a refreshing change from all those bloody remakes and sequels.",8,8,10,21 September 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," More of the same.
","Maybe it's because I've watched the first four M:I films in the last three days, but I'm starting to tire a little of the formula. I had high hopes that director Brad Bird's fourth instalment would continue the upward trend set by the other sequels, building on what had gone before, but it merely offers more of the same—which doesn't make it a bad movie, just not as satisfying as it might have been.The film starts with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) escaping a Russian jail so that he can join an IMF team on a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin, which holds files that can identify the Russian extremist known as Cobalt. While they are there, Cobalt detonates a bomb, and the blast is blamed on the IMF agents, who are immediately disavowed. Hunt, accompanied by agents Jane (Paula Patton, supplying the eye candy), Benji (Simon Pegg, supplying the comic relief) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must now find Cobalt without the backing of the IMF before he can attain the codes needed to launch a nuclear missile and start WWIII.As with part three, the pace for Ghost Protocol is pretty fast, with plenty of spectacular action scenes, but at 133 minutes long it all becomes a vacuous blur of high speed chases, shootouts and far-fetched stunts, with Cruise flashing his s**t-eating grin at regular intervals. The much touted sequence atop the Burj Khalifa tower is worth the price of admission alone, and the final smack-down in an automated underground multi-storey garage is rather ingenious and suitably gritty, but the other action set-pieces are largely forgettable.Fans of the series thus far will no doubt have an enjoyable time with this undemanding slice of big-budget escapism, as did I, but don't expect anything truly outstanding.",7,0,0,31 March 2017
28 Days Later...," Danny Boyle should make more horror.
","Twenty-eight days after a powerful virus known as 'rage' escapes from an animal experimentation lab, injured cycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma to discover that, while he has been asleep, the country has been overwhelmed by the infected, who are crazed, bloodthirsty, and surprisingly fleet of foot.Although I'm not the biggest fan of Danny Boyle's oeuvre as a whole, I do love me a good zombie film, and 28 Days Later is one of the finest examples that the genre has to offer (OK, I know that they are not technically zombies, but as poet James Whitcomb Riley once wrote, 'when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck).Not only does the film offer intense horror by the bucket-load, but it also manages to deliver heart-rending pathos, dark comedy and nail-biting action, thanks to a raft of central characters you actually give a damn about, a gripping script from Alex Garland that wisely keeps matters within the realms of believability, and Boyle's stylish direction that combines stunning cinematography (considering the digital format on which it was shot) with frantic, hand-held footage of the type that often sends me into fits of rage myself, but which works brilliantly in this instance. Also adding immensely to the overall atmosphere is the excellent original music by John Murphy, which works particularly well in the early scene in which Jim wanders the deserted streets of London, the score building to a crescendo as he gradually comes to understand his predicament.I know it's highly unlikely, now that Boyle has snagged himself Academy Award for Best Director, but I reckon the guy should tackle more horror (but NOT sci-fi/horror: Sunshine sucked!).",9,2,3,19 May 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Makes JP3 look like Oscar winning stuff.
","After the massive success of Jurassic Park, it was pretty clear that a sequel wouldn't be 65 million years in the making; but just because it had less time to evolve doesn't excuse the fact that The Lost World is an inexcusably sloppy piece of movie-making.Jeff Goldblum returns as eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm, who travels to dinosaur infested island 'site B' to rescue his researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding (no, not the one from Girls Aloud, but rather the lovely Julianne Moore) who has gone to study the scientifically engineered prehistoric creatures not quite appreciating the dangers she will face.What follows is often spectacular, and sometimes downright brilliant (best bit: Moore falling on to the slowly cracking windshield of a truck suspended hundreds of feet above jagged rocks), but any flashes of genius from director Steven Spielberg are easily negated by some of the dumbest plot developments and unintentionally funny bits it has been my displeasure to witness in a big-budget blockbuster.For starters, there is Malcolm's (African-American?!?!) daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who stows on board her father's high tech truck in order to lend the film some kiddy appeal. She provides the film with its most ridiculous moment when she puts her gymnastic skills (conveniently mentioned early on in the film to set up this particular scene) into practise by swinging on some makeshift uneven bars and dismounting with enough force to kick a velociraptor to its death.And she's almost as dreadful in the part where good old T-Rex sticks its huge head into her tent, and she wakes up to ask 'What is that?'. Take a wild guess, sweetie!Then there's the gob-smackingly silly scene where one character is so scared of the snake that slithers into his shirt that he'd rather leave the safety of a cave and be eaten by the dinosaur that has been waiting outside. And let's not forget the fact that a captured T-Rex manages to escape from its cage on a boat, eat everyone on board, and then get trapped back in the hold. Or the daft ending, which has Malcolm and Harding lure the king of the tyrant lizards, fresh from a Godzilla style rampage, back into captivity by using its baby as bait.With all this unintentional hilarity, The Lost World can only be seen as a major disappointment, but I suppose we should at least be grateful that there wasn't a nuclear-blast proof fridge in the film, 'cos that would be really stupid!",5,29,58,28 March 2010
It Follows," Catch it if you can.
","We're all familiar with the old slasher movie trope 'Have sex and die'; well, that's what happens in It Follows, but it's not a machete wielding maniac who comes a-calling after its characters bump uglies but rather a deadly STD: a Sexually Transmitted Demon!After dropping her knickers for boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary), pretty teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) is informed that she is now being followed by a supernatural entity that will kill her if it catches up with her, and that the only way to stop it from doing so is to 'pass it on'. Understandably upset, Jay confides in her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and friends Paul and Yara (Keir Gilchrist and Olivia Luccardi), who are somewhat sceptical but willing to help. With the malevolent being approaching at walking speed, Jay has plenty of time to consider her options, but must keep an ever watchful eye out for the creature, which can take on many different guises and is invisible to the uninfected.Like its monster, It Follows moves at a steady pace, but is never dull thanks to its ingenious plot, engaging performances from its talented young cast, and spot-on handling from writer/director David Robert Mitchell, who cleverly keeps the viewer as much on their toes as the film's central character. While the subject is somewhat reminiscent of J-horror classic Ringu, the atmosphere Mitchell achieves is more akin to the foreboding tension of John Carpenter's Halloween, with careful framing of each shot leading to heightened tension, and a suitably brooding synth score (by Disasterpeace) only adding to the fear factor. Gore is minimal, but effective when used (the early sight of one victim with her leg bent backwards, knee broken open, shows the true horror of the curse).In a world where so many horror films are content with delivering cheap, jump scares, and practically non-existent character development, It Follows makes for a very refreshing change.",8,1,2,12 January 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Even with all of today's digital technology, the original films remain the best.
","Scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on a revolutionary cure for Alzheimer's, testing his serum on chimps. When one of his test subjects escapes, causing considerable damage during an important board meeting, the project is cancelled and the apes terminated—with the exception of newborn baby chimp Caesar, who Will smuggles out of the lab, raising the animal in his own home. As Caesar grows up, he displays remarkable intelligence, but after the chimp attacks Will's neighbour, the belligerent beast finds himself thrown into an animal control centre. Mistreated by the keepers, Caesar comes to resent humans and leads his fellow simians in a revolt against mankind.Film-makers can do amazing things with CGI these days: create far-flung worlds, construct incredible cities, build spaceships, give birth to fantastical monsters. But the one thing they haven't managed to date is to create a totally convincing computer-generated human being. Since humans and chimps share 95% or more similar DNA, it's not all that surprising that any small imperfections in this movie's digital apes are glaringly obvious. The effects are good, but not good enough for one to believe in and emotionally engage with the animals. This might sound like I'm nitpicking, but the success of this film depends heavily on the realism of the effects; they need to be perfect, and they're not.Sadly, the CGI isn't my only issue with this attempt at rebooting the Apes franchise: the plot takes an awful long time to get interesting, and with such a bland lead as James Franco, this makes for a rather tedious movie experience. By the time it all kicks off between apes and humans on a fog-shrouded Golden Gate Bridge, it's simply too late—the damage has already been done.5.5 out of 10, rounded down to 5 for the numerous times that chimps leap through plate glass windows with nary a scratch (where, in reality, they would be sliced to ribbons).",5,0,0,5 March 2016
Cars," About as much fun as blowing a tyre in the fast lane of a motorway.
","Cars screeches off the starting grid with an action packed race sequence but loses control pretty quickly afterwards, ending up as a saccharine-sweet wreck of a film. I found Pixar's latest movie to be a charmless and rather dull effort, lacking the sharp humour evident in much of their earlier output.Lightning McQueen is a cocky little race car looking to win his first major event, The Piston Cup, and, subsequently, receive a massive sponsorship deal. But en route to the finals, he becomes stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs, where he accidentally damages the main road. Sentenced to repair the damage he caused, Lightning spends the next few days fixing the road but, as he gets to know the lovable inhabitants of the sleepy town, he learns that there is much more to life than winning races.Far too long, with a painfully slow second act, Cars needed a lot more laughs and a bit more action in order to succeed. With perhaps only a couple of decent jokes during its excruciatingly long 121 minute running time, this movie would have benefited from a major script overhaul, or alternatively, perhaps it would have been better off being scrapped entirely.",3,4,9,21 August 2006
Avengers: Infinity War," That ending...
","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The finalÃ©, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***",8,19,50,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Do we need a tenth?
","Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood has been receiving some great reviews (it's currently rated 8.3 here on IMDb), but I think it's one of Tarantino's weakest movies. For well over two hours, virtually nothing of interest happens: as much as I didn't particularly enjoy Kill Bill Pt 2, Death Proof or Jackie Brown, I can't say I was bored, but OUATIH is just that -- boring! There's none of Tarantino's sparkling dialogue, no iconic scenes, and the ending simply pulls off the same trick that the director employed in Inglourious Basterds -- changing history (only in this instance, it all seems to be in questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago).As a fan of cult movies, Italian westerns, Bruce Lee and old TV shows, and as someone with an interest in the Manson murders, I fully expected to be enthralled by Tarantino's re-creation of 60s Hollywood, its colourful characters, and one of the darkest moments in its history, but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is. If you want to watch Brad Pitt feed his dog, mend a TV aerial and drive a car, then this is the movie for you; if you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio talk about books to an 8 year old and record an episode of a dull TV western (a scene that went on way too long) then have at it. I think that if this is the standard of movie that Tarantino is dishing up, he should call it quits at nine.4/10 for the face-smashing, dog-biting, flame-throwing finalé, which actually perked me up. But that's being generous.",4,30,51,20 August 2019
Django Unchained," That's another genre ticked off.
","Quentin Tarantino has been plundering cult cinema for over twenty years now, with varying degrees of success. Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches—snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag—some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.The good points include a decent soundtrack (something that QT has always managed to get right), excellent performances from the film's primary cast members (Christoph Waltz putting in a particularly good turn as bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz), a decent supporting cast that includes both big name actors and cult favourites, lots of very brutal violence, and a few well executed action scenes, the film's highlight being a brilliantly choreographed and extremely gory shootout between Django and numerous soon-to-be-dead gun-toting bad guys, the equivalent of Kill Bill's blood drenched Crazy 88s fight (it's such an exhilarating scene it makes one wonder why QT didn't cut some of the jibber-jabber and devote more of the running time to action).Of the more woeful content, we get a supposedly humorous exchange between various members of a hooded raid party that is painfully unfunny, the expected cameo performance by QT (as a slave-driver) which is up to his usual low standard, far too much 'filler' (the film could have been shorter: it doesn't feel epic enough to warrant such a long running time), and a finale that, although explosive, still comes as something of a disappointment after the aforementioned shootout scene.",7,1,3,15 January 2013
Get Out," Wonderfully absurd and effectively creepy.
","Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a young African American photographer whose white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) wants to take him to meet her parents, psychotherapist mother Missy (Catherine Keener) and neurosurgeon father Dean (Bradley Whitford). Chris is worried that Rose hasn't told them that he is black, but she assures him that they won't be the slightest bit bothered about his race. As it happens, his colour turns out to be the least of his worries as his growing suspicions that there is something very sinister afoot at the Armitage house turn out to be well founded.Not long after Chris arrives at Rose's parent's house, matters begin to get weird, Mr and Mrs Armitage's affable behaviour a little too perfect, while their home help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundsman Walter (Marcus Henderson), act in a manner that can best be described as freakin' bizarre. A party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix, most of whom are politely racist. Something clearly isn't right about this picture, but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as Chris, while director Jordan Peele exhausts all of the possible paranoia/conspiracy angles. All the strings are pulled together in the final act, in which Peele reveals the outlandish truth, going for tension and scares, with just a little gore for good measure.As a Caucasian, I guess I could take offence at the film's portrayal of white folk, who, with no exception, are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the African American. Instead, I just found the whole crazy notion too absurd to take seriously.",7,9,16,17 June 2017
Drive," A stylish ride.
","A stunt-man/mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver lands himself in big trouble with vicious gangsters after helping out his neighbour.It's hard to believe that any film centred around a character who drives really, really fast for a living could move so slowly, but don't take that as a negative Drive's deliberate pacing helps to separate this tense thriller from many of its contemporaries, lending it a leisurely air of cool that is sorely missing from much of today's Hollywood output.Gosling's deliberate central performance also adds immensely to the film's distinctive mood; his Driver is classic anti-hero material—a man of few words, calm and collected in even the most stressful of situations, but capable of extreme violence when provoked, proving just as capable in a fight as he is behind a steering wheel.Excellent performances, a gripping plot, and several shocking outbursts of extreme violence make Drive a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining ride, with only the very ending—in which I felt Driver uncharacteristically lets his guard down— detracting somewhat from this viewer's overall enjoyment.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,1,3,16 April 2014
Insidious," Polternormal Activigeist.
","Seen Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity? If so, then you'll be in very familiar territory with James Wan's Insidious, which borrows heavily from both of these supernatural blockbusters, but thankfully does so with just enough verve to still make it a satisfying experience.As in Poltergeist, Wan's film centres around a suburban family—Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) and their three kids—who experience supernatural activity shortly after moving into their new home. At first the occurrences are fairly innocuous—strange noises and moving objects—but after eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) mysteriously lapses into a coma-like state, the incidents begin to escalate in severity and scariness.Just like Paranormal Activity, even moving house doesn't prevent the creepiness from continuing, leaving Josh and Renai no option but to turn to a team of experts (led by the always delightful Lin Shaye), who discover that it is Dalton himself who is being haunted—by a hideous demon intent on occupying the boy's body.Although Insidious certainly won't win any awards for originality, it successfully does what it sets out do do: frighten the audience silly for an hour and a half with plenty of well executed jump scares and lots of fun freakiness (watch it and just try and tell me you weren't weirded out by the sight of that little kid gyrating to Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoe Through The Tulips'—mind you, the song on it's own is enough to make my skin crawl!).",7,0,4,23 July 2011
2012," My 2012th review...
","Subatomic particles from a massive solar eruption cause The Earth's core to heat up and the crust to destabilise, resulting in massive earthquakes, super-volcanoes and huge tsunamis that threaten to wipe out mankind. Amidst the chaos, author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) attempts to save his family by taking them to China where the world's elite are boarding several top-secret 'arks' built to survive the disaster.2012 gets the scientific mumbo jumbo out the way pretty quickly so that it can concentrate on the emotional human dramas and spectacular scenes of destruction that are the staple of modern big-budget disaster movies. Director Roland Emmerich, who is no stranger to the genre, having already given us Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, confidently handles the CGI-packed action, but with his film clocking in at a massive 158 minutes, and each successive scene attempting to outdo the previous one in terms of excitement at the expense of all logic, the film eventually collapses under the weight of its own preposterousness.The heroes of the picture face all manner of perils, always managing to escape death by the skin of their teeth, whether it be careering through the streets of L.A. as California slides into the sea, taking off from a disintegrating runway as Las Vegas collapses around their ears, fleeing Yellowstone Park in a camper-van while molten rock spews into the air, or conveniently crash landing in China (rather than the sea) thanks to the rotational shift of the planet. If it wasn't for the small fact that the world is falling apart all around them, I'd have these guys down as the luckiest bastards who ever lived.To be honest, the film's lunacy would be somewhat more bearable if only the film didn't go on for quite as long as it does; I'm more than able to suspend my disbelief for the sake of fun, but by the umpteenth incredible apocalyptic set piece, the special effects have lost their wow factor and the movie's melodrama has become so clichéd that it only serves to annoy. If the world does come to an end on the 21st December 2012, I sure hope its doesn't take as long to happen as it does in this film!Oh, and if by some small chance you find that 2012 isn't as far-fetched as you hoped it would be, be sure to watch the alternative ending—it's really, really, really dumb!5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for taking such an unapologetically absurd approach to Armageddon.",6,1,4,2 August 2012
The Number 23," 23 is POO! (P=16 O=15. 16+15+15=46. 46 divided by 2=23)
","Joel Schumacher is an unpredictable director whose output runs the gamut from the sublimely brilliant (Falling Down), to the enjoyably trashy (St. Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys, 8mm), to the shockingly awful (Batman and Robin).Jim Carrey is a star who shines brightest when he is making people laugh, although he has proved that he can also play it straight too, when called upon to do so (The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Truman Show, The Majestic, Man on the Moon).The Number 23, the second film directed by Schumacher to star Carrey (the two worked together previously on Batman Forever), is, unfortunately, one of the weakest efforts to appear on either's CV, but the blame really lies with Fernley Phillips, the writer of this convoluted and unbelievable mess. He desperately wants his script to be oh-so-clever, with a denouement that comes out of left-field and stuns viewers with its originality; instead, he loads it with plot-holes aplenty, mawkish sentimentality, and a ridiculous ending.Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an affable dog-catcher who becomes obsessed with The Number 23, a book about a detective called Fingerling, whose life bizarrely mirrors his own. In the book, Fingerling becomes obsessed with the number 23, which he discovers occurs in all aspects of life. Sparrow realises this to be true and becomes fascinated with the concept.As Sparrow delves further into the strange book, his paranoia grows, and he uncovers a terrible secret which turns his life upside-down.Despite his best efforts (he packs the film with plenty of stylish flourishes), Schumacher is unable to rescue The Number 23 from sinking under the weight of its flawed premise, and contrived and nonsensical plot twists. Put quite simply, the film doesn't make any sense!Unfortunately, the only way for you to truly understand how messed up this film is, is to watch it for yourself.",2,1,5,31 August 2007
Ghost Rider," Great comic-book fun.
","After reading some scathing reviews, I was fully expecting Ghost Rider to be a festering pile of stink. I am glad to report, however, that it is not as bad as some have made it out to be: it's a comic book adaptation that actually dares to be fun (unlike that recent Superman movie!) and as a result, it is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of mindless action.When Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) promises stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze that he will cure his terminally ill father in exchange for his soul, Johnny jumps at the chance. The Devil, true to his word, cures Mr.Blaze senior, who promptly snuffs it anyway when his next stunt goes horribly wrong.Johnny, now in the employ of Mephistopheles, is told that when the time comes, he will become a 'ghost rider'a bounty hunter whose job it is to collect the souls of the damned. Johnny's only hope of being released from his contract is to defeat Mephistopheles's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who is plotting to overthrow his father and unleash hell on earth.Knowing full well that the plot is pure nonsense, the makers of Ghost rider decide to concentrate on delivering as much fun as possible, and with a typically kooky central performance from Cage (plus able support from Eva Mendes as buxom girlfriend Roxanne, and Sam Elliot as his mentor, Carter Slade), some great special effects, and loads of comic-book action, they pretty much succeed.Ghost Rider won't change your life, and it's unlikely to become your favourite film ever, but it is not a bad way to spend your time (unlike that recent Superman movie!).",7,3,4,7 June 2007

","Brett Ratner takes the directorial baton from Bryan Singer and runs with the gay subtext established in the earlier two X-Men films: in this third chapter, the government have developed a cure for mutations, something that doesn't sit well with the majority of mutants, who are proud to be who they are. Subtle, this is not.Fortunately, the obvious parallels drawn between mutants and the gay community do not detract too much from the film's overall entertainment value (thankfully, there are no pink mutants firing sparkly rainbows from their fingertips). Ratner's movie might not be quite up to the standard of Singer's superlative second film, but it still delivers enough spectacular comic-book action to make it a very satisfying way to spend 104 minutes.",8,0,0,29 March 2014
Hellboy," So many cogs
","The Nazis are up to their old occult tricks again, using magick to try and open a portal and unleash ancient gods upon the Earth. When the allied forces intervene, all the Nazis manage to release from their inter-dimensional gateway is a red skinned, demon-child, who grows up to become Hellboy, an indestructible, cigar-chomping hero fighting the forces of evil for the FBI.Guillermo Del Toro directed this adaptation of the Dark Horse comic-book, meaning that it's perfect for those who enjoy an excess of the following in their movies: the dark, clockwork creations, leather, rusty stuff, water, steam-punk, cogs (running the gamut from teeny-tiny to f***ing enormous), Nazis, CGI Lovecraftian monsters, magick, and jokey one-liners. Unfortunately, Del Toro seems so intent on getting the basic ingredients and aesthetic style for Hellboy precisely how he wants that he forgets all about telling a decent story: his film suffers from a leaden pace, a weak plot full of clichés (one of those story lines that feels like it's being made up on the fly), and zero chemistry between dull characters.On the plus side, the makeup used to transform Ron Perlman into Hellboy is impressive, and although the use of old school animatronic effects stick out like a sore thumb amidst all of the CGI, I enjoyed the resurrected Russian corpse with the noose around its neck. The rest is strictly for Del Toro fan-boys only.",4,1,4,8 May 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The middle film from Middle Earth.
","The Two Towers is my favourite film from the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts with my favourite scene of the trilogy—Gandalf's breath-taking battle against the Balrog in the bowels of Middle Earth; ends with the best action scenes of the trilogy—the epic battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard; and features many of my most memorable moments from the trilogy, including Gollum's schizophrenic conversation with Smeagol, a hilarious discussion between orcs about whether they should eat Merry and Pippin, and Legolas shouting 'They've taken the hobbits to Isengard!' (check out the dance music remix of this on YouTube—it's hilarious!).A few minor niggles prevent me from awarding The Two Towers top marks—the rather slow scenes with Treebeard in Fangorn, Legolas surfing down some steps on a shield (a portent of the excesses of The Return of the King), and the fact that it took me three viewings to completely understand all that happens—but on the whole this is an excellent film. Did I mention it was my favourite of the trilogy?",9,0,4,30 October 2010
The Mist," The weather forecast for tonight: Heavy fog with scattered body parts.
","Tentacled beasties with snapping claws; insectivorous critters with poisonous stings; winged monstrosities that swoop from the sky; and hideous arachnids that shoot acidic strands of web: these are just some of the Lovecraftian creatures waiting to crush, tear, rip, and devour whoever should stray into The Mist.I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King's books: he has some great ideas, but I don't particularly enjoy his style of writing, and find that he tends to leave some of his stories a little too 'open-ended' for my liking. The Mist, however, is one (short) story of his which I thoroughly enjoyed. And director Frank Darabont's movie adaptation more than does it justice, delivering loads of scares, some great monsters, a fair smattering of gore, plenty of atmosphere, and adding an ending that'll leave you shell-shocked.Thomas Jane plays David Drayton, one of a group of people (which includes Drayton's son Billy) who are trapped in a supermarket after a strange mistthe result of a top-secret government experiment gone wrongsuddenly envelops the building. When the frightened customers and staff realise that there is something unspeakable in the mist that wants to eat them, fear and panic turns them against one another.Darabont's wonderful script is pretty faithful to King's original tale, (only omitting an admittedly unnecessary sex-scene and adding an inspired downbeat ending), and the great cast give gripping performances (particularly from Marcia Gay Harden, as a religious zealot convinced that the 'end of days' has arrived, and Jane as the artist-turned-hero).The special effects and creature designs are very imaginative and, for the most part, pretty convincing (a few of the CGI effects could've been better, but I'm nit-picking). The score is also very good, especially at the end when a haunting melody perfectly complements the harrowing visuals.The result is one of the best US horror films that I have seen in quite a while, and is one that should definitely not 'be mist' (be missedgeddit?).",9,1,3,27 March 2008
Stardust," The best thing about this film is its catchy theme song by Take That; what does that tell you?
","Clare Danes plays a falling star (although perhaps Robert De Niro, one of the film's other big names, would've been more convincing, given his recent track record) sought after by a love-struck young man (Charlie Cox), a trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer's evil Lamia), and a prince hoping to become an immortal king (Mark Strong).With a rating of 8.0 on IMDb, a splendid array of dazzling special effects, and a brilliant cast featuring several Hollywood big hitters (plus the inexplicably rich and famous Ricky Gervaisa case of scriptwriter Jane Goldman's husband Jonathan Ross calling in a favour, perhaps?), I was expecting Stardust to be the perfect Saturday night family movie for me, the missus and the kids. Boy, was I wrong.Adapted from a book by cult novelist Neil Gaiman (who wrote the equally disappointing and over-rated Mirrormask), Stardust is a bland, unsatisfying mess of mis-matched moments cobbled together from a plethora of stale fantasy ingredients: wizened witches, a magical kingdom, a hero unaware that he has already found his true love, a benevolent unicorn... etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Occasionally, there can be found the odd spark of originality, but, more often than not, these moments are quickly extinguished by the film's endless tidal wave of terribly predictable tosh. Another major problem I found with this film is that Layer Cake director Matthew Vaughn desperately wants it to be all things to everyone: an oh-so magical experience for the kids, but a more subversive ride for the adults (for a family film, there is way too much sex and death, and that's coming from a bloodthirsty pervert like me!!!). The end result fails on all levels: it's too meandering and meaningless for children; its mawkish sentimentality should have most adults gagging; and parents will probably be squirming in their seats for the duration, hoping that their children don't understand the more suggestive content or suffer nightmares from the violence.Reading others' comments here on this website, I have noticed that many have likened Stardust to the brilliant The Princess Bride. There's only one thing I can say to that: 'Inconceivable'!",3,1,17,25 October 2008
I Am Legend," I Am Impressed.
","I'm a huge fan of The Omega Man, the 70s film adaptation of Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend, and so when I heard that a new version was on the horizon, starring crowd-pleaser Will Smith and directed by Francis Lawrence (who made the so-so Constantine), I feared the worst.However, I am glad to report that I Am Legend is a hugely entertaining post-apocalyptic chiller, despite featuring that scourge of many contemporary fantasy/horror films: poorly conceived CGI monsters. Lawrence delivers a tight, effective, and very enjoyable movie, and Smith does a commendable job in a role that, for the most part, requires him to interact with just a dog, some mannequins, and a bunch of digital effects.The film opens in a deserted and derelict New York, as Robert Neville (Smith), survivor of a worldwide plague, travels the lonely streets of The Big Apple hunting for food and searching for other humans. Then, as the sun begins to sink, he nervously heads for home (taking special care to cover his trail) where he barricades himself in until dawn, because, when night falls on Manhattan, the infected crawl from their hiding places to feedon blood!Much of the film follows Neville as he goes about his daily routine: hunting, foraging for food, searching for other survivors, talking to shop dummies, driving golf balls off the end of an aircraft carrier, and desperately searching for a cure to the disease that has ravaged the planet. The mundanity and repetitiveness of his life is brilliantly conveyed and the fragility of his sanity is easy to understand.Of course, occasionally, our protagonist's familiar schedule is interrupted by something a little different, such as when (in the film's tensest moment) his trusty canine friend Sam chases a deer into a very dark building, leaving Neville no choice but to follow. And sometimes his experiments require him to capture a live infected specimen. Which is interesting.Eventually, however, Neville's lonely life takes a completely unexpected turn, when, late one afternoon, he falls into a trap set by the infected, and the sun slowly begins to set...Often exciting, sometimes scary, and even occasionally quite sad, I Am Legend is a blockbuster film that actually deliversquite a rarity these days.Shame about those CGI monsters, though.",8,0,2,7 January 2008
Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title.
","High school nobody and avid comic-book fan Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) decides to stop just reading about super-heroes and begins living the dream, but with no special powers, zero fighting skills, and a distinct lack of high tech gadgetry at his disposal, life as a self-styled crime fighter is harder than he imagined—particularly when hunted down by major-league bad-guy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and made to feel totally inadequate by the real-deal, crime-fighting duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz).Kick-Ass is the perfect wake-up call for any comic fan who has ever toyed with the idea of donning a mask and taking to streets in the name of justice (don't tell me you've never imagined yourself in a cool spandex suit with natty matching cape!); rather than painting the fight against crime as a glamorous pursuit, the film graphically displays every ugly detail of life outside of the law and shows what might easily become of anyone foolhardy enough to take on vicious criminals without the proper training (eg., entire childhood spent in a monastery practising martial arts with mystical monks). Brutal stabbings, cold-blooded shootings, and chilling torture are all shown in unflinching detail, making the film a genuine eye-opener (especially for those who might have mistaken this sucker for a light-hearted action/comedy romp).What is even more surprising than Kick-Ass's ultra-violent content, for me at least, is that it was written, in part, by Jane Goldman, and directed by Matthew Vaughan, both of whom were also responsible for Stardust, a film so contrived and cloying that I would dearly love to erase it from my memory. Here, the pair redeem themselves fully, providing their audience with just shy of two hours of pure awesomeness that constantly delights with its witty, thoughtful script, and endless adrenaline-pumping action scenes (accompanied by a effective score and killer soundtrack).On top of the remarkable script (based on the comic by Mark Millar) and flawless direction (love the first person shooter style used during one scene), the film also benefits from a stand-out cast, all of whom deliver pitch-perfect performances: Johnson is both likable and believable as the idealistic teenager who turns his life upside down by following his dreams; Lyndsy Fonseca is simply mouth-watering as Katie Deauxma, the object of Dave's desire; Nic Cage puts in yet another seemingly effortless but extremely memorable performance as vengeful ex-cop turned masked avenger Big Daddy (Cage has a blast in his role, even mimicking Adam West's Batman speech mannerisms); and the amazing Moretz regularly steals the show with her confident turn as lethal, 11-year old killing machine Hit Girl (if this promising young actress doesn't go on to be a MAJOR star in the future, I'll eat my cape!).If, like me, you've grown a little tired of formulaic, big-budget, SFX packed super-hero flicks, I highly recommend checking out this alternative take on the genre, 'cos Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title.",9,5,9,8 May 2011
Ghostbusters," There's something weird, and it don't look good.
","After losing their university grant, paranormal scientists Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) set up business as Ghost Busters, professional exterminators for those with supernatural pests, unaware that New York is soon to become plagued by spooks as an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer prepares to enter our realm.When Ghost Busters was originally released, way back in 1984 (bloody hell, that's a quarter of a century ago!!!), cinema audiences went wild for the supernatural adventures of spook wranglers Venkman and Co.: the film was the definition of an 80s, crowd-pleasing blockbuster, with an impressive cast of hot comedy names, a script packed with witty one liners, bucket-loads of flashy, state-of-the-art special effects, and, of course, a catchy theme song that couldn't fail to please.So this afternoon, I sat down to re-live the magical experience with my children (aged 6 and 8), but to my disappointment, discovered that the film really hasn't aged that well. Despite some classic moments of dry humour from Bill Murray, the impressive sight of a Godzilla-size Mr. Stay Puft trashing New York, and the even more impressive sight of Sigourney Weaver's lovely, long legs, the film just isn't as great as my memory had led me to believe: it's rather cheap looking at times, with shonky props, unconvincing sound-stage sets, and crowd-scenes of, oh, at least 50 people; the effects that once dazzled now look embarrassingly bad, with iffy stop motion animation, crap matte work, random flashy lights, and Richard Edlund's Oscar nominated 'ink in water' clouds looking just like... well, just like ink in water; and rather than being a roller-coaster ride of laughs and scares, the film is actually pretty dull at times. Sorry kids, but I was so sure that this film rocked; instead, it's just another passable piece of 80s nostalgia for the middle-aged.Oh well, at least the theme song is still a corker; all together now.... Who ya gonna call?",6,14,28,3 October 2009
Shrek the Third," NOT a happy ending for the franchise.
","Shrek and Shrek 2 are classics of CGI movie-making, brimming with charm, great jokes and visual excellence; Shrek The Third, on the other hand, is as stagnant as the swamp that the titular ogre calls home, reeking of lazy writing and stinking up the place with stale jokes.When the king of Far, Far, Away finally croaks (he's a frog.... geddit?), Princess Fiona and Shrek are expected to take his place on the throne. But Shrek, being the miserable git that he is, doesn't want the responsibility, and so he sets sail (along with Donkey and Puss-in-Boots) in search of the only other heira young student named Arthur Pendragon.Meanwhile, a miffed Prince Charming, who feels that he should rightfully be king, plots to take the title by force.I had been warned that the third instalment in the Shrek series wasn't on a par with its predecessors, but decided to watch it anyway, reasoning that even a bad Shrek movie would be better than most contemporary kids movies. Unfortunately, it seems that I was fooling myself.With a mediocre plot overloaded with poorly developed characters, and a practically laugh-free script, Shrek The Third is a pitiful effort that should never have been made. When a film's funniest momentthe repeated last gasps of the frog kingis not only very predictable, but also extremely familiar (I just can't put my finger on where I've seen this beforeit'll come to me... eventually), then it's time to give up. The fairytale is well and truly over.",4,1,2,14 January 2008
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not as great as DOFP, but still a lot of fun for fans of the franchise.
","The Nile Valley, 3600BC: mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is revered as a god by the Egyptians, but his growing power proves to be his downfall, at least for a few millennia, as a group of concerned humans successfully carry out a plan to trap him under a collapsing pyramid. Cut to the 1980s, and Apocalypse is finally released from his tomb, recruiting several misguided mutants (including Storm and Magneto) as his followers in order to achieve world domination.There's an awful lot going on in this latest X-Men adventure, so much so that it's a little too much to take in at times. As a result, the storytelling suffers a little, but not enough to prevent this from being another fun addition to the franchise (my favourite superhero series by far). Not as mind-blowing as Days of Future Past, but still a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Evan Peters as Quicksilver once again steals the show with another awesome display of his super speed abilities, rescuing the mutants of Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted from a massive explosion, but there is plenty else to wow the senses, the film packing in lots of slick set-pieces, including the spectacular opening 'pyramid collapse' scene, Magneto (Michael Fassbender) pushing his powers to the limit, and Wolverine on the rampage (an uncredited cameo from Hugh Jackman).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Olivia Munn as very sexy villainess Psylocke, the neat jibe about the third film in a series always being the worst, and for including Metallica's The Four Horsemen on the soundtrack.",8,11,18,27 July 2016
Ex Machina," Neither Ex Cellent nor Ex Crement.
","I have mixed feelings about Alex Garland: on one hand, he wrote the hugely entertaining 28 Days Later and the criminally under-rated Dredd; on the other hand, he has bored me senseless with ponderous pap like Sunshine and Annihilation. Ex Machina falls somewhere in the middle: it has an intriguing premise but it fails to do it justice.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who wins a week as the guest of internet genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), CEO of the firm at which Caleb works. Flown by helicopter to Bateman's high-tech rural retreat, Caleb is given the enviable task of assessing his boss's latest triumph, an A.I. Robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander), to see if she truly possesses consciousness. Over the course of the week, Caleb becomes attached to Ava and plans to set her free, but is he being manipulated by his boss, the sexy robot, or both?Extremely slow burn and heavy on the dialogue, this is what some people like to describe as intelligent sci-fi, posing questions about what it is to be human and the inevitable evolution of machines, but just how intelligent is a film that boasts so many glaring plot holes? Why are Ava's robotic parts visible when Bateman has perfected synthetic skin? Why does Bateman use card keys in his home when a retinal scan would be far more secure? Why can't a genius like Bateman solve the problem of his power outages? Could one man working alone really build a lifelike artificially intelligent being? Why does the skin of an Asian robot somehow match Ava's skin-tone? Why doesn't the helicopter pilot question the young woman who returns to the landing location? Wouldn't Bateman have programmed the laws of robotics into his creations to prevent them from rebelling? All awkward questions without satisfactory answers.If Ex Machina wanted to be taken seriously as an intellectual look at the implications of A.I., it really should have addressed the basic problems with the script first.5/10 for the hilarious dance scene and for all the sexy robot nudity.",5,4,7,23 February 2019
Back to the Future Part III," Once more for old time's sake.
","After the brain-melting series of temporal twists and turns performed by Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in Part II of the Back to the Future trilogy, the time-travelling pair keep it relatively simple for Part III, spending nearly the whole film in one place and one year: the wicked wild, wild west of 1885, where Marty meets his Oirish ancestors, Doc falls in love (with schoolteacher Clara Clayton, played by the lovely Mary Steenburgen), and both face mortal danger from gun-slinging outlaw Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his gang.Considering that it was shot back-to-back with Part II, the lack of narrative complexity for the final chapter comes as a bit of a surprise, but does little to diminish the film's overall ability to entertain: Part III might be a less frantic affair, but thanks to an excellent script packed with witty dialogue, welcome character development, plenty of tips of the Stetson to the previous two films, and a rousing finale, it is no less enjoyable than its predecessors, thus making the whole trilogy one of the most consistently brilliant series of movies ever.",10,2,2,5 December 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Fair to Middling Four
","The Fantastic Four return for more superhero silliness in yet another big-budget FX-laden movie from Marvel, which sees Sue Storm and Reed Richards preparing to tie the knot. But with a mysterious metallic dude known as The Silver Surfer, zipping around the world on his shiny surfboard making huge holes in the Earth (preparing it for consumption by Galactus, a planet-eating alien being), successfully making it down the aisle is more difficult than they had imagined.More tongue in cheek than many of today's crop of superhero films (The X-Men and Spiderman trilogies, Superman Returns), the Fantastic Four movies have the potential to be huge fun. But Rise of the Silver Surfer still manages to be a rather disappointing effort thanks to its lacklustre script which delivers little in the way of genuine excitement.For starters, far too much of the film's (rather short) running time is spent concentrating on the impending nuptials of Sue and Reed, rather than delivering impressive action set-pieces, and, since The Silver Surfer isn't out to directly hurt or attack the foursome, at no point do we feel like they are in any particular danger. In fact, the metallic menace cannot really even be considered a 'baddie' since all he is doing is preparing a snack for his boss (who looks nothing like his comic incarnationthe movie Galactus is a nothing but a swirling cloud).The cast are distinctly average, each playing their character with plenty of enthusiasm but very little depth. At least Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans look the part; Michael Chiklis as The Thing, however, looks rather rubbery, whilst Jessica Alba is the least convincing due to the fact that a Latino actress with blonde hair and blue contacts just looks daft.As for the much heralded Silver Surfer, he is no more impressive than the T-1000 from Terminator 2 which James Cameron gave us over fifteen years ago. So much for advances in technology.As a mindless piece of popcorn entertainment, Rise of the Silver Surfer is just about passable; as a big-budget summer blockbuster, it falls a long way short.",5,1,4,14 October 2007
Transformers," Transformers: adverts in disguise.
","The original 80s Transformers cartoon series was all about shifting toys from shelves, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to find that Michael Bay's prime directive for this live-action blockbuster also seems to be making money through selling stuff.Transformers has been designed to leave kids longing to reenact its bad-ass auto-bot battles via Hasbro's new range of authorised action figures, whilst giving adults the urge to load a top-of-the-range Apple iMac, Hewlett Packard laptop, an X-Box, and a crate of Mountain Dew into the back of a brand new GMC TopKick truck.But blatant product placement isn't the only thing that Bay mercilessly bombards the viewer with: he also pummels his audience into submission with an onslaught of complex CGI effects, endless loud explosions, awful dialogue, rapid fire editing, cringe-worthy moments of comedy, and lots of shouting from Anthony Anderson as an irritating gluttonous hacker. Plot development and logic are almost non-existent.Granted, for many people the sight of giant alien robots transforming into vehicles and battling each other will be entertainment enough (even I can appreciate an awesome heavy-metal smack-down), while others will welcome the sight of a sweaty Megan Fox bending over a car to fiddle with the engine, but for a movie costing $150 million, I expect more than what is essentially a visually impressive two-hour long advert for kids' toys and luxury goods.",5,2,5,6 June 2012
Men in Black II," If ya think this stinks, let me see ya nod ya head.
","A few minutes into MIIB, as Will Smith is riding a giant alien worm called Geoff through the New York subway, my 8-year-old son announced 'That looks so obviously fake'. I couldn't really argue: the CGI effects were extremely shoddy.That's probably because MIIB is essentially a money-making exercise, a rushed mess with a half-arsed script full of lame jokes, cruddy performances (Johnny Knoxville is seriously irritating), and some of the most unsubtle product placement imaginable. It seems as though no-one could give a damn about the standard of film-making, just so long as a profit was made at the box-office and everyone involved received a big fat paycheck.It really is no wonder MIIIB has only just been made, a whole decade after this debacle saw the light of day: they were leaving it long enough for people to forget just how embarrassingly bad this second film really was before going ahead with a third.",3,3,4,19 May 2012
1917," A technical triumph.
","It's over seventy years since Alfred Hitchcock made Rope, which tried to tell a thrilling tale of murder in a swanky New York apartment location with as few shots as possible, the director hiding any sneaky splices with clever visual trickery. For First World War adventure 1917, Sam Mendes pulls off the same illusion, only with the advantages of 21st century technology, meaning that his film is far more seamless and able to cover much more ground: the vast, body-strewn battlegrounds of northern France, to be precise, where Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given the unenviable task of delivering a letter to advancing British troops heading into a trap that could cost 1,600 lives.There's no denying that 1917 is an amazing technical feat, with many an impressive shot as Blake and Schofield risk life and limb to head into enemy territory. Director Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins pull off the seemingly impossible on many occasions, the camera gliding and sweeping over muddy war-torn terrain, in and out of trenches, and through numerous ruins, rarely leaving the protagonists, clearly the result of much planning and impeccable timing. As such, 1917 is, for the most part, an incredibly immersive experience, putting the viewer right in the thick of it with the heroes, the action both intense and visceral. Occasionally, however, it's all just a little too clever for its own good, with a few moments that are so technically jaw-dropping that they tend to draw the viewer out of the film wondering how the shots were achieved. It's a double-edged sword, that movie-making wizardry!The simplistic script also works for and against the film. I liken the story-line to that of a 'first-person shooter' computer game, where the player controls a character who must complete a mission, overcoming various hazards and enemies along the way, There's not exactly a lot of depth to it -- it's about getting from A to B without being killed, and that's pretty much it. On the flip side, the minimalistic plot does mean that there's a fair amount of action to be had, so I'm not complaining too much. I do have a couple of minor niggles, though -- and considering the incredible attention to detail given to the visuals, I wish that Mendes and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns had managed to write their way round these issues a little better: firstly, trusting a German pilot who has just been shot out of the sky.... stupid, stupid, stupid. Number two: milk... just sitting there for the taking, with no-one else around (and how convenient for a touching scene later on). And lastly, a whole battalion sat listening to someone sing, with no-one on look-out - it's like they're asking to be shot!Despite its problems, I would still recommend the film, especially to those interested the whole process of film-making -- the sets, the costumes, the carefully choreographed action, and the camerawork are astounding, and worth the price of admission alone. If you become invested in the characters and their mission, then that's just a bonus.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,5,12,11 January 2020
Kelly's Heroes," Fully deserving of negative waves.
","When American soldier Kelly (Clint Eastwood) learns of a fortune in Nazi gold being stored in a bank behind enemy lines, he organises a mission to relieve the Germans of their treasure.With a fun premise, a proven director in Brian G. Hutton (Where Eagles Dare) and a terrific ensemble cast, Kelly's Heroes could have been a hugely enjoyable WWII 'men on a mission'/crime caper, but winds up being an irritating mess of a movie due to its screwball comedy, its 'futility of war' subtext, and its late-'60s/early '70s hippie spirit, most evident in its madcap characters, of which the most oddball is even called 'Oddball' (played by Donald Sutherland).The flower-power affectations and anti-war message reflect the peace movement of the day and many Americans' sentiments about the Vietnam war, which was in full swing at the time. However, the tone is so completely at odds with the WWII setting that it makes for a very awkward movie. Had they done away with the anachronistic counterculture vernacular and the screwball 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' approach, and made Kelly's Heroes an authentic war movie, I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more.The catchy theme song 'Burning Bridges', sung by the Mike Curb Congregation with music by Lalo Schifrin, is reminiscent of 'The Self Preservation Society', the theme song from the previous year's The Italian Job, which was written by Kelly's Heroes' writer Troy Kennedy Martin and also revolved around a daring gold heist. The Italian Job is far better than Kelly's Heroes.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Sutherland's hugely annoying performance.",3,1,4,25 January 2020
Event Horizon," A haunted house in space.
","Event Horizon is set in the near future aboard a massive spacecraft in low-level orbit above Neptune, but at its heart, the film is nothing more than a haunted house movie given a sci-fi twist: the creepy spaceship is the film's Gothic mansion, the echoey walkways and ducts are its dusty rooms and wood-panelled corridors, the search and rescue team are its travellers seeking shelter for the night, Neptune's turbulent atmosphere is its raging thunderstorm, and rather than being built over a gateway to hell, the craft itself is the gateway, its high-tech drive capable of punching a hole into another dimension where chaos and evil reigns.So, obvious sci-fi trappings such as zero gravity and suspended animation aside, it's tried and tested scares all the way, with hellish visions and supernatural shocks aplenty as director Paul W.S. Anderson skillfully lays on the atmosphere and gory horror. Anderson spoils matters somewhat in the film's closing minutes with an ill-considered finalé that sees one character blown into space by a huge explosion, but somehow surviving the blast to navigate his way back to the spaceship and intervene at a crucial moment, thus saving the day for token spunky female Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson). This rather daft ending almost saw me reducing my rating for Event Horizon from a 7 down to a 6, but the build up was so good that I am prepared to be forgiving.",7,0,1,16 February 2012
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Fun.
","Picking up immediately where Resident Evil left off, Apocalypse sees Umbrella Corporation employee turned zombie ass-kicker Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up to discover that the 'T-Virus', which can reanimate dead cells, has spread from underground facility The Hive to the surface, transforming much of the population of Raccoon City into ravenous zombies. With the quarantined city scheduled to be nuked, Alice's only chance for survival is to join a small group of survivors in a mission to locate the daughter of a top Umbrella scientist, a job made even harder with Project Nemesis, a massive mutant toting a mini-gun, loose on the streets...Sometimes it's so hard to find the right words to convey my feelings about a film that it takes me as long to write my review as it took to watch the bloody thing in the first place. That's one reason why I love the Resident Evil films: they're such pure, mindless, popcorn entertainment that I don't have to struggle when it comes to typing up my thoughts. In Apocalypse, there's tons of zombies, which equals fun. There's Milla Jovovich looking fit and shooting big guns, which equals fun, plus we get a second babe in the form of sexy cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). And there's mutants and blood and explosions and kung fu and zombie dogs and scary stuff and cool effects, all of which means even more fun.See... that was easy peasy—no need for me to even use the thesaurus!",8,2,5,25 November 2011
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drivel.
","I would love to write an intelligent, detailed analysis of Mulholland Drive, I really would, but since I haven't got the slightest idea of director David Lynch's intent (other than to completely confound the viewer), I'm going to have to pass. Instead, let me tell you how my week has been so farMonday: Work as usual. Was involved in an RTA on the way home (not my fault—an old lady drove into the side of my car). Rang insurance company. Started to watch Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Tuesday: Dog ate a packet of ibuprofen and had to be rushed to the vets (no idea how he got them—suspect the cats were involved). Went to work. Came home. Visited the in-laws. Resumed watching Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Wednesday: After the two previous days, this one was fairly uneventful. Dog came home, hopefully without any lasting problems. Ended the day by watching a bit more of Mulholland Drive. Perked up for the lesbian sex scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, but fell asleep soon after.Thursday: Car collected by body shop. Went to work in wife's car (being extra careful to avoid elderly drivers). Watched the rest of Mulholland Drive (managed to stay awake, largely in hope that Watts might indulge in some more sapphic shenanigans, but she doesn't).4/10 for the sexy scene, reduced to 1/10 for the self-indulgent, pretentious, and utterly pointless surreality of the whole thing, especially the opening dance number, the incomprehensible club scene in which a woman mimes a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's classic 'Crying' before fainting (???), the weird hobo with the strange box, and the bit where two miniature people crawl out of a handbag and sneak under a door.",1,8,19,18 February 2016
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb with a capital 'B'
","Hollywood has been accused of dumbing down comedy over the last couple of decades, and if anyone in particular could be held accountable for this trend it would be The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, who between them have been responsible for some of the most puerile, bad taste, gross out comedies ever made. All I can say is 'God bless 'em both', 'cos I'll take a good poo gag over dry wit or a clever play on words any day of the week.In Dumb and Dumber, the film that first brought the brothers' manic brand of inane humour to the public's attention, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play best pals Lloyd and Harry, a couple of morons who take a road trip to Aspen to return a briefcase to pretty socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), unaware that in doing so they are risking their lives.Although this might not be the best of the Farrelly's outrageous comedies (that honour would go to There's Something About Mary or Kingpin), it sure is the dumbest: the plot is dumb, the jokes are dumb, and the characters are dumb... and dumber. If jokes about blind children, boobies, gay truckers, and uncontrollable bowel movements make you bust a gut, then come on down... this'll give your chuckle muscles a more than satisfying workout! If, on the other hand, you find amusement from more sophisticated material, like those movies by neurotic New Yorker Woody Harrelson, then give Dumb and Dumber a wide berth, 'cos it is dumb with a capital 'B'.",7,1,4,23 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I'm going to keep this short (unlike the film).
","After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel.",3,52,76,24 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Please don't feel like you HAVE to laugh.
","There's a moment in Guardians of the Galaxy when Rocket, the film's talking raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), is accused of faking his laugh; coincidentally, there were quite a few people in the cinema I went to who I could have hurled the same accusation at. Yes, GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments, but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However, even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments, this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun, delivering enough weird and wonderful characters, fantastic worlds, spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time. Director James Gunn's eclectic and vibrant universe is brimming with such imagination and visual splendour, all accompanied by a poptastic '70s/'80s soundtrack, that the film proves a treat for the senses despite its obvious shortcomings elsewhere.",7,9,16,8 August 2014
Evil Dead," It'll swallow your soul.
","The original Evil Dead is one of those rare low-budget films that I have long considered to be perfect, so much so that I have always failed to see the benefit of a bigger budgeted remake; even when director Sam Raimi made Evil Dead II (which was essentially a more lavish retelling of the same story), he failed to match his original film's raw intensity and creativity.I will admit, however, that this slick 21st-century version of the infamous 1981 'video nasty' briefly saw me reconsidering my stance. After introducing his obnoxious characters and establishing a somewhat pointless sub-plot about one of them being a recovering junkie, director Fede Alverez actually began to impress me with his handling of the horror, neatly creating an unsettling atmosphere (with the help of his incredibly creepy woodland setting) and delivering numerous, intense scenes of visceral, no-holds-barred carnage—guaranteed crowd-pleasers like self-dismemberment, nail-gun mutilation, shotgun damage and crushed heads.The good stuff doesn't last for long though, and in its final act, the film goes into an irretrievable tailspin, bringing one of its least sympathetic characters back to life in a ridiculous plot development that beggars belief: with the aid of two syringes and a car battery, final survivor David (Shiloh Fernandez) is replaced by his presumed dead junkie sister Mia (Jane Levy), who loses a hand but still proceeds to kick deadite ass, chainsawing in half a crappy Grudge-like creature that crawls its way from the bowels of hell during a torrential downpour of blood. It might be a wonderfully gory way to end the film, but it's frustratingly dumb and deserves nothing but scorn and derision.7/10 for the gore, minus one point for the stupid ending and another for the possessed Mia's unnecessary Exorcist-style expletives.",5,1,10,22 July 2013
The Evil Dead," A relentless, gory masterpiece.
","Sam Raimi may be working with mega-budgets and A-list stars these days but, in my opinion, nothing he has done has surpassed the brilliance of The Evil Dead. In terms of originality and verve, this movie certainly surely tops any of his Hollywood blockbusters.The premise is simple: five people vacationing in a remote Tennessee cabin are attacked and possessed by ancient spirits. Despite this simple plot, the movie manages to be thoroughly engaging from start to finish and delivers plenty of scares along with tons of inventive special effects.Raimi spices up the visuals with a bagful of directorial tricks including improvised steadicam shots and unusual POV angles. Such techniques can become tiresome if overused, but Raimi keeps a tight rein on proceedings and uses these shots where they are most effective, rather than just for the sake of them. Great editing and imaginative sound design add to the overall brilliance of the film.The gore effects are, for the most part, very good. The more outlandish and extravagant gags towards the end are the least impressive (the Plasticine stop motion is kind of shonky) but, considering the budget, this can easily be forgiven.The cast are uniformly excellent, with a special mention going to the young Bruce Campbell as Ash, whose brilliantly physical performance carries the latter part of the film pretty much on its own. He convincingly portrays a character that is pushed beyond snapping point, but who claws his way back to fight the evil forces that surround him.In the early 80s, The Evil Dead was caught up in the whole 'Video Nasty' debate, and subsequently banned in the UK. As a teenager, I treasured my beat up old pirate copy of the film, but have since bought the full uncut version on DVD and the original Palace VHS release (which features great cover art!). This brilliant film never deserved to be vilified in the manner it was, and is thankfully now recognised by cinephiles as the highly influential and truly marvellous movie that it is.",10,4,9,25 November 2006
Saw II," More Saw. More gore. Result is poor.
","Saw was an inventive low-budget shocker that ultimately succeeded due to its clever narrative and ability to disgust.Despite attempts to emulate the elements that made the original work so well, Saw 2 fails to successfully repeat the formula, ultimately feeling like a quickie cash-in sequel (albeit with better acting).The story is basically a retread of the first film, but this time around twisted sicko Jigsaw wreaks havoc on a larger group than before. These protagonists act with little or no logic, undermining any tension wrought from their situation and, in some places, their stupidity beggars belief (the oven victim and the girl who reaches inside the perspex were particularly moronic).I also found the direction and editing extremely tiresome; so many horror films these days feel the need to add choppy edits, distressed and grainy effects and hand-held camera shots. Such gimmicks are not necessary if the director has a tight control of his film and the script is strong enough. These showy techniques make me feel like the movie makers are trying to detract the audience from the lack of a great plot.I sat to the end of this one hoping that the final denouement would be sufficiently clever and unexpected for me to forgive what had gone before - it wasn't!",4,0,1,19 March 2006
Ip Man," You can't keep a good Ip Man down.
","Directed by Wilson Yip (Kill Zone, Flash Point), this is a rather fanciful biopic of Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), the celebrated progenitor of Wing Chun who would eventually become sifu to the world's greatest martial arts star, Bruce Lee. Charting the events in his life that occurred before and during the Sino-Japanese war, the film sees the once prosperous martial artist and his family reduced to penniless, homeless beggars following the invasion of their home town of Foshan. However, when Japanese general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) challenges Ip Man to a fight, he gets a chance to fight for his honour, avenge his dead countrymen, and open a catering size can of whoop-ass on his oppressors!Ip Man is an extremely rose-tinted movie, as one might expect from a Chinese production about a national hero standing up against the tyranny of Japan, but despite its glaring nationalism and an economy with the facts, the film proves to be both a gripping drama and, of course, a bad-ass kung fu flick, with scene after scene of incredible bone-crunching mayhem. The hard-hitting close-quarter combat is brilliantly choreographed by Sammo Hung and flawlessly performed by Yen and his co-stars, and although I've never been a fan of wire-work in a non-fantasy martial arts film (even less so in films based on historical fact), the occasional use of it here detracts very little from the overall effectiveness of the action scenes.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,0,0,19 April 2012
From Dusk Till Dawn," Bloody good fun.
","Two desperate criminals take a family hostage in order to escape to Mexico; once safely over the border, they head for sleazy strip-bar The Titty Twister, unaware that the establishment is home to a nest of vampires who feed upon the clientèle.Fans of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino certainly get their money's worth with From Dusk Till Dawn: not one, but two genres—gratuitously violent crime action followed by over-the-top horror; a smart script that contains just the right amount of cool, quotable, quick-fire dialogue (as opposed to the overlong boring monologues that QT can sometimes be guilty of); sexiness in the delightful forms of Juliette 'Jailbait' Lewis and Salma 'Salsa Hot' Hayek; fantastic splattery gore from effects gods KNB; and a superb cast that includes George Clooney (proving he can play 'bad'), the always dependable Harvey Keitel, plus cult movie legends John Saxon, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, and Cheech Marin.Still firing on all cylinders from his El Mariachi sequel hit Desperado, director Rodriguez ensures that From Dusk Till Dawn is an absolute blast from explosive start to blood-drenched finish, packing the film with wall-to-wall mayhem, stylish visuals, macabre comedic touches (watch for the hilarious bit where one vamp is killed on a pool table and his eyeballs roll into the corner pockets), and cool Tex Mex rock music. And although the story borrows heavily from other films at times—most notably, 80s teen horror Vamp—it matters not a jot: I'm sure you'll be having far too much fun to care!After all, who could fail to enjoy a film that features a biker named Sex Machine (who is armed with a spring-loaded crotch cannon), a sexy dance scene starring the gorgeous Hayek (who allows lucky old Tarantino to indulge in his foot fetish), Juliette Lewis requesting oral pleasure, George Clooney revving a pneumatic stake, Marin listing the wide variety of pussy available in The Titty Twister, and buckets and buckets of juicy, top-quality gore? Not me, that's for sure!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,0,1,18 January 2010
Clash of the Titans," Release the remake!
","In order to prevent the Kraken from destroying the city of Argos, Perseus, son of Zeus, travels to the other side of the River Styx where he must slay Medusa the Gorgon.I'm a big fan of mythological fantasy films, but found the the original Clash of the Titans to be a huge disappointment: the numerous big name Hollywood stars were unable to do much with the lousy script, the special effects were amongst the legendary Ray Harryhausen's least impressive work, and lead Harry Hamlin was out-acted by a mechanical owl.This recent remake features stunning, state of the art CGI special effects and an equally star-studded cast, but little effort seems to have gone into improving the script, which is just as pompous and dull as before; furthermore, in Sam Worthington they have somehow managed to find a pretty-boy actor every bit as wooden as Hamlin—which in itself is a feat almost as impressive as slaying a Kraken!",5,0,0,26 January 2014
Jurassic World," Been there. Done that.
","Jurassic World, the popular dinosaur theme park, has a new attraction: the Indominus Rex, a genetically engineered monster created from the DNA of several different creatures. When it inevitably escapes and begins to chow down on everything in sight, dinosaur wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) is called upon to help track it down.22 years ago my jaw dropped at the sight of CGI dinosaurs rampaging across the screen in Jurassic Park. Four years later and I wasn't anywhere near as impressed with the inevitable sequel, although that was probably more down to the lousy script than the special effects. 2001 and Jurassic Park III tried to make amends for Part 2 by going large, introducing viewers to the Spinosaurus. But while it may have been bigger, it didn't do the trick for most people—dinosaurs were so last millennium.The people behind the Jurassic Park franchise have wisely waited for a new generation of dinosaur fans before trying again. Now, fourteen years later, the park is once again open for business—and, boy, has it been doing a roaring trade, with record takings at the box office. It's spectacular, blockbuster entertainment for the masses, but the problem—for me at least—is that I've seen it all before: Jurassic World might feature a few new attractions, but it's essentially the same thing all over again. Not only was I bored by the predictability of proceedings, but I also became irritated by the excess of CGI, the lack of genuine suspense, the logic-free script, and the regular blatant product placements.The next time Isla Nublar opens for more dinosaur mayhem (given the money this film has made, I think that is a certainty), I reckon I'll save some cash and stay at home.5.5/10, generously rounded up to 6 for featuring my favourite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus.",6,0,4,22 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Better than Blair Witch, but not much.
","Katie (Katie Featherston) claims that she has been plagued by a strange supernatural presence ever since she was a child; boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) is a little sceptical, but after buying a video camera to record any strange phenomena that might occur during the night, he realises that there really is something spooky following his girlfriend—and it ain't very nice!TV adverts for low-budget horror phenomenon Paranormal Activity showed the theatre audience literally leaping out of their seats in terror; the hype almost had me, but having been duped into seeing The Blair Witch Project at the cinema by an equally effective marketing campaign, I decided to wait until this similar sounding film hit DVD. Apart from saving myself a few quid (in the end I snagged the DVD second hand for a pound!), I really couldn't imagine anywhere more apt to watch this home-based horror than in one's own house.Unfortunately, even though I did everything I could to enhance my viewing experience, including waiting until I was alone at night, turning out the lights and leaving the door ajar, Paranormal Activity still didn't scare the bejeezuz out of me! It has a few creepy moments, helped by some weird noises and the occasional loud bang, but like so many other documentary style horrors, the novelty of the hand-held format soon wears off, and the formula rapidly becomes tiresome: the spooky activity is mild at first, but predictably escalates as the film progresses; it's just a matter of time before the ectoplasm really hits the fan; and it's almost a cert that the film will end abruptly with one last shock and the camera falling to the floor/being dropped/smashed etc. (which it does, depending on which ending you see).Thankfully, unlike the Blair Witch Project, the characters are at least likable enough for us to care about them, which helps the tension a touch, and director Oren Peli does manage one or two good scenes amidst the more routine bumps in the night—the discovery of footprints that end under a loft hatch leads to a chilling moment as the camera explores the dark roof-space, and Katie being dragged from her bed by an unseen assailant is an unexpected jolt—but the film as a whole is far from the intense, relentless, crap-your-pants-in-fright scare-fest that the trailers, and many reviews, claimed it to be.",6,1,2,19 April 2011
Mission: Impossible II," Mission: Impossible Woo.
","Despite having a more than competent director in Brian De Palma, the first Mission: Impossible movie was a tad disappointing, it's convoluted plot and lack of action leaving this viewer struggling to remain focused. For the follow up, Hong Kong action expert John Woo took the reins, promising to pump some much needed adrenaline into Ethan Hunt's next adventure. But while many of the expected Wooisms are present and correct, the director's trademark high-octane thrills really only kick in in the final act, meaning that much of the film is just as tedious as DePalma's original, albeit thankfully a lot easier to follow.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire, whose mission is to convince sexy thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to resume her relationship with international criminal Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who has recently acquired the antidote to a deadly virus, and who is now trying to get his hands on the virus itself, hoping to sell the combo to the highest bidder. Helping Hunt on his mission are IMF agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird (John Polson), the latter acting as comic relief.All of this is fairly humdrum—the old 'Earth threatened by a deadly virus' plot holds very few surprises—and much of it is silly (I lost count how many times the rubber mask trick came into play), but the film finally delivers the good stuff in the final reel, when Hunt gets to shoot at lots of bad guys, go wheel to wheel with Ambrose in an exhilarating motorcycle battle, and then duke it out with the boo-hiss villain on the beach. It is only then that Woo gets to really show what he is capable of, although the action is a little light on the blood squibs for my liking.6/10. Marginally more enjoyable than the first film, but still not great.",6,2,4,30 March 2017
Black Snake Moan," My wife gone left me... and now I'm all alone... and to make matters worse... I watched Black Snake Moan!
","Unless you're a big fan of diminutive cutie Christina Ricci, and are desperate to see her wearing very little, there's a good chance that you won't stay the distance with Black Snake Moan. At over two hours long, this slow-as-molasses Southern-style tosh is enough to give anyone the blues, despite its promisingly salacious storyline.Ricci plays Rae, the nymphomaniac wife of soldier Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), who screws around whilst her man is off serving his country (her insatiable lust is apparently the result of having been abused as a child).After one of her drug-fuelled quests for indiscriminate sex, Rae is beaten up and left on a dirt track, where she is found by a god-fearing blues-man, Lazerus (Samuel L. Jackson), who takes the wayward hussy to his home, nurses her back to health, and sets about curing her of her wickedness (by chaining her up, preaching to her, and singing the blues).Lazerus and Rae eventually form a (platonic) friendship, but when Ronnie returns home unannounced (discharged due to high anxiety), discovers from a friend that his wife is a slut, and finds her shacking up with Lazerus, he loses his cool, grabs the nearest gun and goes looking for the old musician.Given the right treatment, this could have been a delightfully trashy slice of exploitation, but with earnest direction from Craig Brewer that shows no hint of being tongue-in-cheek, a dreadful performance from Timberlake, and umpteen laughable Southern stereotypes played completely straight by the stars, Black Snake Moan is rather dull and ultimately disappointing (except for those who are only watching in order to check out Ms. Ricci's knockers).",4,12,25,30 December 2007
Logan," Logan buried.
","Logan (Hugh Jackman) is old and sick, living out his golden years as a limo driver. When he's not chauffeuring drunken hen parties, he's in Mexico, tending to Charles Xavier, who now suffers from dementia. After a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) comes to him looking for help, Logan unwittingly becomes the protector of a young mutant called Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being hunted by a ruthless scientist (Richard E. Grant) and his armed cronies.Director James Mangold takes a decidedly different approach to this follow up to his 2013 superhero flick The Wolverine: whereas his first outing for the Adamantium-clawed X-man was pure comic book silliness, Logan goes for gritty realism. While the sombre tone is a gutsy move, Mangold's film does have a tendency to slip into over-ponderous mode as the director attempts to add depth and poignancy to his character.Mangold's story also leaves much to be desired, being yet another case of young mutants persecuted by the authorities, with our ageing hero caught in the middle. Logan's character arc is easy to predict, as is the inevitable outcome, while certain elements aren't adequately explained (the drug used to keep Xavier from having seizures, the origins of the comic containing the co-ordinates of Eden). Trite as it may be, the plot at least offers up plenty of opportunity for action, which the director handles with aplomb, his R-rating allowing for lots of blood and severed body parts.Ultimately, Logan is a mixture of exhilarating (brilliantly executed fight scenes) and exasperating (the uninspired plot), bringing fans some of the best the series has to offer, but also some of the worst.",6,2,3,9 November 2019
The Dark Knight," The film that the word 'overrated' was invented for.
","8.9 out of 10—really? The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.",5,22,44,29 July 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," In space, no-one can hear you yawn.
","I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie—you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens—broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie—I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)—but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects.",4,5,15,12 December 2015
Men in Black," Show love to the black suit.
","What if there was a special government department whose job it was to police extra-terrestrials secretly living among us? How would new agents be recruited? What kind of technology would be available to them? How would they keep their existence secret? These questions and more are answered in director Barry Sonnenfeld's ingenious blockbuster comedy/sci-fi/actioner Men In Black.The plot—agents Jay and Kay (Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones) must locate a nasty alien bug that threatens the future of planet Earth— isn't quite as strong as the film's basic premise, but with an excellent cast, superb special effects, and plenty of inventiveness, Men In Black has more than enough going for it to make it a great way to spend 98 minutes. Leads Smith and Jones share excellent on-screen chemistry, FX genius Rick Baker provides some incredible alien designs, Linda Fiorentino is easy on the eye as an NY coroner who discovers the truth, and there's a really hilarious talking pug called Frank. And who doesn't love a talking pug?",8,0,0,14 May 2012
Midsommar," Midsommar murders.
","Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first.",3,4,10,1 December 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Not as good as I remembered.
","When Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory, he decides to have the same treatment to rid himself of all thoughts of her. As he is having his brain tinkered with by some seemingly incompetent techy geeks, Joel realises that he has made a mistake and wants to keep his memories meaning that he must somehow hide inside his head.I'm pretty sure I enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back when it first hit DVD. Not so, this time around. While I didn't exactly hate the film on my second long-overdue viewing, I now feel that it is vastly overrated: it's reasonably fun for a while, but the scenes that occur inside Joel's mind as he is having his memories erased go on for way too long, comprising the majority of the movie.Round and round we go, watching the same thing over and over again, with a few cleverly integrated special effects to make us go 'Ooooo'. Carrey and Winslet put in passable central performances, Carrey reining in the gurning as best he can, and Winslet looking and acting suitably quirky, but when all is said and done, there simply isn't enough of a plot to drive a 108-minute movie.5.5/10, not rounded up to 6 for that terrible scene where Carrey plays his four-year-old self.",5,5,11,17 May 2017
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone's gangster masterpiece.
","Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.Spanning decades, the story is truly monumental: it opens in the late 1960s with ageing gangster Noodles (Robert De Niro) returning to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty-five years in hiding, and then proceeds to cut back and forth between the present and the past to show his life as a young boy in an impoverished Jewish ghetto, as a tough gangster during the Prohibition period, and as an old man reacquainting himself with old friends. This skillful technique helps to keep the viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb, but fine performances from a stellar cast (which includes James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello, and a young Jennifer Connelly), excellent cinematography, and some brilliantly executed scenes of brutal violence, all accompanied by a wonderfully haunting pan flute score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, help to ensure that nodding off is unlikely.",9,6,10,6 December 2015

","Much of what occurs in Liam Neeson thriller Taken is incredibly implausible, but with suspension of disbelief turned up to eleven, the film proves to be an extremely satisfying viewing experience—a brutal action flick that effectively exploits that most basic of human emotions: the desire to see the wicked punished.Neeson stars as ex-special forces operative Bryan Mills, who kicks seven shades of the proverbial out of the Albanian human traffickers who are stupid enough to kidnap his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).Although the film's star is well into his fifties, Neeson shows no sign of taking it easy in his old age, kicking, punching and blasting his way around Paris with the energy and power of man 20 years his junior. Director Pierre Morel conducts all of this mayhem with style, and doesn't skimp on the nastier stuff, having Mills mercilessly torture his victims for information, kill without a moment's hesitation, and generally act like a total bad-ass—enough of a bad-ass to make it easy to forgive the film's sillier aspects.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,3,3,26 January 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," Metal is NOT a fad.
","A 'mockumentary' that affectionately spoofs the heavy rock genre, This Is Spinal Tap follows the titular group on a disastrous US tour to coincide with the release of Smell The Glove, their first album in six years.Director Rob Reiner's film is a firm favourite amongst metal-heads, despite mocking the music scene they love so much. This is because metal fans, myself included (a proud headbanger since the mid '80s), can acknowledge the often over-the-top theatricality and absurdity of their chosen genre, and have the intelligence to laugh along with it.And Spinal Tap is full of laughs: from Nigel the lead guitarist (Christopher Guest) proudly stating that his amp goes up to eleven, to the miniature stonehenge stage prop, to the band playing second on the bill after a puppet show, the film is full of great gags, with much of the dialogue being improvised to add to the authenticity of the documentary format.And to make things even better, the music is very good too: I have the Spinal Tap album on vinyl and it is packed with great tunes, from the early '60s songs 'Cups and Cakes' and 'Gimme Some Money', to their hippy hit '(Listen to The) Flower People', through to their heavy rock anthems 'Hell Hole', 'Sex Farm', 'Big Bottom' and, of course, the mighty 'Stonehenge', where the little children danced beneath the haunted moon10/10, although I would go up to 11 if IMDb allowed it.",10,1,3,10 December 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Far from frabjous.
","Alice in Wonderland is another big budget exercise in eccentricity for eccentricity's sake from the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, an overindulgent and unnecessary retelling of the Lewis Carroll tale full of the director's trademark Gothic grandeur and featuring another kooky performance from the top billed star designed to further his appeal with disaffected loners and weirdos (don't be offended: I include myself in those categories).Help is also on hand from pretty but wooden Mia Wasikowska as Alice, assorted well regarded thesps, a handful of cult names from the world of British TV, and of course, Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, whose weak impression of Queenie from Black Adder II is sadly the best performance of the whole film.The clumsy narrative, which focuses heavily on elements from the nonsense poem The Jabberwocky, rarely engages the viewer in a satisfactory manner, achieving neither suspense, tension, excitement or, perhaps most notably, a sense of wonder; instead, the story plays second fiddle to the polished CGI visuals, which offer up the usual, tired, trippy imagery associated with the stories, but fail to either add anything new or make full use of the 3D technology (Wonderland looks positively flat in comparison to Cameron's alien world in Avatar).Not quite as bad as Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes (thank heavens), but still a long way from the genius on display in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks (hey, I like it, so there!), Alice in Wonderland must have looked like the perfect project for all involved but the finished product is unlikely to have anyone grinning like the Cheshire cat.Oh, and anyone who that thinks Crispin Glover needs digitally altering to look creepy is seriously misguided.",5,9,16,5 April 2010
Avatar," Your jaw will meet the floor.
","I wasn't going to bother seeing Avatar: I was afraid that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations as far as the visuals were concerned, and some reports had also been been rather critical of the plot, likening it to 'Dances With Wolves', only with aliens.But inevitably, all the talk of mind-blowing effects and jaw-dropping 3D was enough to finally reel me in, and I'm pleased to say that, once again, James Cameron has succeeded in delivering the goods—and then some.Those who have maligned Avatar for its condemnation of war instigated by greed, or given it flak for its tree-hugging sentiments should get a grip: if Cameron wants to use his projects as a forum for his beliefs (and let's face it, he's not exactly alone in his opinions) then he can go ahead—surely what matters is that the film doesn't suffer for it. And Avatar doesn't.As a piece of 100% slam-bang, in-your-face, holy-cow-how-did-they-do-that, OMG-did-I-really-just-see-that entertainment, it is near perfection: the plot brilliantly combines pure imagination and wonder, incredible white-knuckle action, and genuine pathos; the acting is incredible, with the cast giving superb performances, even when given a massive CGI makeover; and Cameron's use of his advanced, state-of-the-art 3D technology is simply incredible, the design of which draws inspiration from many sources—most notably, perhaps, certain progressive rock album covers from the 70s.On a purely personal level, I also loved the fact that both Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were in the film: they're unlikely bits of totty, I know, but Weaver still has a certain something, even at the age of 60, and Rodriguez has made the hot tough-chick routine all her own.Until someone takes an even mightier leap into the cinematic unknown, developing all the more dazzling techniques to wow an audience (and I'll hazard a guess that that person will be Cameron again), Avatar has set the bar for stunningly beautiful fantasy entertainment.",9,0,6,30 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi's most satisfying work since Ash was last pitted against the Deadites.
","He may have spent the best part of a decade making family-friendly super-hero blockbusters, but Sam Raimi clearly hasn't forgotten how to have fun whilst scaring an audience silly: Drag Me To Hell sees the director on top nerve-shredding form, his enthusiasm for the genre that first made his name seemingly stronger than ever, and his film-making skills honed to perfection.Masterfully blending edge-of-your-seat tension with ghoulish comedy, Raimi's brilliantly inventive and witty script tells of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an ambitious bank employee who, against her better judgement, rejects an old woman's pleas for a loan extension and consequently becomes the victim of a nasty gypsy curse. With only three days before she is due to be dragged to hell by goat-headed demon Lamia, the terrified young woman desperately searches for a way to avoid her dreadful fate, enlisting the help of her sceptical but concerned boyfriend (Justin Long) and psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao).Packed full of perfectly executed jump scares, disgusting gross-out visual gags (eyeball popping; mucous spewing; blood gushing; maggot vomiting: it's all there!), stunning camera-work, and effective CGI, and featuring a strong central performance from lovely leading lady Lohman, Drag Me To Hell is hugely entertaining from start to finish.It goes to show that not all modern mainstream horror is bland, predictable, vacuous drivel—just most of it.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,8,16,10 October 2009
Mission: Impossible," Mission: Impenetrable.
","When the rest of his team are killed during a mission, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) tries to find out who is responsible.Director Brian De Palma has given us some real classics during his illustrious career (Phantom of the Paradise, Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables), but Mission: Impossible isn't one of them, despite a couple of well handled scenes of suspense, a rousing finale, and an impressive cast (Jean Reno, Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart) headed by Hollywood megastar Cruise. The main problem with the film is that it is far too convoluted for its own good, the complex story-line twisting and turning so much that it's hard to keep track of who is on Ethan Hunt's side and who isn't. There is also far too much of Hunt as he taps away on a computer keyboard: I don't know about you, but watching someone surf the web or download information onto a disk isn't what I want from my multi-million dollar Summer blockbuster.Thankfully, the boredom caused by Hunt's excessive computer usage is alleviated somewhat by the film's more outlandish elements: Hunt's rubber disguises that are life-like enough to hold up to close inspection, explosive chewing gum, and lots of high-tech gadgetry that now looks incredibly dated and therefore proves rather amusing. The aforementioned closing action sequence, which sees Hunt clinging to the side of a speeding train in a tunnel while being pursued by a helicopter, is also a whole lot of fun, albeit one of the dumbest things I have ever seen on the big screen. To round things off, Cruise does his patented 'arms and legs flailing while blown through the air by a big explosion' routine.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,1,1,30 March 2017
Saw," Let The Game Begin...
","Oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and photographer Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a derelict bathroom with no idea of how they got there; they are the latest victims of the serial killer known as Jigsaw, who carries out elaborate and sadistic 'games' in order to teach people to appreciate life.With six unnecessary sequels over the last seven years, I had forgotten just how original and innovative the first Saw film was; what a pleasant surprise then to find that, instead of struggling manfully through my first repeat viewing since 2004, the time whistled by, with the movie feeling as fresh, suspenseful and as twisted as it had the first time.When analysed, the plot is admittedly extremely far-fetched—Jigsaw's games, which rely on his victims doing precisely as predicted, could not possibly go off without a hitch—but James Wan doesn't let that faze him and directs Leigh Whannell's convoluted script with enough style, energy and confidence to make it easy to turn a blind eye to the sheer preposterousness of proceedings. Although the film relies heavily on suggestion rather than outright gore, Wan still manages to make this a very unsettling experience, ensuring it as one to miss for the faint of heart but a gruesome treat for those who love their horror gritty and raw.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,0,2,22 September 2011
Mama," Yo mama so ugly...
","Another dark fairy-tale horror from the Guillermo Del Toro stable, Mama is an initially touching tale of despair and abandonment that unfortunately develops into a frustratingly mediocre ghost story severely hampered by the usual culprits—bad CGI effects, digital colour tinting, and worst of all, incredibly cheap scares.As a director, Andrés Muschietti clearly has a keen understanding of his medium, delivering some striking imagery, effectively conjuring up a creepy atmosphere, and commanding superb performances from child stars Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse, but his writing isn't as strong, his derivative script failing to bring much in the way of originality to the tired genre. Once the true nature of Mama's supernatural element becomes apparent, the film becomes a mess of clichés and predictability.",5,0,2,4 May 2013
Super 8," J.J. Abrams gives Spielberg a cinematic man-hug.
","Director J.J. Abrams, an obvious sci-fi nut, was born in 1966, meaning that, like myself, he would have grown up following the career of Steven Spielberg; Super 8 is his cinematic love-letter to all things Spielbergian, a big-budget tribute to the bearded-one's particular brand of suburban sci-fi.Set in a small-town America in the late 1970s, the film follows a close-knit group of high school film-makers who stumble upon a military secret whilst shooting a scene for their 8mm zombie flick. With its small group of dysfunctional friends, sinister government officials, spectacular effects-laden set-pieces, and a suitably schmaltzy message, Super 8 gets the ingredients more or less spot-on, but still fails to be a wholly satisfying affair, Abrams playing his trump card way too early with an improbably fiery but utterly exhilarating train crash that he never manages to top, followed by a rather uneventful middle third, and a disappointing finale that only succeeds in matching Spielberg in terms of mawkish sentimentality.An amusing end credits sequence that features the 8mm movie made by Super 8's budding Romeros proves to be one of the highlights of the whole film.",6,0,2,18 August 2011
Sinister," To the left, to the left.
","Desperate for another bestseller, struggling true-crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a new home, conveniently forgetting to mention that it was the site of a gruesome multiple murder. A search of the supposedly empty attic turns up a box of home movies; as Ellison views the old reels of film, he learns of other murders that are connected to the case he is investigating, and following some strange supernatural occurrences, realises that, by taking up residence in this house, he has not only endangered his own life but those of his family as well.Sinister drags all manner of tried and tested horror movie tricks out of the bag in an attempt at seriously scaring its audience, but all to no avail, the shadowy house, creepy children, loud noises and freaky faces rarely having the desired effect thanks to their sheer predictability. Stick with it, though, and the film eventually gets under the skin, director Scott Derrickson very gradually building a sense of dread with an intriguing story that is clearly heading somewhere nasty; the real fun of Sinister is not in its cheap scare tactics, but in the carefully crafted foreboding atmosphere, and in trying to figure out the exact nature of the film's bizarre occurrences.Sadly, the revelation of a child-eating demon named Bughool being responsible for the mysterious murders comes as a bit of a let down, and the final pay-off is nowhere near shocking as it should have been. After all that has gone before, the previous murders seen in detail, the film wimps out on showing us what should have been the most brutal of them all. Sinister would have been infinitely more disturbing had the ultimate killings been depicted in nauseatingly graphic detail (be honest, who doesn't enjoy a really gory axe murder or four?).Oh well, that's mainstream horror for you, I suppose.",6,2,4,24 June 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Codpiece: Check! Bowler hat: Check! Eyeliner: Check! I'm ready
","England, the future: Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of 'droogs' lead a campaign of terror, raping and beating the innocent at will. After Alex is sent to prison for murder, he is subjected to aversion therapy designed to cure his violence, but finds himself a pawn in a political struggle.Stanley Kubrick's 1971 dystopian sci-fi, based on the cult novel by Anthony Burgess, deals with the theme of freedom of choice vs. social order, questioning the ethics of depriving an individual of fundamental human liberties for the sake of the stability of the state, whilst raising numerous thought-provoking questions on the subjects of morality, good and evil and the abuse of power.There's plenty for the brain to chew over for sure, but it's never a dull experience, being one of the most consistently visually impressive and evocative films of the 70s, a stunning assault on the senses boasting an unforgettable central performance from McDowell, countless memorable supporting characters (my favourite being Alex's creepy post corrective officer, Mr Deltoid, played by Aubrey Morris. Yesss.), a wonderful classical/synth soundtrack, endlessly quotable dialogue, and, for those who like their cult cinema on the controversial side, lashings of the old ultra-violence (as Alex would say).8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,2,5,5 May 2015
Where Eagles Dare," Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
","A good old-fashioned men-on-a-mission war-time adventure, Where Eagles Dare stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood (the Spaghetti Western star finally shaking off his cowboy persona) as Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer, part of a seven man team who embark on a daring raid on a German-occupied mountain stronghold to rescue a captured American general. However, all is not as it seems, with double agents and a hidden agenda complicating an already perilous mission.Shot on location in the snowy mountains of Austria, this WWII classic benefits from plenty of nail-biting action scenes, lots of nasty Nazis (notably Anton Diffring as icy Colonel Kramer and Deren Nesbitt as slimy Gestapo officer Von Hapen), a couple of sexy ladies (Ingrid Pitt, as undercover allied agent Heidi, reminding me a bit of Scarlett Johansson), and loads of shooting and fighting and stabbing and killing and explosions and noisy stuff like that.It's gung-ho escapist fun of the kind where none of the actors attempt to speak German (although some do put on an 'Allo 'Allo-style accents) and where the heroes shoot with deadly accuracy but the enemy always misses their targets. At 158 minutes, it goes on for a bit too long, but the pace is snappy enough to avoid boredom setting in, while some of the obvious technical shortcomings (ropey rear projection) can be excused given the film's age.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Pitt in her wench costume.",8,3,4,13 August 2019
The Fly," Accomplished music video hacks, foreign movie directors with one success under their belt, and Michael Bay—please take note: THIS is how to do a horror remake!
","The Fog, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Omen: just a few of the classic horror titles that have recently suffered the indignity of an extremely inferior remake by greedy studios keen to make an easy buck. With box office receipts the only consideration, the makers of these lazy cash-cows make no attempt at improving upon the originals, aware that indiscriminate teens will flock to see their films, regardless of quality.Back in the 80s, however, things were a little different: easy money came in the form of sequels, which were churned out in rapid succession, but remakes were rare and a surprising amount of care went into their production. Chuck Russell's 1988 version of The Blob was a hugely entertaining romp from a director who clearly loved the genre; John Carpenter's The Thing oozed with atmosphere and pushed make-up FX to a new level; but it was David Cronenberg's re-imagining of The Fly which really proved that a skilled director blessed with a unique vision could turn a remake into a masterpiece.Cronenberg keeps the basic plot from the Vincent Price classic—a scientist experimenting with teleportation becomes horribly disfigured after his body is accidentally merged with that of a housefly—but discards the silly notion of a man sporting a massive fly head and arm. Instead, the director once again indulges his obsession with 'the flesh', and has his protagonist suffer a much more gradual fate: in the days following his seemingly successful experiment, genius Seth Brundle (a wonderfully eccentric Jeff Goldblum) gradually transforms into a monstrous creature as his body struggles to fuse his own DNA with that of the fly.In addition to losing his looks, bits of his body, his ability to digest, and eventually his mind, Brundle also has to cope with the possibility of losing girlfriend Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who is pregnant with his child. When madness finally takes control of Seth, and his transformation into 'Brundlefly' is almost complete, the scientist abducts Veronica as she attempts to abort her pregnancy, takes her home to his lab, and pushes her into one of his teleportation pods, his intention being to merge himself with Veronica and their unborn child, thus creating the ultimate family.A superb central performance from Goldblum, whose quirky, individualistic acting style is perfect for such an unusual role, is perfectly complemented by the equally unique Davis, and solid support is given from John Getz as Veronica's loathsome ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans. The film also benefits immensely from stunning creature and gore effects courtesy of make-up artist Chris Walas (who created the memorable creatures from Gremlins); these ensure that The Fly is as nauseating as it is heart-breakingly tragic. Amongst the revolting sights on offer are a very painful looking broken arm inflicted by Seth during a show of strength in a bar, a quivering inside-out baboon (one of Seth's earlier mistakes), and the Brundlefly vomiting corrosive liquid onto Stathis' hand and foot.If I was going to nitpick, I might argue that baboons seem like an unnecessarily dangerous test animal for Brundle to work with (but then again, maybe they had a special on baboons at the pet store) and the scientist's uncanny ability to program a computer to recognise the poetry of flesh (as he puts it) comes a little too easy, but these are minor niggles and do very little to spoil the film as a whole.With Hollywood currently showing no sign of slowing down the remake production line, perhaps those responsible should take a look at The Fly to remind themselves how the job should be done properly.",9,3,6,29 June 2009
From Hell," Ripper!
","Legendary bewhiskered comic creator Alan Moore has famously distanced himself from all cinematic adaptations of his work, never happy with the end results. It's a pattern that started in 2001 with From Hell, a speculative account of the infamous Jack The Ripper case, directed by The Hughes Brothers and starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. In bringing the graphic novel to life, alterations were made by the film-makers to both characters and plot—changes that were substantial enough to incur the wrath of Mr. Moore.However, while I can fully appreciate how Moore feels (no artist likes to have their work messed around with), I believe that the film is still a very accomplished and entertaining piece that more than warrants merit. A wonderfully realised, bold and bloody take on an oft-told tale, From Hell benefits from confident direction, great production values, and solid performances from a terrific cast, with Hollywood stars Depp and Graham both taking a good stab (pun intended) at the London accent (while they're not perfect, they're more than serviceable) while Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng and a whole raft of other talented players do their utmost to ensure an authentic East End flavour overall.The plot, although heavily revised, holds together very nicely and remains utterly fascinating, pointing the finger of suspicion at both the Freemasons and the Royal Family, making the whole thing a blast for conspiracy theorists and republicans alike. To Moore, I say 'so what if this isn't exactly what you had in mind—at least it's not as bad as what Snyder did to 300'.",8,1,2,16 February 2014
Reservoir Dogs," Sharp direction, sharp dialogue and sharp suits.
","There are two ways one can view a film like Reservoir Dogs (and, indeed, much of Quentin Tarantino's work): a) as an uninspired hodge-podge of ideas blatantly lifted from countless other movies (in this case, a large helping of '80s Hong Kong action thriller City On Fire with countless 'nods' to other crime classics along the way), or b) as an exciting, stylish and highly entertaining exercise in revisionist film-making that sees a bold director mining the work of others to forge a classic of his own.Even though I find description a) applicable to a fair number of QT's films, I cannot help but fall in the latter camp with his debut offering, finding it to be a testament to his deep understanding and appreciation of his medium and his remarkable acuity as both writer and director (he acts in the film too, but two out of three ain't bad, I suppose). In the hands of a lesser film-maker, such an 'homage' would simply be deemed a lazy and unethical exercise in plagiarism, but with Quentin at the helm, infusing proceedings with his unique sense of cool, the whole affair becomes a mesmerising melange of movie-making techniques, a patchwork of pulp excellence that bristles with pithy dialogue and contains many a memorable moment.I can't say the same about Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol.2, Death Proof or even Django Unchained.",9,1,2,15 March 2014
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Not for the easily offended.
","Two hours of human debasement, Sadean perversion, and random killing, Salò's raison d'être is to make the viewer feel as uncomfortable as it possibly can, forcing them to acknowledge humanity's capacity for corruption, depravity and cruelty; in that it succeeds brilliantly, successfully driving home the fact that, as Slipknot so succinctly put it, people=s**t.Although based on a work by Marquis de Sade, the film is set the film during WWII (an era still within living memory for many during the mid-70s) making the horror and wickedness depicted all the more real for those brave enough to watch. As the film's four fascist libertines put their victims through all manner of physical and mental torture, Pasolini captures every last perverted detail, easily qualifying the film as one of the most controversial pieces of cinema ever made.I had heard quite a lot about Salò before watching, enough to let me know that I was in for a very uncomfortable watch, and almost enough to put me off from watching it altogether; however, it was a film that I felt I had to endure in order to keep my self-proclaimed status as a connoisseur of extreme cinema. Although it was undeniably a very gruelling experience, man-love and poop-munching not being among my favourite subjects for an evening's entertainment, I'm glad I stuck with it, partly because I can now finally tick it off 'the list', but also because the film simply works, both as a work of art and as a slice of shocking exploitation.I rate Salò 8/10, not for enjoyment, but simply for taking no prisoners.",8,4,8,14 November 2013
Total Recall," Verhoeven and Arnold do Dick.
","Nobody did sci-fi excess in the 80s and 90s quite like Paul Verhoeven. Whether dealing with bug-like aliens (Starship Troopers), cyborg policemen (Robocop) or invisible maniacs (Hollow Man), the Dutch director rarely took the subtle approach, preferring to mix heavy handed satire with ultra violence. With Total Recall, he once again takes the audience on a wild ride of OTT action and gore, delivering a hugely enjoyable, if somewhat far-fetched, tale based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker plagued with dreams about Mars, who decides to pay the red planet a 'virtual' visit through Recalla company that can implant memories.However, when Doug chooses to receive the memories of a secret agent, he gets more than he bargained for: as a result of tampering with the old grey matter, Quaid discovers that he really has been to Mars, his wife is not who she seems to be, and he may hold vital information in his brain that can change the course of Mars' history forever. Or maybe all of this is just part of his 'virtual' holiday from Recall.With a plot that twists and turns like a rattlesnake on a roller-coaster, it is not long before he (and the audience) is unsure of what is actually real and what is the inevitable result of messing around with the mind.Verhoeven brings together state of the art effects (for 1990, at least), a great cast (which includes Michael Ironside, Sharon Stone, and Ronny Cox) and plenty of action to deliver one of the better movies in Arnie's curriculum vitae. Sci-fi pedants might easily be able to pick holes in the plot (and even I admit that the ending takes some swallowing!), but as far as I am concerned, any film with a machine-gun toting dwarf prostitute is OK in my book.",8,0,3,18 March 2007
Rocky," Yo!
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell). When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.I watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downer—a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.Rocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.Those only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.Director John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb.",10,5,5,24 February 2016
Don't Breathe," Don't watch.
","In the opening scene to Don't Breathe, three youths - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) - break into a posh house, steal anything of value, and vandalise the property, smashing ornaments and urinating all over the place before chucking a rock through the window; their next target is a blind man who is rumoured to have a small fortune in his home, the cash settlement he received after his daughter was run down and killed. Writer/director Fede Alvarez then has the audacity to ask his audience to give a damn about what happens to this trio of white trash scum-bags.Not on your nelly!I don't care how rotten an upbringing Rocky has had, or that she cares for her little sister, or that the blind man turns out to be far from helpless and more than a little bit twisted - rooting for Rocky and her thieving pals is not an option, making the film a frustrating experience from the outset.But unlikable protagonists aren't my only issue with Don't Breathe: there's the small issue of the blind man (played by Stephen Lang), who makes Zatoichi and Daredevil look like clumsy buffoons by comparison. Some of the things this sightless guy is able to do are utterly ridiculous: disarming a gun-toting enemy, repeatedly turning up at the right place at the right time, abducting a woman and keeping her in a basement prison (which, presumably, he also constructed), reaching up to yank Rocky from air ducting, and silently tracking his victim in the surrounding derelict neighbourhood, all without stubbing a toe. His guard dog also displays supercanine qualities, the hound even climbing up furniture and entering an air vent to pursue Rocky.Alvarez manages a couple of effective jump scares along the way, and delivers a memorably yucky scene involving a turkey baster and a large helping of 'gentleman's relish', but the movie is, for the most part, way too dumb and loaded with implausibilities and glaring plot holes to be good for anything but unintentional laughs.",4,1,7,29 June 2018
The Descent," Bloody scary!
","Neil Marshall is a horror fan. This superbly crafted shocker smacks of being made by someone who has spent his life thus far absorbing the great scary movies of all time. The basic plot of a group of friends fighting for their lives against a terrible foe in an inhospitable environment is hardly new (Aliens, Predator, Deliverance, Wrong Turn, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc), but Marshall doesn't worry about that  he's having too good a time using every technique in the book to scare the pants off us.The first half of the film starts as an adventure story  6 female cavers get trapped underground and have to find their way out  but eventually gives way to pure horror when it is revealed that the ladies are not alone; blind flesh-eating creatures dwell in the cave and they're hungry! If tense, gruelling, nail-biting horror with lashings of gore is your cup of tea, hunt this movie down immediately.With Dog Soldiers and now the Descent, Neil Marshall has proved that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of horror. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.",9,1,3,24 January 2006

In order to escape town, the pair dress up as women to join an all-girl band heading for Florida. In a bid to woo the troupe's beautiful ukelele player and singer Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), womaniser Joe ditches his Josephine persona to become billionaire Shell Oil Junior, which causes all manner of problems for his pal Jerry. Meanwhile, the Chicago gangsters are in the Sunshine State for a convention, booked into the same hotel as the band. How long will it be before they recognise the two fugitives?Voted the number one funniest movie of all time by the American Film Institute, Some Like It Hot is pure comedy gold that never puts a foot wrong, from its exciting opening car chase between cops and gangsters, to its now famous last line, 'Well, nobody's perfect'. While that might be true, if there was ever a comedy that was perfect, it's this one: brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, with superb performances from its three leads (Lemmon stealing every scene he is in), great supporting turns from everyone else (Al Breneman as the frisky bellhop is a hoot), a couple of memorable musical numbers by Monroe (who is at her sexiest here), and so many quotable lines of dialogue (my faves: 'That's how I like 'em... big and sassy!', and 'They shrink when they're marinated.').I've seen Some Like It Hot quite a few times over the years, and every time it is a delight, never failing to make me laugh. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? A well deserved 10/10.",10,0,0,3 August 2019
Inside Man," Washington makes it watchable.
","It is to the credit of both director Spike Lee and star Denzil Washington that Inside Man, a rather routine heist story with some glaring plot holes, becomes eminently watchable thanks to their involvement. Washington turns in yet another credible and likable performance whilst Lee displays great control of the whole convoluted affair, with some impressive cinematography and nice use of non-linear storytelling.Denzil plays Keith Frazier, a detective called in to act as negotiator when a bank robbery turns into a hostage situation. However, when the gang of thieves make some peculiar decisions, and a mysterious woman (ably played by Jodie Foster) is given power by the mayor to intervene in negotiations, it soon becomes apparent to Frazier that this is not a typical heist gone wrong.As the story unfolds, we discover that the crooks are after a cache of diamonds, hidden in the vault by the bank's unscrupulous elderly owner (who co-operated with the Nazis during WW2 and received the jewels in return). It is Foster's job to ensure that the proof of the man's secret past, a Nazi document also kept in the vault, doesn't fall into the wrong hands.With Lee's confident direction and solid performances from all involved, I found it fairly easy to ignore the questionable elements of the script (such as why the owner of the bank didn't just destroy the damning evidence of his collaboration with the Nazi's, and exactly how the thieves managed to devise such a foolproof plan).Throw in some particularly funny lines (Denzil's quip about 'Jamal and Jesus' is priceless!), and what you have is an enjoyable, if somewhat flawed, crime drama that packs enough star power and delivers enough action to make it worth seeing.",7,1,2,10 February 2007
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's magnum opus.
","Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10.",10,1,2,16 March 2014
Jack Reacher," All talk and little action makes Jack a dull boy.
","Tom Cruise pops on his Cuban heels and sucks in his gut to play the drifter hero of Lee Child's successful Jack Reacher series. In this film, based on the book 'One Shot', Reacher is hired to help solve the case of an ex-army sniper accused of randomly shooting five innocent victims only to uncover a conspiracy involving Russian criminals with useful connections in the law department.I've not read any of the Jack Reacher novels, so I'm not about to have a moan about how Tom Cruise looks nothing like the character described in the books, but I am going to have a moan about how this blatant vanity project for Cruise is predictable and dull, with way too much talk and not nearly enough action.The DVD case promised 'a heart-pounding, explosive ride', but the reality is far less exciting; I could tell that the film-makers were getting desperate when they gradually started to show more and more of Rosamund Pike's cleavage as the dreary plot dragged on—I know it was the only thing that kept me awake to the bitter end.",3,1,5,14 October 2013
Detroit Rock City," Always fun, occasionally KISSterical.
","Four inseparable high-school pals and members of the KISS Army must overcome numerous obstacles so that they can 'rock and roll all nite' with their musical heroes in concert in Detroit (Rock City).Late-'90s teen comedy Detroit Rock City is a bit like the band KISS itself: it's not high-brow art, and there's stuff that works and stuff that doesn't, but in the end, the name of the game is pure entertainment and fun, and in that it succeeds. It might help if you're a fan of the band and are familiar with the tunes that accompany the action, but even if that's not the case, the film's breezy nature, likeable characters, and easy-going '70s vibe make it a perfect film to chug a few beers to (or some 'cold gin').The film's head-banging foursome are played by James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington, who work brilliantly together, and they are given able support from two of my favourite actresses, Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey (as Christine and Beth - geddit?). Director Adam Rifkin directs with an energy and obvious enthusiasm for his subject matter, and in turn draws inspired performances from his young cast (most of whom weren't even born in 1978, when this film is set).The funny stuff isn't all grade A material, but, just like KISS's classic '70s albums, it's definitely more hit than miss, with some stone cold winners along the way (Furlong puking into the pitcher gets me every time). As a long time fan of KISS myself (1984-present day), I might be a bit biased, but I would say, so long as you don't have 'great expectations', you won't be disappointed.",8,1,1,21 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Far too much lame humour.
","God-like space traveller Ego (Kurt Russell) reveals to Peter Quill (AKA Starlord) that he is his father and tries to convince his new-found son to become part of his plan to assimilate the entire universe.I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy the humour in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie: I just didn't find it funny. So you can probably guess how I feel about Vol. 2, which ramps up the level of comedy even further. I can't say I'm disappointed that James Gunn won't be directing part three (although I do think he was treated very unfairly by those in charge).But Vol. 2 doesn't just suffer from an excess of bad gags: the plot is weak, the pop soundtrack is overbearing, at 136 minutes it's way too long, and the action is too far-fetched (even for a comic book sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon and a dancing baby tree). Our heroes are thrown into numerous situations that would reasonably result in a very messy fate, yet they repeatedly manage to emerge unscathed. Suspending disbelief is one thing; accepting that a character can escape certain death time and time again is asking too much.Admittedly, Gunn has produced a film that looks great, with some mind boggling special effects and mesmerisingly beautiful scenes that make wonderful use of colour, but with such a silly plot and execution that frequently defies logic and the laws of physics, it's hard to care too much about what happens to the good guys.In short, this is the second best film to co-star Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, Cliffhanger still clinging firmly on to first place.5/10, simply for sexy insect alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and tasty blue bald cyborg Nebula (Karen Gillan), both of whom make watching just about worthwhile.",5,1,2,20 February 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Disappointing big-budget adaptation of the Dan Brown bestseller.
","I've read a couple of Dan Brown's books, finding them fun but ultimately disappointing due to their ridiculous plot twists and unbelievable conclusions; the author's prose is also less than sparkling.But whatever you think of Dan Brown's writing skills, you've got to admire his ability to take an age old theme, thoroughly research it, weave a potboiler story around it and then sell the results to the masses. The Holy Grail has been the subject of countless books, but Brown's genius is to make it accessible to the average Joe. So, in THE DA VINCI CODE, he wraps the mystery of who or what is the Holy Grail in standard thriller clichés (murder, action, double-crosses), and serves up an easily digestible platter designed to appeal the widest possible market.On paper, Ron Howard might seem like a reasonable choice for the job of bringing Brown's book to the silver screen; a popular Oscar-winning director, Howard specialises in film-making for the masses. But in tackling this tale of murderous zealots and religious conspiracies, Howard is, in fact, way over his head. Out of his usual territory (sappy dramas, family movies), he flounders with the mystery plot line and occasional action sequences. Poor old Ron just isn't made of the right stuff to tackle this controversial tale of murder and intrigue head on.Brown's books tend to have complex and preposterous plots, and turning THE DA VINCI CODE into a convincing movie was always going to be a challenge. Howard gives it his best shot, but he ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying adaptation of the bestseller, ending up with a muddled effort which requires better structuring and more detail to be wholly satisfying (although with the film already running at a whopping two and a half hours, I can't imagine sitting through even more!).The cast of the movie fare little better. With Howard at the helm, it was not at all surprising when lovable all-American Tom Hanks was chosen to play the hero of the story, famed symbologist Robert Langdon, and although Hanks is a versatile actor, this kind of role just doesn't seem to suit him; he spends most of the proceedings looking more than a little lost. The French contingent is equally unimpressive; Audrey Tatou, who plays his sidekick Sophie Neveu, struggles with the dreadful dialogue whilst Jean Reno plays his usual stock Frenchman with no enthusiasm. Only the Brits manage to give anything resembling a decent performance with Ian McKellen making the drivel he is forced to deliver sound plausible, and Paul Bettany stealing the show as albino assassin Silas.The film glides through the contents of the book, sometimes glossing over certain points too quickly, and at other times labouring issues a little too much (Langdon's claustrophobia, for example, had no bearing on the plot yet was mentioned several times). Those uninitiated with the Grail mythosthe bloodline of Christ, the Merovingians, the Knights Templar, Mary Magdalene, the Priory of Sion et al.will probably find following proceedings a chore. After 150 minutes, even those with an interest in such things may have even had enough.",4,3,7,30 July 2006
Titanic," To be fair, when Jack tried to get on the door, it tipped up.
","A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",9,6,9,15 January 2020
Rocky III," Ding ding!
","Round three of the Rocky story continues to dispense with reality, Philly's famous fighter slowly becoming a parody of his former self. At the start of the movie, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is still Heavyweight Champion, having successfully defended his title against numerous contenders, but after Mickey (Burgess Meredith) reveals that the fights have been against 'soft' opponents hand-picked to keep Rocky on top, the boxer begins to doubt himself. When Rocky finally comes up against a genuinely dangerous opponent, bruiser Clubber Lang (Mr.T), he loses his title and develops a psychological block. However, with the help of one-time rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who would like nothing better than to see the arrogant Lang defeated, and with the support of his loyal wife Adrian (Talia Shire), the Italian Stallion regains the 'eye of the tiger' and rises up to the challenge of his rival. Dun... dun dun dun... dun dun dunnnnnnn....It's very silly at times and rarely feels like anything other than a formulaic Hollywood sequel, but knock me down and count to ten if I didn't have a good time. An early charity fight against Hulk Hogan (as wrestler Thunderlips) sets the tone: this is more 'comic-book' than the previous movies, the violence shrugged off by those involved (and boy, does Rocky get pummelled big time!). In Rocky's rematch against Clubber, virtually every punch hits its target and is accompanied by a bone-crunching wallop sound effect, yet both men carry on despite a clobbering that would put mere mortals like you and I in the ground, making it about as realistic as an episode of the Mr. T animated series that followed shortly after. The iconic theme song by Survivor is the icing on the cake: this is great popcorn entertainment no matter how unbelievable it all gets.",7,0,0,4 September 2019
In Time," The word 'time', time and time again.
","I wonder how many times the word 'time' is mentioned in In Time. It's a lot of times, I'm sure, but I didn't take the time to count. Maybe next time.Starring Just-In Time-berlake and Amanda Seyfried (whose name doesn't really lend itself to any clever time-related puns), this film has a very intriguing premise - that time is a commodity that can be bought or sold, allowing the rich to live indefinitely while time runs out for the poor.Sadly, writer/director Andrew Nichol fails to do the idea justice, his film spending most of its running time being little more than one long chase, as his photogenic leads try to bring down a big-time time magnate, while Timekeeper (i.e. cop) Raymond Leon works around the clock to call time on their antics. It'll only be a question of time before you'll be picking holes in the plot, Nichol having clearly not spent enough time ironing out In Time's wrinkles.4/10, just for keeping me amused for most of the time with its incessant use of the word 'time'. Best line of dialogue: 'Time'.",4,1,4,11 August 2018
Thor," Thor he's a jolly good fellow.
","Thor (Chris Hemsworth), arrogant son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is stripped of his powers and banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders (by fighting the frost giants of Jotunheim). Landing on Midgard (or Earth, as we call it), he meets a group of scientists, falls in love with Natalie Portman, learns some humility, and defends the human race against a deadly foe, before finally returning to Asgard to face off against his deceitful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who has since laid claim to their father's throne.I'm finally getting around to watching the standalone superhero films that paved the way for The Avengers, and I've got to say that, so far, I have much preferred the characters in their individual movies than when working as a team; this one is no exception. Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, which originally concerned me since he hasn't really had much experience with big budget blockbusters, but I'm happy to say that Ken did a great job, handling the material intelligently, delivering a film that gets the balance just right between drama and spectacular action.Hemsworth—a relative unknown before being picked to play Thor—is excellent as the hammer swinging God of Thunder, a strapping fellow who not only looks the part, but who also gives a fine central performance. Hopkins is, unsurprisingly, great as Odin, Hiddleston is suitably loathsome as the boo-hiss villain, but Portman is required to do little other than look pretty.",7,1,2,17 May 2014
The Godfather: Part III," Easily the worst of the trilogy.
","In this, the third (and hopefully final) Godfather film, mafia boss Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), wracked with guilt over his past sins, is one step closer to becoming a legitimate businessman. He's already earned respectability in the eyes of the church, who award him the holy order of St. Sebastian, but, to paraphrase Michael himself, just when he thought he was out, 'they' pull him back in.Sofia Coppola cops a lot o' the blame for the failure of The Godfather Part III, but it's not all her fault: sure, her emotionless delivery of her lines is painful to endure, but no more so than Pacino's uncharacteristic performance, Andy Garcia's smug face, Diane Keaton's horrible hair, and the dreary script that forces the viewer to sit through hours of boring business deals, an unconvincing romance between first cousins Vincent (Garcia) and Mary (Coppola), several crushingly dull Catholic ceremonies, and lots of operatic singing, with only the faintest hint of mafia shenanigans to still qualify it as a Godfather film.",4,1,2,11 March 2016
Zombieland," The zombie movie that gives you a Woody!
","From the hilarious opening scenes, in which its teenage loser protagonist Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) informs the viewer about his hard and fast rules for surviving a zombie ravaged Earth, it is evident that Zombieland is going to be a seriously fun ride, and the cool slow-mo credits sequence, depicting a variety of living dead mayhem to the strains of Metallica, only go to reinforce this fact (classic thrash metal and stylish zombie action: they sure know how to get my attention!).The film follows anxiety-ridden nerd Columbus as he attempts to travel to Ohio to find his parents, teaming up with Twinkie-loving, hard-as-nails zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) on the way; but when he meets and falls for pretty con-artist Wichita (gorgeous Emma Stone), who has serious trust issues and a younger sister to protect, Columbus' sense of self-preservation falls by the wayside and he realises that, to be truly happy, risks must be taken and that rules are for wimps.With lots of stylish zombie slaying, bags of visual gags, plenty of slick gore (including CGI blood, unfortunately, but I guess that's just a sign of the times), a quite surreal moment midway featuring a surprise cameo from a well known comedy movie star, and an exciting, action-packed climax set amidst the attractions of a theme park, Zombieland provides solid wall-to-wall entertainment for zombie fans who enjoy a good laugh along with their graphic gut-munching.No doubt people are going to refer to Shaun of the Dead when talking about Zombieland, since both films are zombie comedies featuring a dash of romance; but to compare the two films is pointless—Shaun's humour is so typically British and Zombieland so American in style that they actually bear very little resemblance to each other.Let's just be content with saying that both films rock, but in their own unique way.",8,0,2,14 December 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," The list still stands at zero.
","Back in 2013, I jokingly created an IMDb list called 'Non-irritating performances by Jack Black' which consisted of zero titles. Over the years, I have wondered if I might have been a little unfair (he was just about bearable in Tropic Thunder, I suppose), but I feel vindicated after watching Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, which sees Black putting in a grating, boorish, self indulgent, and seriously unfunny performance to beat all others.The film stars Black as JB, a wannabe rock star who teams up with guitarist KG (Kyle Gass) to form the group Tenacious D; together, they plan to take the music world by storm by laying their hands on the Pick of Destiny, a legendary guitar pick made from Satan's tooth that endows the holder with incredible musical skills. All of this nonsense definitely has the potential to be funny, but Black's egocentric performance, Liam Lynch's uninspired direction, a lack of decent material that relies too heavily on vulgarity, 'stoner' gags, and pointless cameos, and surprisingly cheap production values makes for a really painful experience.1/10. Foo Fighter's Dave Grohl puts in the best performance as Satan, but it's nothing we haven't already seen in Tenacious D's much played music video for 'Tribute' (which I actually like, along with the rest of their debut album — go figure!).",1,1,6,24 August 2017
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Rarely hits the target.
","This romantic comedy/action pic starring Hollywood A-list sex symbols Brad 'Pretty Boy' Pitt and Angelina 'nice tits, WTF lips' Jolie has something for everyone, male or female... or so the studio must've thought when concocting their calculated 'sure-fire hit'. Shame then that they forgot to include decent laughs, neglected to bother whether the script made any sense, miscalculated the level of on-screen chemistry between the film's stars, and failed to generate any excitement until long after the audience had stopped caring.Coming across like James Cameron's Trues Lies crossed with Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner's black comedy War of the Roses—only minus both of those films' style, wit and charismatic lead performances—Mr. and Mrs. Smith sees Pitt and Jolie as a bored married couple who, to their surprise, discover that each other is a hired assassin working for a rival agency. This conflict of interest initially pits the pair against each other, but with so much in common, the couple eventually rekindle their love and form a formidable alliance.Clearly, with such a set-up, the audience is intended to connect emotionally with the film's cold-hearted killers and find humour in their predicament, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith fails to pull off such a trick, the script lacking the sophistication and requisite dark humour that the subject matter demands.",4,1,3,28 January 2012
Die Hard," Still the best of the series.
","The first time I ever saw Die Hard it was at the Film On The Square screening, part of the London Film Festival in Leicester Square, November 1988; I spent the following weeks—up until the film's official UK release date on February 3rd—trying to convince people that Bruce Willis would be the next big Hollywood action star and that Die Hard would change the face of the action genre forever. 'Bruce Willis from Moonlighting?' they would say, 'I don't think so.' 'Just wait and see', I would reply...A quarter of a century later and Bruce is still proving me right (the fifth Die Hard movie came out earlier this year and Red 2 is on general release as I type); but no matter how long the guy keeps on blowing stuff up and shooting bad guys on screen, I doubt he will ever match the brilliance of Die Hard, which remains the pinnacle of action cinema as far as I am concerned, a film where everything came together to create pure cinematic gold.Director John McTiernan at the top of his game, fresh from the success of Schwarzenegger vehicle Predator; perfect casting throughout, from Alan Rickman's loathsome lead villain Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia's plucky Holly McClean, right down to Al Leong as mustachioed henchman Uli and Playboy Playmate Terri Lynn Doss as the blonde hottie at the airport; a great soundtrack that combines hip-hop and classical music with a seasonal flavour; visual effects from Richard Edlund that still hold up well against any of today's CGI; superb cinematography courtesy of Jan De Bont; a brilliant script with cracking dialogue and a wry sense of humour (that scene with the SWAT member catching himself on a rose bush still cracks me up!): Die Hard is virtually flawless in every department.Unless you've been in a coma or living in a cave for the past two and a half decades, you'll no doubt be familiar with the plot, so I won't waste any time summarising what happens, suffice to say that the set-up is lean, mean and full of explosive, edge-of-the-seat action, and is still influencing action film-makers today, recent examples being comic-book sci-fi flick Dredd and martial arts actioner The Raid. But no matter how many derivatives (or sequels) it spawns, the original will always be the best—a white knuckle ride of a movie with the power to thrill your socks off even after all of these years (so watch out for broken glass!).",10,1,2,8 August 2013
Psycho," Not to be confused with the 1998 film of the same name (as if).
","Psycho is undoubtedly Alfred Hitchcock's most famous film, and not for no reason: it's a masterclass in suspense, tension and terror that, even half a century after it first stunned audiences with its raw, psychological horror, has lost none of its ability to shock.For those who don't already know, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, creepy proprietor of the Bates Motel, situated off the old highway 15 miles from the town of Fairvale. Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane, who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40,000. Feeling tired after a long trip on the road to visit her lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin), Marion decides to check into the Bates establishment, where she meets a sticky end whilst taking a shower (c'mon, don't tell me you didn't know...).When Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) travels to Fairvale to see if Sam knows anything of her sister's whereabouts, she is tailed by private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), whose expertise eventually leads him to the Bates motel where Norman and 'mother' wait with butcher's knife in hand.Working from a script by Joseph Stefano (based on the novel by Robert Bloch), Hitchcock delivers a flawless exercise in horror that sees the director develop techniques so effective that they are still imitated to this day, but which are rarely as well executed as they are here. Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off, metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches, including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix, where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank, Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot), a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink, and of course, the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann, itself often imitated, and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes, horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times. It's that good.",10,0,4,4 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The only thing I might possibly hate even more than this is a Transformers film starring Mark Wahlberg. Oh, wait a minute
","With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director (and I use that term in the loosest possible sense) Michael Bay hasn't just achieved a new low in his god-awful career but has quite possibly reached the absolute nadir of the cinematic art-form. An incomprehensible two and a half hour orgy of stupefyingly crass nonsense, this garbage substitutes loud smashes, rapid dialogue, insanely fast editing and a tidal wave of CGI for actual talent, the result being one of the least pleasurable film experiences of my life.In addition to the digitally-enhanced audio-visual maelstrom that constitutes the bulk of this mess, the film also boasts a lousy script (featuring ridiculous comedy relief robots and a randy chihuahua) and some really wooden performances, with poster-boy-for-Dreamworks-SKG Shia La Beouf being the worst offender (let's hope that appearing in Lars Von trier's Nymphomaniac kills his career), and gratuitous eye-candy Megan Fox coming a close second.My ten year old son, who presumably falls slap bang in the centre of the film's demographic, bailed about halfway though, bored to tears by the endless drivel being served up to him; unfortunately for me, I always insist on watching a movie in its entirety before slagging it off, and stayed to the bitter end.

Rosemary's Baby," What a horny devil!
","Pretty housewife Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) are over the moon when they secure a spacious new apartment just right for starting a family. Not long after moving in Rosemary suffers a horrific physical assault that leaves her a shadow of her former self: she's given a dreadful pixie haircut by Vidal Sassoon that makes her look like a young David Bowie. Oh, and she gets knocked up by Satan as well.Roman Polanski's faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's bestseller Rosemary's Baby is an unmissable treat, a slow-burn classic of the Satanic horror sub-genre that builds inexorably to its chilling climax with class and style, never resorting to cheap scare tactics (which some might find surprising given that producer William Castle is renowned for his schlock horror B-movies).Polanski's approach is all about the foreboding atmosphere and mounting tension, building slowly on the sense of dread first triggered by a potted history of the infamous Bramford Building (given by Rosemary's friend Hutch) with a series of bizarre incidences that eventually have Rosemary believing that her neighbours are witches aiming to steal her as-yet unborn baby. Of course, Rosemary is not far wrong but Polanski cleverly toys with his audience right to the finish, almost having us doubt her sanity towards the end despite all that we have seen.Barring a brief glimpse of a bloody corpse—a suicide victim who hits the sidewalk with a splat—the film is totally devoid of gore, but even if you usually prefer your horror drenched in red, this effective chiller still comes highly recommended.",8,0,1,23 May 2012
War of the Worlds," The chances of anyone making a decent War of the Worlds film are a million to one.
","The first movie adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the World's was produced in the 50s by George Pal and featured flying saucers attacking modern-day America rather than tripods laying waste to Victorian Britain (as was depicted in the book). Pal can easily be forgiven, since there was neither the budget nor the technology available to remain absolutely true to Wells' incredible tale.Steven Spielberg has no such excuse.With a massive budget, A-list stars, the power to call the shots, and the best special effects houses at his disposal, he could have given us the definitive cinematic version of Wells' classic tale; instead, we get this pile of unmitigated cack, another contemporary tale set in the US with a typically Spielbergian dysfunctional family at its heart and plot holes big enough to walk an army of tripods through.From the dumb premise of Martians using aeons-old war machines buried under the Earth's surface, to the supposedly advanced alien probe that can be fooled by a mirror, to the happy family reunion at the end, this is badly scripted, ill-judged film-making from a director who really should know better.Possibly Spielberg's worst movie to date, War of the Worlds gets 2/10 from me.",2,0,2,5 March 2013
Love Actually," No chainsaw wielding maniacs, but still very enjoyable.
","At Christmas, even an out-and-out hardcore horror freak like me occasionally puts the blood 'n' guts goes on hold for something a little lighter and more heart warming. And they don't come much more fluffy and saccharine sweet than Love Actually (which I'm squeezing in between a Dario Argento giallo and a trashy Pete Walker slasher).Director Richard Curtis delivers a series of cleverly written tales about the trials and tribulations of love, covering the many facets of the subject: unrequited love, platonic love, adulterous love, young love, spontaneous love, dangerous love. Always chuckle-some, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but never boring, Curtis's sparkling script brings us a collection of likable characters who are brilliantly brought to life by an amazing ensemble cast, which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, and Billy Bob Thornton, plus brief cameos from, amongst others, Michael Parkinson, Ant and Dec, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards.Nighy, in particular, shines as a has-been rocker vying for the Xmas No.1 spot, giving a bittersweet take on the whole romance schtick, as does Laura Linney who plays Sarah, a woman whose love for her brother costs her the chance of scoring with her dream man. On the more traditionally 'sappy' side of things, Grant's Prime Minister falling for working class cutie McCutcheon borders on fantasy, but is perfect viewing fodder for couples curled up in each other's arms on the couch.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to the wanton slaughter of buxom women before I find myself hooked on rom-coms!",8,0,2,26 December 2007
30 Days of Night," Whatsisname and Thingummy vs. The Pet Shop vampires.
","I had high hopes for this film after hearing the interesting synopsisvampires attack an Alaskan town as it is plunged into darkness for a whole monthbut feared the worst when I saw that its unimpressive cast included bland hunk Josh Whatsisname, Thingummy George from... um... that remake that wasn't particularly good, and some others (yes, the cast is that unmemorable). Just as I expected, 30 Days of Night turns out to be pretty dull, but is made just about watchable thanks to the occasional spot of decent gore.The film starts off promisingly enough with a stranger to the remote town of Barrow destroying the inhabitants' mobile phones and killing their sled dogs. When he is caught by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Whatsisname) and thrown in jail, the man warns that 'they' are coming. So far so good.Then it all goes wrong: 'they', as it turns out, are a gang of bloodthirsty vampiresand what an irritating bunch of crap bloodsuckers they prove to be! Head vampire Marlow (Danny Huston) is just laughable, looking like Neil Tennant (from the Pet Shop Boys) and speaking like a Klingon; the rest of the bloodsuckers look okay, but insist on hissing and screeching like demented velociraptors from Jurassic Park, and really grate on the nerves.Director David Slade, whose last film was the impressive 'Hard Candy', manages a few decent moments of gory mayhem (an overhead shot of the vamps spilling blood into the snow; the big tractor-like machine with the big whirly blades, slicing and dicing through the vamps with ease; and the axe decapitation of Deputy Billy), but there are far too many dreary scenes featuring the survivors cowering in a variety of abandoned buildings.Slade also succumbs to that annoying trend that has blighted many a recent movie: wobbly camera movements, with rapid editing. What action there is, is made extremely difficult to watch.The very silly ending, in which Eben deliberately infects himself with vampire blood in order to defeat the enemy, is perhaps the worst part of the whole film, and left me wondering how such a daft finalé could have ever seemed like a good idea.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for the gore.",5,3,6,2 April 2008
Wedding Crashers," A promising cast produce a so-so comedy with the odd moment of genius.
","Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) and John (Owen Wilson) are a couple of womanisers who crash weddings in order to take advantage of the romantic mood in the air and bed the hottest female guests. But whilst crashing the society wedding of the year, they find themselves at odds with each other when John falls for the daughter of the Treasury Secretary, thus breaking the 'rules of the wedding crasher'.With the combined talents of Vaughn and Owen, plus Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken, I was expecting this film to be a hilarious side-splitter from start to finish. Unfortunately, Wedding Crashers isn't half as funny as it should be, only delivering the occasional gem of a line in between the so-so comedy that makes up the majority of the movie.On the plus side, Isla Fisher is great as the sex-crazed 'stage-five-clinger' sister and Jane Seymour plays brilliantly against type as Christopher Walken's drunken-slut-of-a-wife! If you settle down to this one with high expectations, prepare to be a little disappointed – a shame, because it could have been something special.",6,0,1,25 March 2006
Joker," Heath who?
","One in four people will experience mental illness in their lifetime, but only a very small percentage of those will pose any sort of danger to anyone other than themselves. Hopefully, as more people talk about openly about mental health, stigma will decrease, and all those in need of help will get the treatment they require.There will, of course, always be cases that slip through the net with tragic results, people like Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose fragile psyche is the result of a lifetime of hurt: a victim of child abuse, a victim of violence, a victim of intolerance, a victim of circumstance, a victim of inequality, and a victim of a society that doesn't care. No longer functioning as a rational human being (his access to meds having been taken away), Fleck confuses reality and fantasy, is prone to outbursts of extreme violence, and dances wildly to inappropriate pop music from the '70s.With a tour-de-force performance from Phoenix, whose turn as the green-haired villain is both sympathetic and terrifying, plus stylish direction from Todd Phillips, and an intelligent script that is, by turns, funny, sad, exciting, and horrific, Joker is a refreshingly bold attempt to do something with a well known comic-book character that doesn't involve expensive CGI-laden battles.9/10. The only part that I didn't like was where it is revealed that Arthur's relationship with his pretty neighbour has been a figment of his imagination. I think most people would have got this without the need to spell it out for them.",9,9,30,16 October 2019
Man on Fire," WARNING! This film contains migraine-inducing direction and novelty subtitles!
","With Denzil Washington, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke and Dakota Fanning on board, this film could've been something special. Unfortunately, Tony Scott blows the whole affair with his awful direction and use of the most annoying gimmick seen in recent cinema history - novelty subtitles! Brian Helgeland's average script serves up nothing in the originality stakes, but with a competent director helming the tale, we may have had a pretty good 'avenging angel' flick. Instead, Scott indulges his 'artistic' whims rather than concentrating on telling a story  the result is a 140 minute piece of self-indulgent dreck that irritates and bores in equal amounts. Even when the 'action' kicks in (and it takes a long time to do so), you'll probably find yourself with finger poised over the off switch. Life is too short for pretentious drivel like this.The constant choppy editing, flickering images and pointless use of out-of-focus shots will make your head hurt and the aforementioned subtitles, which even appear when the actors are speaking English, do nothing to help matters. If you insist on watching this, keep the paracetamol on standby.",2,4,12,17 February 2006
Army of Darkness," Excessive consumption of alcohol: the cure for chronic sequelitis.
","I absolutely loved the The Evil Dead, a brilliantly inventive splatter-fest that showed how a low budget needn't be a restriction on creativity; sadly, I found the sequel to be a bit of a disappointment in comparison, being little more than a rehash of the original, only with the horror diluted somewhat by director Sam Raimi's proclivity for slapstick humour. The very last scene in Evil Dead II, where hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrown back in time to defeat a medieval 'deadite', did however offer a glimmer of hope, suggesting that a third chapter might be a little more epic in scope and would expound considerably on the Evil Dead mythos.Five years after EDII, and I finally got my chance to see how Raimi's vision would pan out, securing tickets to an early screening of Army of Darkness at The London Film Festival; unfortunately, after a long wait in a pub knocking back Jack Daniels, I was completely rat-arsed by the time the performance started. The next morning, all I could recall about the film was the final shot, an impressive post-apocalyptic vista with Ash screaming in dismay at his eventual plight; this excellent bleak ending led me to believe that Raimi had made amends for the predictability and dreadful physical comedy of EDII and that I had just sat totally mullered through a possible future favourite.When Army of Darkness got its official release, however, a second viewing revealed the film to be far from the inspired horror classic I hoped it to be: instead, I was shocked to find that the Three Stooges inspired buffoonery had taken complete precedence over scares. Army of Darkness was a relatively horror-free effort packed with drawn-out slapstick routines (albeit ones performed by skeletons and miniature evil versions of Ash) and that Ash had been turned into a jerk of massive proportions; worse still, the cool downbeat ending had been replaced by a dreadfully cheesy crowd-pleaser. Grrrrr!The moral of this tale: if you're a huge fan of the visceral approach of the first film, but didn't care so much for the second, watch Army of Darkness completely blotto. And make sure it's the Director's Cut.",5,1,5,14 November 2010
Scream 2," Wes and Williamson do it again.
","Wrongly imprisoned and almost executed for the murder of town bike Maureen Prescott, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) could be forgiven for being a little bitter towards young Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose false testimony resulted in his incarceration. But is the recently released Weary responsible for the spate of copycat killings taking place at Sidney's college? With so many candidates for campus maniac to choose from, it's anyone's guess...Scream 2 is definitely a case of 'more of the same', but when 'the same' is of such a high calibre, this really isn't much of an an issue: the film is still an absolute blast and a worthy successor to the brilliant original.This time around, writer Kevin Williamson abides by most of the rules of the horror sequel, as defined by the film's very own movie nerd Randy: the body count is bigger and the death scenes are more elaborate, and definitely messier. Fortunately, Williamson doesn't stick to the notion that sequels have to be inferior: the superbly constructed script, masterful direction from Wes Craven and great performances from an excellent cast (several of whom reprise their roles from the first film) ensure that Scream 2 works like a charm, providing fans with another satisfying dose of fear laced with laughter.In addition to the expected scenes of stalk and slash, the well executed jump scares, and the usual quota of red herrings, there are in-jokes aplenty for film buffs to spot, and umpteen 'guest' stars who pop up in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em bit parts (familiar faces include Heather Graham, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, Portia de Rossi, and Jada Pinkett, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua Jackson, who would subsequently appear in Scream-alike slashers I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend).If you loved the first Scream, then the chances are you'll have loads of fun with this one too.",8,0,3,25 October 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Bram Stoker's Dracula my arse!
","If I were to rate Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula based on style alone, it would get a pretty decent score, the film boasting some truly striking visuals achieved through a wide range of classic pre-CGI movie-making techniques. Coppola's bold aesthetic decisions are wasted, however, on a film which suffers from a dreadful script that strays way too far from its source material, features some of the most embarrassing performances imaginable, and is quite simply a very, very dull viewing experience.Over the years, I've developed a pretty good idea of what makes for an effective vampire: undead soul-less agents of Satan, their only desire should be to feed on the blood of humans, the more cruel and ruthless they are in this pursuit the better—oh, and if possible, they should look cool while doing so. They certainly shouldn't fall in love.And yet this film sees Dracula (Gary Oldman hamming it up for all he is worth), supposedly the most evil vampire of them all, sporting a really stupid get-up that makes him look like an old queen, and has him pining for a woman. And not just any woman, but bloody Winona Ryder, quite possibly the most insipid actress ever. In short, he's a bloody embarrassment to bloodsuckers everywhere!As if that wasn't bad enough, the film also features Keanu Reeves in the role of Jonathan Harker, a more miscast actor you would be hard pushed to find; Reeves's lamentable attempt at an English accent rivals that of Dick Van Dyke's dreadful Cockney in Mary Poppins for sheer ineptitude, turning his scenes into unintentional comedy gold. Anthony Hopkins fares little better as Van Helsing, Tom Wait's Renfield isn't a patch on Dwight Fry's in the 1931 classic, and Sadie Frost is overtly sexual when she really shouldn't be.For all the incredible sights on offer in this elaborate production (including the scrummy Monica Belluci once again baring her magnificent chest), this is a truly retched attempt at bringing Stoker's novel to the screen, and one that should be treated with contempt by all genuine Dracula fans.",3,5,8,23 June 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Hard with a Lethal Weapon.
","Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve.Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the film—I still had a lot of fun with this one—but it is a worrying sign of things to come7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,0,0,18 August 2013
Con Air," 1997: a vintage year for Cage.
","I realise that Con Air is about as far from ground-breaking visionary cinema as you can get—Hell, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which speaks volumes about the artistic integrity involved—but as a thrilling slice of slam-bang popcorn action fun, it works a treat.Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, an honourable army ranger who is sent to a maximum-security federal penitentiary after accidentally killing a man while protecting his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). After serving eight years, Cameron is finally given parole, and scheduled to fly home on a C-123 Jailbird aircraft, along with several other prisoners whose number include evil criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and Poe's likable diabetic cell-mate O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). Poe's freedom is delayed however, when Cyrus and his equally vile cohorts take over the plane by force, and O'Dell's life is placed in jeopardy...Unlike The Rock, which was an overly dramatic and rather jingoistic affair, Con Air is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish. To try and analyse the plot or apply logic to proceedings is futile, the script conveniently glossing over details as and when it suits (for example, we never learn what Cage's cell-mate O was jailed for; as a result, he becomes a sympathetic character, when the guy could have been a child killer for all we know!). Director Simon West sure isn't concerned about his film making sense, 'cos he's too busy having the time of his life inflicting maximum damage on everyone and everything in the most spectacular manner possible. In this film, the rules are 'don't just have a car crash when you can drag it behind a plane on a hook for a while before smashing it onto a runway?' and 'Don't just kill a man when you can kill him and then drop his corpse from several thousand feet onto a moving vehicle?'.It's stuff like this, coupled with a formidable cast and excellent stunts, pyrotechnics and special effects, that elevate Con Air from the ridiculous to the sublime. I give Con Air a rating of 8 delightfully ruthless maniacs out of 10, making it the second best Nicolas Cage action flick of 1997.",8,1,2,24 February 2012
It Chapter Two," The killer clown from outer-space is back.
","The otherworldly creature that terrorises the Maine town of Derry every twenty-seven years is back, reuniting the now grown-up members of the Loser's Club, who swore to try and defeat the evil once and for all should it return.Chapter two of IT is, unsurprisingly, very similar to part one: effectively creepy, occasionally gory, and slickly directed, with excellent performances from both the young actors from the first film (who appear in flashbacks) and their adult counterparts. Also putting in another superb turn is Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, who returns as the monster's quasi-human form, scary clown Pennywise: he's just the right mixture of unsettling and humorous. Hell, even Stephen King delivers a decent cameo as the owner of an antiques shop (the mega-wealthy author making a funny about writers being rich).Despite numerous attempts by director Andy Muschietti, I can honestly say I didn't jump once (I've seen more than enough horror movies to not fall for the obvious scare tactics), but I was suitably impressed by the inventive designs of IT's many forms, from the creepy old naked lady to the disembodied spider-head (a nice homage to John Carpenter's The Thing) to the final massive monster. Besides, the lack of genuine frights is more than made up for by the comedy, which was great throughout, with Bill Hader as Richie being particularly amusing, the best scene involving three doors and a very cute dog.At 169 minutes, I can imagine that the film will be a touch on the long side for many, but I found that it whipped by with nary a dull moment and kept me entertained throughout, which is more than I can say for some of the much shorter, more recent and more lauded horror movies of the past couple of years (Us and Halloween, to name but two).",8,4,7,6 September 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Incredibly silly and brilliant comedy.
","In Anchorman, Will Ferrel stars as Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top TV news reporter. His show is top of the ratings, when a beautiful female broadcaster, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), joins the team and catches Ron's eye. Ron is smitten, but falling in love is only the beginning of his troubles.The ridiculously puerile and downright immature humour on display will either repel you, or hook you completely, as it did me. But then I loved Zoolander and Dodgeball, equally daft movies which also had a healthy dose of the absurd running through their veins.You can tell that the entire cast are having a blast getting paid for being stupid, and the fun is infectious (just try keeping a straight face when Ferrell plays Jazz flute). If you dig this kind of thing (and I pity you if you don't), you'll have a great time watching the film, and an even greater time afterwards quoting your favourite lines.",9,0,1,4 March 2006
Jaws," I'm still afraid to go in the water.
","What were my parents thinking when, in 1975, they took me to see Jaws at the tender age of 7? Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel (about a man-eating shark feeding on the inhabitants of a small island) had me squirming in terror for nearly two hours when I first saw it. Even now, 32 years later, this film still has the ability to horrify, nauseate and generally upset me; testament, surely, to the brilliance of its director and the talent of its amazing cast. But it's still definitely not suitable fare for a 7 year old!Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, who has moved with his family from the crime ridden streets of New york to Amity, an idyllic New England island. But when a spate of shark attacks threatens to ruin the island's 4th of July weekend, Brody, along with salty sea-dog Quint (Robert Shaw), and shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), sets out to catch the fish responsible.Opening with a terrifying scene in which a woman taking a midnight swim ends up as fish food thanks to the toothy terror lurking in the deep, Spielberg creates an atmosphere of fear from the word go. After a second attack, in which a child is chomped in full view of the sun-worshippers on the beach (possibly the film's most shocking moment), it becomes clear that anyone is fair game for the Great White prowling the waters of Amity, and the tension becomes almost unbearable.Spielberg's impeccable storytelling and incredible visual style, coupled with amazing performances from practically all involved, plus a fantastic score from John Williams, result in a film that is as close to perfection as humanly possible. Packed full of jump scares, great characterization, nerve wracking suspense, and exciting action, this one really does have it all.Jaws was the film that kick-started the summer blockbuster phenomenon and made Spielberg a household name; more importantly, it was the first movie to completely scare the crap out of me. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.",10,1,3,4 May 2007
Kong: Skull Island," Bigger doesn't mean better.
","Skull Island features the biggest Kong yet, a towering 100 ft tall primate able to swat helicopters from the sky like flies. But bigger doesn't necessarily mean better: while this latest great ape adventure is a slight improvement over Peter Jackson's bloated 2005 remake of the '33 classic, it's a monster movie desperately in need of a decent plot. The special effects laden action sequences cannot fail to impress, but the story does not.The extremely basic screenplay takes a group of scientists and soldiers, has them embark on an expedition to the titular uncharted island, where they encounter Kong, who knocks them for six. The survivors must make their way to a rendezvous point on the North side of the island, avoiding being eaten by a variety of massive creatures or getting trodden on by the oversized simian. And that's about it. Kong battles a giant octopus, a massive crab/spider attacks the humans, vicious birds swoop out the sky, and nasty lizard creatures crawl from beneath the island's surface, all of which is mindlessly entertaining, but not in the least bit inspired.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for token eye candy Brie Larson, who strips to a figure hugging vest in an attempt to distract viewers from the lack of fresh ideas.",6,1,3,12 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The end. At last.
","Almost fifteen years ago, I was genuinely excited to see The Lord of the Rings brought to life by director Peter Jackson. Now, six Middle Earth films later, with countless hours spent watching extravagant CGI battles, sweeping shots of spectacular scenery and grandiose architecture, happy hobbits, angry orcs, athletic elves, dour dwarfs and wise old wizards, I couldn't be happier. That it's finally all over.With each successive Tolkien film, I could feel my enthusiasm growing steadily weaker and weaker. As the CGI became more and more elaborate, the action became more and more preposterous, so much so that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. Legolas repeatedly defying all the laws of physics became painful to watch. Although I should have loved The Hobbit movies, the book being my favourite work by Tolkien, I found the whole bloated experience frustratingly tiresome, with The Battle of the Five Armies being the most disappointing of all.Having already realised the majority of The Hobbit in the first two films, there really is very little story left for Jackson to tell, so he pads out this third chapter with pointless romance, internal conflict and even more CGI-heavy battles, all of which proves relentlessly dull if you've already seen the director's other five Middle Earth movies. Needless to say, I was more than pleased to see Bilbo arrive safely back at Bag End, just so that I could say a very final farewell.",4,10,19,15 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," At least Lucas ends the prequel trilogy on a (relatively) high note.
","Just like Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace before it, Revenge of the Sith, the last in George Lucas's Star Wars prequel trilogy, suffers from CGI visual overload, lots of preposterous action sequences and wooden acting from some of its stars.Despite all this, however, it's actually a very enjoyable affair—much better than I expected—wrapping up lots of loose ends in a satisfactory manner and in doing so delivering quite a few classic moments genuinely worthy of the franchise.Naturally Mr. Lucas cannot resist chucking digital trickery into every frame of the film, and his dialogue is as iffy as ever, but strike me down with a light-sabre and make me more powerful than you could ever imagine if he doesn't end the series on a high (for now, at least).Ian McDiarmid's Senator Palpatine becoming the Emperor; Anakin's turning to the dark side to try and save Padme's life; the order to turn the Clone army against the Jedis: all of this is so epic in scope that I find myself able to forgive the overblown effects, Hayden Christensen's terrible acting, and even a brief glimpse of Jar Jar Binks (OK, forgiving the presence of Jar Jar is never easy, but surely you get my gist!).",7,0,3,31 December 2010
Inception," The ultimate mind-f**k movie? Dream on.
","At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects—which are undeniably impressive—whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous.",5,12,23,4 April 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Nothing to write Holmes about.
","A life-long fan of Basil Rathbone's classic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, I had my reservations about Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of the character, particularly with Guy Ritchie directing (let's not forget that the man was responsible for turning Vinnie Jones into a movie star!).As expected, this 21st century reinvention of Conan Doyle's great detective bears very little resemblance to any previous movie incarnation, Downey Jr. playing the sleuth as a scruffy, smug, loutish, and reckless brawler, while sidekick Watson (Jude Law) is considerably smarter—and handier with his fists—than Nigel Bruce ever was.Seeing the usually dapper detective and the equally eminent doctor portrayed in such manner is hard to come to terms with, but wasn't a deal-breaker for me—I can appreciate a new spin on an old theme—but the asinine script and unnecessarily flashy direction sadly was. An illogical, plot-hole ridden piece of guff, the film is peppered with juvenile humour and heavily stylised action set-pieces in a desperate effort to try and detract from the many weaknesses and flaws in the narrative, which start with a highly implausible fake execution and become more and more strained as the movie progresses.As a piece of mindless popcorn nonsense, I guess this fares no worse than many a modern Hollywood blockbuster, but as a case for the finest crime-busting mind the world has ever known, it's far from brilliant.",5,1,2,17 December 2011
WALL·E," ILike
","Part cutesy kids story, part serious sci-fi tale, WallE is a love story with robots, an indictment of man's appalling treatment of Earth, and a warning to the human race about what may be waiting for us in the near future. It's also a very entertaining movie, and one of Pixar's finest to date.WallE is a small robot who is left on a trash-covered Earth as part of a clean-up team, whilst the human population takes a five year sojourn in space. The problem is that five years eventually becomes seven hundred years, Earth is still messy, and WallE is now alone (save for a cockroach who keeps him company).The little robot's lonely existence comes to an end, however, when a human spacecraft lands on Earth and drops off a high-tech probe to search for plant-life. The little metal guy falls for the shiny white machinenamed Eveand the two form a friendship. But when Eve discovers a small plant, she must obey her programming, and alert her masters of her discovery.When the ship returns to collect Eve and her precious find and return them to the Axiom, the huge holiday craft that is still cruising through space, WallE decides to hitch along for the ridean action that results in the ultimate human re-population of Earth.With almost no dialogue in its first half, Pixar's latest triumph begins like a silent movie: with narrative and character development achieved primarily through clever use of 'body' language. WallE, who is part ET and part Johnny 5, is wonderfully expressive, and director Andrew Stanton works miracles with his character, masterfully manipulating his audience into caring for the lump of rusty metal. Likewise, Eve, who is basically a white egg with blue eyes, is just as endearing thanks to the expertise of the Pixar animators and Stanton's faultless direction.The second half of the film is a wake up call to the human race, showing what will become of us if we become lazy and over-reliant on technology. It's also a pretty nifty action/adventure, with WallE braving space travel to find true love, and helping the overweight humans find their feet again and overthrow the power-mad computer who secretly controls the Axiom.Although it is perhaps occasionally too sophisticated for younger children, and some of the science could be picked apart by pedants, WallE is nevertheless a brilliantly crafted piece of entertainment which combines an enchanting tale with superb CGI, wonderful comedy and, most importantly, a real sense of fun.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,0,2,21 August 2008
The Cannonball Run," And I was SO sure that this was a good film.
","The Cannonball Run, an all-star caper about a bunch of ne'er-do-wells competing in a trans-American road race, is one of those films that I have had fond memories of ever since seeing it on its original release. So re-watching this film after many years was going to be a real treator at least I thought so. Isn't it funny how time affects your memory?Instead of the laugh-a-minute, stunt-packed classic that I recall enjoying immensely as a kid, I was shocked to find that the film is in fact a rather tedious, poorly directed, mostly laugh-free effort saddled with mundane action. Apart from some stunning cars, and a few stunning women, The Cannonball Run actually has little to recommend it.Not nearly exciting enough (the car stunts are limited to a few unremarkable jumps, skids and crashes), nor funny enough (the desperate non-PC humour making light of schizophrenia, drink driving, stammering, abduction, racial differences, the law, and drug and alcohol abuse), director Hal Needham's chaotic comedy rarely gets into gear, and repeatedly stalls when it does.With an improvised feel to every facet of the film, The Cannonball Run gives the impression that much of it was made on the fly. In fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that Needham got his cast, crew and cars together first, and worried about the finer details (like a script) once the shoot had begun. The director and his Hollywood pals probably had a blast making the film, and I would like to say that the sense of fun is infectious. But it isn't.To be fair, a few moments did manage to make me smileJackie Chan kicking biker ass, Adrienne Barbeau's cleavage, Jack Elam as a drunken proctologistbut the majority of the film left me massively disappointed.The Cannonball Run gets a star for the kung fu, one for the babes, one more for the freaky doctor, plus a bonus star purely for nostalgia's sake.

Parasite," A tad underwhelming.
","A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not.",7,5,22,25 January 2020
Centurion," Okay, Neil, you've had your fun—now get back to business
","A group of brave Roman soldiers trapped behind enemy lines are hunted by savage Picts.ORA group of brave Picts defend their homeland against savage Roman invaders.No matter who you side with, this historical adventure will provide 97 minutes of perfectly serviceable popcorn escapism, with impressively gruesome fight scenes, spectacular scenery, solid acting, and slick direction; the problem is, for longtime fans of Neil Marshall, a director who set the bar extremely high with his first two features, Dog Soldiers (2002) and The Descent (2005), serviceable just isn't good enough.It happened with Marshall's 2008 post-apocalyptic action flick Doomsday and it's happened again here: a larger budget has allowed the director to become over-indulgent and the film has become flabby around the edges as a result: there's a touch too much of the epic, sweeping camera-work; the dialogue is a little pompous at times; the violence relies too heavily on CGI; an unnecessary romantic subplot featuring Imogen Poots drags things down for a while. It's not terrible by any means, but neither is it the lean, mean movie that we know Marshall is capable of.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,2,5,24 April 2014
The Conjuring," This Wan lacks originality.
","James Wan has directed three of the biggest horror hits of the millennium thus far: Saw (2004), Insidious (2010) and The Conjuring (2013). Saw was a wholly original shocker, a twisty-turny torture pic well deserving of its success. Insidious breathed new life into the well-worn supernatural genre with its really freaky atmosphere and well-crafted scares. The appeal of the Conjuring, on the other hand, has me puzzled, the film being little more than a collection of generic clichés borrowed from countless other possession movies.Purportedly based on a true story from 1971, The Conjuring stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren, who are called to the home of the Perron family, who have been experiencing terrifying unexplainable occurrences since recently moving into the old house. A little research reveals that the property had once belonged to a witch named Bathsheba, who killed her child and hung herself, putting a curse on anyone who took her land. After lots of creepy phenomena - moving doors, ghostly apparitions, strange noises etc. - wife and mother of five girls, Carolyn Perron, is possessed by the witch and attempts to sacrifice her youngest daughter, at which point the film switches from a lame facsimile of The Amityville Horror/Poltergeist to an equally lame copy of The Exorcist, with the Warrens trying to cast out the evil spirit.Stopping just short of a 360-degree head spin, the film really does offer very little new to fans of the genre, even throwing in a creepy doll called Annabelle for good measure (Annabelle would go on to be the subject of a couple of spin-off movies). I guess if you're new to horror, and haven't seen a lot of similarly themed flicks, The Conjuring would seem like a pretty scary ride, but it left me distinctly unimpressed.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",5,1,3,28 January 2018
Scream," Post-modernism has never been so scary.
","It's easy to become prejudiced against Scream: after all, it's the film that launched the career of Kevin Williamson, who has since been responsible for pathetic teen soap Dawson's Creek and rubbish werewolf pic Cursed, plus it provided the inspiration for countless dreadful imitators and the godawful Scary Movie slasher spoofs.But the fact is, when judged purely on its own merits, Scream proves to be excellent entertainment—an extremely well written and expertly directed horror that brilliantly integrates witty, post-modernist self parody with genuinely effective scares.An awesome opening sees arguably the film's biggest star, Drew Barrymore, being terrorised and brutally murdered by a killer wearing a mask fashioned after the famous Edvard Munch painting The Scream, after which director Wes Craven quickly introduces his main cast: Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, a virginal teen traumatised by the murder of her slutty mother a year earlier; Johnny Depp-alike Skeet Ulrich as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis; nipple-icious Rose McGowan, crazy Matthew Lillard, and nerdy Jamie Kennedy as close pals Tatum, Stuart and Randy; Courteney Cox as ambitious TV newswoman Gail Weathers; and David Arquette as dorky police deputy 'Dewey' Riley.Having established his array of characters, Craven then proceeds to scare the pants off his audience with a series of well orchestrated murders, interspersed by thrilling/amusing scenes in which people almost get murdered and wax lyrical about the 'rules of horror'. There's not a whole lot of gore to speak of, but the tension is kept high, and there's always the 'in-jokes' to keep viewers happy between kills.Along the way, Craven cleverly interweaves several plot threads, offers several possible candidates as the killer, and shows once again why he is a true 'Master of Horror'.",9,0,1,24 October 2009
Prometheus," Maybe it'll make more sense in the extended director's cut.
","One of the most enduring and engaging aspects of the whole Alien series has been the speculation concerning the origin and evolution of the xenomorph, and the conjecture about whether the creature's existence is somehow linked to that of the human race. Ridley Scott's sci-fi prequel Prometheus sets out to answer some of these questions, while providing viewers with further questions on which to ponder until the inevitable arrival of Prometheus 2.Of course, inviting the audience to study every last detail of a film in search of answers is only a good idea if the script has been so carefully crafted that it can withstand such intense scrutiny, which is most definitely not the case with Prometheus: between them, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have somehow managed to cobble together a mess of ill-considered plot progression, moronic characterisation, and weak exposition that is a million light years away from the perfectly profound experience that was undoubtedly intended. In short, the script sucks.It's a good job then that director Ridley Scott has made his film such a magnificent feast for the eyes, the impeccable visuals being its one true saving grace. Such is the incredible quality of the CGI, the amazing spectacle of the action, the pure majesty of the scenery and the sheer inventiveness of the production design, that I actually found it within myself to cease dissecting Prometheus and simply enjoy it for the incredible over-blown spectacle that it is. F**-off big spaceships, impressive alien landscapes, an exploding 2000-year-old decapitated head, thrashing tentacled squid-like creatures, powerful mutants, and Noomi Rapace wrapped in skimpy bandage-like underwear: that'll just about do me until something resembling a well-thought out plot comes along.",6,2,7,15 October 2012
Halloween," Slashers just don't get any better than this.
","In 1978, director John Carpenter scared the bejeezuz out of audiences worldwide with possibly the finest slasher movie ever made: Halloween. On a very modest budget, he crafted a taut, terrifying and technically superb film that would change the face of horror movies forever.With its simple premise (pyscho escapes from an asylum and butchers some teens during Halloween), excellent cinematography (courtesy of Dean Cundey), a brilliantly atmospheric synthesizer score (also by Carpenter) and an extremely talented cast of (mostly) relative unknowns, Halloween is THE perfect scary movie experience.Having spent 15 years locked up in a mental institution (for killing his sister), Michael Myers breaks out and heads for sleepy Haddonfield, his home town. Hot on his trail is Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence), who is convinced that Myers is evil personified and must be stopped at all costs.Only stopping to pick up a creepy looking mask and some knives, Myers proceeds to slaughter a group of teenagers, eventually targeting the virginal Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is spending her Halloween night babysitting for some neighbours.After taking time to introduce viewers to characters that they can actually care about, Carpenter expertly builds the tension, carefully using light and shadow to maximum effect, until the brilliantly tense climax which sees Laurie discovering her dead friends, and then battling against the seemingly indestructible Myers.Myers - incredibly creepy in his white mask (actually a modified William Shatner mask) - is made even more menacing through his calm, emotionless approach to killing; at no point does he rush after his victims, preferring to take his time, as if content in the knowledge that they can never actually escape him, no matter how hard they try.The end of the film sees Loomis shooting Myers, who falls off a balcony onto a lawn; however, when Loomis looks for Myers, the body has gone.Surprisingly bloodless (but still shocking), brilliantly directed, and impossible to forget, Halloween is an absolutely unmissable horror classic.",10,3,9,3 May 2007
Wonder Woman," Proof that a woman can make a DC superhero movie just as mundane as any man.
","I was quite disappointed when I learnt that they hadn't cast Alexandra Daddario as Wonder Woman, but I'm over that now (not really, but I am slowly coming to terms with it). In lieu of Daddario, I guess Gal Gadot isn't a terrible alternative, but I doubt that the film would have been great whoever played the title role: the story, by Zack Snyder, is a by-the-numbers exercise in superhero banality, while director Patty Jenkins goes for CGI-laden style over substance, her film reliant on flashy overblown set-pieces in which our heroine proves totally impervious to harm, whether it be poison gas attack or being hit broadside by a flying tank. With Wonder Woman able to withstand any onslaught, the film is totally lacking in excitement.Having watched a handful of other DCU movies, including the recent over-rated effort that was Shazam!, I'm still waiting to be impressed. Casting David Thewlis as the villain definitely isn't the way to go...4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb - Mindless generic popcorn superhero nonsense. Not totally unwatchable (Gadot being easy on the eye), but definitely unexceptional.",5,2,7,26 April 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Everything you could ask for in a sequel to one of the best films of the '80s.
","Way back in '89, I took the back-lot tour around Universal Studios in LA, during which I spied several futuristic looking vehicles from the upcoming sequel to Back To The Future; to say I was excited would be an understatement. However, I was also a little nervous: after all, just how do you top a 10/10 classic like the 1985 original? The answer: you can't (11/10 doesn't make much sense, does it?)—but you can MATCH it in terms of entertainment value, which is precisely what director Robert Zemeckis and Co. succeed in doing.With many of the original movie's cast reprising their roles (sadly no Crispin Glover or Claudia Wells, but Elisabeth Shue as the replacement Jennifer is more than welcome in my books), awesome special effects from ILM (even today, the hover boards and flying cars look great), a wonderfully inventive plot that'll leave you scratching your head trying to figure out the paradoxical possibilities, and loads of clever visual jokes, Back To The Future Part II is brilliant stuff from start to finish—and that's not even taking into account the added unintentional fun that can be had from the inaccuracy of the film's predictions for the future (unless technology advances a lot in the next five years, I doubt we'll be seeing auto-drying jackets by 2015).",10,0,0,4 December 2010
Carrie," An unmissable 70s horror classic.
","Over the past few decades, almost everything ever written by Stephen King has been filmed for either TV or the silver screen; however, very few of these adaptations have come close to matching the extremely high standard set by Carrie, the first King novel to receive the movie treatment.Directed by Brian De Palma, this superb supernatural horror stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, a shy and awkward teenage girl who is mercilessly bullied at high-school and further tormented at home by her overbearing, religious zealot mother (Piper Laurie). To make matters worse, at the same time as Carrie experiences her first period (during the film's unforgettable opening shower sequence), she also discovers that she has developed telekinetic abilities that get more powerful but less controllable as she becomes increasingly distressed.When a group of spiteful classmates (led by the gorgeous Nancy Allen and a young John Travolta) implement a nasty plan to humiliate Carrie during prom night, the poor girl finally snaps and unleashes her full psychic wrath on the unsuspecting revellers.Determined to impress with his first major Hollywood movie, director De Palma pulls out all the stops to bring Lawrence D. Cohen's excellent screenplay to life, displaying a confident and flamboyant style full of the fluid, gliding camera movements and impressive visual trickery that would eventually become synonymous with his work; these stunning visuals, combined with a lush orchestral score by Pino Donaggio and faultless performances from an amazing cast go to make Carrie an unmissable experience.Spacek's central performance is astonishing: her touching portrayal of the vulnerable and withdrawn Carrie—always wary, yet aching for acceptance—is heartbreaking and anyone who has suffered the indignity of bullying will no doubt find the fiery prom night massacre a strangely cathartic experience. Also worthy of praise are Piper Laurie as Margaret White, who mistakenly believes that she is protecting her daughter, but is actually doing much more harm than good (although her motherly advice about skipping the prom was, for once, right on the money), William Katt as Carrie's well-meaning prom date Tommy Ross, and Amy Irving as repentant bully Sue Snell, who is unable to thwart her school-pals' cruel trick.Stylish, beautiful, tragic, shocking, and even occasionally humorous, Carrie is an absolute classic that deserves a place in every horror fan's DVD collection. 10/10.",10,2,3,16 April 2009
1408," Cusack checks in for a night of terror in this excellent Stephen King adaptation.
","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a writer who, after the death of his daughter, has given up on life. Separated from his wife, he squanders his talent writing guidebooks on America's most haunted hotels, despite being quite convinced that life after death is a fallacy.When Mike receives a postcard warning him not to stay in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, NY, he can't resist the challenge. He books the room, and, despite being repeatedly warned by the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to do so, he checks in for a night of unspeakable terror that drives him to the edge of sanity.Based on a story by Stephen King book, 1408 is a terrific thrill-ride that managed the almost impossible task of freaking me out. Cusack gives a bravura performance as the man forced to face his demons whilst trapped in the hotel room from hell. Carrying the film almost entirely on his own, he convincingly portrays a man who, faced with unspeakable horror, gradually loses his marbles and possibly his will to live.Even before Enslin enters 1408, director Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m ensures that the tension is made unbearable by having Jackson's character repeatedly warn the writer against the idea, telling him of the dreadful history of the room and the numerous people who have died there. By the time our protagonist steps across the threshold of the malevolent room, the audience is on tenterhooks, nervously awaiting the first inevitable sign of trouble.HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m then carefully cranks up the tension by having his character gradually realise that all is not as it should be in 1408. At first Enslin is his usual sceptical self when confronted with the unexplained: he suspects that someone in his room is playing tricks on him. As the terror escalates, however, Mike realises that he has made a grave mistake and tries to leave, but it is too late... room 1408 has a new victim.Mixing moments of absolute fear (Enslin's attempts at escaping the room are nail-biting exercises in tension) with pure shock horror (a couple of moments are guaranteed to have you leaving your seat), 1408 is a very effective movie. Only towards the end, when events spiral out of control and perhaps become a little too melodramatic, does the film lose some of its power, but this is a minor quibble and one that does little to spoil one's enjoyment of the film. Freaky, creepy and downright unnerving, this is one of the best King adaptations in a long time, and highly recommended viewing.",8,1,9,27 September 2007
Raging Bull," A hard-hitting biopic.
","Raging Bull is a raw and gritty look at the turbulent life of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, a rather reprehensible character whose paranoia and insensitivity drove away those he loved and ultimately left him on the skids and in trouble with the law. Even though it's far from what most would class as a fun film, it's still an unmissable slice of cinema, thanks to powerful performances from an excellent cast, and impeccable direction from Martin Scorsese, who handles both the drama and the brutal fight action with plenty of style.Robert De Niro is not only in tip-top physical form for his role as the world class boxer (at least until he flabs out for the final act), but is also at the top of his game as a thespian, the star fully flexing his acting muscles in a performance that runs the gamut of emotions and which deservedly won him an Oscar. Also making a big impression are Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, a loud-mouthed brawler with ties to the Mafia who is almost as obnoxious as his older sibling, and Cathy Moriarty, as Jake's long-suffering second wife Vickie.",9,4,7,9 December 2015
The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant stomps all over the competition.
","Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear.",10,4,7,2 February 2008
The Woman in Black," Harry Potter and the Ghostly Drivel.
","Because of the excellent job she did with Kick-Ass, I'd forgiven screenwriter Jane Goldman for the absolute drivel that was Stardust, but The Woman in Black has just put her in my bad books again, a more predictable, pedestrian, derivative and utterly boring ghost story it would be hard to envisage. Likewise, director James Watkins, who impressed me so with his superb debut Eden lake, hasn't exactly gone up in my estimations.For those who grew up with Radcliffe as Harry Potter—a demographic most likely still fairly unfamiliar with the horror genre—this might succeed in coming across as both original and scary, but trust me when I say that everything in The Woman In Black has been done many times before, and often much better. In particular, I was reminded of Ghost Story (1981) and Dark Water (2002), although the tricks employed by Watkins to scare his oblivious young viewers have been pilfered from numerous other films. As for the dumb ending.... always hold on to a young child's hand when on a station platform—it's as simple as that!The fact that this nonsense was filmed under the Hammer banner makes me want to cry.",2,9,14,23 September 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Not quite as baarilliant as ewe might have herd.
","Five times Oscar winner The Silence of the Lambs is a class act in many respects, but there are several factors—issues with the script that many fans seem to have happily chosen to ignore—which prevent me from finding the film such a wholly satisfying experience.With a little suspension of disbelief, I can accept that FBI boss Crawford (Scott Glenn) might believe that Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) could help in profiling serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), but what are the chances of him knowing the killer's actual identity? Pretty damn slim if you ask me—almost as unlikely as Crawford assigning a rookie agent like Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interrogate a manipulative psychopath in the first place!Swallow all that, and you'll probably have no problem with Lecter's escape, but I know I'm not alone in finding this pivotal scene far-fetched in the extreme. Even if I let the whole 'pen thing' slide (Hannibal's a master of sleight of hand and a whizz at picking locks–fair enough), I still struggle to believe that it is possible to fool an entire team of highly trained cops and medics by slipping a dead man's face over your own. Just ain't going to happen.And then there's the ending, which after all of the slow-burn psychological games between Lecter and Starling, suddenly goes into over-drive, glossing over details in a hurry to get to the typically tense Hollywood-style finale: all of a sudden, the FBI have Buffalo Bill's true identity, Clarice Starling has tracked the nut-job to his lair, and it's all on for an exciting climax inside the pitch black, labyrinthine basement where the psycho skins his victims.Thankfully, even with these frustratingly ill-considered moments taking the film down a peg or two in my opinion, Silence of the Lambs is still well worth a watch thanks to director Jonathan Demme's slick handling of the material, and career defining turns from several of his standout cast. Hopkins iconic performance as Lecter is mesmerising, the actor deeply menacing even behind a sheet of unbreakable glass or completely immobile, securely fastened to a trolley in his iconic face-mask; Foster is also memorable as Clarice, who unwisely allows Hannibal inside her mind to exploit her emotional fragility. But it is Ted Levine who steals the show: as sexually confused, mumbling maniac Buffalo Bill, whose goal is to make himself a suit from women's skin, Levine is absolutely superb, providing the film with many of its most memorable moments and delivering several of my favourite quotable lines of dialogue.All together now: 'It rubs the lotion on its skin...'",7,0,5,9 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," First class? Not quite...
","A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch).",7,1,2,31 May 2014
The Wolverine," An American Wolverine in Tokyo.
","The second of Wolverine's standalone movies, The Wolverine sees Logan (Hugh Jackman) travelling to Tokyo where dying businessman Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) would like to say goodbye to the man who saved his life during WWII. While in Japan, Logan becomes embroiled in a battle for control of Yashida's empire, and must protect the life of the businessman's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).The Wolverine is far from the best of the X-Men movies - the plot isn't strong enough to sustain the 126 minute runtime and is riddled with holes - but Jackman is always great, and any film with ninjas is cool in my book. The film also features one of the silliest action scenes of the franchise - a battle between Logan and the yakuza on the roof of a speeding Bullet train - which, despite its preposterousness, is still entertaining, AND it's got a fight against a giant adamantium samurai robot with a flaming sword, which must count for something.My advice: sit back, switch off your brain, and enjoy the spectacle, safe in the knowledge that the next Wolverine movie, Logan (2017), is reputedly much, much better.",5,2,2,31 March 2019
Iron Man," You'll believe an Iron Man can fly!
","In 1978, I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman and believed a man could fly (gimme a break... I was only 10); 1989, and The Rocketeer made me want to soar across the heavens (and, being 21, also get off with Jennifer Connelly). Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,0,3,7 October 2012
Creed II," It's a knockout!
","I've finally gone the distance with the Rocky franchise, watching Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V, Rocky Balboa, Creed and Creed II almost back-to-back. The fact that I have been able to do so without throwing in the towel is testament to the brilliance of the original format, to which the sequels remained fairly faithful: gritty drama, likeable characters, a lot of pathos, and stunning fight action, with a training montage or two along the way for good measure.Creed II doesn't break the mould, but it doesn't need to, because the formula still works, albeit with the focus now on Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), with Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) in the corner as his trainer. When Creed is pitted against Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed his father, Rocky refuses to train him for the match, considering his opponent to be too dangerous. Inevitably, Creed is beaten to a pulp by the angry Russian, only hanging on to his title by way of a disqualification, and his pride is hurt almost as badly as his body. As Creed soul searches and returns to health, he must also contend with becoming a new father, his baby girl born with a hearing defect.Knowing that he will never be happy until he has stepped out of his father's shadow and created his own legacy, Creed agrees to a rematch with Drago, this time with Rocky as his trainer (the Italian Stallion regretting that he wasn't there for the first fight).Packing an emotional wallop as well as many physical ones, Creed II is a belter of a film, with plenty of heart-warming drama leading up to the inevitable showdown set in Moscow, where the titular character finally gets to prove to himself that he more than just his father's son. It's engrossing stuff from start to finish thanks to excellent performances and sharp direction from Steven Caple Jr., but it is the titanic battle between Adonis and Viktor that seals the deal: it's hard hitting, bloody, and superbly choreographed, with stunning cinematography and that awesome 'spaghetti western' score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Then comes the moment that the iconic Rocky theme music kicks and Adonis belts seven shades of the proverbial out of Viktor, and the crowd goes wild! Predictable, perhaps, but still a winner.",8,1,3,8 September 2019
Monsters University," MU is more than OK.
","The cruddy trailer hardly filled me with hope for this belated prequel to Monsters, Inc., and the relatively laugh-free first thirty minutes did little to change my mind; however, once Mike and Sully and their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers enter the Scare Games, the film really picks up and the laughs start to come thick and fast. By the time the end credits were rolling, Monsters University had given me lots of giggles and even a few genuine belly laughs and I'd completely altered my opinion: the oft-used 'under-dogs do good' plot may not be as fresh as the original, but overall I reckon the film is well worth watching.Some of the best moments are clever one-liners and subtle fleeting visual gags which could go unseen, or over the head of younger viewers, but that gives the film repeat value; I hope to catch even more funny stuff the second time around after I proudly add the DVD to my Pixar collection.A very respectable 8/10 (If there had been more funny moments in the first half-an-hour or so, this would have been right up there with Pixar's finest).",8,13,13,2 November 2013
Ben-Hur," It doesn't get much more epic than this.
","A perennial Xmas favourite on TV during my childhood, spectacular biblical epic Ben-Hur opens with the birth of Jesus: manger, star, wise men, shepherds... the whole nine yards. Those TV programmers knew what they were doing.The film then scoots to XXVI A.D.-Jesus is now a grown man doing God's work; meanwhile, Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (played by distinctly non-Jewish blue-eyed hunk Charlton Heston) is reunited with his Roman childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who has just been appointed tribune of Judea. Messala, desperate to keep the Jews under control, asks Judah to help him quell any potential rebellion, but his friend refuses to betray his people. As a result, the pair part as enemies.This animosity proves problematic for Judah when his sister accidentally knocks a roof tile onto the Roman governor as he arrives in town. Seizing an opportunity to make an example of the influential Hur family, Messala sends Judah's mother and sister to jail, and has Judah thrown into slavery as a rower on the Roman galleys. After several years of 'battle speed', 'attack speed', ramming speed' and 'warp speed', Judah earns his freedom by saving the life of a Roman consul during a sea battle. Returning home, Judah searches for his mother and sister, seeks revenge on Messala, and has a profound encounter with Jesus of Nazareth.In the wrong hands, Ben-Hur could have been an epic bore, but director William Wyler proves himself more than worthy of the task, commanding great dramatic performances from his superb cast, and mounting some stunning action scenes, the highlight being the film's iconic chariot race, a breathtaking piece of cinema that still holds up as one of the most exciting sequences ever committed to film. Every last cent of the massive $15,900,000 budget is up there on the screen, with impressive sets, excellent production design and a cast of thousands. Miklós Rózsa's wonderful score complements the action perfectly, the deserved winner of one of the film's eleven Oscars.Sadly, Ben-Hur no longer pops up on TV every Christmas, meaning that it's probably not found much of a new audience in recent years-a shame, because it really is worthy of any film fan's time-all three and a half hours of it!",9,4,6,2 April 2018
Casino Royale," Bond is back! Better luck next time.
","After the lamentable Die Another Day, a rethink for the Bond franchise was definitely in order. The new approach: a tougher, more brutal 007 with the plot emphasis on realism rather than far-fetched tales of world-domination, super villains, and silly gadgets. The last time the production team behind the world's favourite spy tried this, they gave us License to Killa film I personally loved, but critics seemed to hate. However, this time around, I seem to be the odd one out: critics raved about Daniel Craig's debut outing as James, whereas I struggled with the film, finding it poorly scripted and directed, and way too long.Set at the beginning of Bond's career, Casino Royale sees the top spy first earning his 007 status (by killing two people) and then, after chasing down a bomb-maker, taking on bad guy Le Chiffre, banker to international terrorists. When Le Chiffre loses his investors' cash after a failed attack on an airliner, he attempts to win it back in a poker game at the titular Casino Royale. Bond, no slouch at the game himself, tries to make sure that this doesn't happen.So why don't I like this film as much as previous outings for Bond, and who do I hold responsible? Well, I don't blame Daniel Craig: he looks the part and plays the charismatic spy very well, bringing a tough edge to the role which was sorely lacking with Pierce Brosnan.I guess that the blame must be apportioned to scriptwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, and director Martin Campbell. The convoluted plot has loads of moments which stretch plausibility beyond breaking point, and Campbell's muddled handling of the movie makes following proceedings very difficult.The first surefire indicator that something was up were the opening credits, which were devoid of the usual magnificent hypnotic blend of girls and guns; instead we get some crap CGI graphics.The next iffy moment sees Bond pursuing a foe through a building site, with both men navigating the terrain with superhuman agility. As if they're playing some crazy full-sized platform game, they jump up and down and across all manner of obstacles with complete disregard for their own safety. Whilst this all looks very impressive, it is very hard to swallow. That's the sense of realism blown right there!And the film's tense non-action 'highlight', Bond's card game with his arch enemy, is plain boring. Will Bond win or will he lose his £15million? Will I stay awake to find out? After much tedious card-play, Le Chiffre outwits Bond at poker in a move I saw coming a mile away, but, when Bond's luck changes, poisons our hero in a fit of bad sportsmanship (it's a good job Bond's new car is fitted with a selection of antidotes and a defibrillator!!).Then, after an admittedly nasty torture scene in which James gets his knackers bashed, the film completely stalls with some lovey-dovey tripe which nearly sees our agent hang up his Walther PPK forever. A last ditch attempt to revive the audience sees James in one final gunfight in a sinking building in Venicea case of too little, too late.As an action film, I guess Casino Royale is OK; as a Bond film, it's mediocre at best.",5,6,10,12 April 2007
The Deer Hunter," A bloated bore.
","Three friends, Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), and Nick Chebotarevich (Christopher Walken), find their lives affected in different ways by the horrors of war.50 minutes, give or take a few: that's how long the opening wedding sequence takes in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. It starts with the preparation, followed by the ceremony itself, and finishes at the reception where there is much drinking and dancing. It's about as much fun as being at a real wedding where you know none of the guests (other than your partner) and are forced to remain sober because you're the one doing the driving home. You want it all to end as soon as possible, but your other half insists on just one more drink (and another, and another) while she chats with all of her friends.Having bored the viewer to death with the wedding, Cimino then proceeds to numb the senses further with some dreary hunting scenes in the mountains, after which the film finally cuts to Nam for a little war action. Here we are treated to the infamous Russian roulette torture sequence, which is arguably the highlight of the film, both suspenseful and terrifying. But don't worry, we're soon back to the drudgery as the main characters escape capture, Mike returning to his steelworks hometown, Nick remaining in Saigon (to earn cash by taking part in Russian roulette games in seedy gambling dens), and Steven recuperating in a veterans hospital. Eventually, Mike decides to find Nicky and bring him home, which he doesâ€”with a bullet in his head, his luck having finally run out.Winner in 5 categories at the 1979 Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Film Editing (seriously?), and Best Sound. Superman The Movie might have only won one Academy Award that same year, for Visual Effects, but I'd rather watch a man fly than hunt deer any day of the week.",3,10,18,15 June 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Hmmm.
","I'm usually quite decisive when it comes to rating films, but Jojo Rabbit has me in a bit of a quandry. I enjoyed the touching storyline of 10-year-old 'Hitler youth' Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) befriending Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl he finds hiding in his home. And I enjoyed the general irreverent tone and quirky satire. But I didn't laugh. Not once. And since I believe this is intended to be a comedy, I can't say that it is a complete success. A rating of 5 feels a little unfair, since the film is an undeniably unique and visually impressive experience, but at the same time it seems like a reasonable score for something that has left me feeling unsatisfied as a whole.I definitely wish that Roman Griffin Davis and Archie Yates (who plays Jojo's friend Yorki) hadn't filmed an introduction for the preview I attended: it made it harder to accept them as their characters, which, to be honest, wasn't that easy in the first place because neither is particularly convincing. The adults are far better, with Stephen Merchant as a nasty Gestapo officer Deertz almost making me smile, and Sam Rockwell shining as Captain Klenzendorf, a disillusioned soldier who isn't as bad as he first seems. Director Taika Waititi mercilessly mocks Adolf Hitler, who appears to Jojo as an imaginary friend - he's fun (but not funny). Scarlett Johansson is extremely likeable as Jojo's loving mother, and even Rebel Wilson, who I normally can't stand, was bearable as cruel Nazi Fraulein Rahm.5/10. I might like it more on a second viewing. Then again, I might dislike it more.",5,74,159,17 December 2019
Beowulf," The Old English epic in motion-capture CGI form.
","I try to steer clear of motion-capture CGI that attempts to border on realism: I either want my films to be live-action footage or clearly animated. I find the awkward middle ground just a little unsettling. That said, with such a cracking tale (the original poem is a thousand years old—stories don't endure for that long if they're crap), superior acting from a solid cast, and masterful storytelling by director Robert Zemeckis, I'm willing to make an exception in this case.Zemeckis's film does deviate from the original story a tad, which might upset the literature purists, but since the average cinema-goer probably has as much in-depth knowledge of the Beowulf legend as I have of the inner workings of the Hadron Collider, I can allow a little artistic license. With such an epic narrative, enjoyable action scenes, cool monsters, a naked digital Angelina Jolie, and a CG rendering of the main character's ass for those who like that sort of thing (thankfully Beowulf looks nothing like Ray Winstone), there surely is something for everyone.",7,1,2,16 November 2016
Speed," All aboard for extremely dumb action.
","Pop quiz: you're a cinematographer given the chance to direct a high-concept action flick. What do you do? What do you do?Well, if you're Jan De Bont, you make a movie that is so action-packed that most people seem to be extremely forgiving about the film's sheer preposterousness. Your star is wooden and your bad guy is hammy, but there are more than enough explosions and stunts to keep the popcorn munchers happy, and the movie is a massive success.I was never much of a popcorn fan, and I never really understood why this film wasn't lambasted like its sequel. After an admittedly well-handled opening scene set in an elevator armed with a bomb, the film completely dispenses with logic (and the laws of physics), the silly script taking way too many liberties for my liking. Having had his elevator bomb plot foiled by young police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and bomb disposal expert Harry (Jeff Daniels), crazy ex-cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) tries to hold the city to ransom once again by placing an explosive device on a bus which will detonate should the speed go below fifty miles per hour (despite the bus looking like it's going about thirty in most scenes). Boarding the bus, Jack tries to find a way to save the passengers' lives while pretty commuter Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel (the driver having been shot).Payne's plan is poorly thought out: had the driver dipped below fifty before Jack had been able to board the bus, the bomb would have gone off, leaving the extortionist with no chance of collecting his cash. Luckily for him, this doesn't happen, but this isn't the film's only dodgy plot point: there's the ridiculous gravity-defying leap across a fifty foot gap in an unfinished stretch of freeway; getting the driver off the bus is a perilous affair, but Jack casually hops off later without a hitch; bomb expert Harry and his highly trained team enter Payne's home without even considering that it might be booby-trapped; and in a very silly finale, Jack speeds up a subway train when he could have simply slowed it down.I've yet to see the sequel but surely it can't be any more inane than this one.",4,0,1,26 July 2019
Live Free or Die Hard," It's a bird... it's a plane.... no, it's John McClane!!!
","About 40 minutes into Live Free or Die Hard (the fourth film in the popular Die Hard series), Bruce Willis stops playing tough cop John McClane and becomes his indestructible character from M. Night Shyalaman's Unbreakable. It's the only answer that makes sense.How else could he jump from a speeding car onto blacktop and live to tell the tale? Or fall several stories out of a window, only to get up, dust himself off and continue fighting? Or crash a vehicle through solid walls and into a lift shaft without killing himself? Or leap from a wrecked juggernaut, onto the tail of a soon-to-explode jet plane, and then onto a collapsed freeway (I'm not making this uphonest!) without being reduced to a red smear? In the first Die Hard, McClane was vulnerable; in this one, he wouldn't look out of place wearing a fancy spandex costume with a fluttering cape.Part 4 sees our grizzled hero back in action after he is sent to pick up Matthew Farrell, a computer hacker who is suspected of being involved with a high-tech terrorist organisation (who are attempting to shut down the U.S.A. in order to get their grubby paws on it's entire wealth). However, it transpires that the young geek was duped into helping the bad-guys and is now surplus to requirements; the villains try to kill the net-nerd (I know, I know... look who's talking!) to cover their tracks, but they don't count on the hero of the Nakatomi Tower incident being on bodyguard duty.McClane rescues Matthew (after engaging in an exciting shootout with some nameless henchmen, who all dienatch!) and takes off in his car, with a helicopter full of gun-toting baddies in hot pursuit. Eventually, trapped in a tunnel, having narrowly escaped death in a multiple pile-up, John McClane makes his transformation into a superhero. Now, impervious to damage, he gets in his car, hurtles at high speed down the tunnel and launches the vehicle into the waiting helicopter, leaping to safety at the last moment.And so it continues, with each successive action set-piece more ridiculous than the one before, until the aforementioned freeway/fighter jet scene which takes my award for daftest cinematic moment of this millennium.Unfortunately, the silliness doesn't stop with the action scenes... the characters that populate this film are equally ill-conceived: Luscious Maggie Q plays Mai Lihn, a kung fu fighting villainess who is almost as indestructible as Willis''s cop; Long's cyber-dork is one of those people that only seem to exist in modern day action/thrillersa twenty something with the ability to outsmart the government's top computer operatives; tasty Mary Elizabeth Winstead is John's ballsy daughter Lucy, who goes from hating her dad to loving him (when he rescues her from danger); and Timothy Olyphant is the supreme bad-guy, a miffed ex-government computer boffin who (inexplicably) manages to gather together a team of henchmen willing to do his bidding, whatever the risks.Live Free or Die Hard is glossy, popcorn entertainment for those who don't worry too much about logic. It's entertaining fluff that is technically flawless, easy to follow and reasonably exciting, and, for many, that will be enough. But for those who, nearly twenty years ago, thrilled at the sight of a vest-wearing Willis dangling over the edge of a skyscraper, it can only be something of a disappointment.",6,27,53,21 September 2007
X2: X-Men United," Have you tried not being a mutant?
","Brian Cox plays mutant-phobe William Stryker who plans on eliminating all of the world's genetic aberrations with the unwilling help of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his amazing Cerebro machine. In order to defeat Stryker, the X-Men must team up with the villainous Magneto (Ian McKellen)—but can they really trust him? (answer: of course not!).I've got to hand it to director Bryan Singer: even though X-Men 2 was apparently intended as an allegory for the gay community's struggle for acceptance, there's nothing limp-wristed about its execution, the film more than delivering in the thrills department. Upping the ante in terms of jaw-dropping action set-pieces, but not at the expense of an intelligent, well-written script, this super sequel manages to be both bigger and better than the first, a hugely entertaining box-office belter from start to finish.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the sexy trio of Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn.",9,1,2,28 March 2014
Lucy," Lucy: beauty AND brains!
","The average human purportedly only uses 10% of their brain; watching Luc Besson's Lucy will only require 1% (if that), despite the director steering his film into pretentious metaphysical territory during his 2001: A Space Oddity-inspired finalé.Scarlett Johansson is Besson's eponymous protagonist, who taps into the full power of her mind after accidentally overdosing on a new narcotic. As the drug courses through her body, the young woman becomes more and more powerful, absorbing vast amounts of knowledge and cerebrally controlling her surroundings, before eventually becoming an omnipresent super-being. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), an expert in the human mind, can only look on in wonder.While the film pretends to say something profound about the existence of man, what it is really about is packing in as many flashy special effects as possible, crashing a load of cars, emptying loads of guns, and briefly showing Johansson in her bra (which is almost worth the price of entry on its own). It's all very flashy, and, despite its pseudo-loftiness, very trashy—a film to watch when you want to give your brain the night off.",5,2,3,18 August 2016
Midway," You sunk my battleship!
","Midway is not just the name of the place where a historic WWII sea battle took place between the Americans and the Japanese, it's also the point in this film where I realised I didn't know what was going on. Director Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, 2012) is obviously no slouch when it comes to action scenes, bringing us some truly astonishing battle sequences that provide much bang for your buck, but he struggles to tell his complex historical story with any coherence.As the movie cuts back and forth between the American and Japanese forces, with numerous ships, locations, characters, and much detailed wartime strategy to take in, it's easy to lose track of what's what and, more importantly, who is who, making it hard to feel anything when they meet their inevitable fate in a ball of flames and twisted metal (the most emotional part of the whole film comes right at the end when photos with captions show the real-life people who were instrumental in the battle).Of course, those who are watching, not for a history lesson or for heart-rending pathos, but for thrilling scenes of destruction and derring-do, are more than catered for with countless huge explosions, plenty of machine-gun fire and loads of impressive aerial combat. While most of this is realised through the use of CGI, it's well-handled and, for the most part, very convincing.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6,7,13,8 November 2019
The Sixth Sense," M. Night's masterpiece.
","Watching The Sixth Sense for the first time is a seriously creepy experience topped off with one hell of a clever twist. Subsequent viewings might lack the same level of spookiness, and prior knowledge of the ending robs the film of its novelty factor, but hindsight still makes for a very interesting watch: knowing the twist means that the viewer sees the film from a different viewpoint, paying particular attention to the details, thereby driving home what a superb film this is, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan clearly having gone to great pains to ensure that all possible plot-holes can be satisfactorily explained.Bruce Willis, taking a break from his usual tough-guy action roles, is excellent as child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, but the star's thunder is stolen by 11-year old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the child who can see dead people, who puts in an amazingly assured and thoroughly believable performance for one so young. Also making an impression are Toni Collette as Cole's concerned mother Lynn and Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe, Malcolm's wife.Sadly, M. Night Shyamalan has earnt himself a pretty rotten reputation as a film-maker in recent years thanks to succession of box-office flops, but don't let that put you off checking out this wonderful film.",10,0,0,16 September 2013
The Producers," Overrated and overacted.
","Theatrical producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), assisted by timid accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), deliberately oversell shares for Springtime for Hitler, a show that they have no intention of making a success. Unfortunately for Bialystock and Bloom, the musical is a massive hit, meaning that they now owe the financiers 25,000% of the profits.A lot of people seem to revere director Mel Brooks as some kind of comedy genius, but on the basis of what I have seen (Young Frankenstein, The History of the World: Pt I, and now this) I have to disagree. Yes, he has his moments, but the films as a whole are more miss than hit. The plot for The Producers is ingenious enough, but the whole affair has a theatricality that makes it seem more suited to the stage than screen, while the gags are extremely laboured, the performers overcompensating for the lack of genuine laughs by wildly overacting.I admit to giggling at Dick Shawn singing his hippy rock song Love Power, the extravagant Springtime for Hitler musical number is fun, and Lee Meredith is a delight as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla, but once again, I find Brooks' work to be highly overrated.",5,3,5,11 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Episode VIII had better be fantastic.
","A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.",6,38,61,24 December 2015
RED," Old, but not past it.
","Retired CIA black-ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) seeks help from his old colleagues when he finds himself the target of a hit team.There's a scene in RED (which stands for Retired: Extremely Dangerous) where John Malkovich's character fires a single bullet at a rocket propelled grenade heading his way; the two projectiles hit each other, the resulting explosion killing the woman who fired the RPG. It's that kind of film.If you can accept the ridiculousness of the action in this all-star geriatric espionage caper, then there's a reasonable amount of fun to be had despite a rather unexceptional and instantly forgettable plot (apparently based on a DC graphic novel). With such names as Helen Mirren, Bruce Willis, Richard Dreyfuss, Karl Urban, Ernest Borgnine, Malkovich and Morgan Freeman on board for the ride, and a hefty dose of the aforementioned OTT violence, the film is never boring, even with a slightly overlong running time of 111 minutes.At the end of the day, RED features Willis and Urban in a fist fight to Aerosmith's Back in the Saddle, and Mirren firing a large-caliber machine gun, and sometimes that is all you need for an entertaining time.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,0,0,20 January 2018
Final Destination," Nothing is certain but death and sequels.
","Final Destination sees a group of students narrowly avoid being blown to smithereens in an airplane disaster after one of their number, Alex (Devon Sawa), witnesses the catastrophe in a vision minutes before it actually happens. Miffed at being cheated, Death decides to have another pop at each of the survivors, claiming them in the order they would have died in the midair explosion.This simple yet ingenious concept allows director James Wong to deliver a series of intricately designed and wonderfully imaginative death set-pieces that make this film one of the most genuinely entertaining and original horrors of the decade; not since The Omen films has violent death been so imaginatively planned and so much fun to watch unfold.As each victim reaches the top of Death's hit list, seemingly insignificant incidents cause a snowball effect that ultimately results in a horrific demise: a leaky toilet pipe winds up causing a guy to choke to death in his bathtub; a tiny crack in a mug kick-starts a chain of events that climaxes in a huge explosion; and a train hurtling past a piece of debris makes another poor schmuck lose his head (although not completely—just from the lower jaw upwards!).In an exciting finalé, Alex attempts to end the terror by trying to cheat death once again, only to realise that he has got the order all wrong, and it is pretty social outcast Clear (the lovely Ali Larter from Heroes) who is next up for the chop...With spectacularly gory deaths, a very likable and talented young cast, a dark sense of humour, a cool cameo from Tony 'Candyman' Todd, and a totally unique killer, Final Destination goes to prove that not all big budget, major-studio, teen-orientated horror is totally worthless garbage.",8,1,2,11 December 2009
Rear Window," I'd be breaking out the binoculars too, if Miss Torso lived opposite me.
","Psycho is definitely Hitchcock's most shocking film, thanks to its infamous shower scene and gruesome finale, but as far as pure suspense goes, it doesn't get much better than Rear Window, which sees the director wringing every possible ounce of tension from his ingenious premise: a professional photographer, confined to his room with a broken leg, wiles away the hours observing the lives of the people with whom he shares a courtyard; when he notices one of his neighbours acting in a very suspicious manner, he comes to believe that the man has murdered his wife.James Stewart plays L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, the poor guy confined to a wheelchair who notices unusual goings on in the apartment opposite; Grace Kelly is his adoring but seemingly incompatible socialite girlfriend Lisa; Wendell Corey is disbelieving detective Lt. Thomas J. Doyle; Thelma Ritter is L.B.'s advice-giving nurse; and Raymond Burr is the surly and burly salesman with the missing wife. This excellent central cast is supported by a raft of brilliantly developed incidental characters without whom the director's main theme of voyeurism would be worthless: L.B.'s spying is ultimately justified by the fact that he solves a crime, but by having his protagonist also invade the privacy of many other individuals, Hitchcock is questioning the ethics of 'innocently' snooping on strangers.And the director makes us, his audience, feel just as culpable: not only do we join L.B. in his dubious hobby of peeping through the window, but as the viewer of the film, we are made to feel doubly guilty, for we are also poking our noses into the troubled relationship between L.B and Lisa.In addition to all of this interesting investigation of the human psyche, we also get a damn good thriller to boot, one which sees Hitchcock at his very best, weaving a taut tale that delivers the mundane and the macabre in equal doses, but which builds inexorably to a hugely exciting climax. There are several excellent edge-of-the-seat nail-biters on the way to the final showdown between L.B. and the killer that sees the photographer fighting for his life as he is slowly pushed out of a window several stories up—it's a guaranteed heart in mouth moment if ever there was one.After all of this intense action, Hitchcock rounds off the film with a superb ending that lightens the mood perfectly whilst clearly displaying the director's somewhat warped sense of humour: there's a happy ending for all of the people who have had their privacy invaded, Lisa has successfully convinced her man that she can be as adventurous as he is, but poor old L.B is still stuck in the same boat—he's in a wheelchair, and now he has two broken legs!!!",10,0,3,31 May 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Superelf to the rescue...
","I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot. And it isn't.Oh well, fingers crossed for The Hobbit...",8,1,2,2 November 2010
The Purge," Well I liked it
","America—the near future: the annual 'Purge'—a 12-hour period where all crime is legalised—turns into a nightmare for a wealthy family who had hoped to spend the time in the safety of their heavily fortified home.The Purge has been the victim of a lot of negativity, but I found it to be a well-executed thriller with a satirical edge that deliberately adopts a far-fetched premise in order to take a pop at the USA's culture of violence, its undercurrent of racism and a legal system that favours the rich.I imagine that much of the hate comes from Americans who simply don't like the messages the film so effectively illustrates—an understandable reaction, perhaps, but sometimes its good to take a long hard look in the mirror, and if you don't like what you see, do something to make a change.On a more shallow note, the action was suitably hard-hitting, with the snooker room fight being particularly bad-ass, and both Lena Headey and Zoey Sandin are total babes.",8,60,113,16 October 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Introducing Mr. Krueger...
","After years of tepid stalk 'n' slash films, Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street gave the horror genre a much needed shot in the arm with an altogether different kind of scary monster: Fred Kruegera dead child killer who is able to attack and kill people in their dreams.Unfortunately, the victim of a bad case of sequilitis, A Nightmare on Elm Street was also responsible for spawning that staple of the 80s and 90s chillerthe bad guy that makes bad puns whilst slicing up his victims. With each subsequent chapter in the franchise, the mystery behind Fred was stripped away, and he became less and less a figure of fear, and more of a wise-cracking pop culture icon to be loved and not loathed.Is it still even possible to watch the original movie and put this image out of one's mind? After many years of not having seen Wes's 1984 'classic' I decided to sit down and revisit Elm Street to find out.Craven's film starts with a credits sequence in which an unseen person crafts a pair of wicked looking razor-fingered gloves (all the better for slicing up teens with). We are then plunged into the first nightmare of the movie, as experienced by terrified teen Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss): the poor girl is stalked by a hideously scarred man wearing the lethal gloves. This, of course, is Fred Krueger (Robert Englund), back from the dead to slaughter the children of those that took the law into their own hands years earlier, and sentenced him to death by fire.It seems that Tina is not the only one suffering from night-time visits from Fred: most of the other teens on Elm Street have been seeing him in their dreams too. And when the kids start dying in mysterious circumstances, it is up to plucky Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), daughter of local policeman Lt. Thompson (John Saxon), to stand up to kiddie-killer Krueger.Whilst not perhaps deserving of its almost legendary status, A Nightmare On Elm Street is still, for the most part, a solid, fun and innovative movie which is well worth a watch. Craven makes good use of the whole dream idea, delivering some suitably nightmarish visuals accompanied by unnervingly creepy sound effects (most notably, the sound of Fred's 'fingers' scraping on metal). I can't say that I found the film particularly scary, but am willing to accept that this is probably due to my over familiarity with the whole Elm Street franchise.Craven builds the tension well, and the likable cast (including a young Johnny Depp) give reasonable performances, making the silly premise seem almost believable. And when the story threatens to drag, the savvy director has the good sense to pop in some creative and very bloody death sequences in order to regain the interest of the viewer.In fact, the film is pretty good up until the final showdown between Nancy and Fred, when Craven's script becomes a bit of a nonsensical mess, with our heroine dragging the killer into reality and luring him into several rather hastily set-up booby-traps. It is here that the film falters badly, with Nancy defeating Fred in a decidedly lame fashion (by ignoring him!). And then to make matters worse, the film finishes with a 'twist' ending which will leave you questioning what the hell just happened.If you are totally unfamiliar with the Elm Street series (which is unlikely, I know), then it is advisable to watch this one first to get the most from the film. As for the rest of us, don't watch this expecting to experience absolute terrorit won't happen. Instead, sit back and enjoy one of the most influential horrors of the past few decades safe in the knowledge that, with the exception of maybe two of the sequels (Pts 3 and 7), they got a whole lot worse.",7,0,2,28 April 2007
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Takes some swallowing.
","Nasty President Snow (Donald Sutherland) isn't very happy with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), joint winners of the 74th Hunger Games, whose behaviour has promoted rebellion in the districts, so he fiddles the rules to get them back into the arena where he hopes that this time they won't make it out alive.Admittedly, I'm probably one of the few people to watch this film without reading the book first, but I hold the firm belief that any film should stand on its own merits without the need to 'gen up' on the story and characters beforehand. Sadly, unless the viewer is already familiar with the material, I reckon there's a good chance they'll be asking quite a few questions along the way.Nearly two-and-a-half hours should easily be enough time to satisfactorily explain matters, but certain aspects of the plot still left me puzzled (not that I'm advocating an even longer cut of the film to make things clearer—147 minutes was more than enough for me!). Despite help from both my wife and daughter (who HAVE read the books), I was frequently left scratching my head in bewilderment: If Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wanted to keep Katniss alive, why did he risk killing her with poison gas, mutated apes and a rapidly rotating island, all of which almost finish her off? With flash floods and poison gas attacks, wouldn't there be the possibility of every tribute dying at the same time? Why do the tributes bother forming alliances when they will have to kill each other sooner or later? Was Beetee's plan to destroy a mile-high dome by hitting it with a spear connected to a lightning conductor tree by a copper cable? Was it? Really?Just as I was busy trying to figure out the answers to these awkward questions (and others), the bloody film just stopped. Right in the middle of things. While I appreciate that the middle chapter in a trilogy has to end somewhere, they could have picked a better",4,6,11,26 May 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Still excellent after all of these years.
","I had some reservations about showing Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure to my kids and their friends, not because of the content, which barring a rude subtitle is strictly PG, but because I feared that it might have dated really badly (I hadn't seen it for many years and I didn't want my kids laughing for all the wrong reasons). I needn't have worried: although the film is unmistakably a product of the late 80s, with some truly heinous fashion choices on display (Alex Winter's cropped top is most egregious!), its unprecedented sense of fun and silliness ensured that everyone had a most triumphant time.Bill & Ted, as played by Alex Winter (from The Lost Boys) and a young Keanu Reeves, are a pair of likable dolts from San Dimas who are destined to become the saviours of humanity, but only if they pass their imminent oral history report with flying colours. To help ensure their success, the pair are provided with a time-travelling phone-booth by cool-dude-from-the-future Rufus (George Carlin). This set up allows for loads of bodacious time-travel chaos, with the duo bouncing through the ages, collecting famous historical figures along the way.Obviously, this all sounds extremely daft, and many might quickly dismiss it as worthless, brainless nonsense, but the script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon is surprisingly astute, with lots of ingenious parodoxical moments to boggle the mind, plenty of clever historical jokes (I love Bill and Ted materialising in front of Joan of Arc like a vision), and even a totally cool message: be excellent to each other (and party on dudes!). All this plus Genghis Khan (played by everyone's favourite mustachioed character actor Al Leong) cleaning a toilet, Napolean experiencing the joy of water flumes, the lovely Diane Franklin as an English princess babe, and some early classic examples of Reeves' trademark 'Whoa!'. What else can I say but 'Excellent!'.",9,0,0,22 July 2012
The Matrix," Whoa!
","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.What a shame they had to go and make those sequels!",10,2,6,14 November 2009
Godzilla," Godawful.
","Godzilla (Gojira) wakes from his slumber to do battle with two over-sized insect-like monsters that have been causing trouble in Japan, and which are now headed for San Francisco.I think it's safe to say that I am in the minority for liking Roland Emmerich's Godzilla (1998), but dammit, I find it entertaining despite all of its silliness. In contrast, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is one hell of a bore for most of its running time, with way to much of the two hours plus spent on dull drama, and the action scenes, when they happen, simply too dark to be enjoyable. This is probably the reason why this year's Kong: Skull Island was so devoid of a plot, comprising of endless action set-pieces occurring in broad daylight: the makers were trying extra hard to ensure that it came nowhere near to the abject dreariness of Edward's film.When giant radioactive lizard and mighty ape finally meet up in Godzilla vs. Kong (scheduled for 2020), I sure hope that they take extra special care to get the balance of plot and action right: I don't think I can handle another monster-sized disappointment.",3,1,3,18 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I get all choked up just thinking about it.
","There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).",10,9,13,25 February 2007
What We Do in the Shadows," Destined for cult status.
","What We Do In The Shadows, a horror 'mockumentary' that follows a group of vampire flatmates in New Zealand as they go about their night-to-night activities, both ghoulish and mundane, does for vampires what Spinal Tap did for Heavy Metal bands: it puts its eccentric characters at the centre of some extremely outré situations, yet still shows them as real people that the viewer can identify with and care about. As with Rob Reiner's celebrated 'rockumentary', the wonderfully realised collection of likable characters, the delightfully droll sense of humour and plenty of highly quotable dialogue ensure that the film is destined for cult status.The cast are uniformly excellent, their deadpan delivery of some very silly dialogue making for some seriously funny moments (although my favourite character, Petyr, an 8000-year-old Nosferatu-style vampire, managed to make me laugh without uttering a word, his confused expressions enough to tickle my funny-bone). Writer/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi keep the pace brisk enough and the action varied enough to make certain that their central joke never wears thin, the silliness including a female familiar who is fed up with cleaning up blood and providing virgins, a newbie vampire who brags about his newfound status, a human who is welcomed into the group, a pack of irascible werewolves, and an annual masquerade party where the vamps get to let off some steam.",8,1,3,4 January 2016
Deadpool," Super. But no hero.
","Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin), but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease, but also give him incredible powers, he is sceptical, but eventually undergoes the treatment—a long and agonising process that scars his entire body—unaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence, Deadpool is an absolute blast, a side-splittingly funny, hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it, creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character, imbued with invincibility, doesn't want to be a hero he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis, the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks, he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence, pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past), it's a very close second. I loved it! 9/10.",9,4,12,5 May 2016
300," A major disappointment.
","Caught in a temporal warp that causes everything to happen at half-speed, 300 buff Spartan warriors do battle with a massive invading Persian army (consisting of slaves, giants and assorted freaks), led by an impossibly tall, self-appointed 'god' (with a penchant for body-modification) named Xerxes.Adapted from a graphic novel by Frank Miller, director Zack Snyder's paean to the noble warriors of ancient Greece is an aesthetically stunning, but ultimately hollow epic that exists purely to showcase a series of stylish battle sequences. Virtually plot less, 300 devotes most of its running time to mindless macho posturing and endless well choreographed skirmishes. Whilst this is fun for, say, an hour at the most, it eventually becomes tedious in the extreme.With its CG rendered backdrops, beautiful lighting and faultless cinematography, 300 is visually arresting like classic Renaissance art brought to lifebut when applied to virtually every frame of the movie, this level of aesthetic perfection also starts to become tiresome. Likewise, an overuse of slow-motion drains the carefully composed battle sequences of life, leaving the viewer emotionally detached from what should be thrilling cinema. Used sparingly, these techniques can have a tremendous effect on the power of a movie, but Snyder has obviously forgotten that sometimes less is more and overcooks the whole damn mess.It's a shame really, since Snyder had shown so much promise with his first movie, the impressively scary remake of Dawn of the Dead. And there is so much about 300 that could and should be praised (the set design, the amazing costumes, and realistic make-up and effects), that it makes it even harder for me to report that I was hugely disappointed by this overblown and rather pretentious 'blockbuster'.A word of advice, Zack... next time, concentrate on telling a decent story, shoot enough footage so that you can afford to show the film at normal speed, lose the CGI blood, and get some decent actors.... if you screw up the long-awaited Watchmen adaptation, it might mean the end of your career.",3,1,4,9 June 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Move over James Bond.
","When London oik Eggsy (Taron Egerton) winds up in serious trouble with the law, he calls the number on the medal given to him as a child by his dead father's old colleague Harry Hart (Colin Firth). As a result, he finds all charges dropped, and himself enrolled in the training program for elite spy agency The Kingsmen. Meanwhile, supposed philanthropist billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is planning to take care of the world's ecological problems by severely thinning out the human population.Unless Spectre (out next week) heralds a major turnaround for the Bond franchise (which I somehow doubt: the awful theme song already has me concerned), Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman will remain as my favourite British spy movie since License to Kill. It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. It also features the best use of Lynyrd Skynrd's Freebird in a movie since The Devil's Rejects (during an incredible fight sequence in a church). A well deserved 9/10.",9,5,11,19 October 2015
Cube," Tension squared.
","Ignoring the highly unlikely probability of six people placed in separate cubes somehow safely converging, despite there being countless possible routes for them to take (with many booby trapped rooms along the way), the script for Cube is taut, smartly-written and engaging, primarily a well-observed study of human nature, but also an original little sci-fi thriller, the premise of which predates the similarly themed Saw movies by quite a few years.Not knowing how they got there, the film's six disparate characters (a schoolgirl, a doctor, a criminal, a mentally disabled man, a cop and an architect) try to find a way out of their unusual predicament, but as time goes by, nerves begin to fray and tempers flare, resulting in a fight for survival. Decent performances from the minimal cast help the film to hold one's attention, even when the focus shifts from creative death scenes (cheese wire and acid traps result in some neat gore) to more psychological horror.I can understand how the ambiguous ending of the film might be deemed a disappointment by some, but I like how the nature and purpose of the cube remains a mystery.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8,3,4,17 May 2019
Tarzan," Another disappointing 90s offering from Disney.
","With its traditional animation cleverly enhanced by CGI, Tarzan looks fantastic; it's just a shame that the story doesn't crackle and fizz with as much energy as the visuals.With absolutely no respect for its source material, this very loose adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's classic tale is given the full-on Disney approach. Hence, we get a crap Phil Collins song introducing the movie, a host of talking animals, a wisecracking sidekick and a nastier-than-nasty bad guy. And, unfortunately, not much of a story.Tarzan (a little too pointy-chinned and goggle-eyed for my liking), a man raised by gorillas, meets a group of explorers: Professor Archimedes Q. Porter; his daughter, Jane; and nasty Mr. Clayton, a hunter. Realising that he is human, Tarzan faces a dilemma: should he travel to civilisation or stay with his hairy pals in the jungle? While Tarzan is figuring out what to do with his life, trigger-happy Clayton is planning to bag himself a few gorillasPersonally, if I was in Tarzan's shoes (if he wore them, that is), I would travel anywhere just to get away from Terk, an annoying gorilla voiced by Rosie O'Donnell. With an unbelievably grating voice and quite awful characterisation, I wouldn't have been unhappy to see Terk captured and killed, and her paws turned into a nice set of ashtrays! And the same goes for Tantor, the irritating elephantmuch better off as set of umbrella stands and some piano keys!Of course, in true Disney style, Tarzan saves his furry friends from being captured and everything ends happily (except for Clayton, who meets a particularly nasty fate). Tarzan opts to stay in the jungle, accompanied by Jane and her father.Not exactly a classic offering from 'The House of Mouse', but worth seeing, if only for the sumptuous imagery.",5,1,5,30 September 2006
Easy A," Stone scores.
","Teen comedy Easy A stars Emma Stone as high-school nobody Olive, who finds herself the centre of attention after a little white lie about losing her virginity becomes hot school gossip. Rather than admit the truth and return to obscurity, Olive capitalises on her new-found fame, even going so far as to make some money out of the situation by charging desperate dorks to say that they have scored with her.Instead of going for the easy option -- crass low-brow comedy -- Easy A opts for a more sophisticated and good-natured approach, and while this means that real belly-laughs are in short supply, it makes for an appealing movie overall, both amusing and heartfelt, helped no end by a very likeable central turn from Stone. Other solid performances come from Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favourite teacher Mr. Griffith, Amanda Bynes as moralising Jesus freak Marianne, Aly Michalka as Olive's bestie Rhiannon, and Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's caring and supportive parents.Easy A directly references a handful of '80s teen classics that were clearly the inspiration for writer Bert V. Royal, who matches these in terms of tone and characterisation. This film could sit quite nicely nestled amongst time-honoured favourites such as Pretty In Pink, Say Anything, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,2,2,26 December 2019
Fast Five," Vin Diesel vs The Rock.
","Fast & Furious 5 steers the series even further away from 'car-porn' and into more accessible over-the-top summer blockbuster territory. This one even has The Rock in it!The film opens as part four closed, with Dom's team rescuing their friend while he is en route to prison by orchestrating a bus crash that, in reality, would kill everyone inside. Of course, by now, reality has nothing to do with the Fast & Furious franchise: this is a preposterous slam-bang spectacle that would have left me with a big grin on my face if it hadn't been so drawn out. At well over two hours, part 5 is at least thirty minutes longer than it needed to be. Trim the fat and it might have been the most enjoyable one so far.Anyway, with Dom free (and somehow devoid of any injuries), the action moves to Brazil where the team decide to pull another car robbery (from a speeding train, no less). Lots of mayhem ensues, with more death defying stunts, after which the crew discover a computer chip hidden inside one of the vehicles that details the activities of Rio De Janeiro's top crime lord. Armed with this information, the gang decide to pull one more heist: steal the bad guy's money - all $100million of it. Meanwhile, top US agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is on their trail.Unfortunately, the preparation for the daring raid is where things tend to drag (although we do get to see Gal Gadot in a small bikini, so it's not all bad). The film does, however, eventually culminate in one of the craziest heist scenes in cinema, with Dom and Brian dragging a humongous metal safe around the streets of Rio, laying waste to buildings and cars in the process. Oh, and there's a car with a mini-gun that pops out of the sun roof! All of this is mindless popcorn fun if you can check your sense of logic at the door on the way in - it's just a shame that getting there is a bit of a slog at times.",6,0,2,22 July 2018
Fantastic Four," Not quite 'fantastic', but still very entertaining.
","After being exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation during an accident on a space station, four scientists discover that their DNA has mutated, giving each of them a unique special power: Rex Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic, a man with an elastic body; Sue Storm finds that she can become invisible; her brother Johnny is a flying fireball called The Human Torch; and big, bald softy Ben Grimm turns into a huge hulking orange beast called The Thing. Together, they are the Fantastic Four.Unfortunately, their megalomanical boss, Victor Von Doom, who was also present during the accident, develops his own superpower: he can store electrical energy in his body and use it as a weapon. And, like all good super-villains, he plans to use his newfound ability to rule the worldMwa ha haaaaa!!!Having already watched the Rise of the Silver Surfer and been thoroughly underwhelmed by what I had seen, I nearly passed on viewing the first movie altogether. Thankfully, my wife convinced me to settle down and watch it with her, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Fantastic Four is far superior to its sequel.Maybe it's the whole 'origin of' aspect to the film that I preferredgetting to see each character discover and master their new talents is a whole heap of fun. It's possible that this movie succeeds due to it's witty script, light-hearted approach, and well-defined villain (The Silver Surfer wasn't really 'evil', and his boss Galactus was a massive disappointment, being nothing more than a hungry space cloud). Or perhaps it's just the fact that there is more action and better special effects.Whatever the reason, I'd choose this film over the team's decidedly average second outing any day of the week.",7,0,1,2 January 2008
The Great Escape," I'm sure you'll dig it.
","Continuing my quest to re-watch every film I saw during my Christmas holidays as a youth, I now arrive at The Great Escape, a staple of festive scheduling on UK television for many years. From the rousing Elmer Bernstein score, which blares out over the opening titles, to the emotional ending, this is the perfect film to digest a turkey dinner over, a 172 minute star-studded true story of incredible heroism guaranteed to stir the blood (unless you're German) and thoroughly deserving of the adjective 'Great'. A testament to the indomitable spirit of man, the film tells of how the inmates of a German WWII Prisoner of War camp planned and executed a daring escape, digging three tunnels, which they dubbed Tom, Dick and Harry. After months of careful planning, this bold bid for freedom resulted in over seventy prisoners successfully fleeing the camp. Only a handful ultimately made it to freedom, but the sheer ingenuity and bravery involved was staggering (despite seeming far-fetched, the events that occur on-screen are apparently accurate). Superb direction from John Sturges and a brilliant cast ensure that the viewer genuinely cares for the colourful characters, which only goes to make their post-escape exploits all the more nail-biting.Highly recommended, even if, like me, you're not a big war film fan.",9,0,1,22 May 2018
Click," From boob and fart gags to depression, regret and death.
","Adam Sandler vehicle Click starts off as a goofball fantasy comedy that isn't all that funny, then turns into a surprisingly bleak but eventually heartwarming parable about not wasting your life, although for a while there I could have sworn that I was watching something else entirely: a movie about depression.Sandler's character, Michael Newman, a workaholic architect who cannot find the time to spend with his family, is obviously suffering from severe stress and appears to have a mental breakdown. It's at this point that the enigmatic Morty (Christopher Walken) offers him a solution: a universal remote with which he can control his life, fast-forwarding through all the bad bits.Think of Morty as a doctor and swap 'universal remote' with 'anti-depressants' and what follows can be seen in a different light. When Michael uses the remote, he is on auto-pilot, like a zombie, and before he knows it, years have passed and he has missed out on many of his family's special moments. Ultimately, his relationship with his gorgeous wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) breaks down, he piles on the pounds, and winds up alone, having lost all that is dear to him. Then he dies.Of course, this being a Hollywood comedy, this isn't how the story ends: Michael's miserable life turns out to have been a dream; waking up before his encounter with Morty, he decides to change his ways and make the most of every moment from now on. When offered the remote once again, he simply chucks it in the bin. If only it were that simple.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the astounding old age make-up.",7,0,2,16 June 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Keanu kills everyone. Again.
","I love me a bit of the old ultra-violence, but I also like a plot of some kind to go with all of the gunfire, blood and broken bones. Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table.This sequel sees Wick being forced out of retirement to honour a 'marker', criminal Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) calling upon the quasi-mythical hitman to repay his debt by assassinating his sister Gianna D'Antonio. Wick refuses, which results in his house being burnt down and his life being put on the line. Realising that he will only ever have peace if he agrees to Santino's request, Wick kills Gianna, and massacres her henchmen; however, in order to tie up any loose ends, Santino double-crosses John, putting out a contract on him. Now Wick has to battle lots of other hitmen and women. Luckily for him, they're all rubbish and easily killed. Miffed at being betrayed, John goes after Santino, meaning that he has to fight even more gunmen, but they're all a bit rubbish too. Wick gets shot in the gut and stabbed in the leg in the process, but is able to shrug off the pain, continuing to cut a bloody swathe through the bad guys to get to his target.If kick, punch, blam, blam, blam is all you want for 2 hours, with very little variation in style, lots of CGI blood, and nothing to tax the brain, then have at it - it's not unwatchable, just unremarkable. To his credit, Stahelski ends the film well by nicely setting up things for a third film. I just hope he doesn't give us the same thing all over again (Chapter 2 even repeats the novelty subtitles that I found so irritating in the first film).",5,0,0,4 February 2020
Annihilation," As Natalie Portman replies during her interrogation scenes in Annihilation, 'I don't know'.
","I don't know what writer/director Alex Garland was thinking. I don't know what the point of the film was. I don't know how so many silly plot holes could have made it into the final script. I don't know whether I ever want to see another Garland film again. I don't know what Jennifer Jason Leigh has done to her face. Natalie Portman plays biologist Lena, who volunteers to join a dangerous mission into the 'shimmer', a mysterious, expanding zone caused by an alien force. Inside the zone, Lena and her all-female cohorts encounter strange mutated creatures and fear that their own DNA is being slowly assimilated.A boring build-up to the mission; some brief excitement involving the mutated animals; a smattering of gore; lots of introspection and ponderous pretentiousness; plenty of scenes that take an awful lot of swallowing; and an ending that makes very little sense: Annihilation is the perfect companion piece to Danny Boyle's even more disappointing and even more perplexing sci-fi Sunshine, which was also penned by Garland.One thing I do know: I won't be giving this one a second watch anytime soon.",4,15,31,7 July 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Gothic romanticism AND gore.
","With its photogenic cast and a story-line revolving around the emotional anguish that goes hand in hand with vampirism, Interview With The Vampire could be accused of being the 90s precursor to Twilight; its vamps might be sad, however, but they sure ain't sappy: the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) would happily tear Edward a new one; Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) would rip out Bella's throat without batting an eyelid; Louis (Brad Pitt) would find it hard to join in at first, but his hunger would prevail. That's because Interview With The Vampire is a proper vampire movie with proper vamps designed for a mature audience, not watered down PG-13 tripe aimed at the less discriminate teen demographic.Interview's bloodsuckers might have emotional issues to deal with—immortality and a constant craving for blood doesn't come without its baggage—but when it comes down to it, these guys see mortals as food and having a relationship with dinner is only going to get messy (much better to slash their throat and be done with it); Interview's brutal bloodsuckers (and its R-rating) ensure that viewers get a healthy helping of gore to go with their Gothic romanticism, Stan Winston's incredible effects giving the film plenty of bite. Factor in excellent direction from Neil Jordan and great turns from its stars (Dunst is amazing for her age), and what you have is a terrific vampiric horror in the truest sense.",8,1,1,19 May 2012
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The funniest of the Monty Python movies.
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is silly. It's amazingly silly. In fact, it must be amongst the silliest films ever made, if not THE silliest film ever made. If you like silly, you won't be disappointed.The film sees the Python team attacking the legend of the search for the holy grail by the knights of Camelot, and includes lots of jokes featuring animals. If the mere mention of a badger, a sloth, a llama, a carp or a fruit bat gets you giggling, you won't be disappointed.It also gets laughs from such random nonsense as shrubberies, French soldiers, coconuts, a three-headed knight, and confusion between the numbers 3 and 5, while an indefatigable black knight who loses all his limbs and a killer rabbit add moments of cartoonish gore.With so much lunacy packed into an hour and a half, this is Python at its most entertaining (so much funnier than the over-rated Life of Brian).",8,1,4,17 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Why can't they make them like this any more?
","From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second.",10,5,9,3 March 2007
Saboteur," Hitchcock does propaganda.
","A wartime propaganda thriller, Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is designed to evoke a strong sense of patriotism and righteousness in its viewers; as such, it is about as subtle as a brick, but not totally without its merits, delivering a couple of reasonably executed suspense scenes and a fun finale atop the Statue of Liberty.Robert Cummings stars as airplane factory worker Barry Kane, who becomes a fugitive after he is wrongly accused of sabotage. Going on the run in an attempt to clear his name, Barry teams up with beautiful blonde model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) and uncovers a group of ruthless fifth columnists who are plotting a series of terrorist attacks.Hitchcock handles the action well enough, but even his deft direction cannot overcome the silly nature of a script that sees Kane repeatedly escape capture due to the trusting nature of complete strangers (where, in reality, he would be turned over to the authorities tout suite) and which relies rather heavily on chance (the taxi cab drivers seeing Pat flicking the light switch on and off in a room at the top of a skyscraper is beyond dumb).Also not helping matters much is the occasionally poor editing: a shootout in a movie theatre proves hard to follow, whilst Kane's escape from a locked storeroom, where he has activated the sprinkler system, is nothing short of a miracle—one second he is trapped, the next he is out on the street.Thankfully, the giddying finale at the pinnacle of America's proud symbol of freedom rounds off the film in style, with Hitch using lots of inventive camera angles (and some dodgy matte work) to raise the tension.",6,1,2,30 March 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Clowns and zombies and werewolves, oh my!
","Two babes (Kristen Connolly and Anna Hutchison); two hunks (Chris Hemsworth and Jesse Williams); one stoner (Fran Kranz); a weekend in a creepy old cabin by a lake: sounds like all the ingredients for a typically gruesome teen horror, doesn't it? Well, that's precisely what Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard want you to think, except that there is absolutely nothing 'typical' about this film.The initial set up will be familiar to most, but with the early introduction of a group of sinister scientists keeping tabs on events at the cabin (via some sophisticated surveillance equipment), it soon becomes apparent that things aren't as they might at first seem. As the film unfolds, Whedon and Goddard seize every opportunity to play with the conventions of the genre and mess with their viewers' expectations; the result is a whole lot of demented fun, something that I can only describe as 'The Evil Dead meets Lost'.To give away anything further about the plot would be to ruin your enjoyment, so I'll keep schtum and leave you to discover the secrets of The Cabin In The Woods by yourself. Suffice to say that the film delivers all of the standard horror movie clichés (a dark cellar full of bizarre objects, sex in the woods, a creepy gas station attendant, etc.,) but what it does with them takes the film into refreshingly new horror territory where the standard rules of the genre simply do not apply.",8,1,5,31 August 2012
Spectre," It's time to shake up the franchise and add some FUN!
","007 is back, hunting for the head of sinister criminal organisation SPECTRE, which plans to use an international intelligence network to further its nefarious activities.Spectre opens in fine form with a thrilling pre-credits action sequence that sees James Bond (Daniel Craig) narrowly escaping death when a building collapses around his ears before leaping on board a helicopter to do battle with a baddie above the crowded streets of Mexico City; then Sam Smith begins his godawful caterwauling, and the film never recovers.This latest instalment in the long running British spy series is another overly sombre adventure that once again lacks the excitement and thrills that I remember from the Bond films of my childhood. People love to scoff at the Roger Moore movies, but at least they were hugely enjoyable slabs of blockbuster entertainment, full of exotic locations and colourful characters; in contrast, Sam Mendes' movies are drab and largely boring. I don't blame Craig—he actually makes for a great Bond—it's the overall tone, overly elaborate plots, and the film-makers' absolute refusal to have any fun that are to blame.",5,6,11,1 March 2016
Moon," Sam I am. And so am I.
","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is coming to the end of his three year contract working for Lunar Industries at Sarang Station on the far side of the moon, where he is the only employee, overseeing the mining of helium-3, a revolutionary fuel. While on a routine inspection of a harvester, Sam crashes his buggy and is rendered unconscious.Waking in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident, Sam is tended to by the base's artificial intelligence named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). After hearing GERTY communicating with his superiors at Lunar Industries via a communication channel that is supposedly inoperative, Sam starts to become suspicious, more-so after he is confined to the base. Deliberately creating a technical problem that requires him to go outside, Sam travels to the crashed moon vehicle where he finds an unconscious occupant: himself!Moon is a well acted and well directed sci-fi drama and passes the time nicely enough, but it does feel a bit like a short story stretched over a feature length runtime, director Duncan Jones struggling to maintain momentum after his 'reveal' -- that the central character is a clone, and that his three year 'contract' is in fact his lifespan, after which he will be replaced by another clone. The film would have worked better as an hour long episode of The Twilight Zone, but 97 minutes is pushing it a little. Still... worth a go, especially for fans of isolated/solitary sci-fi such as Silent Running and Dark Star, or of Bladerunner, which clearly provided inspiration for much of the plot.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7,1,1,22 January 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Welcome back, Max.
","It's been thirty years since I left the cinema feeling more than a little let down by the kiddie friendly, Hollywood-ised action of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome; could this long-awaited reboot from the series' original creator George Miller make up for three decades of disappointment? You betcha!One certainly can't accuse Miller of playing it safe with his fourth Mad Max outing: Fury Road is an exercise in absolute excess from start to finish. The outrageous plot opens with Max (Tom Hardy, taking over the iconic role from Mad Mel) being captured by a clan of desert warriors ruled over by ruthless tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from the original Mad Max), who keeps order in his citadel by controlling its supply of water (and breast milk!). The helpless Max is used as a 'blood bank' by sickly war-boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), before finding himself strapped to the front of Nux's vehicle, part of the huge convoy that takes off in pursuit after rebellious one-armed rig-driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has betrayed Joe by making off with several of his wives, having promised to escort them to a promised land of green.After the chase enters a massive electrical sandstorm, during which Nux crashes his car, Max finds himself free once again; teaming up with Furiosa, he helps to drive the rig to safety, but on reaching their destination, Max and Furiosa realise that their only hope for survival is to turn back and face the enemy head on. Up to this point, the action had been impressive, but what follows is absolutely breath-taking—a mind-boggling mêlée of sheer madness and mayhem, with more mashed metal and massive explosions than all three previous Mad Max films put together, times ten. Quite how Miller managed to capture some of the scenes of car-nage without killing anyone in the process is hard to imagine, such is the incredible level of vehicular destruction on display.The previous Mad Max movies—even Thunderdome—excelled when it came to production design, and Fury Road is the most imaginative yet, with its wonderful citadel full of man-powered machinery, and, of course, its cavalcade of absurd post-apocalyptic vehicles (love, love, love the The Cars That Ate Paris-inspired buggies covered in metal spikes). The attention to detail here is superb, with far too much to take in in just one viewing (I've only just finished watching it and I already want to see it again). The insane characters also go a long way to making this film the hugely entertaining experience that it is: Slit, a war-boy with a Joker-style smile; Rictus Erectus, the dim musclebound son of Immortan Joe; The Doof Warrior, a guitar playing gimp stood astride a bank of loudspeakers on wheels; and a strange deformed dwarf, another of Joe's sons, who watches the world through a telescope from the safety of the citadel.Finally, the 3D: usually, I can take or leave the gimmick of a third dimension, but here it really added to my enjoyment, Miller milking the process for all its worth. I suggest watching Fury Road in 3D if only for the shot of the steering wheel flying into the foreground: I felt like I could reach out and catch it—a lasting souvenir from one of the most spectacular movies of the millennium so far.",9,9,26,14 May 2015
Gladiator," Maximus Excitus Entertainius.
","In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.",9,3,5,27 April 2018
Contact," Contact vs Interstellar.
","Deep space exploration, theology versus science, extraterrestrial contact, a central father-daughter relationship: there are a lots of similarities between Christopher Nolan's recent hit Interstellar and Robert Zemeckis' Contact; hell they even share the same star in Matthew McConaughey. There is, however, one massive difference between the two films: Contact is a genuinely great film, while Interstellar is merely entertaining in a 'did they really just do that?' kind of way (I often wonder if Nolan was having a laugh at the audience's expense).Obviously, Interstellar boasts state-of-the-art CGI, meaning that it trumps the rather dated looking Contact in terms of jaw-dropping visuals, but with an intelligent script based on the work of Carl Sagan, a terrific central performance from Jodie Foster, and a superb supporting cast that includes James Woods, Jake Busey, Tom Skerritt and John Hurt, Zemeckis' film is the clear winner. Thought provoking and life affirming, Contact leaves the viewer with a genuine sense of awe and wonder; Interstellar, on the other hand, leaves one impressed with the current state of special effects, but pondering more than a few awkward questions regarding the plot (that tidal wave gets me every time, and don't even get me started on the intergalactic bookshelf).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,7,11,16 March 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I guess I'll be watching the next one on my own as well.
","As the battle rages on Cybertron between the Autobots and the Decepticons, an Autobot craft carrying a secret cargo is launched into space, eventually crashing on the dark side of the moon. Years later, the Decepticons put into motion a plan to secure the contents of the craft— artefacts that would help them finally win their war, if only it wasn't for the intervention of plucky teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his 'clearly out of his league' girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and their metal pals.I watched the first two Transformers films in the company of my son, but I'm watching this one alone: I simply cannot subject my poor boy to any more of this mindless drivel. Admittedly, I thought it would be impossible for Michael Bay to make a more terrible film than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but here it is 154 minutes of noisy, CGI-filled crap that easily ranks amongst the very worst movies I have ever seen.A man for whom more is never enough, Bay smothers his ridiculously OTT action with expensive CGI special effects, overloading the senses, yet never managing to generate any feeling of excitement or tension. Frequent ill-judged comedy only goes to make the whole thing an even more painful experience, one that not even Huntington-Whiteley's hot bod can prevent me from awarding the lowest possible rating.",1,1,4,10 August 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the Third Best in the Series (so far).
","For his third Indiana Jones adventure, Steven Spielberg once again pits his heroic, Fedora wearing, whip-cracking archaeologist against pre-war Nazis, who are up to their old tricks again, searching for religious artifacts that will grant them supernatural powers. This time around, Indy (Harrison Ford) must try and beat the goose-stepping Germans to the 'Holy Grail', the cup that held the blood of Christ, which is said to grant eternal life to those who drink from it.Whilst it's admittedly nice to see Ford back in action against his old foes, the Nazis (who, let's face it, always make excellent villains), and director Spielberg does manage to deliver one or two well orchestrated, stunt filled action sequences, The Last Crusade fails to match either of its predecessors in terms of sheer entertainment value.Raiders was a near perfect blend of action and adventure from start to finish, with great characters, flawless direction, and excellent visuals; the less immaculate Temple of Doom still managed to be a hugely enjoyable effort overall, thanks to its sheer exuberance; but Crusade is a far less fulfilling experience.Much of the blame can be laid at the feet of whoever came up with the idea to introduce us to Indiana's father, a superfluous character (played by a terribly miscast Sean Connery) created to give our hero emotional depth where none was required, whilst also delivering a few cheap laughs; but the film also suffers from poorly considered moments (Indy takes a flaming torch with him down a tunnel swimming in petrol; Indy frees the guardian of the grail who, moments earlier, had tried to kill him; Indy and his pals can only see a giant 'X' on the library floor by climbing up a staircase and looking down), some risible effects (the Nazi zeppelin looks terrible), and a rather disappointing climax involving three 'tests' for Indy that equate to a well timed duck and jump, a spelling bee, and a quick jaunt across a stone bridge.6.5 out of 10, which I'll generously round up to 7, because it's still marginally better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",7,1,5,4 July 2010
Back to the Future," A film you can watch time and time again.
","My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs...",10,2,2,20 November 2010
Goodfellas," One of the best Mafia films ever made.
","As far back as I can remember, I've never wanted to be a gangster. I'd crack under the pressure and would probably wind up getting whacked (I've not a drop of Sicilian blood in me either, so would never be a 'made' man). I'm far safer sat here at my Mac typing film reviews.Real life mobster Henry Hill (portrayed by Ray Liotta), on the other hand, had always wanted to be a 'wiseguy', and lived the dream to the full, making all the right connections and bags of cash in the process, at least until his greed got him into trouble with mob bosses and he was forced to turn state's evidence to save his skin.As directed by Martin Scorsese, this account of Hill's exploits is extremely gripping stuff, with great period detail, a superb soundtrack, and a standout cast (including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci) all putting in great performances, Pesci in particular giving it all as loose cannon Tommy DeVito, one of the scariest characters ever committed to film (his classic 'funny like a clown?' scene is unbearably tense). The film is also incredibly violent, showing the harsh reality of the 'business' in unflinching detail, opening as it means to go on with the brutal stabbing and shooting of some poor sap in the trunk of a car.Nope a life of crime is definitely not for me. Now what shall I review next?",9,0,1,11 November 2016
Shark Tale," Not enough to get your teeth into.
","Despite having the benefits of a very talented cast and some of the best digital animators in the business, Shark Tale ultimately fails to reach the levels of success achieved by its contemporary, Finding Nemo.Nemo had a sharp uncomplicated script that was primarily aimed at the kids, yet was funny and clever enough to amuse the adults as well. The characters were appealing without being too nauseating and the CGI was superbly executed  state-of-the-art, colourful and detailed without being too fussy.Shark Tale, on the other hand, is... ahem... a different kettle of fish. It has a leaden script, hampered by a lack of really funny jokes and too many references to urban popular culture, most of which will go way over the heads of younger viewers. The characters are some kind of freakish amalgamation of human and fish  quite possibly the ugliest animated creatures ever (the fish resemble the actors providing the voices  a bad move!). The CGI is packed with detail but is far too brash and fails to convince the viewer that the story takes place in an underwater environment.Sure there are the occasional funny moments  the two Rastafarian jellyfish and the shrimps made me chuckle  but these are too few and far between. What we are left with is a rather soulless affair that will struggle to find an audience when there is much better out there.",5,0,3,5 March 2006
Warm Bodies," A refreshingly different kind of zombie film.
","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie who spends his days shuffling aimlessly around an airport, snacking on the brains of any human who might stray across his path—but he hasn't lost all of his human qualities just yet: he still has interesting thoughts, can grunt the odd word to his zombie pal M (Rob Corddry), and enjoys listening to music.Julie (Teresa Palmer) is one of a handful of survivors who occupy the city behind the safety of a massive wall. When she takes part in a mission to the dead zone to find supplies, she comes under attack from zombies, but is saved by R, who—having just eaten her boyfriend's brains—begins to have feelings for the girl.With other zombies on the prowl, including the terrifying 'bonies' (the zombies who have deteriorated the most), R insists that Julie spends several days in the safety of his home, a deserted passenger jet; as R's feelings for Julie become stronger, he discovers that he is gradually becoming more human.Warm Bodies not only works well as a charming, unorthodox romance but also as a smart allegorical tale about how society has become dehumanized to the point where many people sleepwalk through life in a zombie-like state, glued to their mobile phones, only communicating via social media or experiencing life through other people's Facebook accounts. It is only when a spark is ignited by someone who is truly alive that a 'zombie' can begin the gradual journey back from the dead.With gentle comedy, romance, action, brain eating, AND social commentary, Warm Bodies is a welcome and innovative addition to the zombie genre that offers something to delight almost every demographic. Hoult, currently appearing in cinemas as war-boy Nux in Mad Max Fury Road, is on particularly fine-form, absolutely nailing the zombie routine. Who would have thought that that bowl-haired kid with the weird eyebrows from About A Boy would turn out to be such a star?",8,0,2,10 June 2015
The Birds," If the birds don't get them, the lung cancer will.
","Only a director of Hitchcock's calibre could transform a patently silly idea like killer birds into such a nerve wracking and thoroughly entertaining movie, one that proves without a doubt that he really is 'the master of suspense'.The director spends the first half of his film investing purely in the characters, letting his audience get to know them, making the viewer care so as to increase the potency of the horror once they are eventually in peril. Before we even see the birds in action, Hitch shows exactly what his feathered fiends are capable of, with a truly shocking shot of a victim, eyes pecked out, covered in blood. The scenes when the birds attack are suitably vicious and gruesome, Hitch making it abundantly clear that no-one is safe from harm, not even children.But it is the moments between the attacks, the calms before the storm, when the director really pulls out all the stops to show how just good he is at cranking up the tension. A flap of a wing, a few creepy echoey caws, screeches and squawks, a malevolent glance—that's all Hitch needs to have his audience on tenterhooks. Case in point: my favourite scene of the film, in which Melanie (Tippi Hedren) sits smoking yet another cigarette while crows slowly gather behind her; when she finally turns around, there's hundreds of the bloody things—superb!",9,2,5,28 October 2012
Jurassic Park," Stomping, chomping dinosaur action par excellence.
","I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds).",9,6,8,15 November 2008
Beetlejuice," This film's popularity perplexes me.
","When their attempts to scare away the obnoxious new owners of their home prove less than successful, recently deceased couple Barbara and Adam Maitland (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) turn to outrageous 'bio-exorcist' Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) for help.They played Harry Belafonte's 'Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)' at my work's Xmas 'do' this year, which made me realise that it's been a whopping 25 years since I last saw Beetlejuice (as well as making me painfully aware that dancing the conga when sober isn't anywhere near as much fun as it is while plastered—next year, I drink!). Sadly, a quarter of a century later, the film isn't anywhere near as much fun as I remembered it to be There are plenty of creative ideas and director Tim Burton's morbid style is much in evidence, but the film as a whole proves to be far less than the sum of its parts—a series of quirky, macabre, but not very funny gags with little in the way of a decent story to tie it all together. Keaton is also rather irritating as the 'ghost with the most'; thankfully he gets precious little screen-time (despite the film being named after his character), but Winona Ryder, an actress that I simply cannot abide, is sadly present throughout.",4,13,26,22 December 2013
The Simpsons Movie," I laughed... but I should've laughed harder and more frequently.
","In this big-screen adventure featuring the lovable folk of Springfield, trouble brews for the Simpson family after Homer irresponsibly pollutes the local water supply with tons of pig manure. As a result of this thoughtless action, the town is encased in a huge dome by the Environment Protection Agency and, after angry Springfield citizens form a lynch mob, Homer and his family are forced to become fugitives.How much you enjoy The Simpsons Movie will depend entirely on your opinion of the current Simpsons TV show: if you have loved the past few seasons, then you'll have a great timethe movie is as funny, if not slightly better, than your average episode of recent years. Those of us, however, who recognise that the show has long since passed its prime will feel underwhelmed: the movie is often amusing, but very rarely hilarious.And that's just not good enough! When a series as successful as The Simpsons takes 20 years to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen, it had better be damn goodnay, it had better be exceptional!! Instead, this rather uninspired product just doesn't make the wait worthwhile.5 out of 10, bumped up to 6 out of a misguided sense of loyalty to a show that has given me so much fun in the past.",6,7,8,26 January 2008
The Wizard of Oz," I do believe in spooks...I do, I do, I do...
","Iconic, fantastical, loved by millions: The Wizard of Oz should be made compulsory viewing for all under-fives before their minds are polluted by the some of the drivel that passes for children's entertainment these days. Packed to the gills with imaginative characters, lavish set design, impressive special effects, wonderful songs and boasting unforgettable performances from nearly all those involved, what child could resist this landmark of fantasy cinema? As Dorothy and Co. made their way to the Emerald City, battling flying monkeys and wicked witches on the way, my daughter sat transfixed, temporarily transported to the land of Oz in her mind; I sat next to her, temporarily transported back to my childhood, when it would be shown on TV every Christmas. And perhaps that's the appeal of the film for many adults: the magical sense of nostalgia that accompanies every viewing, a reminder of the innocence of childhood before growing up made things complicated, the comfortable feeling that comes from watching an old familiar favourite.If you're the parent of a small child, do them a favour and get this film for them now. Fill their minds with the wonder of Ozthey'll thank you for it when they're older. And give yourself a treat toowatch it with them.",10,3,4,18 June 2006
Dodgeball," You'll have a ball.
","An archetypal (and purportedly true) underdog story, Dodgeball sees Vince Vaughn as lovable but apathetic gym owner Peter La Fleur, who, with his band of misfit customers, enters a national dodgeball tournament to try and win the $50,000 he needs to prevent his business from being acquired by corporate fitness freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller).The order of the day here is low-brow humour, with laughs derived from abject silliness, vulgarity and slapstick; thankfully, nearly all of the gags hit their target square in the face, meaning that even the most joyless of viewers will struggle to remain composed. Whether its the simple pleasure of seeing a person being hit in the knackers by a fast moving ball, the sight of an overweight cheerleader wearing no underwear falling ass down onto someone's face, or ridiculous lines of dialogue such as 'I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel', Dodgeball is simply too daft not to enjoy.",8,0,1,28 December 2016
Evil Dead II," A silly splat-stick horror classic—but not the film I wish it was.
","Back in 1987, when I emerged blinking into the daylight having just witnessed the long awaited sequel to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, I was too embarrassed to publicly admit the tinge of disappointment that I was feeling. With fans and critics alike hailing the film a masterpiece, I didn't feel comfortable expressing my less than glowing opinions. Now, 22 years later, having just revisited the film, I feel ready to come clean: I don't LOVE Evil Dead II.There. I've said it. I feel better now.It's not that I hate the film either—on many levels it's very entertaining and Raimi's direction is certainly kinetic, ensuring that boredom is never an option—but it just isn't what I expected or wanted from the sequel to one of the greatest horror films of all time.Gone is the all-out visceral horror of the original; Evil Dead II's violence is less graphic and very cartoonish, with extremely watery blood and one deadite even bleeding green. Instead, Raimi gives us slapstick comedy, Three Stooges style, with star Bruce Campbell performing a series of silly comedic set-pieces that require him to smash plates on his head, perform pratfalls, and pick a fight with his own hand. Very amusing, I'm sure... but scary?? No siree!Raimi starts his film begins by virtually retelling the entire first movie in the first ten minutes and then proceeds to throw in a few more characters to kill off: Bobbie Joe and Jake, a couple of expendable hicks, heroine Annie Knowby played by Sarah Berry (who has the most irritating scream in the history of horror), and her pal Ed Getley (Richard Domeier). Meanwhile, Ash (Campbell) gets do his physical comedy thing whilst spouting a few quotable bits of dialogue for the fans to repeat ad nauseum.As the film progresses, there are a few effective jump scares as the dead unexpectedly pop into frame, one particular scene in the fruit cellar manages to raise the tension (at least until the monster appears and the comedy starts again), and a memorable finalé leaves the film on a high note, but in my opinion, Evil Dead II sorely needs more horror and less cheese.I give Evil Dead II 7/10, which isn't that bad I suppose, but I wish it was a 10/10.",7,0,6,19 May 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," I'll get you, Butler.
","Wonky-mouthed star Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton, whose wife and child are brutally killed during a home invasion. When one of his family's killers escapes death row after striking a deal, Shelton spends ten years planning revenge, using his skills as an inventor to punish not just the men who committed the crime, but also those working in the justice system who failed him.Law Abiding Citizen starts off promisingly enough in Death Wish mode, but once it enters Saw territory, things get really, really dumb, with Shelton's meticulous planning meaning that he can carry out his revenge even from inside a prison cell, having somehow predicted the every move of legal eagle Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) and his Department of Justice colleagues. It's all so far-fetched that it's impossible for the viewer to take seriously, although that is clearly the intention of director F. Gary Gray, who conducts proceedings without a shred of irony.",3,2,2,23 June 2018
V for Vendetta," V. Good!
","Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic, Warrior), V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material, but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.V (Hugo Weaving, who remains masked throughout the entire film), is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys, I do hope that others seek this one outthey might be surprised by how good it actually is.",8,0,1,25 August 2006
The Island," Where are the clones? Send in the clones....
","It is ironic, perhaps, that a film dealing with the central theme of cloning feels somewhat like a clone itself. The first 30 minutes or so of The Island (and the ending) is more a less a direct crib from 70s classics 'Logan's Run'(in which the main protagonists must escape their enclosed environment to escape execution at the hands of those in control) and the lesser known 'The Clonus Horror'.Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen play clones who discover the terrible truth behind their existence - that they exist only as spare parts for the rich - and decide to hot foot it to sanctuary - in this case, Los Angeles. They are pursued by a professional tracker and his gang and at this point the film becomes a hi-tech actioner of the kind to be expected from director Michael Bay, the man behind OTT mega-budget blockbusters Armageddon, Bad Boys and Pearl Harbour.Bay takes proceedings very seriously, obviously believing he is making a profound piece of work that questions the ethics of cloning; what the viewer actually gets is a big budget sci-fi epic that is preposterous, yet very entertaining.The film looks great – cinematography and special effects are well above par – and Bay's usual annoying habit of over-editing sequences is kept to a minimum. The action is loud, fast and spectacular, although some scenes are so far fetched that they will have you sniggering in disbelief. McGregor and Johannsen are pretty good as far as eye-candy leads go, and they deliver some ridiculous lines with admirably straight faces.And when the film had finished, I actually found myself in two minds about the ethics of cloning. Part of me felt that cloning was perhaps wrong – that playing God is a dangerous thing to do. The other part of me wants to know where I can get me a Scarlett Johannsen clone for a little experimentation of my own!",7,2,3,26 March 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Coens done good.
","Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the Coen Brothers' 'O Brother, Where Art The hou?' is the saga of Everett, Pete and Delmar (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson), three bumbling criminals on the run in the deep south, hoping to dig up a hidden stash of treasure before the valley where it is buried is flooded. At the start of their journey, they meet a blind man who prophecises that they will find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek; indeed, life for the trio takes many strange and unexpected turns before fate smiles upon them, their adventure involving encounters with many unusual characters (including three sirens, a Bible-selling conman, a bluesman who has sold his soul to the devil, infamous bank robber Babyface Nelson, and the KKK).Combining smart witticisms with superb slapstick and American folklore, the Coens have crafted a sparkling comedic delight, helped no end by excellent performances, not just from the three endearing leads, but everyone involved, the superb supporting cast including such wonderful talent as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning. The film also benefits from stunning photography (much of it sepia-tinted to add to the depression-era ambience) and a superb soundtrack bristling with 'Old Time America' bluegrass and country music (if you're not already a fan of the genre, you might well be by the end of the film), making it a treat for both eyes and ears. If only the film had smell-o-vision, so we could appreciate the odour of Ulysses' Dapper Dan pomade as well...",8,0,0,2 January 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Another winner for Ferrell and McKay.
","I can't explain or rationalise exactly why, but I love the absurdist humour of Will Ferrell. And Talladega Nights is right up there with Ferrell's amazing Anchorman as one of the dumbest, craziest and funniest films that I've seen.Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a pit-stop engineer whose life radically changes when he is given the chance to drive in a Nascar race. He does so well that he is made a permanent driver and pretty soon he is living the high life. Married to a blonde bimbo, with two kids and massive bank account, Bobby thinks his life is perfect.But when his place as numero uno on the Nascar circuit is threatened by gay French Formula 1 expert Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), Ricky Bobby's 'perfect' life begins to fall apart.Ferrell is very much a 'love-him-or-loathe-him' kind of performer, and if you haven't enjoyed his previous films, then there's a good chance that this one will leave you unimpressed. But if you're a fan of the madcap performer's zany style, then Talladega Nights is a surefire winner.Directed by Adam McKay (who also helmed Anchorman), this laugh-a-minute gag-fest mercilessly rips into the world of Nascar racing, mocking both those who make a living from the sport, and its dedicated fans. But it also has a heart, as we see Bobby learn from his mistakes and, by the end of the film, find true happiness.Very occasionally, some of the humour is laboured a tad too much, and a couple of the gags fall a little flat, but with so many genuinely hilarious moments to make your sides ache, one can easily forgive a dud joke or two. Talladega Nights isn't quite the virtually flawless, high-performance laugh machine that is Anchorman, but it's damn close.8.5 out 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9,6,9,18 August 2007
Furious 7," More of the same. Which is why I watch them.
","I watched The Fate of the Furious and Hobbs & Shaw without seeing Fast & Furious 7, figuring that it wouldn't matter much since they're all practically the same film anyway: dumb as hell, with extremely silly action sequences, very fast cars, really hot women and indestructible heroes. I wasn't wrong: the plot for 7 is fairly forgettable: the good guys try to stop the bad guys from using a surveillance program that can locate anyone, anywhere on the planet. Meanwhile, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks revenge for his brother, targeting Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team. It's not a particularly imaginative or compelling storyline, but it's the outrageous action that really matters, and director James Wan really goes for broke, delivering some of the craziest big-budget carnage to ever hit the silver screen, never allowing the laws of physics or the mortality of his characters to get in the way of sheer spectacle.As the movie unfolds, numerous expensive vehicles are trashed and buildings are wrecked, but none of the good guys gets so much as a scratch, not even when involved in a high-speed head-on collision or when leaping from a speeding car onto tarmac. None of it is meant to be taken seriously, and those looking for any semblance of realism will be sorely disappointed. Die-hard fans of the series, however, will no doubt love the sight of Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) hurtling from one high-rise penthouse to another in a W Motors Lykan Hypersport (I admit it... I had to look that up) and Dwayne Johnson brandishing a mini-gun. For me, though, the highlights were Tony Jaa (as a mean Thai henchman) kicking ass, and the brawl between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Abu Dhabi bodyguard Kara (scary yet sexy MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, who should definitely team up with Gina Carano for an action film).7/10, which is how I rated parts 6 and 8 as well.",7,0,1,3 March 2020
The Godfather," Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.
","The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.",10,4,6,6 March 2016
