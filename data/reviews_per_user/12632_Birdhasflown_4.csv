3:10 to Yuma," Be on Time to 3:10 to Yuma
","The Western has been somewhat non existent in the last 5 years, with the exception of 'Open Range,' in 2003, and HBO's series 'Deadwood,' the genre has moved into extinction in movie goers' minds, as many Westerns nowadays focus on shootouts and blood and leave out the humanistic themes that the genre is built around. These humanistic themes are exemplified through stories of men who bring anarchy to places where law and morality are hard to find on the new frontier, which give rise to bold hearted men who stand up for justice when it is no where to be found. In '3:10 to Yuma' you find such a moral story line as criminal Ben Wade comes across rancher Dan Evans. Dan Evans is a maimed Civil War solider who fought for the North and has come to Arizona to seek refuge and peace for his family, but he has come to find nothing but pain and misery as his crops and cattle are deprived from drought, the town's businessman threaten Evans to pay off his land, and his wife and oldest son look at him like he is a coward. As Evan's barn is burnt to the ground by the businessmen and his posse, Evans decides to head into town to tell the businessman off. When he confronts him, he's told to pay up or his cattle and home will be burnt to the ground, how's that for your landlord? Now, the only way to compensate for his grievances and to pay off his debts, Evans decides to take up a job that will give him enough money to pay off the shrewd businessman. The job is to escort captured outlaw Ben Wade through perilous desert so Wade can get aboard the Yuma train and await certain execution. Wade is the leader of a band of criminals who bring down stagecoaches and rob anything on the Southern railroad. Wade is wanted for countless murders and over $400,000 stolen. Wade is brought into Evan's home, where they wait to ride out any of Wade's posse who are certainly looking for him. There Wade brews the interest of Evan's oldest son, William, and begins to flirt with Evan's wife. William has the mentality to go out and do violence to avenge their families burnt down barn, which you can say is the Wade part of the boy. But Daniel tells his son that a man must get by with his words and not his actions. The quiet and authoritative way of Dan Evans played expertly by Christian Bale, becomes a character that stands with Shane from 'Shane,' or Gary Cooper's Marshal Will Kane from 'High Noon,' They are regular, vulnerable men who stand up to injustice when no one else will, and are prime role models for children and young men who need to lead honest lives when there is much temptation and room to be lead astray. What's captivating about James Mangold's crisp, authentic morality play is how it circles around the characters stories and the dichotomy between the righteous man, Evans, and the outlaw, Wade. Ben Wade is a cunning, charming, and heartless criminal who perfectly manipulates and torments his captures as they travel through deadly wilderness swarming with Apace Indians, brewing tensions, and Wade's gang of criminals on there tale. Wade however is revealed to have a humane side to him as we realize he isn't too far from Dan Evans, its just the choices the pair has made set them apart. Wade and Evans begin to bond, as the pair begin to understand one another. Many shades of Wade's character are revealed as well as he cites passages from the Bible, and takes to draw sketches in times of solitude. Russell Crowe maybe plays one of his most entertaining performances as Ben Wade in this film. Wade and Evans keep working off each other as they both force the other to question their subsequent livelihoods. Evans leads an honest and clean life, Wade points out to him, but he still suffers for it. Isn't it better to lead a life like his, Wade tries to confide to Evans. Evans though thinks different, and speaks of always doing what is hard and right when many choose the easier path. By the end of the film Evan's example rubs off on Wade, and the story calls to mind that the wildest of dogs can be tamed. In the most stirring scene in the film, when Dan Evans is alone with outlaw Ben Wade in a hotel room, battered, tired and bruised from a hellish odyssey through sand and rolling tumbleweeds, Wade's posse circles the hotel, where Evans and Wade await certain death. All of Wade's captures leave him in fear of their own lives, but only Evans stands by Wade and promises that justice must be served and that whatever happens, he'll get him on the 3:10 to Yuma. It's almost homage to Butch and Sundance's last stand in front of the Bolivian army, but Evans sleekly leads Wade past bullets and swarming gun men, in a shoot out that will be remembered forever. This film is surprisingly a remake but it stands alone as its own film, and also up there with my favorite Western films. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe have called for the genre's immediate revival.",10,4,8,17 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," Vintiage Coen Brothers
","No other film this year is more somber, cold, and morally objectifying then Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men,' The Coen's latest opus is adapted by Cormac McCarthy's book. The Coen Brothers interpretation of the novel is an almost exact literate reflection of McCarthy's hard, unflinching vision of 1980s West Texas, as the vast and hot desert is as unsympathetic as the criminals who dwell in it. The Coen's genius speaks for itself as they rehash McCarthy's Western vision into vintage Coen film-making: a film-noir classic that reminds us how great movies can be.The story chronicles welder and ex-Vietnam veteran Lewylen Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who uncovers a satchel full of money surrounded by shot-up SUV's and dead Mexicans while hunting for antelopes. Having a young wife and trailer to come home to, he takes the money of course. Soon he is tracked down by an assortment of criminals, including a psychotic expert killer, Anton Chigurh, played menacingly by Javier Bardem.The film embodies an eerie if not unsettling portrayal of evil, as this ruthless assassin rids whoever crosses his path with no remorse or sympathy. He finds truth in the fact that if you cross his path, you are very much meant to be killed. The only thing that may save you is a coin toss, but you would have to be lucky for him to be that gracious. The killer carries a cattle gun, which is a device that shoots compressed air out of a hose. He uses this device to impale locks out of doors, and on people to. In one scene, posing as a police officer, and wielding the gun on his side, he politely asks a man to get out of his car, and prods the hose to his forehead killing him instantly. He did not want to foray the vehicle with blood.Tommy Lee Jones gives the film a much needed reprieve from the violence and carnage as he plays wise and melancholy filled Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. He follows Anton's string of crimes and tries to ease Lewylen's concerned wife as he follows her husband's trail on the run. Sheriff Bell stands for all of us who endlessly contemplate evil's profound hold on the world, as it walks in many forms. For the entire film carries with it a nihilistic message. Its message is that sometimes the most we can do to fight evil is to remain diligent and strong, and the Sheriff, Lewylen and his wife Carla Jean realize this quite tragically.The film's pacing is superb as the camera envelops the viewer into the reality of the situations, with steady camera shots where the actors show the actions on screen without the camera presenting it. Little to no music is present throughout the film, which makes for a more surreal experience for the viewer, as you feel you are with the actors as the actions takes place.The film's themes of greed and how the good combat against evil make prevalent themes in Coen pictures. Another theme is how the stark imagery of the landscapes and settings connect with the conflict of the characters. The forlorn backgrounds of desolate, morbid landscapes mark their films with an eerie presence. For they give off an unsettling perspective of lands without end, where peace and safety from evil are no where to be found. This is beautifully crafted in the gaping desert of this film and the frozen tundra of North Dakota in the Coen's Academy Award winning 'Fargo.' If you are an avid film-goer and have been deprived of entertainment as well as profound meaning in films all year, 'No Country for Old Men,' is your ticket.",10,2,8,4 December 2007
Across the Universe," Across the Universe is a testament to the greatest band of all time.
","'Across the Universe,' is one of those rare films that captures the turmoil of a generation, personifies it with music, and then moves us with a heartwarming love story. Not since 'Forrest Gump,' has a film authenticated the cultural and personal upheaval that was the 60s, and what better musical score to epitomize it, then the Fab Four from Liverpool, England.The film circles around, Jude who is a shipbuilder from Liverpool, England who meets college drop out Max in Princeton, New Jersey. Max invites Jude to Thanksgiving dinner at his family's stuffy, conservative home in suburbia. There Jude meets Max's sister Lucy where they decide to go to New York to escape their conformed lifestyles.Julie Taymor, who directed the play 'The Lion King,' is a master choreographer, who accomplishes a surprising feet in almost telling this entire story through the music of the Beatles. The musical scenes coincide with the character's personal narratives and also the cultural, social, and political overtones of the decade as Taymor brilliantly crafts 'The Beatles,' music into a perfect incantation of the generation's feeling and attitude.The film's 33 Musical numbers first lends its focus on the developing romance of Jude and Lucy. Lucy's boyfriend is killed in Vietnam which prompts her to rely on Jude for comfort as she is deeply conflicted with her feelings for him. In one of the most emotionally captivating performances by the young singer, she sings 'If I Fell,' as she watches Jude from a distance at a party. The song fleshes out her apprehension and conflicted heart so perfectly you'd think that John Lennon wrote it specifically for a similar situation.There is an apparent revival to many of 'The Beatles,' more obscure songs in 'Across the Universe,' as Taymor's interpretations prompt the listener to connect with them in a more profound way then the original. In one of the film's subplots we see a girl, named ironically Prudence somberly singing, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' Later in the film she meets the film's central characters, but she is a troubled lesbian as she longingly gazes at a girl, wanting to hold her hand. The upbeat tempo of 'The Beatles,' version is suddenly transformed into a song of longing and emotional heartache for a love that will never be realized.As the film's characters immerse themselves deeper and deeper into the 60s influences, the choreography of the film becomes more intense, creative, and elaborate. Bono lends his voice and appreciation for the Beatles as he plays a psychedelic hippy who performs 'I am the Walrus,' and takes the films characters and audience on one of the film's trippiest numbers as we go on a 'magical mystery tour.' The psychedelic musical numbers call to mind Pink Floyd's 'The Wall,' but thankfully 'Across the Universe,' evokes its abstract scenes subtly and with a sense of organization and purpose.Jim Sturgess is impressive as Jude, as he carries himself with vulnerability and pose during a generation of many baffling cultural changes. Evan Rachel Wood is angelic as Lucy, as I and countless other males in the theater fell in love with her soft gentle voice. Both stars I believe could carry themselves on Broadway as they move through countless scene changes and sophisticated choreography.The film's central conflict centers around Lucy's involvement with a peace movement. Jude is against the political convention and fears for Lucy's safety, but she contests, and their relationship falters because of it. I won't unveil too much, but this aspect of the story felt a bit underdeveloped. This musical is not as emotionally prolific through its songs as Baz Luhrmann's 'Moulin Rouge,' but that film in my mind is a masterpiece, 'Universe,' falls short. Sometimes in this particular musical, the song numbers seem forced or awkward in the midst of the film's story, as we see Eddie Izzard perform as Mr. Kite in an insane carnival piece to the song, 'Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.' Although beautifully conceived, the song has no tangible reasoning in the film's plot line.The director may have crammed too many musical numbers into the film, but we'll let it slide. Despite the film's strained middle, its beginning and end move eloquently as a touching musical passageway of story almost as good as any Beatle album. 'Across the Universe,' is a delightfully sweeping testament to the greatest band that will ever be, and shouldn't be missed if you are an avid fan.",8,0,2,16 October 2007
American Gangster," Ridley Scott fashions Crowe's intensity and Washington's commandingly cool presence in one of most entertaining crime pictures in ages
","Audiences know a good crime-saga when they see one, as American Gangster brought in $16 million dollars on Friday alone according to showbiz-data.com, setting itself to double the weekend take of last years destined crime-classic The Departed. The proof is in the pudding as famed British director Ridley Scott helms the true life story of drug lord Frank Lucas and the detective on his trail, Richie Roberts in Scott's greatest conceived film since Gladiator. Scott beautifully and brutally orchestrates Russell Crowe's determined and intense Roberts and Denzel Washington's smooth but fierce Lucas, in a sublime crime epic that transcends the genre. Frank Lucas's boss passes away in the beginning of film, prompting him to step into his shoes. Denzel Washington embodies Lucas as a cool commanding criminal who wears business suits rather then super-fly fur coats and jewelry as he adheres to keep a low-profile. Lucas carries profound ideals such as 'the loudest guy in the room is the weakest,' and that the man who draws the most attention to himself is the one that ends up in jail. He is in a lot of ways the Michael Corleone of Harlem as his intelligence and poise promote fear in his enemies. Although a gentlemen, Lucas is not afraid to conduct vicious acts of violence as he walks up to rival mobsters in broad day light and guns them down. This is one of Washington's most multi-layered characters, and he pulls it off with ease.In noticing the high quantity of narcotics in Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas immediately gets on a plane for Bangkok to work out a drug trafficking deal to get pure heroin in the United States. By securing this 'product' he cuts out the middle man, thus causing his power and control to grow. He executes his plan with fortitude as he quickly becomes the city's leading drug lord. Lucas's rise to mafia kingpin paints an engrossing portrait of capitalism in its most distasteful form, as Lucas becomes $150 million dollars richer as his product baffles police, junkies, and other criminals alike with its potency and lower price; and the audience feels the same effect. The late 1960s and early 70s are fleshed out with breathtakingly dark and menacing cinematography. Ridley Scott and cinematographer Harris Savides heighten Gangster's realism as its stage is set upon gritty, foreboding mirages of night clubs and alleyways, where desperate junkies, crooked cops, and criminals loom everywhere. Savides had conveyed such dark gloomy visions in The Game and Zodiac. The screenplay also characterizes the time period with authentic hard clenched dialogue of the streets. The focus on Crowe and Washington's dichotomy leaves out many story lines. We want to have a better sense of Lucas's father relationship with his nephew, and we wonder what happened for Roberts to cause his wife to take away his son. Their unwavering livelihoods however distract Roberts and Lucas from their beloved families, as Lucas is determined through his police work, and Lucas becomes paranoid to protect his business. Much like L.A. Confidential or Miller's Crossing, Gangster delves you into the characters daily lives, where you get a distinguished sense that the world of the criminal and cop are not too far apart. These conflicted worlds of the police officer and criminal are both littered with selfish depravity, greed, and envied power as Lucas and Roberts are surrounded by evil on both sides. This includes a crooked cop, who uses his power to blackmail both Lucas and Roberts, which makes for a captivating twist in this crime epic. Ridley Scott personifies the brutal effect organized crime has on innocent people's lives. Distressing shots of dead parents OD from Heroin inhabit the screen as a motherless child cries alongside her. These apparent scenes heighten the film's realism even more. Lucas's 'product,' is becoming the city's epidemic as thousands of New Yorkers are able buy his affordable Heroin. These wrenchingly unsettling images prompt the viewer to cheer on honest detective Richie Robert's crusade to rid the city of drugs as he becomes the film's hero. Russell Crowe exemplifies the character's courage and integrity through much evil as his struggle becomes the film's most captivating storyline. American Gangster is intelligent and engrossing as it eloquently takes us through the rise and fall of one of the most notorious crime figures in history. Before you know it, 3 hours go by and you wonder what hit you, maybe it was the gritty dark atmosphere of New York City that was so captivating or maybe it was the dualism of Crowe's intensity and Washington's fierce but commandingly cool attitude, Gangster is simply a crime epic for the ages.",9,1,8,4 November 2007
