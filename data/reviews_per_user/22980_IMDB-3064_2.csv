Ghost," Have the tissues ready.
","My family hates it when this one comes on TV. It doesn't matter if it's the first or last five minutes, I put the remote down and watch it to the end. Some of the effects are a little lame but Demi and Patrick are wonderful together. If you're a macho man, watch it alone so no one sees you cry!",9,4,5,10 February 2004
Dirty Dancing," My All Time Favorite
","I can recite the lines and I still get tears watching this cult classic. Jennifer and Patrick are so good together. The DVD has lots of extras including interviews with Jennifer and her old (better) nose. Every time I see Jerry Orbach I think of Baby. Worth seeing over and over again, until your eyes bleed. At least that's what my family claims of me!",10,0,0,10 February 2004
