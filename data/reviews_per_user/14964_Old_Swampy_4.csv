Skyfall," What a letdown!
","After seeing the trailers for this movie, I was really excited. Sure, I said to myself, Quantum of Solace was nigh unwatchable but they seem to have made another great neo-Bond movie. It'll be like Casino Royale all over again!This charade was kept up right until the scene where the guy gets eaten by the komodo dragons. Hmmm, I said, that seems like something that would happen in a later Pierce Brosnan Bond or an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The facade started to crack. The movie kept going fairly well. We meet the super villain: he has an awesome intro and great opening lines. Then, for no discernible reason, the movie plunges straight into the toilet.Keep in mind, up until the conclusion of the island part I was really into this movie. I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief (it IS a Bond movie) and the plot seemed to be building to a cool story. There was a gorgeous woman who needed saving, an extremely crazy super villain that needed defeating, and a mystery about a missing list that needed solving. But for some reason the writers chose to completely abandon these intriguing plot lines they spent the entire first part of the movie developing! I noticed in the credits that 3 people wrote this movie. Did the smartest one write the first part, the second smartest the second, and an escaped chimp the ending? It was going well!!! It had a great set up. Then they just chucked it all and started again on a much worse story. The bad guy kills the damsel in distress right away, so that angles done. The missing list is never found and not even attempted to be recovered after we meet the bad guy. The super villain turns out not to be a great foe for Bond to duel; instead, he wants to fight a decrepit old lady!The writing is just so bad after we meet Javier Bardem. Some examples off the top of my head: -Javier arranges an extremely elaborate plan to get to M just so he can look her in the eyes, involving changing the location of Mi6 headquarters, getting caught, tricking Mi6 into uploading a virus so he can escape, having disguises and getaway cars ready for him, and rerouting a subway train through the floor at the exact right moment, all so he can...shoot M with a handgun? WHY DID HE GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE JUST TO DO THAT? Every Bond villain ever had grander ambition than that. -A major part of the plot until after the island part is how Bond is losing his skill. He can't run, shoot, and he may have a drinking problem. After the island this is never mentioned again-The Scottish groundskeeper has no trace of a Scottish accent. He also steals Will Smith's line from Independence Day-The movie turns into Home Alone at the end-Javier Bardem can finally shoot M, then decides he can't, then tells her to shoot herself. She doesn't. -There's no final showdown between Bond and Javier. Javier dies from a knife in the back and Bond is just standing there. -After that anti-climactic death, M dies anyway. The whole stupid final part of the movie was a complete wasteThis was one of the most perplexing, frustrating movies I've ever seen. It had a great beginning with cool action sequences and some interesting plot developments. Then it completely abandons them for government inquiries, bad guys fighting a house, long chase sequences where nothing interesting happens, and a plot to protect an elderly woman, which ultimately fails anyway. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. I give it a 3 only because the beginning had so much promise. Watch up until Javier finishes his opening talk with Bond. Then turn it off and make up your own ending. It will be much more satisfying.",Null,12,25,16 November 2012
Public Enemies," What a bore
","I had medium hopes for this movie before I watched it. They were soon dashed to pieces like Nancy Kerrigan's knee meeting a steel pipe. Except the Nancy Kerrigan story was interesting. I never thought they could make a story about bank robbers who lived fast, violent lives boring. Somehow, they found a way. The movie drags in many, many places in between action scenes. The pacing is horrible. There are so many long dull parts you'd swear you were watching Depp in Leaving Las Vegas. Nothing happens for long periods of time, then all of a sudden there's an action scene. Unfortunately, the action is also boring or shot in a manner that makes watching it unbearable. The camera often zooms in too close to tell what's going on, like in the Quantum of Solace, but not quite that bad. The filmmaker also decided to shoot the movie in a grainy style, which makes it look more like it is from the 1940s or 50s or whatever, and also makes it even harder to tell what's going on. The worst part is that Johnny Depp's character thinks he's so cool and bad, when the movie makes it seem like he doesn't really do anything. There's some guy chasing him, but we barely see him at all. Mostly it's just Johnny Depp doing nothing and talking to some waitress or something trying really hard to impress her even though she's dumpy and not attractive. There could be an interesting cops and robbers meets the Fugitive story in here, but the director instead told a boring love story: the story of how John Dillinger was in love with himself and tried to make a waitress think he was cool. This, apparently, was his life's goal. In the end, nobody cared, especially the audience. A much better period piece of a similar vein which I think also has Johnny Depp or possibly Jude Law, is Road to Perdition. If you want to watch something interesting, watch that. If you want video proof that before television, the internet, and video games the world was very boring, watch this piece of monkey crap.",Null,0,0,8 October 2010
Horrible Bosses," Falls Flat. Real Flat.
","I had high hopes for Horrible Bosses. It started out well. The first 15 minutes made it seem like it would be really good. The premise was alright and the first few minutes set up the rest of the movie well. Unfortunately, the joke writing was bad. There were a few funny lines, but they were interwoven into a tapestry of mediocrity. I'm pretty biased though because I don't like Charlie Day's shtick. He plays the exact same character as he does in Always Sunny, a really stupid guy who talks a mile a minute and if you listen carefully there's a few jokes in there. I don't enjoy that. I don't really like Jason Sudekis either. I find him bland and he plays an extremely dull character in this as well. You could take him out and the movie would still be mostly the same. Jason Bateman's character seems to be aware he's in a bad comedy. He doesn't really seem to like Sudekis or Day and treats all the wacky situations with a sort of slightly angry distaste. I watched Bridesmaids a few nights ago and enjoyed it way more than Horrible Bosses. That movie also had story line problems, but it had a lot of funny parts. That's all I want a comedy to do, make me laugh. Horrible Bosses didn't really do that for me, as the vast majority of its never-ending dialogue falls enormously flat.",Null,63,133,25 September 2011
Event Horizon," Random Scariest Movie Evah!
","I watched this movie a long time ago. Thank goodness for that, because the horror has finally receded. If you are someone who likes being freaked out and you haven't seen this movie, you need to go rent it now! Now! NOW! Sorry for yelling, but this movie is unbelievably scary. You will not be disappointed. I remember renting it with my best friend because I think we liked space movies and we were like, oh sweet, a new a space movie. Looks good. We had no idea it was a horror flick. I remember sitting there in his basement and becoming engrossed in this movie and it was like he wasn't even there I was so drawn into it. The terror steadily grew and grew and never left. The way I remember it, there were no breaks between the scary parts. It was just unrelentingly scary once it got going. I remember it ending and me and my friend just looking at each other freaked out of our minds. We both thought it was the scariest movie we had ever seen. The weird part is that I can't really remember what was specifically scary about it. I remember some parts with blood and hallucinations and stuff, but I don't remember exactly why it was so terrifying. You'll have to see for yourself. I'll never watch it again.",Null,0,0,30 October 2010
