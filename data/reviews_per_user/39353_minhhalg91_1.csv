Your Name.," Most beautiful & charming movie
","This anime makes me speechless, I watch this movie with very high expectation from all the reviews I have read and it was worth all of the good reviews out there. The scenes were so beautiful, it makes me want to drawn into it, from the view of the Itomi village to the scenes of the comet falling down, everything was outstanding. I was not expect much about the story, just thought it was some boy & girl love story but then I was wrong, the story is much more than that. It makes me think about people we have met, have forgotten, about how people react to the disasters.That's movie is worth 1.5 hour of your life and I truly hope that it can won an Oscar.",10,9,13,12 December 2016
