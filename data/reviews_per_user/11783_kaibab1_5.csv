The King's Speech," Superb acting and script-writing tour de force
","The courage and gallantry of King George VI is a documented fact of history. And another fact of history will, surely, become the fact that this film is one of the finest dramatizations of a momentous period in the history of the West. Words will not do justice to this movie. It is one of ten best I've ever seen --a monumental showcase of script writing and acting. The star studded cast delivers throughout the film --there's an award-winning scene every minute, in lines spoken by Firth, Rush, Jacobi, Carter and Gambon, among others. There is not a superfluous word in the script --every line advances the plot and adds to character description. The close-ups are terrific as the actors transmit every nuance of their feelings in a description-defying performance that nails all possibilities in every scene. You have to see it it to believe it. Absolutely amazing.",10,1,2,18 December 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A l-o-o-o-n-g goodbye to virginity
","Kudos to Hollywood for its skill in stretching one very unoriginal joke into almost two hours of repetitive gags. So how many times are you going to laugh at a morning woody? Or yet another drunken driving sequence? Or a discussion about women's breats? There's about as much original humor here as in the warnings on a package of Trojans, not to mention an utter lack of erotic tension. Romany Malco displays great timing, Catherine Keener shines (as usual) but headliner Steve Carell sinks a notch or two from his excellent corporate jerk role in The Office. He displays a frozen, deer-in-the-headlights stare that becomes tedious after the first half hour or so. Maybe he has come to the realization that there's very little to laugh about in this overblown and blatantly commercial road to penetration --other than the gross-triggered guffaws of gags built around diverse bodily orifices and organs. 40 Year Old Virgin feels like watching the 30 Years War Plus 10 in real time --minus the action and gore.",6,3,10,22 August 2005
Lincoln," Superb
","Spielberg's latest opus can be summarized in four words: 'An American film masterpiece.' From acting to directing to production values (lighting, wardrobe, locations, cinematography, makeup, etc. etc.), 'Lincoln' is simply magnificent. Spielberg's steady hand and Kushner's eloquent handling of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, kept my attention (and my companion's) riveted, from start to finish. In the realm of American movie-making this is one 'for the ages.' There's so much more that can be said for a production that redeems Hollywood, but in a year that has seen several excellent films, this one stands out, as tall as Lincoln's stovepipe hat. Additional words from my side would be superfluous.",10,2,6,13 January 2013
The Departed," Too bloody long... literally
","By the time half of this very l-o-o-o-o-n-g bullets-and-blood saga has rolled by there has been so much violence depicted that the dozen or more graphically depicted additional killings lose most of their shock value. This movie should have been titled 'Overkill.' Also, it includes a tedious overuse of the f-word, now apparently Hollywood's go-to expression when the Muses fail script writers. Then, were one a Boston cop/detective/investigator one would have cause to be plenty miffed at having the police department portrayed, as done here, as being populated by a bunch of screaming bunglers who are badly in need of remedial investigation and surveillance skills. This movie is too long --by 2 1/2 hours. Better watch another 'Law & Order' episode...",4,0,1,14 October 2006
Downfall," Extraordinary chronicle of the demise history's ueber-evildoers
","Words fail to capture the power of this documentary-style re-enactment of the last days of Hitler and the coterie of criminals that made up the upper echelons of 'The Thousand Year Reich.' The performances are phenomenal and marked by a total lack of caricature --straightforward performances suffice to depict the insanity of Nazi criminocracy. The superb cinematography avoids gratuitous violence and gore. In short, this is a film that has to be seen to be believed about times that, unfortunately, cannot be forgotten.Lead actor Bruno Ganz delivers a seamless interpretation of Hitler's last, deranged moments, as he swung from hysterics to introspection. The photography places the viewer alternately inside the dank and narrow confinements of the bomb-proof bunker in Berlin, and the devastated urban landscape of a once great capital... all metaphors for the illogic carnage delivered by Hitler and company.",10,0,1,23 April 2005
