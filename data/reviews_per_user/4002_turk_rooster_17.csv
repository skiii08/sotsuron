Changeling," LA Changing
","Clint Eastwood continues his glittering directorial second coming with Changeling. While Angelina Jolie is perhaps better known for her more 'commercial' performances (with the possible exception of A Mighty Heart), here is a clearly well-deserved Oscar nomination. The movie is about a single mother and her boy that goes missing and her search for that boy. In the course of that search, many wrongs are righted  the LAPD is reformed, laws regarding detention without sufficient evidence are passed, a serial killer is unearthed and executed, a boy returns to his family. And in the middle of all this is the poignant undertone of the search by Christine Collins of her son Walter Collins, alternating between hope and despair and taking the viewer along with both",7,5,7,25 January 2009
Frost_Nixon," Mother of Interviews
","In an amazing character portrait, director Ron Howard (The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, Apollo 13) pits the dilettante-ish English talk show host David Frost (Martin Sheen) with all his charm and naivete and susceptibility to 'mind games', against the redoubtable Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) whose pugnacious redoubtable personality was bruised but not beaten by the experience that was Watergate, in Frost Nixon. The clash of unequals is not concluded by any unexpected victory in favor of Frost  it is perhaps more of a case of the former president clearing a heavy conscience, going through a televised catharsis for all to see. Yes, as the movie mentions, television simplifies, and a single shot becomes the summary statement on a complex and difficult presidential tenure. Witness today's reality shows the need to capture that defining moment that woos audiences and 'sums it all up', while completely missing the undertones, the buildup and the complexities therein. And it takes a brilliant performance by Frank Langella to show us just how acute those nuances can be.",9,1,2,21 February 2009
Inglourious Basterds," The Strangest Resistance
","Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) gives a stunning performance in Tanantino's latest – Inglourious Basterds, - that sees alternate history as two parallel and similar plots are hatched to put an end to the Third Reich. Rather limited in the insanity quotient, and actually serious in parts, the plot revolves around the Nazi-killer team led by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and their encounters. Typical chapter-based Tarantino narration – the first scene about the purge and introduction to the central character of menace, the long scene and encounter wrt Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) in the basement, the showdown between Hans Landa and the German actress, are the most memorable. The inexplicable fact of Shoshanna owning a theater in the heart of Paris explained away rather trivially, the sharpshooter Pvt Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) and his mixed emotions, the ramblings on Goebbels' propaganda, the strange silhouette of Marcel and his giant pile of inflammable film make sure that Tarantino's quirky touch is very much alive and kicking. A mellower, more circumspect Tarantino, but enough to keep fans engaged",10,1,10,16 October 2009
Life of Pi," Lost and Found
","For me, Life of Pi was a yo-yo between overt romanticizing of vignettes of Indian life and times by a non-Indian author, and a movie that has some seriously profound insights in spite of the same. The quaintness of a zoo in Pondicherry, finding religion, the mystique of Indian dance, the uprooting of a family owing to economic circumstances - all had an overtly lyrical, if not particularly original - aura. Then, suddenly, we find Piscine Molitor Patel aka Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) - a castaway in the middle of the Pacific ocean - with all his beliefs called into question. Is there a point to overt faith? Can a human and a large carnivore be (to borrow from Star Wars) symbionts? Where does a man who has lost everything find hope, and the will to move on with one's life? Somewhat if not profoundly moving, Life of Pi is about how we are shaped by our bouquet of experiences, and how, from those experiences, one can draw upon great reserves of strength",7,1,4,6 December 2012
Salt," Salt It
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie)'s talent for the action heroine is obvious, her choice of plot is two decades too late. It is distressing that every aspect of the plot seems to have been drawn from some currently irrelevant Cold War cliché, and, in spite of the same, some of the sequences are barely believable. Cut to the story. An interrogation of a Russian defector reveals that the CIA interrogator – Evelyn – is possibly a double agent (why he gives this information voluntarily to the CIA at large is but one of the faux pas of the movie). In any case, Evelyn performs her dubious role admirably in battling the forces of law and order while fulfilling her near-impossible assassination missions through various decent to good action sequences, and suffice to say that many realities are stretched. When you have finished yawning through the Defcon II and suicide bomber and Universal Soldier-like sequences, the movie trails off rather ambitiously in the quest for a sequel. All the best on that one, Evelyn",5,6,14,24 July 2010
District 9," The Darkest District
","In Metamorphosis, Kafka explores social reaction to a man being transformed into a giant insect. In Blood Diamond, bounty hunter Leonardo DiCaprio shows the best and worst of humanity as he races through strife-torn Africa to liberate a family. District 9 has a Blair Witch Project style reality TV format buildup – aliens land up in Johannesburg with little to offer and nowhere else to go. They are stigmatized ('prawns' as epithet), victimized ('humans only'), and isolated and forced to live in a giant slum on the city outskirts. Their only hope of returning to their planet finds an unlikely hero in the form of Wikus Van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), who, largely motivated by his own desire to return to normal, brings hope of deliverance in a disturbing milieu. District 9 manages to showcase the best and worst of man – persecution and sheer human cruelty, the arms race, and the profiteering from vice, in sharp contrast to the coming of age of Van De Merwe and his last gasp effort that gives the 'prawns' their only last vestige of hope for escaping from the cruelty of man. An outstanding movie and one that, irrespective of the analogies I began with, I find it hard to think of a parallel",10,0,6,16 October 2009
2012," Reserving Judgment (Day)
","Roland Emmerich of Independence Day, The Day after Tomorrow and Godzilla fame brings another (doomsday) magnum opus that seems to be pieced together from all three, with a few dollops from say Volcano and the likes. 2012 starts well and the heightening agitation of Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as events start unfolding that give credence to barely believable theories, and the same along with the sense of urgency of young scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are quite well depicted. In fact it is quite remarkable that the failure of this movie is identical to that of The Day After Tomorrow - a lack of believability in the emotional content - beyond the fact that Jackson Curtis does appear to be quite attached to his kids, every other interpersonal relationship in the movie for some reason appears contrived - and this is just why all of the one hour or so aboard the ark is excruciating. In summary, it will be difficult for Emmerich/ Hollywood to keep attracting audiences to these doomsday sagas with ever-improving special effects alone - the movie needs to hold together with genuine human emotion - the rest is just programming",7,0,1,12 December 2009
The Hurt Locker," Bombs, Away
","Like Enemy at the Gates (snipers), The Hurt Locker focuses on a single war-zone (Iraq, circa today) and one category of soldier (bomb detection squads). Unlike the morality tales like Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom and Body of Lies, there is no lesson purported to be delivered herein. This is about the intensity, and the role of each of the members of an elite bomb detection squad, in the heat of combat. Unavoidably, the groups gets embroiled in other aspects of war that is strictly not their domain, such as sniping across vast expanses of desert, or giving chase to bombers across dark urban alleyways in the dead of the night. The spirit of the group is epitomized by one Marine – who returns injured and cussing from the epicenter of battle to home and family, and then in an epiphanic moment in a supermarket, decides to return to the Bravo Company for another 365 day stint at what he really loves doing. Great 'action' sequences delivered with a deliberate lack of melodrama",9,2,6,2 January 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twilight of the Series?
","In some quirky way, I can actually empathize with a vampire romance series. I suppose there are people out there who would find a love triangle with a vampire and a werewolf respectively, intriguing if not downright tantalizing. And I also suppose that if I had the inclination to read the Stephenie Meyer novel that forms the basis of the series, or had watched the first part, some of the movie may have actually made more sense to me. The fact of the matter is that none of these aforementioned wonderful things came to pass. So here I was, watching The Twilight Saga: New Moon wondering what's going on. Which viewer in his right senses would be moved by the mediocre acting, the uninspired dialogue, and the downright horrific graphics. Was left wondering how the disjointed pieces that came together in the movie fit together. Wondered whether someone actually expected that the revelation of Jakob Black (Taylor Lautner) as a werewolf was actually a matter of suspense. In the end, I could not recall a single thing that I actually liked about the movie. And this is one of those reviews that I am glad I am penning down, because two weeks down the line I am not going to be able to recall a single thing about this eminently forgettable movie",2,8,11,12 December 2009
Avatar," Avatar = Reincarnation or Recycling?
","Avatar does not seem to be a movie that is suited to the cynic as audience (!). What of Ehwa (Gaia?) in a distant planet, an indigenous people with lifestyle and roots in the bounty of nature around them, their inevitable conflict with the human race and its endless quest for resources – this is all schmuck, says the cynic. There is a been-there done that aura about the movie – whether it echoes the indigenous tribes and fragile ecosystem of the Brazilian (and a dozen other) rainforests, or whether the unlimited greed for mineral resources brings to mind America's global warmongering in search of oil, it seems that the core of the movie is drawn around a rehash of all-too-familiar elements and the fact that these elements are of course finding increasing resonance in an increasingly aware world does not take away from the fact that the core of the movie is somewhat unimaginative. But what is undeniable is the sheer quality of the graphics and the overall cinematography – the attention to detail and the sheer quality and complexity of the visual imagery bring to mind Jurassic Park – another genre-defining milestone in the use of technology by Hollywood. This is a movie that is likely to be a resounding commercial success in the short to medium term, but on a more measured inspection both critics and the public may find it wanting",5,6,14,20 December 2009
Enemy at the Gates," Shoot Thy Enemies
","Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris capture both the all-out poignancy of war as well as the frailty of man in the face of personal and extraneous challenge, in Enemy at the Gates. Easily one of the best war movies that I have seen, young Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), sharpshooter from the Urals, finds himself the hero of the Battle of Stalingrad on account of his superlative sniper skills. He also finds love in the beautiful Moscow-educated Tania (Rachel Weisz) and the two catch some fleeting intimate moments in the midst of the horror. The fame and love awaken jealousy in no small measure in Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who clears his conscience in one last cathartic act. And the showdown between the deer-hunting German nobleman sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Vassili is the piece-de-resistance of the movie. It is a rare combination of the depiction of the large-scale brutality of war coupled with the cat-and-mouse game of the two sharpshooters",10,2,4,12 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Someone Transform This Series
","One part of me wants to trash Transformers II – Revenge of the Fallen real bad. Another part, however, asks – what is it we were expecting anyway. Shia LaBeouf, vulnerable and quite the center of affairs. Megan Fox, sizzling, a modicum of dialogue also thrown in for effect. Relentless action sequences (with the side effect of destroying the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This is a teenage movie series, and we stepped in, forewarned of the same, and got everything that we might have expected. The question is – did this movie lift the franchise to a higher level? Did it lend character to Optimus Prime the way it clearly sought to do. Did you want to make up our minds about whether humans should be taking sides in an extraterrestrial battle, or whether the Autobots should be sharing their military technology with humans. I guess not, because this movie did not quite click",4,0,4,12 July 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Super Sleuth movie
","Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law play unconventional super-sleuths as Guy Ritchie boldly re-incarnates Sherlock Holmes. At first, it appears that this is a more of a mix of the typical graphic novel elements - mature themes encompassing the dark occult, complex relationships and the like - than vintage Holmes. The movie eases up after a while, and in the end, when all is clarified, you may be forgiven for having believed somewhere along the line that this was a bit too nouveau a reincarnation. Irene Adler adds a classic touch to the melange, and the female leads as well as the villain and his retinue, are exceedingly well-developed characters. An movie with new dimensions to offer on the central character, an out-and-out hit and a great entertainer that does not falter",Null,0,1,8 January 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Charmed
","Vicky Christina Barcelona, like good food or fine wine, lingers in the senses long after the movie. Vignettes stick in one's mind  in no particular order: 1. The beautiful sights and sounds of Barcelona, in a lovely yellow tint. Last time I remember it is the no less beautiful French countryside in A Good Year 2. A strictly right-side-of-the-brain movie with art and spontaneity and passion 3. Vicky's confused affections that cannot reconcile till the very end 4. Christina's clarity about choosing ambiguity in relationships 5. The torrid Hispanic Elena 6. The matter-of-fact narration that lets you draw you own conclusions, unhindered Watch the movie as a strictly sensory pleasure without judgment. With of course Woody Allen's masterful hand at depicting relationships",7,0,2,7 March 2009
Moon," To the Moon an Back
","The Moon deserves a close description lest I forget later what this was all about (at the cost of giving away some of the movie's secrets). I remember watching Solaris and 2001 and their ilk and the loneliness and silence of space, and I got that same eerie feeling all over when I saw Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) at the fag end of his 3-year long mining stint on the moon. Sam Bell ventures out to study a leak, and finds himself next at the sick bay in the base station. Ventures out again to the crash site, and finds himself – or a copy of himself – at the site – alive. Succeeds in hatching a plan to return to earth and succeeds in bringing the diabolical plans of The Lunar Corporation to light and put an end to the trauma of clone usage in the mines of the moon, all clones that have been implanted with memories of lives back on earth that were never theirs to begin with. A science fiction movie that is convincing, touching and flawlessly executed by Sam Rockwell in two concurrent avatars, and Kevin Spacey as the voice-over for GERTY, the resident robot who faces moral choices – and chooses right",9,0,1,3 January 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Thanks for All the Fuss
","Slumdog Millionaire, for all the great cinematography, does not really capture the essence of Mumbai. Plenty of Indian movies capture the true stigma of poverty, or the true horror of the underworld, far better. Let us for a moment give Danny Boyle the artistic license, and run through the vignettes here. The depiction of poverty is a sham. The rioting is unconvincing. The beggary racket is trite and equally unconvincing. The fact that each answer coincidentially relates to each (painful) vignette in the life of the protagonist is a cruel joke? Is this even a movie worth making a fuss about? There is great cinematography, but in the end I feel sorry for the legions of Indian directors, unwept unhonoured and unsung, whose far better portrayals of Mumbai go unnoticed simply because they lack the 'brand' of a Danny Boyle. If this movie is worth four Golden Globes, some of India's movies of 2008 are worth at least as many Oscars",6,2,5,25 January 2009
Valkyrie," War of Conscience
","What makes Valkyrie clearly stand out from the common or garden Third Reich movie is the depiction of the careful build-up and execution of a plot where a majority of the participants are engaged throughout in a zone of ambiguity where while they are fairly sure of what to believe in, they are not clear about what their role in the same should be. Apart from the clear ideology of von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), the indecision of the likes of Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and the ostensible undying allegiance to the Fuehrer from the likes of Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), make for immense viewing pleasure. In the end, this is a movie set in war where there is not a single genuine battle scene, just the air raids in different circumstances  with his troops and with family respectively  that reinforce in von Stauffenberg his belief in the futility of it all. Rather, this movie is all about strong and carefully constructed character portrayals of a set of distinct individuals who chose to differ from the establishment, but in their own separate ways",7,2,3,28 February 2009
