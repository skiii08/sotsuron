The Ring," not as good as 'Ringu', but not crap either
","I'm big on horror films, so I had seen 'Ringu' about as soon as it hit the US. Here's the american remake. It's not as good, but it's not bad. Excellent acting, creepiness abounds, but it has problems.Why does every little kid in a horror film since 'Sixth sense' have to be weird and creepy? 'Ringu' drenched itself in some of the more obscure horror traditions, and resulted in a post-millenial update of Robert Chamber's book, 'The King In Yellow'. 'TKIY' concerns a book so evil that those who read it, die. It's obscure these days, but it is highly regarded by the Lovecraft mythos afficianados. Along with this, 'Ringu' dips heavily into the vocabulary of David Cronenberg, (more than any film since 'Demons 2'!), and that really got me intrigued. This remake is easier to take, (no subtitles!), but it lacks some of the creepier aspects, and the adaptation of the original story seems foggy. I look forward to further remakes from this series, although the japanese have made several TV-movies tying in with this and that might be a bit much. 'Ringu 2', and 'Ringu 0' really fill in the story, and that would probably be a good thing. It's a good but somewhat confusing movie, with a fascinating history. Although it's better than 'Fear.com', that holds some interest for fans of this, but comes from a different tradition that might not fly well with all fans of this.",Null,0,0,7 March 2004
Children of Men," recycled, over-hyped 'ZPG' retread
","I had great hope when I first saw the reviews. really should have known better. Hadn't seen such juvenile SF fluff since the glory days of my youth. Eerily reminiscent of junk like 'ZPG', but possibly even more empty, and pointless. I just watched the DVD an hour ago, and really, all I can call to mind is Michael Caine smoking a joint of his 'Strawberry Cough' marijuana. good laugh, Michael...Junk SF doesn't die, it just waits 20-30 years, until we forget how stupid, and boring it was, and tries again. This was all bluster, with the most pedestrian 'Action' scenes I've ever seen. I always enjoy Michael Caine, but his part in this was brief, and rather minimal. (he's much better as 'Alfred' in 'Batman Begins'). It tries to present a true Dystopian vision, but it's absolutely nothing we haven't seen done better, before.",4,1,4,25 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Comeback from someone who didn't go away?
","I like Tarentino movies, I have a special place in my heart for this 'Video clerk' made good (Spent time behind a video counter myself), but I can't quite understand all this talk of a 'comeback'. Lets look at the record, with 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown', 'Kill Bill Vol. 1', and various small projects that have been touched by QT. I'm not saying that his work is perfect, but I cannot consider 'Jackie Brown' a failure. I think 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is just another Tarentino movie, albeit one perhaps more obsessed with all his favorite things. I actually expected more gore after all the comments, but this doesn't really paint the screen like a good 'Lone Wolf & Cub'/Baby Cart movie would, although the way the blood sprays out of wounds seems like another tribute. He cooked it up for a comic originally, and it shows. The animated segment was the finest fake anime' I have ever seen, and could probably pass for the real thing. Suspense and mystery, don't really seem to be the main concern here, but I am eagerly awaiting part 2!  I just don't see it as a comeback, since he didn't go anywhere. **** out of *****.                                  --Judex.1--",Null,0,0,2 March 2004
