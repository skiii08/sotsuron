The Mask," You know what, I didn't like it!
","I was about 12 years old when this arrived into our world's and I just didn't join the masses who loved it! I remember in the playground everybody doing there 'P-A-R-T-Why? Cuz I gotta' <--- whatever the saying was, impression. I loved Ace Ventura back then and in idea and execution The Mask was probably worlds better, but my maturity and comical taste preferred Carrey's first film.The story of Cameron Diaz not realizing how big this movie was going to be by asking 'Will my parent's be able to watch this? If so where?' (something like that!) is priceless!The Mask... I liked the 80's cartoon M.A.S.K much better (m-m-MASK!)Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha",Null,2,5,19 June 2003
Alien 3," But how do you reply to Alien & Aliens?
",(TAKEN FROM COMMENTS I MADE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME)Alien 3 is the third best movie from the Alien saga but under the helm of David Fincher (Fight Club & Panic Room) The audience gets a brilliantly dark movie. But I personally found it to be disappointing but what did we suspect!Weaver is reliable as ever but the support cast are not that good really!You certainly got the feeling that Fincher is going to be a great feature film director6/10,Null,0,3,25 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Take a Hike Kojak
","(Taken from previous comments I made under a different name)Yes. It's kids movie. Yes. Lucas just couldn't emulate his original successes. Yes. Saying all that, it still sucked.Sorry, but it did. I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan in the world by a long way, but this was still disappointing.I don't rate Lucas as a director. But it's too late for all that talk now!I hope Jar Jar Binks gets wasted in Episode III!5/10",Null,1,2,25 June 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Great Pop Corn Stuff!
",Steven Spielberg never fails to amaze me... hell I even like 1941! This was just a great film to watch. From start to finish I was enjoying the crazy adventures of this guy... the fact that this is basically based on a actual events makes this film ten times better!Hanks is great support and and this is Di Caprio's best performance in recent years (closely followed by Gangs of New York)The rest of the supporting cast in 'Catch Me if you Can' are also really good (Walken and his BAFTA will prove me right there).It's not trying to be the best film in the history of cinema but it's damn good fun!8/10,Null,0,1,15 June 2003
Wayne's World," Because you and I know that there is no film in this camera!
","(TAKEN FROM COMMENTS I MADE UNDER A PREVIOUS NAME)Wayne's World, surely, has to be the greatest film to come out of cult television show 'Saturday Night Live' probably followed by Wayne's World 2! The creations of Wayne and Garth were inspired! Myers and Carvey show off the skills to the world with good effect.

Alien: Resurrection," Winona Ryder is hot though!
","(TAKEN FROM PREVIOUS COMMENTS I MADE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME)Will there be a Alien 5? This film doesn't help anyone's efforts to push for a fifth movie. They got there main star in Weaver to re-appear as Ripley, they got a great visionary director in Jeunet. They got an actress who at that point was still a huge star that couldn't do that much wrong (well you know what I mean!).But known of that counted for me because in my opinion this film sucked!",Null,0,0,25 June 2003
Happy Gilmore," Adam Sandler at his finest.
","Most hate him, most say they hate him and really own his whole collection but I have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan! Happy Gilmore is my joint favorite along with The Wedding Singer.It has all your usual Adam Sandler ingrediants... Anger/Sport/70's-80's music!The story of a nobody trying to do a good deed for someone else had been done millions of times but there's something about Happy Gilmore that I find original.I mean come on! A little guy on one those horses for a dream sequence was inspired!Christopher McDonald is great as the evil SHOOTERBut this film is made great by the amazing cameo by Ben Stiller as the nurse! BRILLIANT'Hey you know want breakfast'8/10",Null,1,1,19 June 2003
X-Men," There was an X1?
","Do you know I think if Bryan Singer named his recent film X2, X1 no one would have cared! Because if truth be known X2 is far better and superior to the original.... I think both fan boys and cinema goer's in general would agree with me on that one... if not, I'm so sorry!So anyway I think the major flaw is the same thing I had problems with the Matrix Reloaded... You can't win my praise with cool special effects! Because that was the only good thing about X-Men.I don't see why every comic book film must start at the very beginning just to do introduce everyone, what are those misty corners in the background for? FLASHBACKS!!! Ha ha ha ha I am only joking!A weak film, room for improvement and BOY did they improve!6/10",Null,0,0,19 June 2003
The Terminator," I still prefer it!

But we can forget about Titanic!Anyway Arnold Schwarzenegger is THE TERMINATOR - A cyborg from the future sent to carry out and destroy a certain deed! Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor...THE DEED! Michael Biehn (1980's God and 1990's/2000's reject) is a guerilla fighter sent from the future to protect Connor from that bloody big bloke!That police station scene is simply great!9/10",Null,0,0,25 June 2003

","(Taken from previous comments I made under a different name!)This film had great moments of kick-ass entertainment! Namely Yoda without his walking stick!!! Do I get a hell yeah!?!?!The moments I didn't like, were the bits that I knew Lucas had to include like the romance side etc... I wasn't convinced by Hayden Christiensen at all. I thought he was more convincing as a spoiled brat than a young man with issues against the world. I am really looking forward to the last installment! 7.1/10",Null,0,1,25 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wellity Wellity Wellity A Very Good Films Me Thinks...
","...but certainly not a top ten film of all time, as voted on this here site!LotR:FofR is a super film but had a good few many moments where I thought they could have done it better... I do honestly prefer the book to this film!I guess it's because my vision of this book is different to how Jackson did it.There are a lot of fast forward moments in this film and in my book that cannot happen if this is a top 10 film of all time!The cast though are great and yes they got the right people to do this film... Viggo Mortenson was born to play Aragon... I don't know what they were thinking for Stuart Townsend!The opening of the film is probably my favorite part of the whole thing!A good film but not as good as the book and not as good as Peter Jackson's effort for the Two Towers7.10",Null,0,0,15 June 2003

Anyway, he's back but this time thanks to franchise merchandising he's kind of a good guy, because that nasty Robert 'Have You Seen This Boy' Patrick is in town.It begins far too slowly and that is costly as far as it being considered as BEST EVER material.Sadly Arnie Schwarzenegger went on to 'Jingle All The Way' Ed Furlong to drugs and child star a**hole status (Thats why your not in he 3rd anymore mate!) Linda Hamilton went on to be mayor of a town near Dante's Peak!!!

","(TAKEN FROM PREVIOUSLY COMMENTS I MADE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME)Special FX are stunning in this film, I mean amazing! Him going through New York City CGI style. The cast was pretty much correct with Maguire, Dunst, Dafoe and co doing there jobs well enough. But OH MY GOD the dialogue in some places are awful, I mean really awful, especially YOU, YES YOU grandma. I'm going to open some real controversy now by saying I thought the extra NEW YORK CITY scene (with the citizens watching Spider-Dude save little kiddies and love interest), it was a pathetic attempt for the world to stand up and salute America again after one Tuesday 11th September 2001, I'm sorry to be rude but this is the movie business, we shouldn't need such things highlighted in such a way!For what it is all the same7/10",Null,0,0,25 June 2003

Independence Day," I read it's thoughts!
","Now now people let's all calm down shall we! Yes the 1996 Block Buster has aged horrendously in places (dog jumping moment... ouch!) but I like Independence Day... I think it's brilliant 'Friday-Night-Nothing-To-Do-Entertainment' Plus I think there is absolutely NOTHING wrong from the opening to the end of the main attack on earth! It's after all the stuff has gone down where Independence Day gets a little bit to silly for anybodies liking!Will Smith does a fine job as always! Bill Pullman does the stereo-typical president well, Jeff Goldblum is good as the environmentally fussy genius (but in a sub-standard job) David, Judd Hirsch is good as David's father... isn't that enough?!?!?!?!I thick Emmerich and Devlin set up the film in an almost perfect way! From the start of the film right till as I said the explosions, I'm really enjoying it!Just saw the special edition and I think the alternate plane ending is was of the funniest endings ever! Thank God they decided to leave it out!9/10 for the opening 45-60 minutes6/10 Overall!",Null,1,3,24 June 2003
Liar Liar," POOR
",By the time this film came out I had grown out of the slap stick Jim Carrey films (the Ace Ventura films basically!). This was a bit different but relied too much on Carrey's crazy body movement!The support cast don't really match up although I find Maura Tierney strangely attractive (WHOSE WITH ME? HA HA HA)Cary Elwes bless him really has no luck these days in character and film choice! A good talent (Glory) wasted would be the best way to sum up Cary.And as the for the feel good ending... That was too unrealistic film not that Liar Liar is a realistic film that is!Give me the modern day Carrey any day!4/10,Null,0,1,19 June 2003
Man on the Moon," Amazing
","Thus far this is by far the best film that Jim Carrey has been in. All my friends hate this film, because they just don't understand the life of Andy Kaufman... Ha ha ha one said... 'The film was way to unrealistic' Hmmmmm.... They didn't understand the concept that Andy was real... They also couldn't realize why DeVito was in it but not in the TAXI segments... Yeah I don't talk to that crowd much anymore!The cast portray characters with much sensitivity and respect for the memory of Andy Kaufman a man who spent his career annoying America and tricking America no one believed him when he needed them the most. Very Sad.Milos Forman is one of the greatest directors around yet surely should be recognized for this more... ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO's NEST PEOPLE!!!8/10",Null,0,0,19 June 2003
1941," SNL Power
","(TAKEN BY MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS)Spielberg doesn't make horrendously bad movies, he just can't, it's not in his genetics! 1941 came close, critics hated it, Spielberg hated it, I liked it. It's no where near close to a great film, but for what it is, its a amusing look on paranoia in the USA after the PEARL HARBOR attack, alas it would be many years before Hollywood would even consider talking about a comedy to do with the aftermath of 9/11.",Null,0,1,25 June 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Stunning

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Flippin Eck!
","...what a bloody brilliant film this is! So much better than the first! The comical element to this film also helped make this one of the best films in many many years! ...Jackson should have won every award a director could get for this effort... it's a brilliant piece of film making! Even when the likes of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin look like faultering the direction alone solves the problem. ...The weak part of the films IN MY OPINION involved Elijah Wood and that boring but needed scene involving Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving. ...All in all the reason this film is so damn good is because of that amazing Helms Deep battle... which was 10 out of 10 as far as battle sequences go! It had everything from the build up to the conclusion! Mortensen, Bloom and Davies are a great team of actors 10 times better than the Hobbits!9/10",Null,0,0,15 June 2003
Moulin Rouge!," One of the best musicals ever!
","Forget the Moulin Rouge being one of the best (all be it one of the only) musicals in modern history, this film must surely go down as one of the best musicals in the history of the talkies!?!?!?! AND this is coming from someone who really hates the musical genre of movies.There's just something about this film that certainly removes the 'Chick Flick' status making this a movie for all sexes. The visuals are stunning: If this type of effort would have been tried in the 60's people would be talking about all the drug influences in the film! The 'over-the-top' acting is essential, with Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut & To Die For), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting & Shallow Grave), John Leguizamo (Romeo + Juliet & The Fan), Jim Broadbent (Iris & Gangs of New York) & Richard Roxburgh (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen & upcoming Van Helsing) as the evil but camp 'Duke' perform brilliantly in this run-of-the-mill story of romance (I thought it was kind of like the plot from 'Shakespeare in Love' in many ways!)The songs are done well and a bunch of middle aged men singing a segment of Nirvana's cult hit 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was hilarious!7.8/10",Null,4,6,24 June 2003

","Dumb & Dumber back in the day was my favorite comedy of all time, but as I've grown older and wiser other films have overtaken the Farrelly Brothers first assault on Hollywood audiences! But all the same I still have the biggest soft spot for this movie.The team of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels was inspired and hope one day they could do something else together in some form!The situations that occur in Dumb & Dumber are absolutely brilliant in the hilarious way...

I'm not sure!The Farrelly Brothers have taken a done over again story and converted it to a unique piece.The cast are great Cameron Diaz is so much more attractive that film for some reason! Ben Stiller is great as the normal guy, and Dillon is good as the as*hole investigator, Lee Evans as Norm, Lin Shaye has the nosey Magda and Elliott as Stiller's best pal Woogy.My favorite moment would be the 80's scenes for poor old Stiller!

NO WAY... ...but anyway I was intrigued with the progression of the film after all the troubles it had during production. ...Ok so I didn't like the MATRIX RELOADED... the fight scenes were amazing... simply amazing, but it is my opinion that cannot save a film alone, one of this calibre anyway! ...The Zion segments was awful, plain boring! the whole love thing was not needed...Those damn english twins were pants!Good points?Jada Pinkett SmithThe fightsWill Ferrell's spoof of the Architect on the MTV Movies AwardsThe trailer at the end of the film ...because if it wasn't for the shots of Neo and Agent Smith getting ready to brawl in the rain in the trailer, I would have no urge to watch the REVOLUTIONS!REMEMBER THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE MATRIX.

Daniel Day Lewis was superb and was worth watching him alone! ...Diaz' role was pointless and only really a token love interest within the movie. ...The fight scenes are great although the final meeting is a bit of a cop out! ...and that one shot of immigrants arriving in American only to enroll in the U.S army was just amazing!8/10",Null,0,1,15 June 2003
