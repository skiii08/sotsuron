Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm waiting for EPISODE II
","Definitely, all the people that has more than 18 years old (old fans), need an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK soon (with a real script, human and mature characters)....For sure, this movie will take a millions of children for a new star wars fans... but, please GEORGE LUCAS, think in the old fans that are mature, because we want a movie with magic, mystic, suspense, love, and DRAMA).Think for the next episode, in all of us.  TPM was a great movie for the little ones, for me, was just a good film (better of course than any other sci-fi since ID4).",9,0,0,11 June 1999
