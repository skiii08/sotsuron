Despicable Me 2," 'Meh' at best
","I'm slightly confused as to why this ranked number one in the box office. It's an OK movie, but it's not great enough to beat movies that should have claimed number one, such as Pacific Rim.The movie itself has many good intentions, but it focuses too much on the minions rather than around Gru's life with his daughters, and bonding with them. Sure, it pans to the fans' obsession with these yellow Minions, but for those who aren't in love with them, it can lead to a mediocre experience.I've watched it four times. The first two were with other friends, and the other two were alone in the audience. I can't say it's a movie that you should watch alone, because you won't be laughing as hard as in a crowd. The movie starts off great, but after Lucy shows up, the act with the Minions has me a bit unfocused. The skit there is drawn out too long, and even the scenes after that don't keep me on the edge of my seat. The scenes at the mall brought a chuckle at the most from me, but overall, pelvic thrusting from Gru made me feel awkward surrounded by parents who may think that it's inappropriate for their children to be watching. And it sort of is. It's embarrassing. It just gets more and more drawn out, and I really wanted to leave the movie at the halfway point (at the fourth time watching it), because I know I'm not going to get any pleasure watching the rest of it. I do watch movies repeatedly, over and over, but I won't be seeing this movie again. I won't say that I was ever a major nerd for Despicable Me, so maybe that's why my review isn't ecstatic over this movie. I don't feel it earned its place as number one convincingly enough, but hopefully it will be the last of this Despicable Me series.",6,5,9,19 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Best Live Action/CGI Film
","I created an account on here solely because of some of the negative reviews that the movie had received in regards to the producer using this movie as his 'personal fanboy playground'. I find it hard to believe that anyone could not enjoy this spectacular movie, and find it disheartening to see that it's beaten in the office box. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater today. I hadn't really watched the trailers with any particular interest, and the only reason I came to see it was because I'd heard that GLaDOS would be voicing the computers in this. I'd been slumped in my seat, expected to be bored (because of the title), but I was blown away the moment the movie began. I definitely did not expect to see what would carry on throughout the movie, a spectacular sight to behold.There's such a variety of aliens in terms of design, and it really brought me to the edge of my seat, squealing like a fangirl at all of it. The robots were great as well, bringing with it the fiery love I have for the Transformers movies. The human characters themselves, I came to like as well, despite my resilience for liking any human character in a live action film. I felt for them during scenes, and adored the portrayal that many of the actors/actresses nailed on the spot. They came off to me as people that I could see in real life (namely the two scientists). I didn't see any lull in the movie whatsoever. I was constantly drawn to the screen with things that I love. I saw/thought of many references throughout the film, which made it more pleasing to watch as I could relate back to those things. It's like a giant conglomeration/fanfiction crossover. Aliens, Transformers, Real Steel (though I haven't actually watched it yet), Evangelion, Godzilla, Hellboy, Portal (this is the most prominent one, and the one that drew me to the movie in the first place), 2012, and much more. I don't see why anyone would give this movie less than an A unless they were asking to be the bad cop in this reviewing scene. And I'm not stopping at one viewing. I can't wait to see it multiple times, both in normal and 3D, over the next two weeks. It's not a movie that you can see just once. There are so many things to see, and this glorious movie deserves all the attention it can get. Best live action/CGI movie I've seen since Transformers (I'm talking about the CGI on this one, because I don't care as much for the script). I'd say this is my new favorite movie, and I don't play favorites easily.",10,24,39,14 July 2013
Insidious," The concepts are nightmare-inducing
","I don't remember much about this movie after watching it about a year ago, but I can say it had a troubling impact on my ability to live normally for the two weeks afterward.It left me with a disturbing fear of going to sleep, with the thought that I could go into a coma and never wake up. The concepts that the movie presented had me uneasy and unwilling to stay in a room alone for too long, for fear that a demon would be in there as well (and it didn't help that my cat often looks at things that aren't really there. There's always the saying that cats can see spirits and things like that, so it terrifies me).Whenever I hear/read about the paranormal, I really have to force myself not to think about Insidious so that I don't become paranoid about the things that I saw in that movie.I can't give it a rating, because I'm not really in to horror movies, so I can't say that I enjoyed it or thought any of the scare devices were effective. And now that I post this, I know the nightmares are going to come back again. Oh no.",Null,1,2,19 July 2013
WALLÂ·E," All of my Creativity is now Gone
","There is a time when you have to wonder, 'Will I ever see anything that can possibly top this level of intricacy?' Because I have never seen a more beautiful and mind-blowing animated film than WALL-E. This movie has been my number one animated film ever. I never saw it in theaters, my first time being about an hour on the television, but it was one of the most captivating things I had ever seen, so I went ahead and bought it. I do not regret seeing it 15+ times now.There's so, SO much to praise about this. You have to appreciate PIXAR's work on this. It's almost like a silent film, where you go 15 minutes into the film without dialogue, which is impressive because they handled it beautifully. Then, there's the music. I have found my new favorite composer. And THEN there's the graphics. They are beautiful and realistic (well, at least on Earth. Once we reach The AXIOM, humans are a little unrealistic, but then again, they have a great style that contrasts with the live-action video that is played of previous Captains of the AXIOM). Then there's the characters. I don't think most people will get into depth with this, but nearly EVERY character is dynamic in some way, and it all happens from WALL-E's interactions. While WALL-E is a static character, the characters surrounding him change in some way, mostly personality wise. Like an automated bot, learning to wave back at WALL- E. It breaks from the stoic life that robots learn to live with, and teaches them that diversity and personality aren't always such a bad thing.Then there's AUTO. Many people believe he's the villain, but in all reality, he's just following his directives. Many of the directives are so vague/simple, that it creates conflicts with higher priority directives, causing him to have to go against his orders to follow the highest priority directives. I can't even try to get deep enough into this, because it's such a complex ordeal that most people won't understand. He's not the bad guy, though. There's no real 'villain' in WALL-E, really. In fact, if we actually look at who might be the real 'hero' of the movie, it would probably be M-O, due to his actions in the movie that contribute to the success of WALL-E and EVE's actions. And then there's the plot. I love EVERYTHING about it. WALL-E was PIXAR's last 'original' movie. Oh man, there's too many words in my head to describe it. It's just so amazing.And I cried. I cried a lot to this, because of how PIXAR managed to do everything right. I seriously regret not being able to see this on the big screen, but if ever a time comes again that they play it, I will be there to spend all of my money on it.The best animated movie I have ever seen, and if ever a movie manages to triumph it, it will still remain in a special place in my heart.",10,1,2,19 July 2013
The Purge," A bit bland
","With a concept like this, you could go above and beyond in the plot. This movie reminds me a lot of Skyline, which consisted of people running around in a house for the entirety of the movie. Now, I can't say I may have expected something better, or even imagined anything that would be better, as I haven't really thought about what one may do in twelve hours of freedom.If it were to be an annual event in real life, I would have been terrified to death of the concept. I can't imagine why any sane person in the movie wouldn't be at least a bit fearful of the events to come. It's unsettling how calm they are; they put too much faith into security, and that's what really hurt my interest. Events were pretty predictable, but the movie wasn't exciting enough to watch more than once. I can't say I could come up with anything better (rather, I'd show a different scenario), but then again, you can only come up with so much for a two hour span movie.",5,1,4,19 July 2013
