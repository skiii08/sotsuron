","I saw the movie and loved it! Johnny Cash was a little before my time but my parents talked about him constantly. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix did a excellent job! They played the characters extremely well and gave me a great insight into Johnny Cash and June Carter's life. I now understand why my parents were such big fans of them and their music!! I will definitely be buying it as soon as it hit local stores!I really enjoyed the music, Joaquin Phoenix came really close to Johhny Cash's voice,you almost couldn't tell the difference. Reeese Witherspoon sang really well, for a person who is not a professional she done great!",10,0,0,11 January 2006
