The Ring," Like a blockbuster action film - lots of flash and no story
","I went into this film pretty excited. I thought it was going to be a really good scary ghost flick (I'm really big on ghost films).So imagine my disappointment when I found out what it was: just a bunch of flashy 'ooh, our camera is dropping frames, isn't that scary?' scenes, and no real reason for it to be going on.Don't get me wrong. The effects do achieve a good deal of fright...for about the first forty minutes of the movie. After that it just felt like guys in business suits were waving their hands in front of my face going 'oooOOOOoooOOOOooooo' while they took my six fifty and watched their sales skyrocket. Needless to say, the creepiness dwindled considerably fast.The ending of the movie will make you angry, because rather than tie everything together, they instead choose to just do a bunch of random crap. You'll understand what I mean if you see it.Long story short, this movie was just another crappily-written piece of junk with shinier effects than the ones you can rent for a dollar at your local video store. I blame the success of it on all of the dumb people I've ever known...because, honestly, they're the only ones I've ever heard rave about the scariness of this movie.",3,0,1,14 April 2005
