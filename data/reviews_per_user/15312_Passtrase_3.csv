Angels & Demons," Angels and Demons - fantastic thriller !!!
","Angels and Demons is the kind of movie I wanted to see this year . This is probably one of the best thrillers for the past few years . The whole film is worth watching , because : 1.The Story is interesting and it is not a total super-natural-fantastic movie (like The Da Vinci Code was) . 2.The actors : Tom Hanks is great as Robert Langdon , Ayelet Zurer is also fantastic in her role . But I believe that Ewan McGregor played his role perfectly and he deserves (my personal opinion) an award for best supporting actor , his character will not be forgotten , thanks to Ewan McGregor's performance . Angels and Demons is a thriller , that you do not want to miss .",10,2,6,27 August 2009
Star Trek," A New Beginning
","I am a big fan of the ,,Star Trek'' series . Unfortunately the last 2-3 movies weren't very good , so - I expected a promising reboot , at least worth to watch . But , on the end , I was extremely surprised ! This movie is better than all the other series (put together) !!! The visual effects were awesome . The actors - perfect . Chris Pine really looks like a leader , like one true captain of Enterprise . Zachary Quinto plays Spock - my favourite character . I can just say that Quinto looked like a real Vulcan-Human Hybrid . He did his job perfect as a first commander of the ship , most importantly - he was the coooooooooooolest ! What about the script , the other characters , the story ? Perfect too . This movie is something more than a reboot - this is a new beginning of the era , called Star Trek .",10,1,9,29 May 2009
The Dark Knight," Probably the best movie ever !!!
",",,The Dark Knight'' ! Another Batman movie ! I was asking myself - is this movie going to be cool ? Is this movie going to be exciting ? And now I have the answer - YES ! This was absolutely the best movie I've ever seen in my life ! The script , the actors , the story - everything was great ! Really , I didn't actually for a second thought that this movie is going to be one of the best movies EVER , but I was wrong . I am a big fan of Batman and Christian Bale . And I was STUNNED when I saw that ,,The Dark Knight'' is one of the best movies ever ! And I think that this movie is not one of the best movies ever - THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE AND SEEN !!! Like I said - everything was awesome !I hope for another Nolan-Bale Batman movie !!! This movie deserves an Oscar for the best movie of the year !!! That's all !!!",10,3,7,3 December 2008
