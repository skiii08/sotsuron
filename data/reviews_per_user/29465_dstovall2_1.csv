The Blair Witch Project," Horrible Movie, Marketing Genius
","Spoiler Alert, The only genius in this movie was marketing. It was a very low budget poorly acted movie! Many were convinced by the marketing, that it was a true story. That they had found a video. This was a movie, a work of fiction. I thought it must be well acted, to convince so many that it was real. Then when I saw it, I could not see how anyone would have believed it to be real. It looked more like, teens at a camp playing around video, than a movie. It was not scary. The only suspense was when would it end. Pass this up, unless you want to see the worst movie to gross over a hundred million dollars. I gave it a 1 but it does not deserve that.",1,11,20,17 April 2004
