Deja Vu," Mildly entertaining drivel
",Our summary is all we can say about this film really. It wasn't the worst we've ever seen but was it a cop movie? Was it a sci-fi? Or was it a film from CSI guy Jerry who has to make sure all the loose ends are tied up badly? As others have noted it starts off OK but then tails off into this weird world of the same old rubbish about wormholes and entropy with plastic acting and a plot with holes large enough to put Val Kilmer's over-sized head throughDon't bother with this unless you really have no other options on a Sunday night and want to get to sleep early...,3,5,11,15 July 2007
War of the Worlds," Absolutely awful....
","........I begrudge having to spend too much of my time commenting on this terrible film, but feel I must warn you - quite simply a tragic effort at a supposedly tragic storyline.Less than mediocre performances from Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning but worse than this is Spielberg's conveyance of H.G. Wells' classic. The special effects do nothing to drag the movie out from underground where in my opinion it should be buried with the Martian machines.As far as stirring emotions goes, the world scale disaster and human need for survival did cause a passing feeling of sickness, however this was soon diminished by the fact that if you're Tom Cruise, the killer beam always seems to pass you by.....hmmm.Don't waste your time.",1,7,27,2 July 2005
