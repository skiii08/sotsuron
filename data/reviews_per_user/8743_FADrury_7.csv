Come and See," A Witness to Atrocity
","This film follows the path of a young boy as he confronts the incredible brutality of the partisan war in the Soviet Union during WW II. The film starts with the boy joyfully going off to join the partisans while his mother shrieks with fear. However, when the partisan band heads off, he's left behind due to his youth and innocence. As a result, he becomes a witness to the atrocities visited upon his village and others nearby by a wandering einsatzgruppen unit that takes great pleasure in its grisly task of extermination. The film is episodic and takes some unusual turns (the effort to put up the dummy German is one). This is film about images, not words. There is remarkably little dialogue throughout much of the film. It's also brutal and graphic. A great deal of the horror of this films comes from the simple joy (and conviction) that the Germans bring to their goal of wiping out the population.",7,2,5,2 May 2005
Alien," Simply One Scary Movie
","I am not a big horror fan and normally don't care for gory horror films. However, I generally love science fiction and was very curious to see what this film was all about (I saw it when released in 1979). Well, all I can say is it scared the hell out of me!!! In fact, when the movie was over, the lights came up in the theater and nobody moved or said anything.  That's how powerful this movie was back in 1979. As noted in many other comments, this is a well constructed film that has the ability to keep drawing you in when, in the back of your mind, you're saying 'I don't want to go there!' It's a testament to the quality of this film that my parents (who were in their fifties at the time and had never seen anything remotely like this in the movies in their entire lives) sat through the whole thing on HBO.No real need to go over the story because, by now, almost everyone has a rough idea of what the 'Alien' films are all about. I will say that there was a direct predecessor done in the 50's.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the name. I rented it years after seeing 'Alien' and was struck at how closely it resembled the more modern film and how some scenes were pretty scary for the time.  Anyway, I recommend this film.  As noted by many, it may not hold the same impact today after years of increased gore and shock. But, I think for a lot of people, it will still hold your attention and still scare the hell out of you!",Null,0,1,29 October 2003
Pearl Harbor," Tries to be three movies and misses out on being one
","I had really been looking forward to 'Pearl Harbor' when I saw the previews. Once I saw the long string of bad reviews, I decided to hold off and watch it on video.  Well, it earned those reviews. 'Pearl Harbor' really tries to be three movies: 1) A historical account of the attach on Pearl Harbor; 2) A love story framed by that attack; 3) A story of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. I imagine that the producers were banking on audience having no interest in older films, because each of these themes was done much better in 'Tora, Tora, Tora,' 'From Here to Eternity,' and ' Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.'  If you're interested in the story of Pearl Harbor, a torrid romance framed by the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid, just rent these three films and you'll get a much better sense of the whole thing.  Yes, I admit that some of the action scenes in the attack were good.  But there's an awful lot of bad movie surrounding those scenes.  It's a shame because I'm sure many Pearl Harbor survivors were hoping that their experience would get the same respectful treatment (and intensity), that Speilberg gave the guys from D-Day.  That treatment is still to come.",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Powerful Mood Piece
","'Good Night and Good Luck' presents the McCarthy hearings of the 50's through the prism of a very particular individual, broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, and the organization he worked for, CBS. While many people have commented about the failure of the film to place these hearing in historical context, or the political viewpoint (anti-McCarthy) the films is expressing, I think these observations are a bit off mark. While Clooney is definitely taking a political position, I believe his main purpose is to convey the mood of that time, that place, and those people. Once the decision is made to directly attack McCarthy, there is real fear present among the participants. Clooney also is willing to include details that tarnish the halo around CBS and Murrow. The loyalty pledges are signed, Murrow is chastised for pulling some punches on some McCarthy misstatements. In addition, the sub-plot about the 'hidden' marriage of two of the characters adds to the tension. Fear doesn't just come from big, politically-charged issues. Even a liberally-minded employer can reach into your personal life and the impact can be just as potent.If think if you see this movie as a mood piece, it succeeds masterfully. If you want the history, there are plenty of better places (of varying political viewpoints) where you can learn more.",Null,3,5,30 December 2005
Titanic," Excellent in Parts, but I still prefer 'Night to Remember'
","I have long been interested in the Titanic since reading Walter Lord's great book 'A Night to Remember' over 30 years ago.  I loved the film made from the book and own it.  So, I was interested when 'Titanic' hit the screen. However, this film just didn't do it for me as a whole. I found the love story between Jack and Rose unconvincing.  I really found the whole character of Rose hard to take.  While recognizing that she was in a bad spot, she came off to me as so egocentric and petulant that there were times when I felt like she deserved Billy Zane (great as a nasty.  Billy Zane has the perfect looks for the early 20th century parts).  So when she hops in the sack with Jack, it looked like a nice fiery diversion that probably wouldn't have lasted two weeks once the boat docked.  But, the boat didn't, which brings me to the parts I like best.We have some friends who are naval architects and, according to them, 'they sunk the boat real good!'  Also, I found that Cameron really did capture the terror and tragedy that affected the nameless passengers who went into the water and went down with the ship. I found most of the sections of the moving that didn't involve the main characters better than the hissy fits going on in first class.  One thing that did surprise me was the absence of the story of the California, a ship that was sitting within 20 or so miles of the Titanic with its radio off.  That was one of the most poignant elements of the real story.  I don't know why Cameron didn't include it. Overall I give it a 7 of 10.",Null,1,2,12 May 2004
300," Spartan Propaganda on Steroids
","'300' provides a highly imaginative depiction of the battle at Thermopylae. The film outlines the story of the 300 Spartans who held the pass to the end until overwhelmed by the Persians (and a little Greek treachery to boot!) The film is visually stunning and is certainly worth viewing if you are a fan of great visuals. You must keep in mind when viewing this film that this is actually a fantasy version of the events at Themopylae. The Spartans are depicted as maniacal supermen who disdain all the other Greeks and the Persians even more. I think this is carried too far, since the Spartan only comprised a small portion of the total Greek forces in the original battle. However, the Spartans did go down fighting (with the Thebans and some others). I'm sure this film is very popular in today's Sparta. But I'm sure it ticks off most of the rest of Greece!",6,0,1,24 September 2007
Windtalkers," The Invasion of Saipan with an Occasional Navaho thrown in
","If you are looking for a film that will provide you with the story of the Navaho Codetalkers, this really isn't your film. If you're look for a war flick with plenty of gore and where everything seems to explode in massive fireballs (just like in the Simpsons!), this is your flick.While the title focuses on the Navaho Codetalkers, most of the film is really taken up with inflated actions scenes and stock characters. While there is some effort to show the training of the Codetalkers, how they were actually used is obscured (they didn't call in coded fire missions) and some of the scenes are just ludicrous. The scene where one of the codetalkers poses as a Japanese soldier taking a Marine prisoner is pretty silly. I guess the Japanese officer they approach must have assumed this soldier was from Japan's wild west.In essence, the 'Windtalkers' theme is just something to catch you eye and make this film 'different.' John Woo really didn't want to make a film about the Navaho Codetalkers. This film is just an exercise in explosive excess.",3,17,27,21 July 2005
