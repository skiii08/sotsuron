Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effect, weak story
","The story is weak comparing to the old three Star War movies. Many details are vague. This is not a stand-alone movie. Both video and sound effects are great -- thanks to today's computing technology. After watching this movie, I was more or less disappointed. I was expecting a more interesting or stronger story, not just the effect. Everybody can make a great effect if investing enough money.On the other hand, what can we expect after all?",7,0,0,11 June 1999
