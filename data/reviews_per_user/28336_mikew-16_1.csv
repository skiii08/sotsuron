Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas should have called this 'The Broken Promise'.
","After twenty years of waiting, we are rewarded with this crap, exasperated only by the insane exploitation in retail, fast food and anywhere else you look.  What's wrong with the film?  Start with Jar Jar.  This character is neither funny nor intelligible.  The Jedis.  As an audience member, how can I share in the drama if the Jedis never break a sweat.  The plot.  An elected Queen (destined to fall in love with a character 12 years her junior) is having some kind of trouble in the Senate where the bad guy is to be the emperor?  Oy vay.  The insults.  Is there a group not insulted by this movie?  How about Asians, Blacks and Christians?  Perhaps Hispanics will be insulted in the next movie.  I was once Lucas' largest fan, now I regret ever supporting him.",Null,0,1,27 October 1999
