Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Boring.
","Not a very amusing premise. One not very funny joke that just goes on and on long past its expiration date. I'd like my time and money back.Many of those in the apparent target market won't realize the real joke is on them. Several of the unwitting 'stars' of the movie are now suing, but I have to believe that they were only exposing their true feelings when they said and did what was shown in the movie.Some of the others featured in the movie were trying to be nice and helpful, but were cruelly insulted and embarrassed.It really isn't funny to keep pushing people to see just how far you can go before they stop being polite to you. Especially when that doesn't end the rudeness.Humor doesn't need to be Politically Correct, but it does need to be funny. This movie was not funny.",1,106,213,11 November 2006
