Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Building up the story
","This film could have been to good with the new film technology at hand but it simply fails because of the lack of story, excitement and childishness. It is somehow saved by references to the other movies and old characters like yoda and the emperor. Also a plus for darth maul. However, it seems that the sole purpose of this film is to build up to the coming movies.",6,0,1,14 October 1999
