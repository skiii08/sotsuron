The Incredible Hulk," Potentially Underrated MCU film
","'The Incredible Hulk,' not to be mistaken with its 2003 counterpart, is an underrated film, that is usually forgotten to be a part of the MCU.Edward Norton plays a much different Hulk than Eric Bana or Mark Ruffalo and I think it works really well. We also have Liv Tyler as Bruce Banner's girlfriend, Betty, who is probably one of my favorite female characters in a comic book movie.While the CGI is far from perfect and the Abomination, is an abomination CGI-wise, there are a couple of scenes where I genuinely liked the CGI. There were also some really neat landscape scenes in Brazil that I thought added something to the film.2008 Hulk is a bit of slow-burn at points and it's definitely not perfect, but I still found myself enjoying it and if you're like me, and haven't seen it in a while, go give it a second shot.",6,0,0,13 March 2018
Darkest Hour," Unexpectedly enjoyed this more than I thought I would
","I'm never been a history nut, so I didn't know what to expect going into 'Darkest Hour.' I knew about Winston Churchill, I knew that he gave a ton of iconic speeches during World War II and he helped represent Great Britain, but that was about it.What I didn't know as that Churchill wasn't liked by many people before and during his reign in Parliament. Now that alone didn't get me to like this movie, but I did end up enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would.'Darkest Hour' benefits from Gary Oldman's fantastic performance as Churchill and how he interacts with the other characters. He's a bit of smart ass, he's great with words, and he has a full on hatred for Hitler that causes him to allow thousands of people to die on the battlegrounds, just so that he doesn't have to have peace terms with the man.He wants to win the war, not surrender, and he goes to the citizens of Great Britain to make sure that they're on his side. And of course they are.The 'Darkest Hour' wasn't quite good enough to make my Top 10 films of 2017, but it was a really great period piece and if you enjoy anything around the World War II period, you're sure to enjoy it.",7,0,3,13 March 2018
Final Destination 2," Not as good as the first, but still great
","Final Destination 2 is a great sequel to the original. It continues with the first film's premise, while incorporating a couple of new elements and twists and turns without being boring or annoying.The inclusion of a character from the first film helps easily tie the films together, which the future sequels can have a bit of a problem with.One of the franchise's strong suits is its ability to have extremely entertaining deaths. This one takes those deaths to a new level and has some of the best in the series.I don't like this one as much as the first one, but it is a close second. Definitely give it a watch if you've seen the first one.",7,0,0,13 March 2018
Suicide Squad," This movie is garbage.
","This movie is garbage.I have nothing great to say about it. The soundtrack was cool, except it made no sense. They just sprinkled in different songs, with some of them being covers.Will Smith was great as Will Smith. Margot Robbie is attractive and she plays a comic accurate Harley Quinn. Killer Croc has 'haha lol' one-liners. Captain Boomerang exists.But Slipknot is the best character. He's the guy that climb anything.The Enchantress is a terrible villain. The only worse villain than her was Amanda Waller, the person that started the Suicide Squad.Will Smith says the words 'Are we some kind of Suicide Squad' in the movie.The editing looks like it was done by a trailer company. Oh wait - it was done by a trailer company.Don't watch it, it's bad.",3,1,2,13 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of the best films of 2017!
","I came into 'Three Billboards' with zero expectations. I hadn't seen the trailer. I knew nothing about the premise. I was just there to watch the 9 Best Picture Nominees for 2017 and this was one of them.I walked out of this film knowing that it was one of my favorite films of the year and my top film out of the Best Picture Nominees.'Three Billboards' is about a woman who's daughter was raped and murdered, yet the local police have tossed her case to the side, so in order to get their attention, the woman (played by Frances McDormand) buys advertising on Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (the name of the film) directed with controversy towards the chief of the police station.All of a sudden, the chief starts looking over the case again.If this was any other film, it would've been a predictable Life Time TV movie. It's not though. Unlike other films, there were predictions that I made, subconsciously, and the actual outcomes were completely out of left field. I was constantly shocked at some of the events that actually happened, making this a very entertaining film.All of the lead actors had phenomenal performances, so it was no wonder that Frances McDormand was up for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson were both up for Best Actor.'Three Billboards' was a special film and if you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely make it a priority!",10,3,6,13 March 2018
Baby Driver," I was glued to the screen the entire time!
","After watching all of the Best Picture nominees of 2017, I'm still baffled by the fact that 'Baby Driver' didn't receive a nomination.In fact, I'll go ahead and say it - 'Baby Driver' was my favorite film of 2017. I'm upset that it took me so long to actually watch it, cause I would've loved to see it in theaters, but I've seen it twice now and it was just as amazing the second go around.Edgar Wright does such a fantastic job of mixing music with the editing of the film that while it is a 'gimmick,' it feels much more than your ordinary gimmick.I should also point out, I have yet to see another Edgar Wright film. This was my first one. (I have the Cornetto Trilogy on Blu-ray now, so I'll be watching them soon).This is one of the only films that I've felt glued to the screen the entire time. I never felt it drag and the two hours go by so fast that I could easily rewatch it immediately.The acting is fantastic from everyone. The story, while serious for the most part, does have some great comedic moments. There were also a ton of little easter eggs that are cool to go back and see on a second watch.If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend 'Baby Driver.'",10,1,3,13 March 2018
Justice League," It's okay.
","'Justice League' is an okay DCEU film.Part of me enjoyed it, but part of me didn't.I think a big part of this film is that it just feels like it's not complete. My biggest worry going into it was:
'Oh no, they've got to introduced three new characters, a new villain, revive Superman, beat a villain, and be a good movie - all at once.'Fortunately, the introduction of the The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were all great. They didn't feel forced, they weren't introductions like 'Suicide Squad,' they were great. Along with that, the interactions between the characters of the Justice League worked really well also.There was more comedy in this film, much like 'Suicide Squad,' except this was actually funny.The thing I didn't enjoy as much was the plot. Steppenwolf wasn't an awful villain, he just wasn't a major villain. Considering the fact that the film was supposed to setup Darkseid and actually use him as the main villain, you can kind of see what we're missing here.And it's kind of unfortunate. After the great film that was 'Wonder Woman,' we were all expecting a great 'Justice League.' Instead, it was just okay.At least it's not nearly as bad as Suicide Squad.",5,0,1,13 March 2018
Man of Steel," Not perfect, but it's good
","Coming into Man of Steel, I had heard that it was bad. The reviews were extremely mixed and since I'm not a big Superman fan, I was pretty sure I wasn't gonna like this film.But hey, I did like it. A good bit.I read this somewhere and I have to agree:'Man of Steel is the Superman movie for people who are not Superman fans.'It's completely true. Here we have a more human-like Superman, who makes a few mistakes, who does a thing at the end that a lot of people hated. And yet, that's why I liked this film.It's not perfect, none of the DCEU films are perfect, but Man of Steel jump started me into that Universe as a great standalone film, Henry Cavill played a great Superman, and this movie looks really pretty.If you haven't seen this one yet, I'd recommend it.",7,0,1,13 March 2018
Dunkirk," War is the main character and I love it
","'Dunkirk' is a relentless 1 hour and 46 minutes of war... and I love it.This was a first for me - on a couple of accounts. It's the first War film I've ever seen, but it's also the first Christopher Nolan film I've ever watched.I know, I still haven't seen the Dark Knight Trilogy (and I'm a Batman fan). It's a weird contradiction.'Dunkirk' does this really interesting thing, that while there are characters and you obviously don't want them to die, there's not your typical:'Here's Joe. Joe has a wife and kids at home. Let's hope that Joe doesn't die, so that he can go home to his kids. Oh, no. Joe just died!'It doesn't have that, because the main character in 'Dunkirk' is the battle of Dunkirk. The sights, the sounds, and the raw emotions are what you get in this film and it's amazing.Nolan does quite a few fantastic things when it comes to the production of this film. I love the timeline element, where there's three independent stories happening within the span of a week, a day, and an hour, respectively.I also love the fact that there's very little CGI, if at all. There are real planes, real boats and thousands of real people.Whether you like War films or not, this is a great film to just get immersed in. Go see it if you haven't already.Hear me talk more about 'Dunkirk' here: youtu.be/HfSouIJXGhw",10,2,4,13 March 2018
Get Out," Strikes the perfect balance between comedy and horror
","Best Picture Nominee:I've seen 'Get Out' twice now. Once with a group of friends way after it released on Blu-Ray and the second time in theaters during the Oscars 2017 Best Picture Festival and both times I have loved this film.'Get Out' strikes this perfect balance of being a comedy and a horror film, while simultaneously being social commentary about racism.The political message works really well here, but it's not the only thing going for it, which can often times be the case for films that push a strong political agenda.The entire cast did so well, that I was scared for Chris and genuinely creeped out by the entire Armitage family. The setup is near perfect, building up the appropriate amount of suspense that we needed for the later half of the film, with the ending keeping me on the edge of my seat literally until the very last scene.I'm glad that 'Get Out' won Best Screenplay and if it had won Best Picture, I wouldn't have complained at all. If you haven't seen it yet, go give it a watch!",10,35,73,13 March 2018
Call Me by Your Name," I was bored
","This film was a bit unsettling. Not because it's about two homosexuals (they honestly don't even play into these themes until the second half of the film). My problem with it lies in the fact that one of the characters is 17, but looks 12, and the other is 24, but looks 30.Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue.With all of that aside, technically the film is visually pleasing to look at. It's set in Italy and there are many great shots of the country.'Call Me by Your Name' didn't do anything for me though. It was bland and boring for most of the film and felt way too long.The ending also cheapened any kind of progressive message they wanted to come through.If you're okay with a slow-burn, you might enjoy this one though, so give it a shot if you want.",5,10,36,13 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's a different Star Wars film
","'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' was a weird film in the franchise for me. There were parts that I really liked, such as, the development of Kylo Ren as a character and a lot of the visuals and fight scenes.And there were parts that I really didn't liked, such as, floating Leia, Raffiki Yoda, Rose x Finn, and the Casino Planet.I still need to do a rewatch (in fact, I've only seen all of the Star Wars films once), but through the first watch, I had a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of unexpected answers from previous questions.'The Last Jedi' is very much a film that you have to watch yourself to determine if you'll like it or not. Especially if you're a Star Wars fan.",7,4,10,13 March 2018
Beauty and the Beast," An almost perfect live-action adaptation to the original
","Growing up I had to watch a lot of Disney Princess films. I have five younger siblings and four of them are girls - so I saw them all. Fortunately, I never found them to be bad and I actually always really enjoyed 'Beauty and the Beast.'So seeing that there was going to be a live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' intrigued me and fortunately - I also really enjoyed it.I have to say that this was a perfect adaptation to the original. They never went out of their way to try to make it something different or unique and I'm glad they didn't.The visuals and set design was phenomenal and all of the actors did a really great job.My favorite part of the original though was the music and this one doesn't disappoint. There were a few moments where I didn't think Emma Watson gave the best performance she could musically. She definitely looks the part, playing a stunning Belle, and again, the acting is great, but there are moments where her singing falls a bit flat. Not bad, she's a good singer, but not necessarily great at times.Other than that little nitpick, I really love this film and it's made me want to go back and rewatch the original.",8,1,2,13 March 2018
The Shape of Water," Deserved its Best Picture of 2017 Academy Award
","From the moment this film started, I knew I was in for a treat.Where to start with this one?'The Shape of Water' is fantastical and breathtaking. The main character is a mute woman, yet she conveys so much emotion throughout the entire film. The cast is diverse, without suffering from stereotypes.The soundtrack is phenomenal. I plan on buying the CD when I get the chance. The main theme is sooo good.The set pieces, the visuals, the way some of the scenes are shot, the fishman himself. Everything is so beautiful.The villain, played by Michael Shannon, is fantastic. A bit cheesy at times, but it just works.I've only seen this film once and I'm dying to see it again. It won Best Picture of 2017 and it completely deserved it, even if it wasn't my top choice.Guillermo del Toro created a masterpiece here, go watch it!Hear me talk about 'The Shape of Water' more here: youtu.be/HfSouIJXGhw",10,34,61,13 March 2018
Wonder Woman," Best film in the DCEU
","After watching the awful 'Suicide Squad,' I got the chance to rewatch the amazing 'Wonder Woman.'This was the first DCEU film that I had watched and I had the pleasure of seeing it in theaters. It's a great standalone film and it never had the need to connect with the rest of the DCEU - which is what the DCEU needed.Gal Gadot plays a fantastic Wonder Woman. The first 2/3rds of this film are near perfect. There's great chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, as Steve Trevor. The world of Themiscyra was breathtaking. The comedy, while sparse, was funny.I really love this film.The only thing I didn't enjoy about it was the villain. He's just bad. There's a twist that happens in regards to the villain and that was fine, but it still wasn't great. If the third act had been better, this could have been closer to a 10/10 for me.There's very few people I wouldn't recommend 'Wonder Woman' to - go watch it!",9,3,5,13 March 2018
Black Panther," Over-hyped, but met with excellence
","While Black Panther is a film that was over-hyped, I do think a majority of its hype was met with excellence. We're looking at a Marvel movie that didn't have its stereotypical humor filled roots and instead, went for a more serious story with breathtaking world-building and a cast that delivers.While this isn't a perfect film, I had very little qualms with it. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was a single joke that felt entirely out of place (you know exactly what I'm talking about, if you've seen it). Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I can't wait to see it again when it comes out on Blu-ray.",9,2,10,13 March 2018
Iron Man," The beginning of something great
","The first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was such a fantastic beginning.Here we have a B-list superhero, being played by a B-list actor who transforms the character into a A-list superhero making Robert Downey Jr. now a A-list actor. It's actually quite amazing.The best part about this film, is the fact that it is a standalone superhero film, while also being the beginning of a cultural icon. We didn't know that the MCU was gonna be a thing, but it didn't matter anyways, because this film was still great on its on.The only thing that I didn't care for was the villain. Obadiah Stone as the Iron Monger was just a jealous man, in a bigger suit than Iron Man's, that ends up losing. It wasn't anything special and it's the biggest thing that most people will criticize Marvel for in their Phase 1 of movies.However, 'Iron Man' did so many great things, that it's only flaw really doesn't matter that much.If you love Superheros and haven't seen 'Iron Man,' I don't know what you're waiting for. Additionally, if you love movies and haven't seen 'Iron Man,' there's still something great for you here.",8,1,1,13 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not perfect, but good.
","Much like 'Man of Steel,' critics and fans alike disagreed about 'Batman v Superman.' Much like 'Man of Steel,' I actually enjoyed this film.And much like 'Man of Steel,' this film isn't perfect.Here we have a few moments were the plot is flawed, there are numerous pacing issues, and why Wonder Woman is in this film, is beyond me. Either way, I think the good outweighs the bad.'Batman v Superman' does a great job at world-building. It brings together three of DC's best characters on the big screen for the first time ever. Ben Affleck as Batman was way better than I ever could have imagined it to be. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is my perfect woman. And Henry Cavill returning as Superman is just as good as Man of Steel.The actual fight between Batman and Superman is dope, but it makes no sense why it actually occurs. It also makes no sense how it ends, but it was what made this film possible.'Batman v Superman' is much more a Justice League Origins film than anything else. This is both a flaw and a great thing. Either way, if you enjoyed Man of Steel, you'll enjoy this film and if you want a darker Superhero film, this might just be for you.",6,0,4,13 March 2018
Final Destination," I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while.
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-w8NjxzWcI started a series called 'RECAP' on YouTube where I recap and review movies, anime, TV shows and more. I'm going through the Final Destination series as the first movie franchise and it's been interesting going back and watching these films again after so many years. I know they're older, but I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts about them as well. I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while. In terms of a premise for a film, Final Destination was the first of its kind. It's execution in discussing premonitions and death's design is really well fleshed out. We get tons of disturbing, but amazing death scenes, and the rest of the franchise pretty much does the same. As we continue to take a look at the rest of the franchise though, we will start to notice that these things that made the movie unique, ended up creating a ton of clichés. This could be for better or for worse.To say that Final Destination is a horror film is a bit of a stretch, though it definitely has a few moments where you can feel uneasy and the gore is very apparent when it's main attraction is death. I would have to say though that this movie is more of a laugh fest at times than a horror film, of course, I myself tend to laugh at most horror films anyways, so some of that is just me. The acting surprised me the most. When you think of a movie with teenagers in it, you'll commonly think that it's going to be a bad film and then together with the fact that this is a quote-on-quote horror film, the two don't really mix. But this particular group of actors worked really well together and played each of their stereotypical parts without being overly dramatic. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter to be exact, the actors that played Alex and Clear, both showed emotional attachments to their part. Not to mention the fact, that Tony Todd as a coroner was practically the perfect casting.The cinematography was really well done. Even though the foreshadowing was pushed in our face every few minutes, at least it was done with some really neat shots with tons of close ups. What made the deaths particularly interesting, was the fact that some of these close up shots didn't have a thing to do with the actual death, so we actually had to guess what would end up being the final straw that broke the camel's back. James Wong, the director and lead screenwriter of the film did an excellent job with this one. You could say that that's not too surprising, since he's also worked on The X-Files series. But he also did Dragonball Evolution...For a movie that's now almost 18 years old, I must say, Final Destination is still worth watching. It's ironically good at times and for the most part, it's a pretty good film in general. I find myself enjoying it through and through. If you can get past the teenage stereotypes and the sometimes goofy and impossible deaths – this is the movie for you.",8,0,0,9 August 2017
Deadpool," Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever
","I saw 'Deadpool' on Valentine's Day 2016, the day that it released. I've now seen it about six other times. This movie is fuckin perfect.If you love the character, Deadpool, you'll love this movie. Hands down. It's a perfect adaptation, which means the comedy is great, the action is great, the characters are great. Everything is great.Go see it if you haven't and take me along with you, so that I can see it again.",10,1,3,13 March 2018
