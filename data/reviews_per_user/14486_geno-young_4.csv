It," I now have even more appreciation for the original.
","This is the way that I see it. If you wanna be scared and awed, watch the original. If you wanna see a lot of expensive CGI tricks played for shock value, then this is your film. At times I wasn't sure if I was at a movie or a CGI convention. This movie looked TERRIFYING in the trailer, but I wasn't afraid ONCE! The jump scares didn't even work. There's a difference between a film pushing the envelope, and being just plain over-the- top for the sake of crowd pleasing. This one relies on cheap jump scares and graphically gory/macabre imagery at the expense of great storytelling and character development. The kids are all likable characters and their acting is compelling, but their lines and COUNTLESS sexual jokes are tedious, disgusting and depraved. Plain and simple. They make for a very uncomfortable atmosphere. How many times can you spout off the same old 'yo momma' and d-ck jokes that are older than time itself? It gets very tedious VERY soon! But enough on that, let me get to Pennywise. Bill Skarsgård gives one heck of a performance in this picture, and it's the only reason, I MEAN THE ONLY REASON why I'm giving this film a 5/10 rating. He's over-the-top and really hams it up on this role; he's clearly having fun. But his job isn't to have fun in this role, it's to be terrifying and to stick with the audience and haunt them after they leave the theater, and for decades to come. Tim Curry's Pennywise scared me before I even saw the miniseries, the cover alone caused me to steer clear of the film for YEARS (and that's saying something because I'm a horror buff). But Skarsgård's colorful performance will not have that haunting effect, I'm afraid. I'm not even trying to be extra critical, he simply wasn't scary. There are few things scarier than Tim Curry's pasty makeup and terrifyingly haunting grin on the cover of the original film. Skarsgård's Pennywise tries to be too over-the-top which is where he fails. Less is ALWAYS more in horror films. Graphic imagery and cheap jump scares CANNOT substitute for the terrors of the mind, which is where the original triumphs. Blood and guts are appealing, but not scary. SUSPENSE is what's scary, which this film has none of. Even the clown's makeup isn't scary, Tim Curry's pasty white makeup, and those eyes, oh those eyes, is absolutely horrific to this day. Because of its simplicity and lack of features, you kinda cast your own fear upon IT. It's all psychological, that's the premise of 'IT.' This thing that plays on your deepest darkest fears. Many people dislike the original because of its pacing. I have news for you, in 1986 Stephen King published a MAMMOTH novel! It took 3 hours just to do it justice and to make room for character development etc.. There's A LOT of plot in 'IT' the novel and miniseries, yet this film misses all of that. As said before, this film feels like 'The Goonies Vs. An Evil Clown' or something! Substance is what makes a good film, most people wanna see action, action, action and when there's plot and actual story/character development they label the film as 'clunky' (Example: Star Wars Episode II). It takes a keen palate to understand King's signature edge, and quite frankly, I have reason to believe that such a task is impossible for today's moviegoers. If it isn't shocking and full of depraved, foul remarks that aren't even remotely funny, they think it's garbage. This film isn't exactly a stinker, but it's a far, far cry from a classic. Rule #1 of remakes: Don't f-ck with the original! I find this film tasteless in nearly every way. P.S. : There are MANY plot holes which I won't get into. Read other reviews for more on that.",5,7,11,29 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," The King is back, and in a REALLY BIG WAY!
","I want to be very clear about this, anyone who doesn't wish to have an extremely thrilling and terrifying time, DO NOT see 'Kong: Skull Island.' He is back, well rested and ready to ensue some fresh havoc. This is not a remake, or a sequel, though it feels like it can go hand in hand with the original as far as the thrills are concerned. The cast really brings their A Game and the overall film packs a wallop with some of the best CGI that I've seen. The characters (although not the brightest bunch) play likable and generally somewhat believable roles; and Kong has never looked better! The film is loaded with thrills and chills, creeps and crawls, jump scares, and a shocking amount of gore for a PG-13 feature. I bet it was a kill away from a R-Rating, this wouldn't have flew under the PG-13 radar 30 years ago. All in all, a MUST SEE for any King Kong fan, or anyone desiring to have a truly thrilling and terrifying time! 'Kong: Skull Island' spins a yarn that I would put against any past adaptation including the original. A+ an instant classic! *Stay to the end for one last shock*",10,1,3,18 April 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," If you didn't read the book, don't see this film
","I'd like to start by saying that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson did a fabulous job portraying Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. I have read the first book (Yes, straight guys do read erotic dramas) and I must say that their portrayals were dead on with the characters that I envisioned in my head as I was reading.As far as the film goes, as much as it pains me to say this, this was a terrible adaptation which didn't do the book justice! Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel ought to be dragged out into the street and shot!!!! What kills me is that the film had a lot of potential with the sexy lineup of actors and top notch set designs and IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!!!!! My bone of contention with the entire film is the fact that it sort of jumped into the story with both feet in, opposed to there being any sort of build up. There is no introduction to the characters and very little plot. The opening sequences of the film is missing at least a half hours worth of detail and character intros crucial to any good film. It's as if the writer who obviously has read the book felt that since she was already knowledgeable about the extensive foreplay in the early chapters of the book, that was grounds for her to omit large portions of the story and kind of just jump to conclusions. Not taking into account that over half of the film's audience has never read one of the books, let alone all three! If I hadn't read the first book prior to seeing the movie I would have been completely dumbfounded and bewildered by the entire thing, which explains its resounding disapproval!There is no reason why 15 minutes into the film, Christian has already taken Anastasia to breakfast and told her that he isn't the man for her when it seems that they have just met! There is also no reason why 25 minutes into the film they have already F *CKED each other three ways from Sunday, and we still don't have a good feel of the identities of each character.The entire film has gaping holes in it, that can only be filled if you read the book and know what really happened! There are amazing sexual scenes, most notably the bathroom scene, and other great scenes that were either completely omitted or severely condensed and censored (THE BATHROOM SCENE). All in all, Great Book, Phenomenal Cast, but terrible directors and writers!THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CENTURY, I can only hope that the next two films clean up this mess that dares to bear the same name as the greatest erotic novel of all time!",3,8,17,19 February 2015
Incredibles 2," Lazy, Feminist, Virtue Signaling and Unoriginal.
","Seriously? I waited 16 years (I just saw it for the first time today) for this? The ONLY reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of the animation, humor, charm and fast-paced story telling. That's it. This was nothing more than another preachy, far-left piece of feminist propaganda that fits into the virtue signaling politically correct culture that has a strangle-hold on our media and society right now. I'm all for equality, but when you shamelessly pander to a specific group of people (women) and emasculate the other group (men) just to further the social standing of the group that you feel has been marginalized (women), you totally defeat the purpose of your mission. If equality is what you are seeking, let the marginalized party gain that respect on their own merit. I believe that it does women a great disservice for these movie studios and the media to thrust them into the spotlight for the sole purpose of making them look superior. That in itself defeats the purpose. Enough with the virtue signaling from Hollywood, let women be strong side by side with men, for THAT is equality. One can not be better than the other. This movie clearly pushes an agenda, and makes men out to be mindless, bumbling buffoons while the women run the world and are the masterminds behind it all. The only male with a SHRED of common sense is Dash and THAT'S REALLY saying something! The whole premise, in fact, is that Mr. Incredible is so bumbling and heavy-handed, that Elastigirl has to hold up the torch while he stays at home with the kids; leading to disastrous results . You get it? Classic feminist role reversal.Make no mistake whatsoever, this film was a deliberate cog in the master plan of blurring the lines between what it means to be male or female. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last 4 years, it's been blatantly obvious that there is a serious war against masculinity occurring in our society right now; and this film plays on that and is nothing more than propaganda advocating for it. The film rambles on with little substance or originally and ultimately leads to nowhere. There's no climactic build up, plot twist or shocking reveals. Just a disgruntled woman at the center of it all. And that's it. Pair that with Violet's bumbling obsession with Tony, and Mr. Incredible trying to learn 'New Math' and you've got the whole film in a nutshell. I didn't wait darn near 20 years for this! The film is entertaining and the characters are likable, but the subliminal and often OBVIOUS messages and themes throughout make this film such a disappointment. The original appealed to EVERYONE, but this one clearly is geared towards a certain group. There are moments in the film when you don't know if you're watching 'The Incredibles' or 'The Princess Diaries!' Yes, the feminist undertones are just THAT loud and clear. I know in our current political climate EVERYONE is a 5¢ advocate/activist but this is just pathetic. You can't even escape in a CHILDREN'S movie! Get back to making classics Disney, and leave the politics to the experts. A disappointment.",5,1,4,26 March 2020
