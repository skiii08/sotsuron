Requiem for a Dream," Not as good as Candy
","Don't misunderstand me: Requiem for a Dream is quiet a good movie. Its fascinating, thrilling and entertaining, and actually it also makes me think about drugs and society. But well: Its about the movie and not about society and its drug scenes. What I was missing was these high emotional feelings I felt when watching Candy , starring Heath Ledger in one of his best roles. There are many common things you can compare - as for example the protagonist who has a girlfriend, who has to prostitute in the end for financing their drug addicition. But I missed the feeling, the sadness, these special kind of empathy which overcame me in Candy, it actually was intense enough to make me cry - an emotional feeling that can only be evoced by really good and realistic movies; some sort of comparison with the protagonist, as you are twitching in his role and feel his dilemma.If you'd ask me: Its worth watching, but id prefer Candy, and suggest you Candy if you want to watch a Movie about Drug, Addiciton and tragic.",8,0,1,4 April 2012
Memento," Not everything really is, as it looks like on first view...
","Right after watching the Movie I wanted to give about 6 from 10 Points. It was much too confusing, not that thrilling (as you already knew who the 'real' murder is) and you didn't get all the answers at the end. But somehow I made a review myself and thought about the whole plot. Actually, I had to admit: Its not I that got confused, Its Nolan that wanted me to get confused ! The whole thing is made up backwards to learn two things: First - imagine life as it could be, learn to love what you got - because somehow life can change and the only thing you rely on are pity emotions like revenge that provides your life with some sense. And second: Not everything really is, as it looks like on first view. You can adapt this interpretation for almost every situation of life - for example prejudices. And maybe you can also test yourself about how moral you are. Do YOU understand Leonards behavior if Teddy really tried to help him, by burning all the evidence for already killing the real murder but hunting instead Teddy as nothing in life worths than the sense for revenge? Or maybe do you even share this behavior? Or do YOU deny all of Leonards doing? Whatever it is, its all in your imagination.Well: I have to admit, Nolan really got me. He caught me that much with his confuseness that I almost didn't get the message and messed up all the intentions. But as it made me think about life and esteem, what every good movie should get the viewer up to, I give it 9/10.Very good Nolan!",9,0,2,20 February 2012
Brokeback Mountain," ..about a forbidden Love
","At first i have to admit , I'm actually no friend of these new-gender-wave , swiping over to europe. But never the less : This is one of the best Movies I've seen in a long time, and sensitized me for homosexuality and their ban and exclusion from society.Heath Ledger played his role overwhelming brilliant - all the time I had no doubt that his characteristic in reality would be the same as in the movie. His acting felt so real, this guy, who hasn't overcome his past and lives in seclusion - also mentally. Who fell in love but hast not yet decided if he'd fight society and their anti-homosexual tendencies and let go and feel with all thats inside of him or become conventional and denies his uprising feelings to another man.How sad he died a couple of years after the movie. Heath Ledger - rest in peace, with this milestone of movie you became immortal!",9,3,3,26 April 2012
The Machinist," About hunting yourself
","How do you find inner peace? Thats what the movie wants to show you; You can't have peace with yourself when you don't accept your past. Acceptance is essential for everything that is (present) and comes (future), otherwise it'll haunt you, until it gets your attention; or in cases like in the movie, where your pasts is a Trauma, inacceptance results in nightmare and false reality. You can't betray your own mind - it knows you best and also all your tricks. So happened in the movie: Just after realizing himself haunting him, he became aware or all the suppressed memories and accepted his past by confessing his murder. And right in this moment, after confessing and becoming peaceful with himself he finally found sleep again , after being awake for over a whole year.",8,3,4,4 March 2012
In Time," One of the worst Movies I've seen in a long time...
","Justin Timberlake as an actor - i knew it couldn't fit. This movie sucks , everything is made awefully mainstream and obvious. Time used as a symbol for money - oh lord, how 'creative' (/ironie). Poor Boy who gets rich by accident and meets rich girl, but gets hunted by government. Seen this plot in different ways about 100 times - and still bores me like hell. But the worst situations are like these obvious dramatic scenes like the one where his mother can't pay the bus for meeting her son , so shes trying' by running to reach him but in the final seconds, when she almost reaches him (like 2 steps ahead) her time runs out and she dies in his arms. Justin crys like hell (yet another situation in which is shown that Justin is NO born actor!) and actually, in good movies these scenes activate the same emotions as seen in the film, i'd got this feeling to laugh. Laughing about this amateur-acting and obvious stupidity. Please, no more Timberlake Movies! My advice: Don't WATCH IT!sincerely,KimP.s. once again: Excuse my English",2,0,3,23 February 2012
V for Vendetta," Guy Fawkes at its best ;)
","Well,...Facsism born from fear. It has never been more actual than today. I really like the kind of story; fear dictates society and has been used by a few ones to get on top of politics and media to satisfy their greed for power and money. Mankind got suppressed by illusions created by all kinds of media, which also lays in the hand of politics. But there's hope - a fighter for freedom sees through corruption and greed and all the plans that were made to control society. His name is Guy Fawkes. So till here all is fine. Nice story, well done. So far.. But the protagonist 'Guy Fawkes' looks ridiculous. He wears a masks that makes him smile all the way. He became a fighter for rights and humanity, the moral Institution of mankind, as he got abused as a test-person for some new kind of virus. Like 'Hulk' he breaks through his cell and raises to seek revenge. And this was the point where I started to dislike the film. Too sci-fi, too 'Hollywood-made-up', too much action, that it became ridiculous and no more serious, as the political and moralic intention actually is and should be. Dear people: Government really uses you to empower their chosen ones, at the cost of our life's! So I'd like to shout out:'HELLO, THIS REALLY _IS_ HAPPENING, take it more serious and erase your stupid Hollywood-action'. Im sick of huge explosions and burning buildings.But never the less: 'Cause of the great message the movie trys to tell, and the anti-fascist connotation 7/10.P.S. still excuse my English, trying to better it :)",7,1,5,1 February 2012
