Skyfall," Bardem saved Bond
","Skyfall is an uncommonly gloomy film with a dense and oppressing atmosphere almost macabre in the sense that the rickety claws of death are palpable throughout the entire plot. Symbols like skulls and tombs, an intro covered in blood, a devastated ghost town left for good, the rainy London swathed in dim shades of gray and blue, an old, abandoned mansion with hidden doors to dark, underground shafts; the cold Highlands of Scotland, a venomous scorpion and last but not least the villain's ugly, broken smile illustrate such an impression. And James Bond? After proving his own obituary wrong, Her Majesty's greatest agent returns from the dead to protect his agency from a powerful cyber terrorist named Silva and he is anything but fit for the job. The shimmering, mischievously smiling Bond as embodied by Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan is a thing of the past. The new Bond in 'Skyfall' is less womanizer and more someone who has difficulties in hitting a target because of the injuries he suffered. He is suddenly vulnerable and his sense of humour was never dryer before, he really has to try hard to achieve his goals because he's getting old, the lightness of the previous Bonds is gone (for now). So it's not surprising that typical elements of the franchise like crazy action scenes as seen in 'Die Another Day', odd gadgets like exploding cigarettes or completely freakish super villains living in a volcano crater are missing as well, even the occasionally sizzling erotic due to attractive Bond Girls (unfortunately) seems to lack space in the world of 'Skyfall'. The old trade marks exist only in nostalgic remembrance, as when Bond takes out an old Aston Martin DB5; the entire film appears to be a farewell to good old times when the Vodka martini was still shaken and not stirred. What's left is an exiting story of revenge, told in a straightforward, pure and slow-paced fashion and carried by the tragic figure of Silva who the great Javier Bardem plays with such impressing intensity and morbid elegance that it's a real joy seeing him on the big screen. Silva, who is more dead than alive, seeks nothing but revenge, he is smart and coldblooded; in appearance somewhere between 'The Joker' and 'Jack Sparrow', and, most of all, he has a history explaining his motivations, adding depth to his character which makes him a perfect antagonist to Bond. Closely connected to Silva's past is M (Judie Dench), Bond's boss, who, for the first time, had a major role in this film. She is a strong, principled women willing to make hard decisions that could cost people's lives; a good counterbalance to the often decorative Bond Girls who don't have much to say of real importance. M, 007 and Silva are the three main figures in a Shakespeare-like tragedy around which a plot revolves being too thin and unoriginal to be really noteworthy, a rather cheep frame of what's supposed to be an otherwise well drawn picture. However, the frame may not be so important after all. It's the dark atmosphere and a nuanced character drawing together with an amazingly thrilling villain that make 'Skyfall' stand out from the previous films. James Bond, as we knew him, is dead...only to live on.",8,3,11,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Not worthy of the hype!
","Lured into the movie theater by the very high average value of nearly 80 % at Rotten Tomatoes and 7,8/10 points at IMDb as well as by the huge box office success, I was nothing but disappointed of what, according to lots of other reviews, was supposed to be a 'witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon' (Rotten Tomatoes), and unfortunately turned out being a - for about two thirds of the runtime - mostly dull, uninteresting, unfunny, silly, unimportant, overlong, plot-holed, Marvel-canon-breaking, and unnecessary blockbuster that, although admittedly upgraded by well-done action sequences, cannot be otherwise described than with the word: 'mediocre' and therefore does not deserve more than 5 points.Now, let me sum up the movie without giving away any spoilers: Babble, babble, babble - action sequence - more uninteresting babbling - oh, a dull twist! - more action - another forced surprise - babble, babble, babble and finally the bombastic finale with lots of explosions and a bunch of Iron Men bustling around in the air like a cluster of flies.I'm sure that a great deal of more people would see the dump mediocrity of the plot if it weren't for the action scenes and most of all the charisma of Robert Downey Jr. whose sheer presence carries the movie like Atlas carried the entire globe on his back and yet he as well is far away from being as funny and entertaining as he used to be in his first appearance as Tony Stark. The so-called love story between him and Pepper Potts, tolerably played by Gwyneth Paltrow, leaves you cold as it is with the super villain who is just a huge blatherer.All in all, you have to be very patient with the movie until it gains momentum during the last 30 minutes or so where you can be assured that you don't have to try finding any sense and significance in all this any more, because there never was any, but simply lean back and enjoy the action pleasantly aware that it's going to be over soon...Phase two of the Marvel franchise had a weak beginning, very weak.",5,7,14,6 May 2013
Gravity," Already a Classic.
","'Gravity' is a suspenseful action survival adventure that sets new standards in terms of a realistic depiction of what it feels like to be an astronaut in outer space. The visual effects are just amazing and are only surpassed by the unique, claustrophobic atmosphere created by the simple fact that nothing more than the small, narrow, oxygen-filled shell within your space suit separates you from the deadly vacuum out there.Being lost in space, we - by the magic of the movie camera which is digitally floating in all imaginable directions - literally witness the dramatic struggle for life through the bloodshot eyes of Sandra Bullock who, in a brilliantly intriguing performance, tries to find a way back to Earth while she is irretrievably running out of her oxygen supply; were it not for the treacherous crunching sound of people eating popcorn, the illusion would be complete! George Clooney as the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalsky, always overshadowed by Bullock's powerful play as Dr. Ryan Stone, is the only help providing some hope in a obviously desperate situation. As a rather chattering person, he contributes to comparatively few dialogs that are unfortunately not always free from typical Hollywood clichés. Strictly seen this movie has a very thin plot as the director apparently puts much more emphasis on the space experience itself which is underlined by a great, vibrant score crucial to its' huge success since - apart from some radio transmissions between the protagonists - there is of course no sound in the vacuum we would be able to hear; this lack of sound being another tribute to realism as far as it's compatible with the regularities of a blockbuster: Alfonso Cuarón did not intend to make a documentary about disasters in space instead he delivered a very authentic, minimalistic science fiction thriller that can easily form a line with all the great SF-Classics of movie history.The little kid in you who has always dreamed of becoming an astronaut will definitely leave the theater being nothing but satisfied.",9,3,4,9 October 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Good Filler-Episode for Fans
","If there ever was a need to show how the construction plans of the Death Star were retrieved by the rebel forces, than this movie finally satisfied the eagerness of every Star Wars fan.I, for my part, think that some things should be left for one's own imagination and not every little side note mentioned in the old Episodes needs to get its own movie, it doesn't bring the saga forward, it doesn't tell a really developed story, it's simply an account of the efforts made and the losses suffered at a particular moment during a war in space, so that Rogue One lacks the epic feeling and the ability to give wings to your own imagination.It has a great battle scene in the end and that's it. I was looking forward to see Darth Vader back in business and got maybe three minutes of his bad-assness. They hired Academy award winner Forest Whitaker to wheeze a bit into the camera and than die. Mads Mikkelsen, whose handsome, masculine features make him perfect for long, moody close-up shots, had a few lines, gazing seriously into the air and than died. There was this cool blind warrior with his cool buddy and they died too. Felicity Jones, whom I adore, played the not so special, kind of outlaw heroine who kind of fell in love with this unknown male hero before they died, Oh and no Star Wars would be recognizable as such without a witty robot character providing some comical relief, only that this one got broken in the end; not exactly what you would describe as an uplifting prelude to A New Hope. And what stayed with me after the curtains closed, was this traumatizing image of a soulless CGI version of young Princess Leia.Yes, finally we got shown how she gained the plans, they simply were handed to her, surprise, surprise!Rogue One is a redundant money grabber, a spin-off with some good action scenes carrying the Star Wars brand, yet it at least isn't as corny as the George Lucas movies.",7,1,11,26 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Hypergalactically Awesome in Warp Terms.
","I belong to the people who believe in love on first sight and this movie managed to captivate me almost immediately and keep me enthralled until the very end, so that I can nothing but recommend it not only to the die-hard Trekkies but also to everybody else out there looking for two hours of intelligently made, action packed, visually stunning movie-entertainment that comes along with a - albeit slightly timid - yet powerful enough message.What became a fresh new, juvenile beginning (reboot) of a long since dusted franchise as the eleventh Star Trek movie entered the theaters in 2009, now found its worthy, and more mature, follow up that both builds a bridge to the first movies of the early 1980's and paves the way for a modern and more contemporary reinterpretation of the canon; having a somehow more complex (deeper) storyline compared to the previous one as well as a definite plus over its immediate predecessor which is: David Cumberbatch's nuanced portrayal of the main antagonist Khan whose enhanced voice and ice-blue eyes are likely to 'send shivers upon you!' While not everyone of the crew impressed me equally - Simon Pegg e.g. whom I couldn't stand in MI: 4, was again quite chatty in a silly fashion in his role as Scotty (I hope he'll find the punch-line in the future productions) and baby-face Chris Pine couldn't live up to William Shetner's charismatic performance as the Captain - I like to point out Zachary Quinto's sophisticated personification of Mr. Spock, whose often disputatious friendship to the Captain contributes much to the dynamics of the entire movie. The other members, especially Karl Urban as the Doc and surprisingly Alice Eve as Carol, could also shine in their roles.The plot, although rather simple with minor exaggerations, was well balanced in terms of the necessity to provide action and excitement with big emotions without dismissing Gene Roddenberry's vision to present an alternative future scenario where the human race is devoted to moral and justice instead of greed and power longing to discover, not destroy. Therefore, I gladly acknowledged Mr. Spock's moral disapproval of having a terrorist killed at the touch of a button without proper trail whereas at the same time in the real world, a 'certain President' can give a command and automatically, thousands of kilometers away in the desert, a convoy filled with people is getting struck by deadly missiles. I would have wished for more of such bold statements in a sci-fi flick like this reaching out for such a huge viewer-ship, unfortunately this moments of true relevance were rather rare. I hope that in the sequels to come, there will be more room for philosophical and ethical thoughts in the spirit of its original creator: Gene Roddenberry.Finally, what is left to say is that J.J Abram's visionary reviving of such a venerable science fiction saga cannot be valued more, now that he is leaving this engagement; he's done a great job and I'm looking forward to watching the next Star Trek adventure.",8,2,11,15 May 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Captain to Die for!
","Captain America's second strike most of all impresses with hand-to-hand martial art fights, almost too fast for the 3D Camera to capture, and well-timed, old school handmade action scenes such as car chases, machine gun shootings on open streets, and spectacular explosions, using less computer generated special effects than other comic adaptations and refreshingly getting along without a Tesseract or similar plot devices to bring the story forward because this time we are presented with a kind of happy-go-lightly mixture of a classical espionage thriller a la 'Bourne Supremacy', a touch of 'Die Hard'-one-against-them-all scenario, a little bit of 'Terminator'-menace, and of course the usual 'Avengers' references like bombastic airship battles that all in all make 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' a quite entertaining and light movie experience. The characters are very likable especially the supporting cast with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Samual L. Jackson as Nick Fury who all together upstage the main hero Chris Evans as the 'Cap.' who begins to thaw only towards the end from his long winter sleep by showing some hidden emotions that seemed to had been frozen inside of him which gave that melancholic touch to his character making him sometimes appear rather pale although it at least prevents him from being a silly chatterbox like some other heroes. In contrast to that lies Black Widow's mysterious aura and sex appeal; an ice-cold femme fatal who is good at fighting and who also has a very human, if not fragile side which makes her approachable and even more charming; she would have deserved an own movie franchise because it's about time for female hero's to be in the front line. Robert Redford as a kind of dubious head of S.H.I.E.L.D is unfortunately visibly unchallenged by his role, his motivations are rather caricatural.A definite plus is the main villain, the titular Winter Soldier who is physically equal to 'The Cap.'. He reminded me of the evil cyborg in 'Terminator 2' with his robotic arm and his threatening charisma. They both do not talk very much and whenever the Winter Soldier appears, he seems to trigger his own gravitational field as the camera seems to revolve around him like a satellite giving his character this sense of heaviness which even more underlines his dangerousness and yet there is a secret human core that makes him more ambiguous than which is the case with most of the usual cyborgs. Plotwisely 'CA: TWS' surprises not with the rather predictive twists but with a rather naive, but nevertheless charming comment on the current issues with data abuse by intelligence agencies and the question of how far a society is willing to give up their freedom for the sake of security in the face of a potential terrorist attack, and thus it is probably the most socially critical release of Marvel so far. It may lack of the necessary psychological as well as artistic depth and edginess of a 'Dark Knight' that would have left a deeper reverberation with the viewer, it is also not as unique in terms of style as the first part, however, it is good enough to be recommendable, especially to Marvel fans.",7,6,12,2 April 2014
Pacific Rim," Great CGI-Fun.
","While lacking of a truly captivating story, Pacific Rim is a grandiose and impressive battle flick about giant robots fighting giant sea monsters in the style of Japanese Anime series that thankfully gets along (almost) without any pathos and exaggerated patriotism as it is often the case in Hollywood disaster movies of this sort (i.e. 'Independence Day' or 'Armageddon'); since it never takes itself too seriously and yet refrains from being ridiculous or silly.This movie is especially made for the theaters, an experience of epic proportions that certainly must blow up the frame of your common flat screen TV at home. Therefore I highly recommend to see it at the cinema in 3D as long as it's still possible. The robots (Jaeger) are so big and heavy that, while walking, I had the impression that the floor, beneath my feet, was trembling with every step they made which of course came from the powerful stereo sound. The monsters (Kaiju) are simply huge and terrifying, you cannot tell where their bodies actually start like endless mountains of flesh. These two gigantic forces colliding with each other subsequently leads to (slightly overlong) battle scenes that are to be described as state-of the-art in terms of CGI effects and destructive frenzy being dirty, brute and swept with rain and pacific water; in its magnitude only surpassed by 'Transformers' and 'The Avengers' - a real 'Materialschlacht' as we would say in Germany.With such a premise it's not surprising that the actual actors are more or less pushed into the background. Idris Elba has great charisma in front of the camera, but his role as the commanding officer is noticeably not very challenging due to a lack of diversity in character development which is maybe why he appears a bit stiff in his uniform. The same goes for the other actors who all appear somewhat pale with Charlie Day as a refreshing exception in his role as Dr. Newt adding much to the humor of the movie. The script itself seemingly paying homage to the Asian monster movies nevertheless missing their susceptibility to intransigence and craziness instead orientates itself too much on the usual Hollywood Blockbuster ingredients for success leaving you with the aftertaste that you have seen it all before one way or another (i.e. 'Cloverfield', 'Godzilla') thus being rather predictable. Guillermo Del Toro surely did better movies, however, with 'Pacific Rim' he proved that he is able to maintain a certain standard which perfectly met my expectations albeit not surpassing them so that I cannot but give it a good 6 points out of ten.",6,3,9,10 August 2013
Ant-Man," 'hahaha!'
","Where other Marvel movies were humorous where they should have been serious or silly where they should have been humorous, Ant-Man was just funny for the most part and absorbed me into a fantastically imaginative, tiny big world from the perspective of ants. All the actors were likable and committed. Paul Rudd was just perfect for the main role, a completely down-to-earth guy with a very good sense for comical timing. Michael Douglas as Dr. Pym had a huge presence as usual and E. Lilly as his daughter (whom I thought to be Jessica Biel up until the end credits although I loved Lilly in 'Lost' - 'Hey man, he doesn't even know the actors' names, he is not qualified to write a review') was just gorgeous and also smart and strong and therefore very emancipated. For one of the best comical moments (albeit some suspiciously silly moments too), the robber trio B. Cannavale, D. Dastmalchian and T.I as Paxton, Kurt and Dave ('The Three Marvel Stooges') was elemental. One great compliment deserves young Abby R. Fortson as Scott's little daughter, she was sooooo sweeet and really could act! Finally, there is the main antagonist C. Stoll as Yellowjacket, a rather whiny antagonist but towards the end, he developed to a worthy opponent.And for all the Marvel nerds: Yes there were some references to the Avengers (which I found rather distracting) and an interesting intermezzo with Falcon, but beware, there were no fancy Air Battleships and no Armageddon scenario with inter-dimensional wormholes, the movie was more a classical heist adventure peppered with a more or less convincing father-daughter conflict and it derived it's entertainment value not from extraordinary action scenes (which were considerably rare) but most of all from the marvelous sensation of being shrunken and especially from it's often subtle, often child-friendly sense of humor. It also conveyed a unique atmosphere similar to the 50's pulp monster movies, it had a nice retro touch, a bit like the first Captain America installment Ant-Man is the best comedy of all the Marvel superhero movies.",8,0,6,28 July 2015
The Revenant," Captivating and Consequent, A Masterpiece!
","This movie has such a strong pulling effect that the moment it starts you feel like physically dragged into the woods accompanying the hero on his long, agonizing way to find the man who hideously killed his son. The eye of the beholder or more precisely, the camera is smoothly flowing around the characters and often comes so close to them that the lens gets fogged by their breath, it's almost 'pornographic' in terms of how close the director wants to show us everything so that you feel the urge to look away, the blood, the sweat, it's literally palpable, the pain the hero must have sustained while being lacerated by a huge bear you're able to feel on your own skin, it's simply awe-inspiring. Sometimes it appears as if there are no cuts like it's happening in real time, extraordinary!Inarritu once again proved that he is a visionary cinematographer and a true artist on par with Terrence Malick just (luckily) more grounded in linear story telling, the style never overlaps the substance like it was the case with Malick's 'Tree of Life' where you could get lost in imagery. Sure the story itself is rather simple, it's about survival and revenge, more or less typical blockbuster themes,'The Revenant' could easily have turned into a second 'Rambo' or Liam Neeson fighting wolves in the wilderness, yet it became an ambitious and authentic epos with a kind of documentary and simultaneously artistic approach and a pulsating score.I'm not sure whether all this panting and screaming by DiCaprio is more challenging and therefore worthier of an Oscar than let's say his brilliant performance of a complex character like Howard Hughes in 'Aviator' for example which means that he should already have gotten one as he is a fabulous actor, Tom Hardy as his treacherous antagonist played a slightly more diverse character and was slightly more interesting so that he definitely should get the Oscar for the Best Supporting Role.'The Revenant' playing in a snow covered wilderness will make you shiver with cold for exactly the right reasons as it is a masterpiece.",9,2,6,13 January 2016
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Stupid in a very good way
","This film tells a story about a special army unit without having a real plot as even the main characters don't seem to know where they're heading. It's just an accumulation of absurd dialogues and crazy moments with real good actors that don't consider themselves too good to act silly (not too silly) although they certainly were unchallenged by the script. The shown sense of humour reminded me slightly of the humour in the fashion of the Coen brothers in terms of pace and surreality, however, less sarcastic, less biting and without cynicism. The characters are rather likable, harmless individuals trying to find peace in a violent surrounding. I would classify this film as a satire about everything the army represents in general and once you've realized how stupid the army is you'll find this an amusing 93 minutes of fun.",7,5,6,10 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Meh!
","M.I. 5 is as original as Hangover 2, the story is predictable and the stunts are laughably over-the-top, however it's so fast paced that you just don't have enough time to realize it as Ethan Hunt jumps from city to city within minutes and the really exciting espionage work like getting information or managing to hide from the CIA without any help is done in secret and is not explained at all, we're just left to accept that Ethan Hunt can break into every facility (by just landing on the property with parachutes for example), that he somehow possesses the best equipment and can do whatever he wants.The villain is like the previous one, just a decal of a villain, no psychological depth whatsoever.The showdown is just a letdown! What saved this movie for me was R. Ferguson as the double agent Ilsa Faust because she was as skilled and smart as Ethan and she was the actual impetus of the movie, she almost stole him the show, a very multi-layered, heroic female character which is rare in such movies.I really don't want to see another 'Fast & Furious' version of Mission: Impossible, how about some seriousness for a change.",6,3,6,14 August 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Nothing new on the Marvel front
","Ten years ago – I must have been 14 around that time – the world of cinema witnessed the beginning of a new, glorious superheroes era as Sam Raimi's super awesome 'Spiderman' conquered the big screen, an era, temporarily culminated in the box office success 'Marvel's: The Avengers', which swamped us with so many good and less good comic book adaptations and flushed so many billions of dollars into the coffers of the film production as well as comic book companies – such as Sony and Marvel in this case – that it seemed hardly ever to end, or more precisely, it was not allowed to end anymore. What enormous fun I had, how thrilled I was watching the fabulous Tobey Meguire swinging as Peter Parker, the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman, through the vertiginous street canyons of New York City fighting his own inner demons, his weaknesses, the guilty certainty of being responsible for his Oncle Ben's death, fighting for Mary Jane's love and against mighty villains that were never entirely evil but rather misguided. Spidey was carried by a simple message that with great powers there also comes great responsibility. Sam Raimi even managed to top it all with the sequel 'Spiderman 2' which brought the action scenes to a whole new level in terms of tempo and choreography taking place in prodigious heights most of the times. This was original, unique and most of all, entirely new to the audience. However, the third and final part 'Spiderman 3' could not reach up to the same quality of its predecessors, the end of Spiderman's film era seemed inevitable, yet Sony Pictures didn't want to lose their rights on the franchise, too much money was at stake, so they fired Raimi and Tobey and all the cast. The end became the beginning, the era continued, only five years after the finale, the producers started anew and created a remake titled 'The Amazing Spiderman' with an incredibly sympathetic as well as well fitting Andrew Garfield for the leading role and Emma Stone as Peter's first high school love Gwen Stacy who is not only extremely sexy in her knee-long boots but also very smart and self-confident.Nevertheless, as a remake this version by director Marc Webb retells a story that was perfectly fine the way it was without adding anything significantly new to it except for maybe some deeper insights of Parker's troubled self thus destroying a lot of former plot elements. For example, I was shocked to see what remained of the story concerning Oncle Ben's murder and the resulting consequences for Spidey. What the writers have left of it is as thin as a spider thread. The introduction of Parker's parents is an undeveloped idea leading to nowhere. The love story between him and Gwen ends before it even started properly. His new enemy 'The Lizard', convincingly played by Rhys Ifans, cannot compete with Dr. Octopus when it comes to the action scenes that rarely take place over ground but which are still good enough to be exiting. At least, he is realistically animated. The film appears altogether in a much darker, dirtier shade and the 3D technology gives it a better sense of spatial depth especially when Spidey jumps from a building. I really missed the funny moments of the original trilogy. Peter Parker is known for his witticism and good sense of humour which the current teen Peter somehow seems to have lost over so much troubling. The second half of the film was far more entertaining as the pace started to grow affording one or two goosebumps moments like the one on the bridge when Spidey saved a child. Compared to that, the first half before the intermission felt like a burdensome necessity they easily could have done without just because no one needs another origin story of how Peter got his superpowers due to a spider bite. In summary, I come to the conclusion that Webb's 'The Amazing Spiderman.' is a good,solid, well played and animated teen action film, partially amazing,never outstanding and always in the shadow of the first adaptation. You may enjoy it, especially if you're 14 as I was ten years before. The spirit of that time I could not feel again, Peter's message is somehow softened by a not fully developed script, however, the era of superhero films will live on and Spiderman will definitely return.",7,0,2,1 July 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Not really a Civil War, but a great Superhero-Fight nonetheless!
","By a civil war, I understand a brutal conflict between several parties in an urban surrounding over a longer period of time, and this was rather a street fight between a bunch of superhero-friends, who once confronted with the political and moral consequences of their actions, realized that they disagree on certain basic issues and therefore argued it out using their fists and abilities, which was so much fun to watch that I will condone the misleading tag-line.Especially for a martial arts fan like me, the fantastically choreographed fist fights were the highlight of the movie and the reason why I would like to watch it again on Blu Ray as I found that the 3D technology wasn't developed enough to capture the fast velocity of their movements making them appear slightly jittery. The action scenes were really amazing and didn't seem overlong or bloated.What I liked about the story is that although it dealt with a lot of characters who all by themselves aspired to be in the spotlight as most of them would ultimately get their own movies like Black Panther for instance, it nevertheless kept a very good balance and followed a clear central theme so that it never felt over-fraught with unnecessary sidelines or was embarrassingly chaotic like 'The Amazon Spider-Man 2' for instance which was a catastrophe. So I will excuse certain weaknesses that all Marvel movies seem to have which I will describe as a certain immaturity and incompleteness of the plot without giving away any spoilers. After watching it I always feel like I should read the comics in order to get the full picture. With the very popular German actor Daniel Brühl they also introduced a rather unusual villain who brought a new kind of stereotype into the genre, a very quiet manipulator with a tragic human side. It's also interesting to compare the many parallels of the story to the recent 'Batman v. Superman' movie sharing some main ideas concerning the public control of superheroes placing them under the command of a specific political authority which is all inspired by A. Moore's legendary 'Watchmen' and in retrospect I find 'Captain America 3' executed this ideas far better than Singer managed to do with 'Batman v. Superman'.Another great plus are definitely the new recruits of the Avengers team starting with Spiderman and Antman, who are just marvelous and also the Black Panther and The Vision and Scarletwitch are superb and a rather personal compliment goes to - hot, hotter, - Scarlett Johansson who as Black Widow demonstrated her best performance so far.All in All I find 'The First Avenger: Civil War' surpassed it's prequels and also marked a new great highlight of the Marvel cinematic universe.",8,6,11,10 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Popcorn-Entertainment at its Best.
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a buoyant and joyful roller-coaster ride through a colorful, fantastically imaginative world somewhere on the verge between Sciencefiction and Fantasy only surpassed by 'Avatar' in it's artistic abundance - and while missing James Cameron's sense for great dramaturgical peaks on a deeply emotional level that make you suffer with the protagonists, it in exchange comes up with a more or less great sense of humor. Certainly not every punchline hits its target, however, there are some really, really funny scenes full of self-irony. The main protagonists, the heroes, who are refreshingly different from the typical superhero characters Marvel has to offer, since they all carry the image of being outlaws beyond ordinary social conventions, somehow succeed in managing the balancing act between silliness and seriousness, harmonizing well together and even providing one or two goose-bump moments towards the end. The plot itself is not very elaborated and feels shallow at times, too much resembling other Marvel movies in its structural build up. More bravado and originality on part of the script authors would have given this in all other respects astonishing motion picture not only more substance and depth but also something that stays with you long after the curtain has fallen and the impressions of the visual effects have faded away. The good thing about the story is that it is fast-paced and does not need three hours to be told. Also remarkable is the - for such a genre - rather unusual soundtrack consisting of famous pop songs of the 1960's-80's, it contributes much to the positive vibe of the movie since it is played throughout the movie, even serving as a plot device. The 13 years old comic fan boy/girl will cheer at this, a more mature viewer can certainly appreciate the satirical quality and epic action scenes. Very entertaining.",8,2,4,2 September 2014
Jurassic World," Dinosaurs Top, the Plot is a Flop.
","After a feeble opening, the movie slowly turns into a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game (the people are the mouse in this game) until it ends with a fulminate dinosaur smack-down.When you're impatiently waiting for the disaster to happen so that finally the dinosaurs can take over the park and by that drive the plot into a basic run-for-your-life theme than it's a clear sign that all the blabbering in between is just an unexciting postponement of the inevitable carnage that follows and therefore just redundant.This sequel is so uncreative that it's actually a remake spiced with more violent horror elements and the latest 3D technology.The characters are all fulfilling stereotypical roles, there is not one really funny line, the only halfway unpredictable behavior comes from the dinosaurs, nevertheless the movie relies on the sensationalism of the audience who much like the visitors of the park are seemingly satisfied with the premise: 'It's roaring, it's big so it gotta be good!'What really intrigued me were the new dinosaur villain, the sea monster and the nasty pterosaurs which caused some thrilling incidents.4/5 pts. for action and effects. 2/5 pts. for story, inventiveness and drama/fun. total rating: 6 pts.",6,4,11,18 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as much Fun as the First One.
","Spectacular action scenes and sophisticated, interesting super heroes cannot quite make up for the fact that the story entangles itself in too many plot lines so that 'Age of Ultron' is a less exciting adventure than its prequel has been.The balancing act between seriousness and humor doesn't seem to work as smoothly as before and the big love story quickly develops some soap-opera like feeling to it which makes it an additional side line that rather distracts from the main plot than giving more depth to it.More of a disappointment is unfortunately the main villain too. 'Ultron' is supposed to be one of the most dangerous and merciless enemies in the Marvel universe and instead he is too charming too be really frightening, he is still cool but his potential has been wasted.A positive surprise is 'Hawkeye' whose story gets more attention and meaning this time and I really like it that the big final battle takes place in a South-European country for a change.'Age of Ultron' has all the necessary ingredients for a fantastic blockbuster, however, the fine-tuning is flawed and considering the high expectations it leaves an aftertaste of mediocrity.",7,12,26,1 May 2015
Elysium," Good but not Outstanding.
","'Elysium' is a visually stunning Science-Fiction parable that - halfway through the movie - loses its socially critical aspirations for the benefit of common action scenes with lots of shooting and fighting and projectiles exploding in slow motion. Neill Blomkamp certainly had a strong vision; he created a dirty, overpopulated, ruined world ridden by poverty and violence, a world we can very well relate to since it too obviously resembles areas and spots we all - once in a while - happen to see on the news when there is again a report on the favelas in Brazil or townships of South Africa or any other slums or war areas for instance, and we feel relieved to have escaped such a hard fate just because we were luckily born in a rich industrial country. And such an idealized industrial country can be interpreted as the eponymous space station 'Elysium' where the few rich ones are living like Greek gods in heaven looking down at the Earth in disgust for all the miserable people down there to whom they feel so much superior. There we have it: the metaphorical north-south divide!All this would have been enough to make it a very profound and deep SiFi-Classic if Blomkamp had not wanted to combine it with the typical Hollywood summer blockbuster action booster pack including a more or less secondary love story plus an obligatory sadistic sociopath named Kruger thus losing track of his original path and - which is worse - giving away much of its suspense and substance because he very soon gets caught up in predictable Popcorn movie patterns. Very much like its more artistically innovative predecessor 'District 9', 'Elysium' seems not thought through down to the last detail, many questions are not answered, too many things are assumed or just not explained, there is no background story either, there are certain issues with logic, and we are not offered a sufficiently satisfying depiction of the futuristic political and economical conditions.So we have to take the world's premise for granted in which the main character Max (Matt Damon), a common worker and former thief, somewhat clumsily (he is not trained after all) struggles to find a way up to 'Elysium', like so many terrestrials before him, where he wants to use one of the local Med-Pods that miraculously can cure any illness and injury in order to save his own life thus teaming up with a bunch of outlaws who enforce him with a strength-enhancing exoskeleton which for some reason no one else wanted to wear. Unfortunately, he has very powerful enemies, above all the Secretary of Defense D. Rhodes whose zero-tolerance immigration policy threatens to foil his plans. Jodie Foster plays Rhodes with such an eccentric, cold-hearted charm that it's really a pity that Blomkamp's script also lost focus on her amidst all the beamy and bulky action intervals.While 'District 9' worked better as a classical SiFi-parable in spite of its many logical flaws, Blomkamp's latest contribution to the genre, may be a bit too simplistic and underdeveloped to have a lasting impact on the audience, however, it is nevertheless an impressive eye candy for any real SiFi-fan.",7,1,2,21 August 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Thundering Conclusion of an Overall Disappointing Trilogy.
","Peter Jackson's self-aggrandizing attempt to bloat a simple children's story to an epic fantasy tale in three parts culminates in an overlong battle scene only to puff out in mediocrity and stereotypes.If the director chose to stay truth to the source material and left out all this fillers, he could have made an unique movie that consists only of two parts at the utmost and more importantly stands on its own instead of having this 'spin-off'-character of LOTR: why trying to copy and even surpass a legendary trilogy that was designed as such from the very beginning by inventing a kind of 'prequel' based on a thin bedtime story that doesn't come even close to LOTR in every respect? Is Peter Jackson paying homage to Tolkien or just to himself as the master of battle choreography? 'The Hobbit' was written first, so it's per definition not a prequel, it just happens to play before the events of LOTR, all this references in the movie are simply redundant and serve no other purpose than to satisfy a vain fan nostalgia, it has nothing to do with any real artistic ambitions. it's the pure exploitation of a franchise that comes along with the latest CGI technology. 'The Battle of Five Armies' is worth seeing from a technical point of view since the visuals are topnotch, the little, poor rest of the plot that wasn't managed to be finished in the previous parts is somehow pressed in between the fights.Let's face it, LOTR is far better.",6,6,12,15 December 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A dignified finale
","After it's prequel 'The Dark Knight' did not live up to my high expectations due to a confusing, overladen plot, I was positively surprised by Christopher Nolan's conclusion of his Batman trilogy 'The Dark Knight Rises'. While it's not my personal best comic book (graphic novel!) adaptation ever, since masterpieces like 'Watchmen' or 'V for Vendetta', 'Spider-Man 2' and, I have to admit, even 'Marvel's: The Avengers' simply thrilled me a great deal more, TDKR is certainly a great action film to enjoy, and as far as I'm concerned, better than the previous one. The nearly three hours it took quickly passed by which is always a good sign and I never had the feeling that the story had no real direction as with TDK. What I liked the most was the villain: BaneBane just got me. He's dangerous and he's evil. Even The Joker would have payed him respect if he had done such things at all. A lot of critics compared Bane to Hannibal Lecter because of the martial mouth mask he's wearing, but I'd like to compare him to Darth Vader and Darth Vader is cool. There is a scene near the end of TDKR (those who saw will know) that could have been directly derived from a similar scene in 'Star Wars: Episode 6', and of course there is this heavily breathing, electronically enhanced voice of his that reminded me the most of the dark lord. Above that, Bane is also a tragic figure who has a heart somewhere beneath all the bull-like muscle mass.The melee between him and Batman belonged to my personal highlights of the entire film although I was somewhat surprised that Batman somehow seemed to have forgotten how to use his utility belt and only relied on the power of his fists which did not really pay off. As a mercenary, Bane commands a huge army of heavily armed mercenary soldiers. Why they're following him and even willing to die for him, unfortunately is left for guessing. Nolan, as often is the case, fails to give a deeper meaning, a deeper understanding to the motivations of his characters, some reason beyond the sheer urge to simply create chaos and destruction. The same goes with Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Catwoman is an attractive, professional thief with some martial arts skills who is looking for a way out of the criminal milieu and thus comes in touch with Batman. Where she is from, how she has become Catwoman,why she is steeling and the reason for her change of mind remains again unclear. Apart from this, I liked the way she interacted with Batman. Her dialogues were very witty and teasing, you could feel a certain sizzling between them. I find it interesting to draw a comparison to Tim Burton's version of Catwoman and I come to the conclusion that, to me, Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is much more fascinating, much darker and grittier than that of Anne Hathaway who is certainly a very good actress.Then there is another new character: Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake. Blake is seemingly the most intelligent, most righteous policeman of all the other ones including commissioner James Gordon who is put to shadow by Blake's investigative skills even outshining Batman formerly known as the world's greatest detective who always needed someone to explain him what's going on which does not do him justice. Blake was the driving force while Bruce wallowed in self-pity.By the way, where was Batman all the time? It's quite remarkable how little screen time the actual main figure had in his own film apart from some fist fights and a few minor action scenes where he was making some cool stunts on his bike or flying around in an aircraft that looked rather like an iron turtle. Instead, Nolan focused on his true identity: Bruce Wayne, an, in the meantime, tired and decrepit shadow of a former glamorous billionaire who is living isolated in his manor like a hermit still mourning the loss of his love Rachel and seemingly deprived of any purpose in life since his initiated 'Dent-law' freed the city from organized crime. Even his butler and father substitute Alfred sees no good in this inaction and loneliness. What's his proposed cure? Yes, of course, it's a woman. A fact leading to a somewhat clichéd Hollywood-friendly ending.Nolan is an undoubtedly great director whose approach to present Batman in a more realistic setting and thus being able to address (or rather broach) subjects like the economical crisis, the gab between the rich and poor, environmental issues etc. at the latest, stands on no solid ground as soon as words as 'League of Shadows' come into play. The circumstance that The Dark Knight is a comic hero after all firstly cannot be ignored and secondly always leads to a tension with the ambitious epic seriousness of the plot which Nolan does not consequently solve. The film is sometimes to serious to be taken seriously, an epos with flaws.",8,5,8,5 December 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Breaking News: 'Superman and Batman defeated by Captain Ennui!'
","On behalf of good storytelling and suspense, we, everyone who expected the long awaited confrontation of two of the most iconic superheroes ever, to be a thrilling masterpiece, declare this poorly scripted advertisement for a potentially bigger sequel to come, an epic fail!Rarely I have been so desperately looking for some relevance and emotional depth like it was the case while watching this muddled mess of a movie and it's so sad because it had everything a good action movie needs and yet the end result is boring for the most part.Zack Snyder made one of my favorite movies of all times which is 'Watchmen', however, he also did 'Sucker Punch' which despite it's visual abundance and sex-appeal bored me to hell, and 'Batman v. Superman' is somewhere between those two.I still hold high regards for Zack Snyder as director for his ability to create powerful imagery that sticks to your mind, but he seems not to care much for his characters and plot development, it all looks so cool and the action is bombastic, but in the end it all feels so shallow and redundant.Ben Affleck proved all the haters whiny naggers, he was superb as Batman! The other cast was fine too, although I consider Eisenberg's interpretation of Lex Luthor as too nerdy and psychotic which doesn't live up to the charismatic image of Luthor I got from the cartoons and comics. Amy Adams is again miscast for Lois Lane and Gal Gadot is a hot Wonder Woman but feels completely misplaced in this movie lacking any sort of background story, another example of how they introduce story arcs to leave them open for further installments to continue them, with the consequences that 'Batman v. Superman' feels unfinished, incomplete, a sole introduction to a 'cinematic Universe' yet to enter the screens, in other words, it's an overlong advertisement for the franchise rather than being a movie, a story on it's own. I'm really disappointed.",5,4,7,4 April 2016
Thor: The Dark World," A lighthearted Rehash.
","The blithe and action-filled sequel to the solid and surprisingly interesting 'Thor' from 2011, never quite unfolds the necessary emotional depth that would make you truly care for the characters as there is no character development like in the first part where the all shiny thunder god Thor made a remarkable transformation from an arrogant bully into a responsible hero whereas now he appears to be a rather one-dimensional beau who is good for some stunning stunts and few cool lines; with his roguish brother Loki as a welcome exception since his ambiguous motives have a sort of lurking sensation to them even though he is slowly turning into a Roly-Poly doll whose tricks are getting old.The rag rug of a plot is too unoriginal and therefore too predictable to be really suspenseful in spite of some more or less contrived twists. It's the ever same 'Capture the Flag'-formula, where the hero needs to wrest a 'Holy Grail'-like magical stone from the enemy's greedy claws in order to save the world, that we have not just recently seen in too many movies before; whether it's called 'Tesseract', 'Allspark' or like in this case 'Aether', it may be a somewhat necessary plot device that brings forward the action, however, if it remains like here the only impetus, the only sense without a deeper meaning, without a humane message, then it is too little and trite to have a lasting impact. Nowadays, every episode of 'Game of Thrones' offers much more excitement and drama than many a Blockbuster I've seen in recent years.What's missing plot-wise is compensated with great visuals and nearly breathtaking action sequences that come along as a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings meets Viking mythology crossover fantasy/science-fiction mash-up which is definitely a plus. The invasion of Asgaard by the Dark Elves strongly resembles the great Battle on Naboo in 'Star Wars: Episode I' especially since Bambi-eyed Nathalie Portman plays the dame in distress in both movies. The chemistry between her role Jane Foster and Thor is good although their kisses lack the fiery passion we saw in Spiderman for example; much more touching love stories have been told than this one for sure.'Thor: The Dark Kingdom' is at least nice to look at.",6,1,4,1 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Solid, Over-Hyped Dramedy with a Cute Droid
","When the first part of Star Wars (now referred to as Episode IV) came to the movie theaters back in the late 1970ies, George Lucas, the creator, rather went on holiday with his buddy Steven Spielberg than attending the premiere of his movie expecting this B-movie inspired Sci-FI Western to be a failure and yet it became possibly the most successful movie franchise in history giving millions of viewers worldwide a form of light escapism which rarely another series managed to accomplish; and now roughly 40 years later, we have a whole different situation, the movie companies invested so much money into this and the fan expectations are so high that failure is simply not an option so whatever fresh, innovative, bold ideas on part of young, aspiring script authors were submitted for Episode VII, obviously everything was abandoned as too risky for a potential success, therefore they hired the same old script author L. Kasdan not to adequately continue the saga but to simply retell it for a new generation of movie goers in such a way that the old fans won't feel excluded and J.J. Abrams made sure the cast is young and energetic and the dialogues not so cheesy like in G. Lukas' times.The result is a fastidious clinging to main plot lines of Episode IV our heroes have to pass in order to be more or less at the same endpoint as their predecessors. Making the new version of Luke Skywalker female is not hiding how closely she is portrayed after Luke having no real background story whatsoever leaving much to tell for further installments emphasizing the incomplete nature of Episode VII. As much as Kylo would like to become the new Darth Vader, in the end he is just a whiny mother's boy, such a disappointment. The fact alone that they felt the need for a Darth Vader rip-off is a sacrilege in my eyes, instead it would have been more honest to just let Vader clone or resurrect otherwise than just replace him with a wannabe cult figure. Some of the CGI aliens look like they come right from Hogwarts. J. Boyega as Finn is the only new archetype of character having no old role model. And the new version of R2D2, the cute BB-8 is almost stealing the show to everyone and he is just a beeping ball with a head! All the old characters like Han Solo or C3PO seemingly pop up out of nothing and they are really holding the story kept into a firm nostalgia corsage. Especially this entire annoying relational entanglements in the sense of who is the grandfather or mother or cousin of whom is on very trivial dramedy level. Where the prequels used to be all shiny and imaginative and epic in terms of settings and abundance, Episode VII is just open, barren deserts, empty space and forsaken forests, gray and monotonous with cheap scenery and one or two solid space battles and a weak melee fight.I really liked the beginning of this movie up until I realized this dog is just chasing after his own tail and we even applaud it since failure is not an option.",6,9,21,18 December 2015
Godzilla," The King of Monsters has Claimed his Throne!
","Finally Godzilla arrived in the 21 century in all his computer animated glory and it all starts where the myth originally came to life: Japan!What I liked the most about this version is that the director takes the iconic figure of Godzilla very seriously and pays tribute to his roots which is not only mirrored by the monster's traditional looks in contrast to the version of 98, but most of all because the director has understood what Godzilla stands for, which is the pure power of nature, it's a metaphor for all the uncontrollable natural catastrophes that we are helplessly exposed to and a warning of nuclear destruction in the sense of its Japanese creator who developed the idea of Godzilla as a response to the atomic attacks on japan. So it's a logical consequence that we find a lot of references to current major catastrophes in this movie like the great tsunami catastrophe in 2004, the core melt accident in Fukushima, and there are even scenes that reminded me very strongly of ground zero and the aftermath of 09/11 with all the fire men looking for buried survivors in a ruined, dust-covered surrounding. This affinity to real disasters that we have all seen on TV enhances authenticity and thrill factor of the movie.What's also extraordinary about this release is the way the fighting scenes are presented. It's not only the usual confrontation of several monsters whereupon a whole city is getting destroyed, there is more to this, the director plays with our expectations, he postpones fights, uses special camera angle's and finds quite pictorial ways to present the scenes which thus have a certain poetic quality to them, something unique that was not seen in any of the previous Godzilla movies due to the lack of cinematic means.In a time where massive city destructions are seen in movie theaters on a regular basis (I mean, the 'Transformers' series alone showed them in each of the three parts, not to think of 'Pacific Rim', 'Avengers' etc.) it is refreshing to see that you still can get something special out of the same genre-typical elements. so everyone who expected just two hours of mindless battles might be surprised by how much thought lies behind this beautifully depicted clash of monsters. It's true, that it takes a while until we hear Godzillas famous roar, however the time it takes is not spent in vain as it serves the creation of suspense and gives space for character development in the context of which the one and only, living legend Bryan Cranston plays a major role as an obsessive scientist who is involved in a very touching family drama. His son, a soldier, later attracts the focus on his struggle to fight back the threat (very evil MUTOS) with military means as there soon comes the point where scientists get pushed back to an counseling role like it is the case with Ken Watanabe who plays an Japanese scientist, a brooding voice of reason and an intermediary between the cultures; its good that the producers chose a Japanese actor to play such an important figure.The director Gareth Edwards did not reinvent the entire genre, there are still the typical ingredients to be found, but a very smart script that offers some good twists, a strong cast and a very beautiful cinematography make this movie one of the most ambitious and impressive contributions to the monster movie franchise, maybe not as good as 'Jurassic Park' but definitely worth seeing. If the Godzilla of 1998 was a silly joke than this one is an awakening, the first milestone of a new era of Godzilla movies that will be measured against this one. The king of monsters has claimed his throne!",7,4,9,21 May 2014
Deadpool," When Jackass meets Spiderman: Quite Amusing.
","'Deadpool' is the same-old exchangeable Marvel happy-go-lightly formula wrapped into a very naughty, very black-humored, often cynical, violent and sexually loaded package that might appear fresh and shocking at first glance, but, once you've unpacked it, there is not much left than just a slight feeling that you've just seen nothing more than solely a bizarre persiflage of a good superhero-movie and not just that, you also discover that deep down, 'Deadpool' is a rather naive story about true love, acceptance and the unwillingness to grow up.The main hero is such a chatterbox that he not only won't shut up even when a bullet pierces him another b***hole, he also speaks directly to us beyond the screen on a kind of meta level: this together with his ability to fully regenerate his body when injured really takes away something that every unforgettable movie should have which is, suspense.Sure, many lines are very funny and worthy to remember and some of the action scenes really kick a**; the somewhat kinky erotic dimension brought in by M. Baccarin, playing a role reminiscent of her iconic appearance in the series 'Firefly'; all this combined make the movie entertaining nonetheless, I just wished the plot itself would have been as provocative and crazy as the way it was presented to us.",7,1,11,20 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Mediocrity Disguised in a Shining Suit of Action and some Irony.
","A crazy, implausible, over-the-top storyline that is neither original nor particularly intriguing, except for some genre-typical twists, clad in a superb, tailored action-suit with the license to be self-ironic.Kingsman works as a rather violent 'Kick-Ass' version of a James Bond spoof having a slight touch of Austin Powers.Colin Firth handles his first engagement as action hero surprisingly well since his gallant stiffness matches the character he portrays in the movie, so that all in all he did not need to change much for this role in relation to the previous roles he played; in fact his character only gets really interesting in the moments when he briefly forgets about his good manners and starts wreaking havoc.His juvenile protégé and spy-in-training 'Eggsy' (T. Egorton) is certainly the most (or rather the sole) psychologically complex character in the movie because he is the only one undergoing an inner development from a Hooligan nobody to a Gentleman hero.However, they both are somewhat overshadowed by the lisping Samuel L. Jackson and this certainly just because of his funny lisping which makes him one of the most bizarre movie villains since 'Jaws' in James Bond.'Gazelle' (Sofia Boutella), the razor-harp woman and bodyguard on his side, entertains as a dangerous mixture of 'Cherry Darling' from 'Planet Terror' and 'Gogo Yubari' from 'Kill Bill'.Politically incorrect killing sprees and fast-paced close-combat fighting scenes together with caricatural characters and one or two laughs constitute the fun factor of this movie which might not be enough for a more demanding viewer who has seen tons of movies like this one.",6,2,8,17 March 2015
Spectre," A quiet Bond.
","Craig's fourth assignment as 007 more than the previous ones conveys a certain retro touch of the first Bond movies as if the authors made a cycle from 'Casino Royal' where Bond was reinterpreted, to finally becoming his old self which unfortunately implies that they kind of drove the Aston Martin against the wall and urgently should be looking for a new, more motivated Bond actor to again refresh the franchise.'Spectre' is an atmospherically dense, narrative-driven spy thriller with so scarce action scenes that it doesn't really qualify as a true action movie which in itself would not be a big problem if the story had more profoundness and originality (or sex) so that it drags a bit towards the ending. What made it still entertaining for me were the interesting characters beginning with M. Bellucci as an incredibly sensual widow to the bulky D. Bautista up to a very vicious Blofeld played by a rather under-challenged C. Waltz.The love story to the bond girl feels authentic albeit somewhat chilly at firstMy personal highlights were the opening in Mexico and an unforgettable torture scene, I just wished they would have put more effort into plot development, yet it's still enjoyable especially for Bond fans",6,1,6,8 November 2015
The Nice Guys," More than 'Nice'
","'The Nice Guys' is a very amusing detective story set in the stylish 1970ies with a mischievous detective duo, who has more luck than brains, and a touch of porn and violence.Ryan Gosling, who played the personification of coolness in 'Drive', now shows his humorous side by playing the over-the-hill private investigator Holland March, a single father who doesn't mind looking for people who he knows are already dead just for the sake of earning some money, a laxity that more than once has brought trouble upon him and one of those situations also makes him cross paths with Russell Crowe's character Jackson Healy, a rather moody, professional thug who likes letting his fists speak for himself and who else would be more suitable for the role than the notoriously choleric Russell Crowe?So together they form a duo as a new case forces them to cooperate and from that moment on they literally stumble upon one trace leading to another and evermore get themselves entangled in the snares of a big political conspiracy which of course surpasses their skills by far and the way in which they nevertheless manage to gain the upper hand gives cause for very comedic moments and memorable lines. The story may be confusing at first but in the end everything adds up convincingly, only the conventional finale is a letdown so to speak.What, to me, makes the movie stand out is the fact that the duo is actually a trio if you count March's daughter, the very smart, cheeky Holly, superbly played by A. Rice, she plays a very active part in the movie and often demonstrates a higher level of maturity than those two guys together.I'm very optimistic that this won't be the last case of 'The Nice Guys' we'll see.",7,2,5,14 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," This is How an Action Movie should Feel like!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a one big, breathtaking, lunatic car chase through a surreal looking Australian desert; it's mad, it's madder, it's f*ckn Mad Max! George Miller surpassed himself 30 years after he had let Mel Gibson fight in the Thunderdome for survival and he reclaimed the very essence of the franchise which is furious Speed, violence, freaky characters as well as rough, handmade action scenes with extraordinary vehicles and amidst all this accelerated ferocity, he still found one or two quiet moments for character development, narrative depth, and beautiful, even poetical imagery.Tom Hardy is an excellent replacement for Mel Gibson who would be too old for the role by now and Charlize Theron gives a worthy female counterpart as 'Furiosa'; she is smart and strong and not the only woman in this movie, who steps up to the men in a harsh, misogynic, post-apocalyptic wasteland.The score, the drums, the electric guitars, it's bombastic! This is how an action movie should feel like!",9,3,9,20 May 2015
The Great Gatsby," A Delight to Behold!
","Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of 'The Great Gatsby' combines the latest motion picture technology with the essence of F. S. Fitzgerald's over 80 years old modern-classic novel in order to make cinema at its most magnificent, most excessive.This movie has such a great power of attraction you can hardly escape from, it's fast and dynamic - like a good party, and you as the viewer are in the center of all the exuberant happening revolving around you in a hurricane of glance and glamor; it smiles at you with a raised cocktail glass as Mr. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) did when he welcomed Nick Carraway (T. Maguire) in his castle for the first time and from this moment on, there is only one question: What's behind his whimsical smile?The cinematography: the camera-work (tracking shots, pans, zooms, different perspectives, high-angle shots, &c.), the 3D effect that suited well the pomp, the editing (fast cuts, time leaps, different color filters, text sequences, archive footage...) as well as a cool, contemporary score with jazzy remixes of known hits by various artists such as Beyonce or Lana Del Rey, is what makes this movie stand out beside a very strong cast with DiCaprio's intriguing performance at it's top. The 'Roaring Twenties' were never more vital and the old New York never shone brighter or was dirtier (like in the 'Valley of Ashes') than in this motion picture I acknowledge as a really good piece of art which I refuse to compare with 'Moulin Rouge' (as some critics did) since it is neither a musical nor a comedy although it certainly had one or two humorous scenes.Carey Mulligan as Gatsby's love interest Daisy Buchanan is a delight to behold like a rare pearl you long to call your own, of a fragile and tender nature torn apart between Gatsby and her jealous husband who is played by J. Edgerton with such hypocritical arrogance that you cannot but find him unlikable in a positive way. Only Jordan Baker (E. Debicki) disappoints because she plays a rather shallow role which should have been a somehow emancipated opposite to a dependent woman of the 1920's who Daisy certainly is. N. Carraway recounts the tale in retrospect using Fitzgerald's powerful prose, a tale not so much of a tragical love affair as of a mysterious billionaire who is enormously wealthy and yet unhappy for the one true love of his life is married to another man.This movie aroused my wish to read the book again and this is indeed a good sign: highly recommendable!",9,8,14,24 May 2013
