Hereditary," A Boost to the Horror Genre
","This might be the first horror film I've seen with acting that I didn't hate. In fact, the acting in Hereditary was top flight, as was the rest of the film.The creativity was pervasive in the best way, with stunningly creepy shots which provided new and interesting opportunities to create tension and suspense. The writing was quite good as well. Hereditary was filled with genuine drama, mind-bending suspense, and visceral, terrifying horror. The ending was not a cliche-horror-movie-ending, but, frankly, a weird one. I would recommend this to anyone who is remotely interested in horror films.",8,2,4,11 July 2018
Aquaman," So bad it was funny
","The number of cringeworthy scenes in this movie is astonishing, but then again it is DC. I was crying laughing when Amber Heard played that little wooden flute on the boat though.",4,1,3,29 December 2018
