United 93," Harrowing, Authentic, and Heoric, 'United 93' is a moving experience
","The tale of events that occurred on that fateful September day in 2001, where 4 planes were hijacked and crashed, is a date that changed many and scarred many others. 'United 93' is a gripping recollection of United Airlines Flight 93 - the sole plane out of the 4 hijacked that did not reach its target.The film is very authentic; the camera never rests, the people on the ground at air traffic control are mostly those who actually were working at ATC on 9/11, and the use of lesser-known actors to depict the passengers really serves well to show that the people aboard Flight 93 were ordinary people leading regular lives, and not Navy SEALS or action movie stars. The film also takes place in real time, which adds to the realism.The film is so accurate and realistic it plays almost like a documentary, going through each of the events of 9/11 very well. It also plays like a thriller, because of how intense the film is. It is also brutally violent, with realistic-looking wounds and attacks that would clearly resemble the way passengers would revolt in such a situation, using anything they could get their hands on.Such a unique film has not been seen yet, and its down-to-earthliness and realism add to the experience. Being so realistic, the viewer definitely feels for the passengers, as they all start to realize just what kind of a situation they are in. It is a story of extreme heroism and courage, and the legend of the people aboard United 93 will live on.",10,7,15,29 April 2006
