Antz," Do they have writers at DreamWorks
","Although the animation was superb (partially made in Belgium, Yes!) this movie was not good enough to 'attack' Disney. They forgot one elementary thing of Animation : you do need a story too, and not the plot that was used in Antz.",Null,0,0,2 December 1998
Mulan," Disney has gone bananas !
","What a miracle : I didn't need one single Kleenex during a Disney movie. After the already 'different' Hercules, Disney now brings us Mulan, a story based on a Chinese poem. You might have thought that it would turn out to be very serious, but really, this is the funniest Disney-movie I've ever seen. But, technically, I think (to my humble opinion Mr.Disney), the movie is not so good. I know that the studios often change styles the last couple of years (like in Hercules, which was also technically very good), but this style didn't pleased me at all. Maybe they tried to imitate the cheap Chinese/Korean/Japanese productions that we often see on tv. (no, it wasn't THAT bad). I always use 'The Sleeping Beauty' from Disney as a reference to technical perfection, as that is the best Disney movie in my opinion. It is not possible to classify Mulan between the other 'Disneys', but it was superb, with Disney displaying drag queens etc. Is this film banned in Texas ?",9,1,2,2 December 1998
A Bug's Life," Disney rules, ones again.
","Disney (and the wonderful folks at PIXAR of course) offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'Antz' and they only had four legs (in 'Antz' six...). But backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which I missed in 'Antz'. Some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end (So keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), which were highly amusing and original. The line 'Filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer.",10,0,0,23 February 1999
There's Something About Mary," Low-grade humor is back !
","There's something about Mary doesn't deserve lots of comment. It was not funny (i.e. a stupid bathroom scene that continued to embarrass me for about ten to 15 minutes...), but there was a lot of laughing in the theater. Which explains the degree of intelligence I suppose of the average 'movie-watcher'. TSABM was too long, the plot was too predictable and as I said, the jokes for very low-grade. But I should have known better, my friends had warned me after they had seen Dumb and Dumber some time ago. Yes, you are right maybe I expected too much, like some people expect Godzilla to be a super intellectual film with a great plot and actors, while the lizard is the main subject of the movie...",5,0,0,23 November 1998
Life Is Beautiful," Benigni looks at WW2 from a new point of view
","How refreshing to see that someone has come up with a tragicomedie about Italy in the second world war. People in the cinema didn't actually know what to do, to laugh or to cry, because IT IS a dramatic film. 1000 X better than Saving Private Ryan, another commercial project from S.Spielberg, who want to make 'intellectual, high profit movies', well MR. Spielberg, let's say PSEUDO intellectual.AD",9,1,3,20 October 1998
