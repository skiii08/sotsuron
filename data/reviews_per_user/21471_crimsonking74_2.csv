","MAJOR SPOILERS!!!
It's unbelievable that this piece of crap is the biggest 007 film of all time. It's not a bond film.
So the bad guy is a super flamboyant dude that just runs away from James Bond the whole time, James is out of shape and looking and feeling like crap, They re-introduce the classic bond car but blow it up after a short little ride. We meet the bond girl and then she dies right away. The two old people try to get away but they use a flashlight so they are found easily, and how does Bond kill the bad guy? BY SHOOTING HIM IN THE BACK???!!! Ughhhh. This is the worst bond film I have ever seen in my life. Give me Casino Royale and License to Kill any day.",1,4,5,7 January 2020
Aliens," BEST FILM EVER.
","Doesn't get better than this. It has it all. Sci-fi, drama, comedy, action, etc..... I try to see it every year when they re-release in theatres. My favorite film of all time. Can't get enough of it. BAY 12, please.",10,2,3,22 November 2019
