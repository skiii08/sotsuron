The Blair Witch Project," EXCELLENT
","The Blair Witch Project was a fantastic horror movie which proved that you don't need special effects. The story (in case anyone doesnt know) is about three student filmmakers getting lost in the woods with a video camera. The film we see is the supposed real life footage shot by the filmmakers before they disappeared. The movie has a very interesting back story which is discussed at the start (pay special attention to the one local who discusses child murderer, Rustin Parr, then you will understand the ending better). All in all The Blair Witch Project is excellent, and I am looking forward to the sequel. 10/10.",Null,0,1,13 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just as good as the other three.
","The Phantom Menace was the best movie of 1999. After all the years of waiting it really did lived up to its hype. The story was good, especially how it set the second movie up at the end, the special effects were the best I have ever seen in a movie to date and the acting was very good. As for Jar Jar Binks, it did not spoil the movie as some people have said. Ok so he got a bit annoying in parts, but he was really just there to keep the kids happy. I give this movie 10/10.",Null,0,0,9 December 1999
Casablanca," Terrible
","I had the unfortunate 'pleasure' to see this film when it first came out in the 1940's. I left three times to be sick. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in all of my natural. The acting is sub-standard and the sets were really badly constructed. If you want to watch a good film, watch Hulk Hogan's Mr. Nanny and not this load of tripe.",Null,1,1,19 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The best comedy movie of the 1990's
","SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is without a doubt one of the greatest comedy films ever made and definetely the best of the 90's. The jokes are even funnier than in the TV series, but the unique animation remains the same (except in the Kenny/Hell scenes). The story sees Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny sneak into a cinema to see the R rated 'Asses Of Fire' starring their heroes Terrance and Phillip. After they have seen the film they start swearing (a lot) and making crude references (a lot). Their parents see this and decide that Canada is to blame for their childrens behavior, so they declare war on Canada. The Americans then Kidnap Terrance and Phillip. Cartman, Stan and Kyle then decide to try and rescue them. The whole movie is excellent but, here are my highlights. 1. Cartmans new version of Kyle's moms a bitch. 2. Kenny's death. 3. The end where Kenny finally reveals his face.I give SOUTH PARK a 10/10.",Null,0,0,29 December 1999
The Fifth Element," ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE
","The Fifth Element was an absolutely appalling film. The special effects were good, but the rest was awful. The story was bland and pathetic. It also lasted way too long. Also, was there really any need for that stupid man with the squeaky voice? If I had not paid to see it, I wouldn't have even watched it to the halfway point. I give this film 1/10.",Null,3,5,12 December 1999

About six months later I paid to see it again on pay per view, to see if it was better second time around. That time I did NOT make it to the half way point.",Null,1,1,12 December 1999
Batman Returns," BATMAN RETURNS
","Batman Returns is a very good follow up to the 1989 original. The story sees The Penguin team up with crooked business man, Max Schrek who is determined to make The Penguin the mayor of Gotham City. Early in the movie, Schrek throws his secretary from the top of a huge building. She then gets bitten by a lot of cats and she becomes Catwoman. Batman senses there is something crooked about The Penguin (who by this time has convinced Gotham that he is a good guy) and sets out to stop him and Schrek. Catwoman also wants to stop them, but only for revenge for what Schrek did to her earlier in the movie. All in all, this is an excellent movie. The acting is good, the sets are excellent and the story is very interesting. I give Batman Returns a 9/10.",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
Halloween," THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF ALL TIME
","Halloween is the best horror film ever made. The other Halloween movies are excellent too, but this one is the best. The reason it is so good is that it does not rely too heavily on blood and guts, it just lets you use your imagination. The story is quite basic (maniac stalking a bunch of teenagers) but it is also full of suspense. I give Halloween 10/10.",Null,0,0,21 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An excellent movie
","Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope, is an excellent film. In fact it is probably one of the best films ever made. This film is the fourth of six movies (two of which have not yet been released), and it tells the story of Luke Skywalker who wants to become a Jedi Knight just like his dad, who he does not yet know is the evil Sith apprentice Darth Vader. The acting is excellent, the story is great and the special effects (especially in the special edition) are the best you will see. 10/10.",Null,0,0,18 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Brilliant
","STAR WARS EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is an excellent sequel to the original movie. It is a lot darker than the first Star Wars movie. The story sees Luke Skywalker train to become a Jedi Knight. Also in this episode, Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his Dad. I give The Empire Strikes Back a 10/10.",Null,0,0,22 December 1999
Gladiator," BRILLIANT
","Gladiator is an absolutely fantastic movie. The special effects and sets are some of the best ever seen on film. The acting is excellent too. The movie lasts for two and a half hours, but when you're watching it you never think about the time, which is a sign that a movie is good.",Null,0,0,29 May 2000
The Wizard of Oz," THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE
","The Wizard Of Oz is simply the best movie that has ever been or ever likely to be made. I first saw this film when I was four (I'm 19 now), and I really liked it. I liked it so much, that I watched it every day for about a year after that. The acting is excellent, the songs are good and so are the huge sets. I give this film 11 / 10!",Null,0,2,4 December 1999
The Godfather," Awful, Awful, Awful
","The Godfather is a pointless, noisy, mindless, violent excuse for a film. It just seems to be an excuse to use the 'f' word for three hours. The acting is terrible and there is no story to be seen whatsoever. It seems to have been written by a three year old child. I give this film a 1/10 and that is being generous.",Null,3,9,19 December 1999
