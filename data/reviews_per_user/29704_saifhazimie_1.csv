Your Name.," If you're not watch it yet, then you should!
","To begin with when I looked up first the trailer of this film, I thought it was an anime! (whoops)-------I should say that this film is the best animation film for 2016, it's not exaggerated when you looked closely the aspect in this film. Hats off to Comics Wave Films presenting viewers the beautiful surreal scenery throughout the film, it's felt as the Tokyo that you seen in this film like real life video - you don't think it's animation! Most aspect of the film have been said well by other great 2 commentators, I felt I should not added more.My advice - if you're not watching this film yet - you should! It'll make you glued to your seat for that 1 hour and minutes of magnificent presentation.",10,8,17,8 September 2016
