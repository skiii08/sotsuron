The New World," I Could Not Get into This
","Sorry, I just did not get into this movie. Not a movie, a poem, as another reviewer wrote, maybe more of a documentary. Something is not right with this movie---it is like watching a filmstrip in elementary school. I found it long winded, rather dull, boring. It is difficult to understand the mumblings of the characters. The Hollywood makeup of the 'naturals' was evident. The casting was all right, I guess, but I just found myself waiting for it to be all over already. The scene where Pocahontas (and funny, she is never called Pocahontas in the movie---who would know if they were not familiar with her story?) is dressed in English finery is very realistic. Not so are the tattoos on Farrell's arms. Again, it is a visual masterpiece, but I just could not get into it, and readily see why it failed miserably. Not a go here. Very difficult to understand the speech.",5,2,6,26 January 2007
Marie Antoinette," Fair to Middling if That
","I really had no desire to see this, but a friend wanted to so I went. I should have trusted my instincts. The theater was almost empty--what does that say. The first clue that this was a rotten drag was when we first see Marie (Dunst) as a girl supposed to be 15--and 15, she does not look. So ridiculous was her entrance with highlights in her blond hair---mind you, highlights...now did they have highlights back then. I was not too keen on the casting and what was most incredibly and so extremely disturbing was the rock music--rock music in a seemingly period piece. You, the viewer, the audience, get only a fraction of the character that was Marie Antoinette. We do witness some maturity and growth, but then, slam, slap--the movie ends. I was stunned as were the few, very few, sitting with me in the rather empty theater. At least, the director could have put some words on the screen to tell the viewer what happened, but I guess she figured we all know the ending---bad. See it on television. A waste.",5,5,9,21 October 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Stupendous
","At first, when the movie started, I simply could not figure out or master the speech patterns---the drawl--or maybe I am trying to say they were mumbling a lot and I,personally, could not understand the speech--it was really, at times, very inarticulate, and maybe the director should have picked up on this. However, after a while I got used to it, but there were many times I simply could not figure out or understand,maybe that is a better word, what they were saying-- a lot of mumbling. Aside from this, this movie was one of the best, well acted films I have ever seen in my life. I was so moved. You know when you see a movie and then something about it, something in it, moves or touches you, and it stays with you for the next day, you keep thinking and thinking about it---over and over again,well that is exactly what happened here. I applaud this movie and I just think it was truly wonderful. Wonderful. Poignant and powerful and it stands as a beacon, a lesson for all of us, gay or straight, to learn about how we must follow our heart as far as love is concerned. That and so much, much, much more. See this movie!!!",10,33,38,2 March 2006
Crash," No Oscar Winner in my Book But A Powerful Statement Anyway
","I saw this movie and do not understand how this got to be best picture. I think the acting is superb and the character portrayal real and the plot believable---but best picture? NO WAY. I don't understand it. Brokeback Mountain was so much superior. This was a compelling and realistic portrayal of racism and the seedy side of life in modern Los Angelee. The movie is abundant with profanity and violence and characters that seem to have nothing to do with each other, yet are somehow connected to the fabric of the city. Look, it is a good movie, but a best picture Oscar winner. I think absolutely not. It is not in that league.",5,1,3,8 April 2006
Knocked Up," Absolute Idiocy
","What a waste. Absolute idiocy. The story of two mismatched people who are mismatched at the beginning, mismatched after she gets pregnant, and mismatched at the end. A total disaster with excessive---I repeat: excessive profanity uttered in just about every single sentence from every single unrealistic character. Horrible acting. With a cast of ridiculous characters that add nothing to the already silly plot. Why didn't she just get an abortion or just leave the jerk. I don't even believe I watched the whole thing. There was else on to watch, I guess. Pass this up. Why it was produced is a mystery to me. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother.",1,3,9,23 May 2008
Capote," Brilliant Performance in a Boring Film
","Look, I just cannot get on the bandwagon for this film---even though I read many books by Truman Capote. Hoffman makes a a superb clone of Truman Capote. His performance is brilliant--I will say it again: brilliant, but to me, the movie was a little boring, no, maybe a lot boring. It mainly concentrates on his writing of In Cold Blood and his infatuation and obsession with Perry Smith--that is it. Nothing after that. Didn't the man have more to him after In Cold Blood---well, we are just given a few sentences on the screen as to what he did, when he died. I was impressed by the performance of Hoffman but felt the film lacking. I don't recommend it.",6,1,2,3 March 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," I was not that impressed
","Well, to me, I was not all that impressed. I thought I was seeing the same old movie, 11, 12, 13...all merged as Ocean's Zero. Enough already. This movie cost a lot to make with fair to middling performances. Ellen Barkin was, however, refreshing to see, and I liked her character. The acting, the plot and the characters remain trite and predicable, even stereotypical, but it is a glorious glimpse into the Las Vegas gambling world. George Clooney is aging fast, and I feel the theme here has expired. Please, let's hope this is the last of the Ocean's saga. The movie has a lot of action, some funny scenes, but, again, all in all, not impressive, even dull at times. Judge for yourself at $10.00 an admission ticket, which is what I paid, and worth only half that amount.",5,5,10,11 June 2007
Dreamgirls," Absolutely the BEST
","I saw this last evening and I wish I could see it again tonight. The performance by the enormously talented Jennifer Hudson is STILL making me think abut the movie. I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed this entertainment. That, you see, is what it is: entertainment. It is what a movie is all about. Dreamgirls is great entertainment. Acting by all in this cast is more than superior. Now, I am far from a fan of musicals, but this movie is one big exception. I say it again: I loved it and want to see it again. Wonderful. Fabulous. Great story and superb in every way. Beyonce has grown as an actress. I have new admiration for Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy is excellent as well. I have nothing but praise. I want to buy the DVD. Please see this movie. But a warning: be prepared to be utterly transfixed and amazed.",Null,0,0,18 February 2007
Twilight," I see nothing spectacular here.
","I finally saw this movie on TV this evening. I never saw it before and was eager to see what the fuss is all about. I was not impressed. I kept looking at the clock waiting for it to finally finish. I can see why teens may like this with its lame storyline and teen idol appeal of Robert P., who, to me, is a big nothing, with two moles prominent behind his left ear, and one on his face, that, and heavy, heavy eyebrows, although somewhat plucked for this movie. That wig on Lautner was half coming off--you could see right through it. I just thought the movie was stupid, senseless. That baseball game was just ridiculous, as were the bunch of motley characters who seemed to escape from a Halloween party. A fantasy, but just ridiculous, even for a fantasy. A good teen movie, but not for intellectuals. Garbage.",2,5,6,25 March 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Superior Story and Acting
","Reviewers here either love it or hate it. Well, I cannot say that I loved it. I certainly did not hate it, but I liked it a great deal. I found it a superior story with equally superior acting from all involved. The makeup was extraordinary. The tale of a man who goes from old to young rather than from young to old. Really no difference, or is there. I thought Brad Pitt did a fabulous job in the role, and I was really into the story or plot. I do have one thing I thought was rather unnecessary---that was the whole sequence of how things went amiss so as to cause the car to hit Daisy--that whole thing how one was late, one had a fight with a boyfriend, a shoe lace broke----all that, I felt, was unnecessary. Just show her getting hit by a car; that whole sequencing thing should have been cut. In any case, I enjoyed this movie, found it entertaining to watch and behold. The acting was excellent and a fabulous story.",8,1,2,9 February 2009
Saw II," To Me It Was Ho Hum , Nothing Special and I Was Not Scared
","I thought the original was better. This one, well, I wasn't scared, and just thought it was dumb---the characters, especially this big muscle goof played by Franky G, nice to look at, but I cannot understand his speech. This boy needs to speak clearly and stop posturing. I was not impressed by the plot, the acting or the storyline. I preferred the original Saw. That movie was more suspenseful and had way better acting and believability than Saw II. This is just pure junk. I cannot agree with some other reviewers here who praise this as the greatest horror and thriller movie. I was not horrified and I was very, very far from being thrilled. A disappointment with lousy acting--by all the actors. Junk.",4,11,22,3 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Flat and Very Lackluster at Best
","The book was a mess and jumble of confusion, average in written content and rather lackluster---at least that is my opinion when I finished reading the book. As for the movie, well, I found the movie marginally better. My problem was with the casting of the actors. Tom Hanks is not the best actor or the best choice for this role. Sorry, but he was wooden and unbelievable---this was not a part he should have been cast in. The actress playing Sophie was only slightly better. I must say, the plot in the movie was a bit easier to follow than the book. It is more of an action thriller to me. It's a long, somewhat tiring movie, and it certainly did not hold me in suspense, but I repeat: the casting of the actors in the lead parts was terribly wrong. I wanted to see it to compare it to the book, to clarify things I found somewhat confusing in the book. I was, however, not impressed--not at all.",5,2,5,20 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," I Am So Glad I Did Not Pay To See This
","A friend gave me the DVD. Horrible. I am so glad I never saw this movie in a theater. A stupid, dumb, totally unrealistic movie. The characters are completely unbelievable. The plot is totally ridiculous. The whole movie is replete with absurd dialog and there are so many wigs and hairpieces on Jolie, it is hard to concentrate. Brad is cute, but this movie is far from it. I would not recommend it and unless it comes on TV, which it will, don't spend a penny. I could hardly wait for the movie to end. Disappointing and dull. It may be good for those who are die hard fans of the starring duo here or those who like violent, big action movies, but all I can say again is: I am so glad I did not pay to see this.",2,1,3,22 December 2005
Burlesque," Not Bad--Pleasant Enough Entertainment
","As I said: not bad and peasant enough entertainment. A story about a young girl who goes to Hollywood from Iowa to find herself, enter show business and be a star, more or less, coupled with how a former dancer needs to get money together to pay her mortgage and other expenses, more or less, to save her night club, called Burlesque, from becoming an office building. I never was much of a fan of Christina Aguilera, but I clearly see from this movie that she is quite a talent. The long blond wig she wears--the color--is quite a better shade of blond than the her real hair, bleached that hideous white color she usually sports. She does quite a nice acting job, and is a finer singer--even singing an old Mae West song--and she does nicely at that too. I don't think she is particularly pretty, with her awful nose and too close together eyes, but she is talented. Now, Cher. She looks just awful. I don't see why she took this role. She sings one or two songs, but is not at all animated in this movie. She does not dance, but just seems to sit around, walk around, stand around...so what is the big deal of having her. I will say it again: she just appears to sit around. Stanley Tucci who seems to be in so many movies these days (liked him in a lot in Julie and Julia) does a god job, Cam G. is all right--I mean that part could have been played by any young male actor, but his tattoos are too distracting. What is it with these young male actors and their hideous tattoos? I heard a lot of people compare this to Dreamgirls. I disagree. Big time. Dreamgirls is totally different. To me, it is a movie I could see over and over, and I did--perhaps 8 times. Burlesque does not do it for me. I do recommend it as an entertaining movie, the songs are sublime, the story is really and totally sort of unrealistic, but, again: it is pleasant enough.",8,0,0,18 December 2010
The Queen," Mesmerizing
","What can I add that the majority of the other reviewers on this board have not said. Mirren WAS the queen....exactly. What a great movie. Entertaining, exciting and moving. A great tribute to humanitarian Diana and a rare glimpse into the stately Queen. What a picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The actors all were superb, but kudos, especially to Mirren and to the actor playing Tony Blair. I did not really get a true characterization of the pomposity of Charles; the actor who portrayed him, I feel, was miscast. All in all, however, this is a must see piece of entertainment. You will really understand the Queen of England, and perhaps, if she saw this, and I bet she did, she understands herself a bit better.",10,0,0,12 June 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Strictly a Teen Movie
","I saw Twilight on television. See my review of it on this site. That movie was enough. I skipped the second movie. There was absolutely nothing to see around here, so I reluctantly saw this crap last evening. My friend and I were going to leave after about one half hour, but because the admission price of a ticket was so costly, we stayed. Oh, torture. A real teen movie with a 25 year old Pattinson who simply, to me, is not all that, and an 18 year old buffed bodied kid with such a bulbous and wide nose, well, that is all you see of Taylor Lautner the minute he appears on screen--that big, wide nose. And this, the result of a nose job, too. I do not see the appeal of him or for him. Sure, he has a nice physique, but even with his nose job, he needs another. His nose is all over his face. I read there was not much they could have done. Some noses are like that, especially with thick nose skin. I repeat: a teen movie and with horrible acting encased in a juvenile plot, that is fantasy come to life. Teens made this saga a hot money maker, and now a third one is coming. Awful. Complete garbage. And the wigs in this movie were so obvious, it bordered on the absurd. Stay home.",2,11,17,12 July 2010
Valkyrie," Stumbles, Plods and Trods Along
","Tom Cruise is terribly, terribly miscast here. A mid-western American accent comes out of the mouth of a stiff Nazi soldier. Very unconvincing. I felt the whole movie was slow, slow, slow to the point of total boredom. Hard to watch and hard to figure out what was going on in the beginning. Not only until the last third of the movie does it get marginally interesting. The laugh came from the portrayal of Adolph Hitler. I mean, didn't the producers and directors watch their own film. Who did the casting here. And the photography. Was there a shortage of lights or good weather. The whole film is so black and dark, photographed in shadows. Just very hard to watch. You could see the strain on Tom Cruise as he tried to elevate this colossal mess. I felt it was awful; simply awful. Miscast, bad acting, obscure photography and does not even have the look or feel that it takes place in Germany of the 1940's. The movie stumbles, plods and trods along., They are killed at the end. Goodbye. The end. Awful.",1,20,44,9 February 2009
