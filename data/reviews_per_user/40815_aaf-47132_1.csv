Skyfall," This movie, from my perspective, serves as an honor to all the past James Bond films. This film is indeed worth 2 hours and 23 minutes of anyone's time.
","** Spoilers!!Skyfall 007 film features Bond, represented by the actor Daniel Craig, embarking on yet another dangerous and thrilling mission to save MI6 and perhaps the world. The film starts off with Bond and Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chasing down a mercenary who possess crucial information of the names of the agents in MI6. When Bond finally manages to subdue his opponent to submission, Eve is ordered by her superior, M, played by Judi Dench, tells Eve, 'TAKE THE BLOODY SHOT!'. (Skyfall 007, 2012). She misses the attacker and the bullet hits Bond, where he plunges down into the river nearly dead. The same yearning theme of all James Bond films recurs again and again: the best ways are old ways. Throughout the history of James Bond films, this idea has always remained and will always remain as an essential part of each and every James Bond film. For Instance, A proof of this is easily shown in the last James Bond film. During the poker game scene in Casino Royale, Bond is seen to rely on his gut feeling and abandon traditional methods of winning poker. This of course works out for him, and he earns a huge payout as a result. This scene provides evidence of the same culture so clear in James Bond films that the audience never tires of. Furthermore, later on in the film, Bond returns to MI6 after having heard of a recent attack on MI6 headquarters. He describes his unintentional time out of action to M as simply 'enjoying death.' When he returns, he seems to have declined somewhat physically and mentally, having been characterized by the psychologist as a person with a degree of physical and mental trauma and having failed almost every part of the assessment program of MI6. However, due to the tender of M, Bond is given clearance after unknowingly failed his 007 re-entry exam. This shows a clear example of how the importance of tradition and instinct overrides logical analysis and reasoning.Moreover, during the course of the film, Bond and other characters continuously refer to the 'old ways'. For example, In the scene between Eve and Bond at the suite, Eve makes a remark about Bond using a cutthroat razor and Bond responds by saying, 'One ought to do things the old-fashioned way.'(Skyfall 007, 2012). In addition, when Eve is shaving Bond, she makes a slick remark saying that he's an 'Old dog with new tricks.' (Skyfall 007, 2012). Lastly, during the last fight scene of the film, Bond uses a knife to kill the main boss. This signifies that sometimes the surest and most effective ways are always following tradition. Another vivid example of the importance of tradition in James Bond films could also be examined in the opening credits of the film. As in all James Bond films, there is referred to as the 'Unique Gun Barrel Sequence. This classical sequence so characteristic of Bond films features Bond shooting at the viewer of the inside of a gun barrel. This opening is a trademark of Bond films and always reminds the James Bond fan that some things will never change.Subjectively speaking, Skyfall 007 is a manifestation and reminder of the classic James Bond films. It always references the importance of keeping with tradition, and remembering one's history. This movie, from my perspective, serves as an honor to all the past James Bond films. This film is indeed worth 2 hours and 23 minutes of anyone's time.",8,1,5,1 May 2017
