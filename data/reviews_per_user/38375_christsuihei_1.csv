E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. was a great movie.
","E.T. is a world-famous movie, no one has not heard of this movie. I thought the reason that Elliott and E.T. became friends easily is because Elliott had the same feelings as E.T.At first, Elliott was not a happy, talkative and self-confident child.He was too young for his brother, his father did not live with him and his mother was always busy. Similarly, E.T. was alone on Earth without friends. He did not know anything about humans and he did not speak their language. He was frightened and lone. I thought that the most impressive part was the friendship between a human boy and an alien. They belonged to different planets, they spoke different language, but they had the same feeling. Elliott could feel what E.T. felt. Although they had many difficulties: Elliott's mum wanted to separate them and the police wanted to catch them. They overcome those difficulties one by one. Elliott also tried his best to help his best friend. He gave food to E.T., helped E.T.to make a transmitter and helped him to his planet.They told us that friendship is important and we must treasure it.",Null,0,1,23 February 2005
