Requiem for a Dream," ........speechless
","This movie is probably the most realistic movie out there. This movie shows where you get with greed and stupidity. Clearly, this movie is about addiction, different forms and prices. There are so many different levels which this movie can be seen from and as always with another view, the level advances. This movie is SO beautifully sad and sad again.One of the best ways to describe this movie is 'ass to ass'(and its also basically said in the movie if you pay any attention). Its truly mine.the best in my opinion and should be way higher than #63.This might be one of the few life-changing movies for a viewer. Although it wasn't for me and I yet haven't found one. Let me just clear that out, that its very rare for a film to be a life-changing experience, it doesn't come from one view.10/10, and if IMDb would let people to rate one movie with 15 then this would be the one.",10,1,2,6 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Very good but hoped some more dedication from Bale.
","I really enjoyed this movie. Nowadays it is pretty hard to make a good western but this one surely is. Everyone who hasn't seen it, start thinking about it because believe me, its worth your money and time. But I don't want to talk much about the film, lets talk more about the actors now.Russell Crowe - Well, as always, you can expect a superb performance from him, although he didn't much surprise. He's character wasn't that hard to play either.. but characters in western never are.Ben Foster - I can't begin explaining how amazed I am. He just jumped out of nowhere with hes performance. Although he had a major role in Alpha Dog, it wasn't a big movie. I think he will have a huge acting career.Christian Bale - For a long time, he was one of my favourite actors but that rising sled is falling. He hasn't given a good performance since Prestige. Hes still good, but not as good as he used to be.",7,1,3,21 December 2007
Ghost Rider," Sorry, all out of mercy
","You know when sometimes watching a movie you have a need for a certain movie type? Well watching this a had lust for an action movie and thats what I got. This movie doesn't have a deep plot, but also isn't plot less but still, pretty much is.I don't know much about Ghost Riders history, but since it is based on a comic book, I suppose they couldn't change much there. In my humble opinion its more important for a film to be book based than changed to be better. It was pretty hard for me to decide weather to put 5 or 6 points. Would like 5.5 or something, but pity, thats not available.This movie is an average action movie. If you don't have a certain need to watch a action movie, don't pick this one. Otherwise do. Nicolas Cage has done a good job in this movie. Thumbs up!",5,0,2,26 February 2007
The Incredibles," A little overrated but still good
","For the record, let me just say that I still like this movie a lot but I don't think it deserves to be in the top. Its just that its not top250 material.The movie is about superheroes and all the basic hero abilities are there like superstrenght, flexibility, superspeed, force field, invisibility and shooting ice. I hoped to see a fireshooter too but not this time. But all the others are there so I'm not complaining.Why it doesn't deserve a spot in the top250 is because.. it doesn't have that X factor that makes me like this movie. But since this is in the top, I think a lot of people still like it, so its a good movie. I rated it 8/10 so that means its above average(average would be 6/7 for me).",7,0,3,18 October 2007
I Am Legend," Really disappointed
","I really liked this movie. I was pretty mad when it ended because it was so good so far and when I realized that its about to end I couldn't believe it because it was.. the story wasn't over at all. In stead of making a 200 minute long movie and get to the top250 in IMDb, they decided to stop there and just everything else important said in the last 5 minutes. After seeing this, I really was stunned. Didn't expect that huge of a fail and tore down my ratings of this movie. After realizing that this movie was no more than a regular zombie movie, I can't rate this highly because of Wills performance, which was unbelievable. Hes performance can turn Manos into The Godfather. Also, what was the point of the flashbacks. The flashback was total of 10 minutes long in this movie and just showed the obvious - the spread. It character information or its background which is usually the point of flashbacks.The movie had a 150 million dollar budget and was so short and really, really poor CGI. I mean, there was NOTHING there. I think that CGI is a mistake to make models like humans, dogs etc. Its easier, less expensive and MUCH better and realistic to just use costumes and makeup. In the case of like 'Transformes' yes, you cant use make-up to make the transformers, but all the best horror movies have costumes like Silent Hill and Jeepers Creepers(although there is a huge movie mistake in JC where you can see the zip of the costume).This movie is nothing more than an above-average action film. Sorry.",6,1,3,16 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Movies may live forever but not people
","Heath Ledger is dead. Before I comment this movie I just want to make myself very clear. I have never rated a movie for reasons that has nothing to do with the plot of the movie like an actors death or a film being super old like the first in its genre or something. That doesn't matter to me and shouldn't matter to anyone.Heath Ledger as the joker knocked me on my ass. I never expected him to impress me the way he did. This movie does deserve to be the topcat. No one should give The Godfather, Psycho or any other movie extra credit just because people say 'it is a classic'. So the **** what? Does it change the fact that a movie is rated worse because it is new and a movie made 50 or more years back is just rated good because it is old? Is that fair? Do we have to wait for another 50 years so we can finally say 'ok, now we can say that The Dark Knight a classic too, NOW its better than The Godfather' rather than now?Overall I liked the movie a lot. I hoped to see a lot more joker scenes and after every scene he was in I couldn't wait for the next one. The movie wasn't too long, not for me. I would have watched it 10 hours straight and just to see the joker.",6,3,8,27 July 2008
