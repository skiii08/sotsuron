Alien 3," A powerful underrated sequel
","This is a well made movie that dissapointed a lot of fans me included, we all like happy endings and we don't get it this time around more like a pretty sad conclusion for lieutenant Ripley. The 4th installment wasn't necessary this is basically the end of the story.",9,2,2,28 May 2020
Armageddon," Do me a favor
","Go get your popcorn ready, relax and enjoy this big budget comedy sci fi flick, it gets a little boring when they get in the space but is absolutely worthy because of the excellent CGI, Best Michael Bay movie yet",9,0,0,22 June 2020
