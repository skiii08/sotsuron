Mission: Impossible III," Disappointingly generic - Alias re-done with Cruz instead of Garner
","Short Version - Certainly not good, but not horrendous either - people who care nothing about plot or small details and like a bunch of action with no substance will probably like it. Long Version - For those of you out there who follow the Alias series, this movie is pretty much just like it. Me personally, I've watched through the first 3 seasons - it's a pretty good show with a very involved plot (which is what i like about it) - however, there are many many plot holes and unrealistic parts to it that keep the show from being great. A lot of it feels very dumbed down for the American public - like whenever someone is on a mission, and someone is talking to the agent through their ear-piece, the agent always holds their hand up to their ear - this would never happen of course because the hole point of having the device in your ear is to a) keep your hands free and b) to make sure no one else can tell you're talking/listening to anyone else. But, the directors feel the need to have someone put their hand to their ear just so everyone watching knows that they have a piece in. ----- This movie is just like that - dumbed down for the public and for plot line purposes. Is it a bad movie? No. Some say 'well it can't be totally realistic, look at what's going on, you have to let some things go.' I can accept the over-the-top plot (it's supposed to be that way) - but I don't accept a movie not keeping people interested in the plot just because they're explosions and action sequences. It's a sell out to me and that's the way this movie is.",3,6,12,6 May 2006
Ocean's Eleven," pretty cool..
","Ocean's Eleven, starring everyone you can possibly think of, is a decent movie that wont change your life but will entertain you for 2 hours..yeah, it had lots of big names, and they were all pretty good, i personally felt that it was a waste of all of the talent, it's not often so many people get together for one movie..but, for a heist movie, it was pretty cool i guess..you ever gone to your favorite resturant that you know is very good, and you order what you know to be very good, but when it gets to you, it's either not cooked just right or it doesnt taste quite the same, so you leave feeling a little let down?...that's sort of how this movie made me feel..hard to explain..but yeah, overall, it's pretty cool and worth seeing unless you're one of the ones who get irritated over obvious outcomes",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," Dont let people tell you it's just about B&G..they've missed the point
","Black Hawk Down is a movie that in my opinion is tough to watch, but not because of the blood and guts aspect(it's not meaningless b&g).  This movie is not a made-up plot with romantic twists and one-line jokes..this is a real life account of an event that actually happened, and for that reason i think that alot of people who didnt like the movie were expecting a more Saving Private Ryan type flick..everyone remembers the first 15 mins of SPR, totally shocking, but then the movie calms down, lets the audience relax, adjust and digest what they've just seen.  Black Hawk Down isnt like that and doesnt try to be..it takes a real life situation that happened in 1993 and tells it like it is.. For people who make comments on this movie like 'what does showing us blood and guts tell us about war, do we really need this to show us that war is violent and brutal, what sort of insight is that into war', i'd say they totally missed the point...this movie isnt here to 'shock' you with blood and guts into realizing war sucks..everyone already knows war sucks..this movie just shows it the way it is, and if you dont believe it then ask those rangers and delta's who were lucky enough to make it back alive.. This movie takes a real life account and tells the story just as it happened. Period.  You either like that kind of thing or you dont.  But please dont say that it was just about blood and guts, because it obviously was not. As for was it good or not?  yeah i liked it alot, it was the way the situation escalated from normal to bad to worse to unbelievable helplessness..very good movie in my opinion",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Unfortunately, one can't be told how good the Matrix Reloaded is..you have to see it for yourself
","I normally don't post many reviews for movies..not because I don't like to but really don't have that much time..but I felt obligated to give my review for this kick ass movie ----- The Matrix Reloaded is not comparable to the first one.  We already know the Matrix exists, we already know that Neo is the One and that he has awesome powers.  This time, it's about the next step.  I'd be the sorriest person in the world if I gave any type of spoiler, so I won't.  But I will say this, I went Wed. night to see it, then just got back from seeing it again at the 3pm show, and I have to say this is one of the best movies of all time. Being that the 2nd is so good on top of the first one, this movie trilogy will in my book go down as the all time best trilogy of movies ever. ----- But be prepared..this movie has ALOT of plot depth.  Alot of people will come back from this movie confused, knowing that the scenes all looked good and kicked ass, but unsure of the overall plot.  I felt the same way coming out of it the first time.  Don't let anyone's comments have any effect of whether or not you go see this.  If you're a fan of the first one, do not hesitate to go see the 2nd, you will not be disappointed.  Also, I'd highly recommend you go seeing it twice, as it takes 2 seeings to fully comprehend the plot(which i think rocks).  And remember, the oracle already knows what you'll decide",Null,0,0,15 May 2003
