The Blair Witch Project," Very poor!
","If you haven't seen this film yet, I wouldn't be too upset! I read somewhere on the internet it cost less than $100,000 to make...yes i can believe it but what did they do with the other $99999.I have to say it's the 2nd worse film i've seen and a complete waste of 86 minutes of my time.If you are into slasher flicks you will be very disappointed.Actually it might be worth watching just for the laughable factor on how poor this really is.Over hyped, poor plot, anybody with a camcorder and a torch could of made this film!",3,0,2,8 February 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Mediocre at best!
","I came on to this site to read about this film before going to see it at the Cinema. I read with enthusiasm the reports of it and as my wife usually weeps at sad films I packed an extra 2 packets of tissues for the supposed emotional turmoil we were about to endure.This film is a very slow starter, I knew before I started to watch it, it was only 1 hour 25 mins long so after 60 minutes I was starting to get a little impatient.I was disappointed to say the least, it wasn't a particularly good story and I seemed to miss the brilliant acting I was lead to believe by reading these other reviews / synopsis.I looked over at my wife at the end of the film and she looked back at me with a 'thanks for wasting 1 and a half hours of my time' look, NO TEARS, well maybe a few of anger.I think 7.9/10 average is more than generous for this film, it's OK if there is nothing else that takes your fancy but I wouldn't make a special journey to see it.",3,3,11,8 February 2009
