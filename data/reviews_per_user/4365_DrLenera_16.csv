Raiders of the Lost Ark," Still a teriffic action/adventure,though maybe not the best of the trilogy
","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is now generally regarded as one of the greatest adventure movies ever made,and for the most part,they'll right.Steven Spielberg and George Lucas succeeded in ressurrecting the style of 30s/40s serials for an 80s audience,keeping all the elements one half-remembers from viewing 'cliffhangers'as a kid on TV or just EXPECTS from a great adventure yarn,such as hidden treasure,lost tombs,fights,nasty creatures such as snakes and spiders,evil villains,they put 'em all in there,and than always remembering not to take it TOO seriously.Infact the film's tone is almost perfect,it seems constantly aware of it's own ludicrousness but never becomes camp.It can possibly be said of Raiders that the long opening sequence,as our hero encounters one peril after another in a Peruvian tomb,is so great,it so captures the spirit of pure adventure,that the rest of the film never quite reaches it's giddy heights.It also shows Spielberg's skill as a director[and Lawrence Kasdan's writing]in introducing and sketching out the personality of our hero,Indiana Jones while all this action takes place.After this the film certainly goes down a notch or to-two brief fights in Tibet and Egypt are all we have in terms of thrills until just after half way when we have a brilliantly sustained passage of non-stop action climaxing in a truck chase sequence which is one of the best sequences of it's kind ever.Oddly however the climax features not some more Indy action but the Wrath of God,an original but not completley satisfying touch,with Indy pretty much redundant.This final scene also takes the film uneasily into horror territory,an area occasionally strayed onto by the film,which perhaps jars with many of the other elements of the film[while the first sequel,Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom,saw it's dark aspects become far more neccessary to it's overall feel and story].Set against some of today's action/adventure films,Raiders does seem a little slow,with perhaps not quite enough action setpieces,but it still holds up with it's sharp writing and charcterisation,particularly with Karen Allen's spunky heroine and ofcourse Indy himself,who really has a dark edge to him and is a milliom miles away from the clean-cut heroes of the serials,as is some surprisingly strong and reallistic violence,almost completely different to that in ,say,Star Wars. It's impossible now to imagine anyone but Harrison Ford playing Indiana.Ofcourse John William's score deserves a great deal of credit,not only for it's famous main theme but the many other ways it backs up and enhances the film,an examplery adventure score.Raiders will probably never seem as thrilling as it must have seemed when it first came out,and in some ways the sequels now hold up better.Nevertheless,it's still a great ride.",Null,0,1,23 October 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fine fantasy adventure for all the family,and a worthy adaptation of the book
","Although sadly considered by quite a few to be just a kid's movie,a kind of juvenile Lord of the Rings {and mind you,what's wrong with that?},this is a terrific fantasy epic that may feature children as the protagonists but is certainly not childish. Whilst C.S Lewis did indeed write his books for children,the makers of this film adaptation of what is not the first but easily the best known book have carefully steered the film away being simply for children to it being a great film for all the family. Of course if you're the sort who would laugh as talking animals and the like,it's not worth you seeing this film,but do you hear many adults say,for instance,The Wizard of Oz is rubbish and just for kids?Opening dramatically if a little discertainly with planes bombing WW2 London,the film proceeds at a leisurely place,introducing the young protagonists and us to the land and denizens of Narnia gradually,but the pace gradually gets faster and faster until the final battle,an eye-popping sequence featuring more mythical creatures than you can imagine.Worried readers of the book have nothing to fear,the film is quite faithful and even,dare I say it,improves on the book at times. The children are characterised better,and a few sequences are added in the middle section of the story to bump up the pace. Only one major scene from the book near the end,where a spell is cast and 'things' come to life {I can't say more as I try to avoid spoilers} is disappointing and falls far short of it's potential.The acting of the children is excellent,although Tilda Swinton gives the stand out performance as the scary but oddly sexy White Witch. The special effects are mostly great. I say mostly,because while the effects team have pulled off a few miracles such as with the talking lion Aslan {a CGI creation so convincing he cane almost be mistaken for a real lion},there is the odd element which appears to have been rushed,such as two instances of DREADFUL back projection {how could they?} and a scene involving a frozen lake and falling ice {one of the 'invented' scenes} which also suffers with poor direction. Al Adamson {of Shrek 1 and 2} sometimes shows his inexperience with live action,although he generally does an okay job.While the action is conspicuously bloodless,there is quite a bit more darkness in the film than one might expect-very young kids may be scared by things such as the Witch's wolf servants,and the ritual killing of one of the film's characters three quarters of the way through is surprisingly disturbing. Some may even see disturbing sexual elements in the scenes between Edmund and the Witch who is trying to seduce him to what George Lucas would have called 'the dark side'.Generally though,this is a fine fantasy adventure movie that certainly bodes well for any future films of Lewis' books and,despite complaints to the contrary,is no more 'Christian' then Lord of the Rings. Don't expect Lord of the Rings or,indeed,Harry Potter,and you'll find much to enjoy.",Null,0,1,22 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," What an incredible achievement
","The Lord Of The Rings has been considered unfilmable for many years,mainly because of the sheer scope and the quantity and quality of the effects needed. Not any more. Peter Jackson {and who would have thought it from the man responsible from Meet The Feebles?}has done something which thwarted even the likes of John Boorman and Stanley Kubrick. Partially this is because everyone else wanted to do it all as one film. Not here. New Line,in a risky move that has now paid off,let Jackson do three films. One for each book. And the first is just superb,a superb fantasy film which has a true epic feel beyond the reach of most films today.For the most part,Jackson has followed the book,and harnessed it to what is just simply film-making brilliance. Most of the potential problems have been overcome. To name two examples,the enormous amount of backstory and exposition,and the lengthy amount of dialogue bits when characters explain what is going on. Here,the opening concisely explains where we are and brlliantly sets up everything,while we are constantly SHOWN what is happening rather than hearing people talk of it. This expands the scope of the first third of the story and makes it easier to follow for non-Tolkienites. Of course,some stuff has been cut,with some fans bemoaning the lack of Tom Bombadil,and the loss of other events of the first half of the book,but none of these losses hamper the actual film and speed the pace up. Most of the {really rather unimportant}changes result in an even better film,such as the added action at the end,giving it a climax the book lacked. Another example is the elf kingdom of Lothlorien. In the book it is a beautiful paradise. Here,it is a more sinister,eerie land,which adds some tension to a potential slow part of the film. The only addition which is not too successful is the Aragorn/Arwen love story,which has been pulled out of Tolkien's appendixes and given a bigger role in the story than it probably warrants.However,The Fellowship Of The Ring is not just a fine adaptation of a classic book,it's a stunning film in it's own right. It immerses us completely it's imaginary world. None of the sterile Star Wars or Matrix computer game-type visuallisations here,here everything has an organic look,Middle Earth genuinely looks like a world that has a history and ,for the duration of the film,convinces us. Yes,much of it is done with CGI,but it works because not only it is generally so seamless but because it is at the service of the film's plot and world. The film actually creates several different worlds convincingly and with terrific variety,from the 'Olde English Paradise'of Hobbiton to the bleak,dark kingdom of Mordor,to the beautiful,dreamlike vistas of Rivendell. Of course the action scenes,some of which have been beefed up a little from the book,are fantastic. The opening battle is just incredible,a real 'Wow'moment,the encounters with the Ringwraiths are real edge-of -seat stuff,and the lengthy Moria sequence,which moves from a battle to a crumbling bridge to the encounter with the deadly Balrog,is just action film-making at it's finest,effects,stuntwork,editing,music,every thing at a filmmakers disposal is combined to create one of the best bits of sustained action ever done on film. And rarely have darkness and light both been visuallised so well in a single film. The evil Ringwraiths are particularly well depicted,genuinely frightening. No toning down for a PG here,it's just lucky the film got one.Yet all this would not work so well if Tolkien and Jackson did not give us characters we care about. All the film's main characters are given full,rounded personalities and their own internal or not so internal conflicts,and little scenes which show these. All the cast is perfect,but particular kudos to Elijah Wood's wide-eyed,almost innocent but deep down very tough Frodo-there could not have been a better choice-,Viggo Mortensen's brooding Aragorn and Ian McKellen's warm Gandalf,while no one can portray evil like Christopher Lee. Howard Shore's score plays another essential part in the film,musically underlying everything shown on screen,adept at describing both darkness and light with equal skill and more inventive and appropriate than anything John Williams might have written.The Fellowship Of The Ring is a tremendous achievement,both a great film of a great book and a great film on it's own. The best fantasy film ever made? It's certainly a contender.A note about the Extended Version which was released on DVD. This longer version,which adds around 40 mins to the 3 hours running time of the theatrical version,is even better. The pace is slightly slower but the extra and extended scenes add to a much more satisfying experience. A few missing things from the boo {such as the famous gift-giving scene}are most notable by their addition,but characterisations are deepened,detail is added is every major part of the film,even some of the action scenes contain more. Some subplots,such as one about the elves gradually leaving Middle Earth,{which is almost invisable in the shorter cut},are clearer. This version really makes a great film even better.",Null,0,1,19 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Disappointing conclusion to the trilogy
","The Matrix Revolutions should have been the best of the Matrix films. Sadly,it's a disappointment and probably the weakest. The film is actually hard to watch in parts because of it's awful dialogue. The action is mostly limited to a lengthy battle between the machines and the humans and the final Neo/Agent Smith duel. Both are undoubtedly exciting but there is nothing to match the car chase of Matrix Reloaded.Even more the other two films,the filmmakers seem intent on complicating the plot unnecessarily. Of course there is nothing wrong with complex,twist-filled plots in sci-fi movies,but one gets the feeling even the Warchowski's don't really know what is going on. We deserved,at least at the end,some answers,and few were provided. Even more sadly,I didn't really care. The Warchowski's are so bothered with creating conundrums and clever computer effects that they forget to even give us characters we care about. Unlike say,The Lord Of The Rings,where despite all the spectacle and fantasy you still have characters who have genuine emotions and who you become concerned about. Here,when a lead character dies,we are not moved at all. Keanu Reeves is so wooden that you could make a barn out of him. Monica Bellucci,as usual,is wasted.Not really a bad film,the visuals are,as expected,terrific,but we really deserved more.",Null,0,0,13 November 2003
North by Northwest," Wonderful comedy thriller, not Hitchcock's best but his most sheerly enjoyable
","North By Northwest is not an artistic masterpiece like Rear Window and Vertigo, but it is probably the most purely entertaining picture Hitchcock ever made. It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.Very few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says 'you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?'.Of course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.Ernest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. 'Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio'. Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he's over 50, and of course there's also Bernard Herrmann's vibrant score.Endlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings. How many of today's thrillers will be such fun in 25 years time?",Null,139,192,30 September 2004
Duck You Sucker," Leone's most underrated film,a rich masterpiece which gets better and better with each viewing
","It's generally thought that this film is Leone's weakest major film,and it is far less well known than the Dollars trilogy and the two Once Upon a Times. In actual fact,this is a masterpiece that deserves to be far better known and regarded than it actually is. It sees Leone attempting new things such as character development and political comment,while refining elements from his earlier films. It's really the bridge between Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In America,and it contains a great many elements of both films {which let's face it,despite both being Leone films are quite different}.It starts in humorous vein,right from the opening sequence of the dirty,very poor Rod Steiger character Juan being taunted by some rich folk aboard a lavish carriage,the camera showing lots of close ups of mouths and eyes in what almost seems a parody of Leone's style. Juan is much like Tuco in The Good the Bad And The Ugly,loud,simple and very funny {he's even often accompanied by comical music }.Juan's first encounters with the other main protagonist,IRA man Sean {James Coburn} are treated like comical duels,and as they go to rob a bank it seems the picaresque tone will continue.However,about a third of the way through the film becomes more and more serious. As Juan,thanks to Sean,becomes more and more involved in the Mexican Revolution,the tone becomes darker as more and more scenes take place at night and there is serious tragedy. The change in tone may jar to some people,but one can see the mature,contemplative Leone of Once Upon A Time In America reveal himself before our eyes.Of course there are still some great action scenes,such as the taking of a bank which is superbly cut to Ennio Morricone's music {listen for the cheeky quotes from Mozart!},or Sean and Juan machine-gunning what seems like a whole army. There is as usual a great deal of violence,but it's less personal and graphic and instead is shown to have more consequence. The film's plot does move rather slowly,with Leone taking his time as usual,but this mean we can more enjoy the mannered Steiger and the laid back Coburn as one of the greatest partnerships in cinema history.Of particular interest are the several flashbacks dotted throughout the movie,shot in dreamlike slow motion and usually set to what is quite simply one of the most beautiful film themes EVER {Morricone excels himself with the score for this film}. Representing Sean's past,they ask as many questions as they answer,Leone trusting his audience to work things out. The final one is missing from many versions of this film,a tragedy because as well as being sublimely beautiful {and ambiguous,is it Sean's memory?,a marijuana-enhanced hallucination?,a vision of Heaven?} it adds yet another element to the story.A Fistful Of Dynamite {well,the French Once Upon A Time..The Revolution is the films' best title}is a masterpiece,it's extremely entertaining whilst also being full of complexity. Things become clearer and more interesting on second and third viewings. Don't expect the operatic ritualism of Once Upon in The West or the comic crowd pleasing of the Dollars films,but if you watch this you will be watching a cinematic master at the height of his powers.",Null,121,146,23 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Slightly inferior to Fellowship but still a fantastic fantasy epic
","The Fellowship Of The Ring was an incredible film and an incredible achievement. Peter Jackson and his team got so much right that the tiny flaws seem hardly worthy of mention,and some of these were even ironed out in the Extended Version of the film.The Two Towers manages to be almost,but not quite,as brilliant. Once again we are immersed in a superbly detailed and convincing fantasy world that has great effects and awesome action but also strong characterisation. There are very few scenes that don't use special effects in some way,the film is packed with 'wow'-type spectacle,but we are never allowed to forget about the people at the heart of the story.Another terrific film,than,but sadly several flaws make it just a bit inferior to Fellowship. The film does not flow quite as well,with Jackson never completely solving the problem of cutting back and forth from different stories. Some parts seem overly rushed while other bits are dragged out,for example Merry and Pippin's encounters with the Ents only take up about 7 or 8 mins while the lead up to the Battle of Helm's Deep takes forever.Sadly,Jackson also felt a need to tamper with the source material far more than in Fellowship. This is partly because he leaves out the last few chapters of the book,and therefore has to invent a great deal,may be not a big problem for those who have not read the book,but the story seems very stretched out and some of the added occurrences,such as Aragorn's separation from his companions,and his flashbacks of Arwen,seem like padding and make the middle hour drag a bit too much. Because Frodo and Sam's encounter with Shelob is missing,there was felt a need to invent another climactic story element with Frodo and Sam,but the whole Faramir/Osgilliath subplot feels hurried,as if it was made up on the spot,which it possibly was.However,the elves arrival at Helm's Deep works superbly.Still,there is so much that is great about The Two Towers. It has a commendable different feel to it then Fellowship,somewhat more realistic and a lot more humorous,this does not entirely work but kudos for trying not to give us too much of the same. A few action sequences seem rushed but the middle Warg battle is thrilling and convincing-you mostly believe that the orcs are riding those creatures,and of course the lengthy Battle Of Helm's Deep is stunning,a truly great battle to rank with the best of Kurosawa and Eisenstein. The highlight,though ,is the climatic assault on Isengard by the Ents,an amazing spectacle.The cast is again superb and two potentially problematic characters,Treebeard {and the other walking trees} and the sinister but oddly moving Gollum,are brilliantly achieved. In Gollum we have the most convincing CGI character so far done on film. Howard Shore's score is even better than his work on Fellowship,providing some of the most rousing film music in years but subtle in unusual places {such as Helm's Deep}. There are problems with this film,but all in all,it's still far better than pretty much everything else that came out this year.A NOTE ABOUT THE EXTENDED VERSION As with Fellowship,the extended version is superior. While there are less important scenes added than in Fellowship,the film flows a lot better and is much more evenly paced. Still not as good as Fellowship,but very close.",Null,0,0,30 November 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Not simply the greatest of gangster movies,but one of the greatest movies ever,a multi-layered,melancholic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings
","Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It's nearly four hours long,and demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.Reminiscent at times of some very old gangster films such as The Roaring Twenties,one will find almost every gangster movie cliché one can find-one can imagine Leone half remembering bits and pieces from films he saw as a youth. However,he never glamourises his protagonists-he may dare us to like Robert De Niro's 'Noodles'-a murderous thug and rapist who always seems to make the wrong decisions-but that's different from glamourising him. The notorious rape scene is all the more hard to watch because its painful to watch Noodles try to destroy himself and his girlfriend by going through with it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. Therefore,starting in mid-plot in the 1930s,than flashing back and forth in time,was the right choice {if initially confusing!}. This is the culmination of Leone's increasing interest in the flashback structure-think especially of the parallel story told in A Fistful of Dynamite's flashbacks.There is action,but it's mostly quick and brutal,and there is also humour,such as a very funny scene set to Rossini's Thieving Magpie where the gangsters are loose in a hospital filled with babies. However,the broody,melancholic tone never really goes away,and towards the end,the film grinds to a virtual halt. Be warned,there is no action climax,just a series of somewhat oblique dialogue scenes and revelations.The expected Leone flamboyancy is hardly to be found,but the film still often soars most when dialogue is kept to a minimum and Ennio Morricone's gorgeous music takes over. Some of the most brilliant scenes just consist of Noodles seeing and reflecting. In one especially effective and poignant scene near the end,an old Noodles is leaving his love Deborah as her achingly sad theme plays,and he sees her son,who is the spitting image of,well,I try to avoid spoilers! As the music changes into the still sad but more majestic main theme,the camera slowly zooms,as it often does,into Noodles' sad eyes. We go to what is initially a blur,until we realise it's curtains. The person who holds the key to all this appears,like a ghost,through the curtains and goes onto a balcony,from where he sees the same 'son' with a girlfriend. Sheer brilliance,and not a gun in sight! Of course De Niro is great,but he's obviously very restrained and reflective. It's James Woods who really dominates,so dynamic here,this should have made him a big star. One must also mention Tonni Delli Colli,who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly.Leone's original cut was five hours and if you want to be picky there are holes in the plot. Leone leaves a great many things ambiguous,but shouldn't all great art ask questions? Once Upon A Time In America is not necessarily easy viewing,but it IS great art,the final statement of one of the best filmmakers of all time.",Null,30,55,13 September 2005
Titanic," Despite some glaring faults,Cameron's mixing of romance with real life disaster is still impressive and occasionally brilliant
","It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say 'I'm king of the world' when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",Null,252,407,28 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The best of the trilogy,yes,you read right
","The Matrix remains one of the most overrated films of the 90s. It's good,yes,but not as stunningly original {Dark City,anyone?},nor as thrilling {a gunfight,a helicopter stunt and an unconvincing CGI kung fu fight,and that's it for action}as people made out.The first sequel,which was made back to back with the next film in what is now a trilogy,is in many ways a better film. The action is doubled on both quantity and quality. The several fights are much better staged,especially the humorous one between Neo and lots of Agent Smith's-yes,it's still mainly computer graphics but there is more wire work and actual martial arts skill in evidence. The centrepiece,a lengthy car chase incorporating fighting,is truly amazing. It's so exciting,well staged and thrillingly scored by Don Davis and Juno Reactor,that,for the only time in a Matrix movie you almost forget it's nearly all computer graphics,so gripping is the action. The effects are generally better and several non-action scenes work excellently,such as the much criticised 'rave'scene,which is actually totally appropriate.However,the film still has a few problems. Even more than the first film,several plot points seem to exist solely to complicate matters. The filmmakers were courageous to end the film with a metaphysical discussion rather than another big action scene,but why do the Warchowski brothers think they have to keep pulling the wool over our eyes? It's as if they got stuck in their story and decided to change it.Still,the best of the three. It's not a great sci-fi movie but it's certainly a terrific action film.",Null,0,0,13 November 2003
Man on Fire," Revenge thriller with good build up and great potential...but it might have been nice to be allowed to SEE the revenge
","Man On Fire is a particularly infuriating film because it starts out so well. Admittedly it's basically a pretty unoriginal revenge thriller rather unnecessarily stretched out to two and a half hours. However, for the first hour the film works well. The pace is leisurely but the tension does build up, Denzel Washington makes his clichéd hero-trying-to-drown-his-sorrows-in-drink a reasonably rounded character, and his growing relationship with young Dakota Fanning is well handled, quite affecting while avoiding mawkishness. Eventually she is kidnapped and killed, and, as Washington decided to kick ass big time, one thinks 'yes, this is where the film is going to kick off'. After all, roaring rampages of revenge are always more powerful after a long build up so we care more.Except here we don't. One of the most annoying 'fads' in current cinema is the MTV style, a-cut-every-second style of film-making. Admittedly, there is sometimes nothing more boring than when a camera is just pointed at the actors, but Man On Fire goes to the other extreme and takes it all a stage further, in fact sometimes director Tony Scott seems to decide not to show us what is going on at all. Two potentially strong scenes, a shoot out in a street and Washington torturing a man by cutting off some fingers, are completely ruined by excessive editing and alterations to the film stock whilst others are considerably weakened. Washington wastes villains and often in nasty ways, but we probably see less than 50% of the action. This means that when the end comes, far from being moved, we just don't really care.What a shame. Most aspects of this film are solid if hardly great. Funny how one bad aspect of a film can sometimes be responsible for almost completely ruining it.",Null,0,0,26 October 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The best of all Dracula films
","Bram Stoker's novel has inspired many adaptations over the years, and F.W.Murnau, Tod Browning ,Terence Fisher and Werner Herzog all made especially fine versions {and even the 1979 John Badham version was pretty good}. However, this superb film tops them all, with Francis Ford Coppola really pulling out the stops to create a wonderfully stylized work which seems to reference it's fore bearers while topping them for horror, eroticism and sheer cinematic skill.Despite what some have said this IS the closest cinematic version to the book. Amazing scenes from the novel which have either been absent from previous versions or not done to their full potential are present here, such as Dracula climbing down the wall of his castle, or Dracula giving a baby to his brides to feed on so they spare Harker. A great many other scenes are heightened, for instance the werewolf ravaging Lucy. This was only vaguely suggested in the book, so Coppola and his writer James V. Hart do what every good adapter should do and develop and expand the idea to suit their purpose while still being faithful to the feel and intention of the original. Another example of this approach is the extremely erotic sequence with Harker and Dracula's brides.Of course the 'eternal love' subplot, which seems partially borrowed from some versions of The Mummy, was not in the book at all and does make Dracula a little bit sympathetic, but kudos to the filmmakers for having an emotionally complex Dracula who is not just a bogeyman.More importantly, Bram Stoker's Dracula is just so stunningly CINEMATIC. From the costumes to the sets to the cinematography, it is amazing to look at, while Coppola uses almost every possibly cinematic tool at his disposal to enrich his story. He crosscuts feverishly during some sequences, achieving an operatic grandeur while on other occasions he is more subtle, such as the opening battle, done brilliantly in silhouette. No shot is uninteresting, and one thinks of Coppola constantly trying to find the most interesting way to show something. Wolliech Kilar's score is extraordinary, often building levels of sound to striking effect while still delivering a poignant love theme.Some of the acting is a bit hammy, but that was probably the best way to compete with everything else in the picture. Maybe Christopher Lee and Bel Lugosi were scarier than Gary Oldman, but his performance and characteriation of Dracula is more varied. Anthony Hopkins is simply just having fun as Van Helsing ,while Keanu Reeves, well, as with most things this actor does his performance is often criticised, but he doesn't even TRY to compete with Oldman and Hopkins, and that's just fine, Harker should not be that interesting anyway.This is a stunning piece of cinema, and it's doubtful there'll ever be a better Dracula movie.",Null,1,3,11 October 2004
Casino Royale," Daring experiment for the Bond series which mostly succeeds very well
","I'll admit something first up. I enjoyed the much-criticised Die Another Day, Yes,the Madonna song and CGI were awful,but as a ramped-up,escapist action movie it certainly did the job. However,Casino Royale is a different beast altogether. The opening sequence is is black and white and shows Bond shooting a man,with flashbacks to Bond's first,decidedly messier,killing interspersed. Both the violence and Daniel Craig's intensity are quite shocking. After the eye-popping title sequence,cleverly based around cards,and a perhaps unusual but good title song which does grow on you,we are thrown into quite simply the most stunning action sequence done in years,as Bond chases a man up and down scaffolding,on top of a crane and through an embassy. It's undoubtedly over the top,but really is thrilling,and seeing Bond fall and get hurt a bit is refreshing and helps maintain,just about,believability.It's possible that action wise the film never tops that scene,but the other three action sequences are all excellent and have superb editing that is fast,furious yet still lets you see what is going on,a lesson to some of today's other action directors. It's almost a throwback to the 60s Bond editing,only quicker. There was a sense in the 80s and 90s that maybe the Bond style of action was a little outmoded,it had certainly been imitated to death. Here,Bond becomes leader of the pack again,and the other upstarts need to keep up.Daringly,the two and a half hour running time is not devoted to more action but chiefly two other things. The lengthy poker game IS long but maintains suspense even of you're not sure what the rules are and is broken up every now and again anyway. Then there's Bond falling in love. The World Is Not Enough and The Living Daylights had flirted with genuine romance for Bond but On Her Majesty's Secret Service up to now is the only real Bond love story. The time given to Bond's romance with Vesper Lynd is unusual but it needs the time allowed it to become convincing ,and,eventually,moving. After all,the main thrust of the film is not Bond fighting bad guys,or even playing an important poker game,but Bond becoming Bond,and this is brilliantly conveyed throughout.It is this aspect in which Craig really succeeds. Yes,he is rough and ready at first but that is the film's character. He grows and matures throughout the film,and when he puts on the tux he's earned it and certainly carries it off better than Timothy Dalton,whom Craig is probably closest to. Perhaps the film's villains and girls are not as memorable as one might hope for,but here it's Bond whom you remember,whom the film revolves around,and for this film that's exactly as it should be.Possible Casino Royale might be embraced by die-hard Bond fans more than general action movie goers,what you won't get here is constant action,silly gadgets,corny laughs {though there is humour,and in exactly the right places,such as during the otherwise horrible torture scene}. What you do get is an artistic triumph,a daring experiment that almost completely pays off,that takes us closer to the character of James Bobd than any other film. Roll on the next one,and definitely with Craig....",Null,5,10,16 November 2006
The Matrix," Good,but very overrated and certainly not that original
","The Matrix is one of those films that seems destined to be always overrated. It is indeed a pretty good sci-fi/action movie,but it is by no means the classic many seem to think. Much has been made of the originality of the concept,obviously by people who have not seen the far superior but neglected Dark City,which had the same basic idea but handled it in a less exciting but far more intelligent manner. Other elements are borrowed from Strange Days and Ghost In The Shell,and while it's safe to say that all films borrow from other films a bit,it's bizarre how so many have hailed The Matrix for it's originality. And as for 're-inventing the action movie',all that has resulted is a depressing increase in the amount of CGI fight scenes in movies,and this is not a good thing because they are not convincing and therefore not that exciting {even wire work looks better}.What we have than is an overrated film that still has much to recommend it,it's just NO CLASSIC. The first half hour has a great atmosphere of paranoia and gives us some memorable and sometimes disturbing images,such as machines breeding humans. After this the film slows down,and you wonder when all this amazing action is going to come .Some scenes,such as a visit to an oracle,seem to just exist to pad out and complicate what is a fairly simple story,a flaw which would reach ridiculous proportions in the sequels. The final quarter is sometimes thrilling,such as the gun battle and the justifiably famous helicopter sequence-this is indeed a masterpiece of editing,choreography and computer effects which just this once are pretty convincing. The final martial arts fight though is just like watching a computer game and is awkwardly edited-it's hard to see the great Yuen Woo Ping's {one of the great Hong Kong fight choreographers}hand in this. The ending is ubrupt but was probably already intended to set up a sequel.Performances are generally good,although Keanu Reeves really does take blandness to a new level {well,until the sequels},a shame as he CAN act. The look of the film is also impressive,with the Workowski brothers having a knack for strong and slightly disturbing imagery and creations such as the robotic octopus-like creatures,although the sheer coldness of the visual style would become tiresome in the follow-ups. Music is a well balanced mixture of rock,dance and Don Davis's brooding score,and does sometimes {as in the use of Propellerheads during the gunfight}get the adrenalin going.The Matrix is certainly not rubbish,but best sci-fi or action film of the 90s?PAH!!!",Null,1,2,13 November 2003
Sin City," Sort of a 10 year old boys version of film noir,tedious and annoying,if undoubtedly a technical and visual triumph
","Sin City has been called the closest a film has come to a comic book,and therein lies the problem. The two Spiderman films and Hellboy were fairly close to their sources,but they also never forgot that they were also FILMS,and that a great many people watching them will have never even looked at a comic book. As well as great action and effects they contained things like character development and at least reasonable plotting. Sin City,on the other had,just has a bunch of killers killing lots of people and falling for prostitutes. That's it. Hardly anything else. It's an extremely faithful adaptation, but it's not a good film.The film's three stories are all set in what is like a 1940s film noir on acid. Therefore you have your tarnished heroes and your femme fatales,plus lots of hardboiled narration. These elements are blown up into almost surreal proportions. However,Sin City seems to forget that those old movies also had usually intricate plots and protagonists whose predicaments one could relate to on a basic level. The stories told in this film are all pretty much the same,involving a thuggish hero being involved with a woman,almost being killed and taking a bloody revenge. Surely the filmmakers could have chosen stories with more variety? As for the heroes or rather anti-heroes,we are never allowed to identify with or even care about them. Bruce Willis,Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen all look good,but we could be watching the Incredible Hulk in his Hulk form for all we care.There's a monotony about the film. All the women are scantily clad and either hookers and strippers,how on earth can the female cast have found much reward in their roles? There is an incredible amount of brutality in the film, maybe the censors were kind because the film is mostly in black and white and some of the nastiest stuff is so stylized as to become almost abstract. There is definitely a place for extreme violence in films and it can be used well in many ways-for realism,for irony,to make a point,etc. I don't also believe that there is anything necessarily wrong with using violence just to shock. However,the constant bone crouching,head lopping,blood spurting action in Sin City just becomes tedious. In the first story,Mickey Rourke kills so many people that one almost feels like laughing,except that isn't particularly funny.From a purely technical point of view Sin City is a triumph,and shows how CGI can be used very creatively indeed. The world of the film soon becomes a bore,but sometimes the CGI scapes approach the beautiful,beautiful not being a word I would normally use in relation to CGI. Sometimes they are very simple,such as the prison cell existing completely in a black void of nothing. Restraint is also shown in the use of colour. Sin City is mainly in black {and the black is often very black indeed} but sometimes a bit of colour appears briefly,often for the blood,but sometimes for more artistic purposes,such as a car journey where the inside of the car is subtly bathed in blue,green and other changing colours.I don't like being hard on a film which was obviously made with no compromise. Too many potentially good films are weakened by studio interference,loss of courage by the director,pandering to a lower rating,etc. Director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller {who wrote the original comic books} had a vision and refused to waver from it for a moment. They deserve some credit. Unfortunately it seems they forgot the audience.",Null,1,3,6 June 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," very good,but basically a remake of Raiders
","The third of the Indiana Jones films is a terrific action adventure. However,it is the least interesting of the three. Spielberg and Lucas obviously took to heart criticisms of Temple Of Doom,and decided to return to the format of Raiders. In fact,more than that,it's basically a remake.Once again there is a search for a holy artifact,once again there are evil Nazis also after it,once again the climax is not an action scene {well,there is an unimpressive earthquake} but an act of the supernatural,Indy has two of the same allies,etc,etc,etc. All this makes the film a little tired. You know where the story is going to go,and so the freshness of the first two films is missing.Still,it's a terrific fun romp,and there are several compensations. The most notable is of course Sean Connery as Indy's Dad,with his relationship with Indy being both touching and funny. The film as a whole probably contains more laughs then the others,and even more action,some of which,such as a boat chase in Venice,have more than a touch of Bond about them. The highlights here are a thrilling tank chase which almost outdoes the truck chase of Raiders,a motorcycle chase and a plane chase which has a great and amusing payoff. One cannot of course fail to mention the opening setpiece with River Phoenix as a young Indy which shows how he obtained things such as his whip,scar and fear of snakes. The sequence set amidst the caverns and lethal traps near where the Grail is also works very well and is extremely successful. However the religious elements somewhat fall flat and it's a pity the end is just a rehash of that of She.Alison Doody is an interesting love {or rather lust}interest and Harrison Ford is again excellent as Indy although he has lost some of the edge to his previous performances in the role. The film somewhat lacks a strong villain. All in all,still great entertainment despite it's flaws.",Null,0,1,1 November 2003
