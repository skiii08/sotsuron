The Blair Witch Project," Terrifying from beginning to end
","This movie is said to be ficticious, but believe me you'll wonder for the rest of your life if that's actually a true statement. The movie's official website tells you much more than the movie about the history of the Blair Witch. Did she really exist? I guess no one will really know. The only thing I can really say about seeing this movie is that I have never before sat in a nicely air conditioned movie theatre with my hands sweating profusely until now.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
Carrie," If more Stephen King films were made this way, the world would be a better place
","It's hard to figure out who's more disturbing in this movie. Carrie or her mother. If there was ever a doorway to Hell, it would begin with the front door to Carrie White's house. The one thing this movie taught me about horror movies is to never assume a movie is over until you see the actual credits scrolling across the screen. Also worth the watch for a Vinny Barbarino era John Travolta performance. Probably one of the top five King movies ever made.",Null,0,0,21 August 1999
The Deer Hunter," De Niro should have won best actor for this before Raging Bull
","This is the absolute best De Niro movie ever. And that's hard for me to say being the De Niro fanatic that I am. I have seen every movie ever made by this incredible actor and although many of his performances are wonderful, this is the one that can still bring me to tears every time I watch it. Just try to find a more powerful scene in any movie than the game of russian roulette that these helpless men have to play in that nasty Vietnam War. All in all, Mr. De Niro has never disappointed me, but I would be very surprised if he ever has a better movie than this.",10,0,0,6 August 1999
