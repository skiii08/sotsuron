The Blair Witch Project," Creepy but not as scary as a big rubber shark
","As you may have guessed from my one line summary, Jaws scared me more than this. I find this an interesting comparison because much of the scares in both movies comes from never seeing the shark/witch/whatever. However, in Jaws this was scary, whereas here there's just not enough clarification. NO, I DON'T WANT THE WITCH TO MORPH FROM A TREE DRIPPING BLOOD AND ALL DONE UP LIKE LINDA BLAIR IN THE EXORCIST, BUT I would like to know just what the heck it was. About the best clarification in the movie as to this is 'No redneck would think of this' or something. Yay. Early on, we get a description of the Witch that very much matches the ending, BUT I decided to disregard this because all the other interviews at the start suggested something totally different and really seemed more funny than scary, apparently intentionally. Indeed, we all know from ads and hype that there are many Scary Weird Noises In The Night sequences, but only late in the movie do these sections become scary. Why? Because the early ones are at the longest a minute, and in daylight there just isn't anything quite strange enough to scare you. And believe me, there's a LOT of daytime in this movie. And 95% of it is them arguing, usually two characters screaming at each other 'f--- this' and the other countering 'f--- that,' culminating in 'f--- you' while the third party member screams 'shut the f--- up.' At one point, when one character turns really cruel, not violent, but mean, the confrontation is fairly tense, but really more at home in a soap. The end, yes, it's quite creepy. No, not the final shot. Just the last few minutes. Not everyone will agree--as the movie ended, the entire audience sat silently--for three seconds. Then some brave and obnoxious souls offered 'You've gotta be kidding me,' and, more to the point, 'That sucked' and 'Boooooo...' Is it worth seeing? Well, yeah, if only out of curiosity. It's still a pretty good movie. But Scary as Hell(TM)? No.",Null,1,2,26 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 9/10 movie, but just not Star Wars
","Overall, this was a dazzling film. The special effects were great, the creatures were interesting, the costumes were insanely over-the-top, and the battles were fantastic. The story was good enough, and did indeed tie in to the other episodes. But that old Star Wars feel is gone. Instead of following the pattern set by the first three, George Lucas has made a movie incorporating every single trend in Hollywood right now. There's Jar Jar Binks, who I'm sure you've heard about by now, the unbelievably annoying 'Gungan' who spouts phrases such as 'How rude!' and 'I-sa wants to help-sa you-sa' in an horrifyingly screechy Caribbean accent. He's obviously aimed at the little kids in the audience, but it was extremely rare to hear anyone laugh. Often, Jar Jar would be away for a scene or two, and the movie would become more engrossing, easier to take. But, without fail, after a few minutes, the floppy-eared, scaly, bug-eyed weirdo would show up on the screen again and rattle off a few jokes, then step in animal excrement or somesuch 'hilarious' gag. Sigh. And the absence of a Han Solo-style character to put a damper on the heroics of the main few is unfortunate. Although it's easy to be taken in to the film, the spotty, inconsistent dialogue ('Are you an angel?') often messes up otherwise dramatic moments. Also, the movie is devoid of suspense, thanks to those other three movies, whatever they were called. As for the romantic subplot between 10-year-old Jake Lloyd's character and nearly-18-year-old Natalie Portman's, the future parents of Luke and Leia, all I can say is... ehhhhh. And although containing some familiar characters, this one is SO different from the original trilogy, words fail me. It's just not the same. The scale is several thousand times larger, the story is heavier, despite all the 'comic' relief, and the same tight focus, no more. And, well, that leads me to the most surprising point about this movie. Even with all of these flaws, it's great, and as far as visuals go, well, anything is possible now. It's engrossing, moving, and well-acted for the most part. I would definitely recommend that you see it again. It's another testament to George Lucas's genius that he could make such a great movie even with so many flaws. To put it on the level with the classic trilogy, many changes would have to be made, but it holds its own as a movie, and is far better than most fare these days. Thanks, Mr. Lucas, but for Episode 2 and 3, let's gorily kill off Jar Jar and try to focus, OK?",9,0,0,22 May 1999
