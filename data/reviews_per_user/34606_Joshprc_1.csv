Blade Runner 2049," A perfect sequel and sci-fi film all in one
","I'm not going to say much about this film, as I'm still processing, but what I will definitively say, and what would be in a completely fleshed out thought-process- breakdown is that having seen and loved the original '82 film, BR 2049 was one of the most visceral, endearing experiences I have had in the theater. Amazing movie.",10,4,11,11 October 2017
