Alien 3," I don't get other peoples opinions
","I must have a funny brain.  I thought that Alien was excellent.  The idea of the Alien being was introduced here and so in my opinion this one is the best of the trilogy and always will be.  Now this in itself is probably not too far from other peoples opinions but where mine differ completely is in that I thought Aliens was pretty bad.  It completely destroyed the idea of the Alien.  In the first film the Alien killed an entire crew without any trouble and Ripley was only able to kill it through a huge bit of luck.  Now in the second there's Aliens dying all over the place.  I just sat watching thinking 'What the hell is going on?'  There's acid blood spraying everywhere, there's Hicks unloading his shotgun in that Aliens mouth and toward the end it just gets ridiculous with Ripley going into a big hive full of thousands of them and not even being attacked until she finds the queen.  I don't care about these marines advanced weapons or training.  Its like the aliens have suddenly become stupid insects which are nothing like the alien in Alien.  So in Aliens I found disappointment and when I arrived at Alien 3 I wasn't expecting much but what I got was far closer to the goodness of the first film than Aliens.  Once again the Alien is returned to the powerful monster it was designed to be.  I really cant see one truly bad thing in this film.  The acting is excellent, each scene is excellently shot and that music really does stir.  How can anyone not love this film? I even know a few people who hate it.",Null,1,5,1 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best Star Wars film yet.
","I know the Ewoks are too cute and cuddly, i know it isnt quite as consistent as The Empire Strikes Back, i know that at times its unrealistic but of the three its the only one i can still watch and not find slightly boring at times.  In the enhanced versions at the cinema this was the only one i could sit through without the slight feeling of dissatisfaction.  Its a couple of key scenes in the film which make it so great.  The Jabbas palace bit at the start of the film and the Throne room scenes at the end.  Its seeing the end result of how Luke has changed across the two previous films which i love; from a farm boy to the powerful warrior.  I don't think there's any call for another three sequels when Return of the Jedi finished it all with such a dramatic ending.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
The Matrix," Most critics didnt get it.
","An excellent film.  Great acting, special effects and fight scenes combined to make one of the most original Hollywood films for quite some time.  In my opinion the plot is intricate but not overly so.  You've got to concentrate in this film or it'll go over your head as i think it did some critics.",10,0,0,13 June 1999
