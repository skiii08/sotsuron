The Monuments Men," Good for reasons other than drama and plot
","I love history. Not the most dramatic of all films, but very important in its subject matter and in what it teaches us about the history of that time.The United States, despite the cost of WWII, returned the Art and made things right at it's own cost, never asking for reparations. We, the USA, spilled our own blood to save life and history and art. We did it without asking for anything in return. We simply did the right thing.For those who see America as the focus of evil in the modern world, you can all rot in you know where for your support of abject Evil, because siding with those who are against the good is to side with evil.And as for France. We saved you and your children and your children's children, and you couldn't let us fly over your country to bomb Libya in the 80's because you're a fearful bunch. I haven't forgotten and you all might as well change your flag to an all white flag because you are the most pathetic bunch of 'surrender first ask questions later' people who deserve what is coming. Just pray the USA comes back from it's current state so it can again be your savior...because without us, what else do you have to place your hope?Marvin",10,1,2,10 July 2014
