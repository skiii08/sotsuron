Miracle," Great job, Kurt et al
","Kurt Russell does a wonderful job of portraying Herb Brooks, an innovative hockey coach, and a hard-driving motivator of the young American team that competed at, and won, the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic hockey championship. Indeed, everyone is great, including the hockey players who learned to act to portray the famous group of college amateur players that Brooks pulled together to form a tight-knit and well-conditioned squad.Camera work and re-creation of key plays is amazing -- maybe the best hockey footage ever shot (see the DVD special features). Also touching is the collage of tragic events involving the USA in the 60's and 70's, leading up to the Olympics. By the way: I found the (voiceover) speech we hear from 1980 by Jimmy Carter ('The USA has a crisis of confidence..') as moving as MLK's famous 'I have a dream' speech. It sets the stage nicely for the events that follow - we all need a dream from time to time, or maybe a Miracle.And you don't feel sorry for the Russians, this the last vestige of an arrogant cold-war-produced hockey machine: seasoned veterans laying out college kids with nasty body-checks, or slashes (just in case you thought us Canucks had the patent rights to tough hockey). Good news, though: the USA was up to it, repaying hefty checks in spades.Finally, there is is some insight into Brooks hockey ideas, years ahead of their time: carefully-rehearsed breakout plays, circle patterns of player movement, and short 40-50 second shifts to keep players fresh.There is a nice up-to-dater on where the players were in 2006 when the film was made, but the NHL careers were overlooked - several of these guys went on to have stellar careers in professional hockey. The talent level was substantial.Anyway-- good job all around.",9,6,6,16 June 2011
Skyfall," Great Roller Coaster ride...
","** minor spoilers ** We enjoyed this 007 action flick.. the opening chase sequence was quite stunning. And chases continue unabated. We finally meet our super-villain, Mallory, played by Javier Bardem. I gather he was a former MI6 station chief, who was jumped by the opps and 'interrogated', resulting in deep physical and emotional pain and a burning desire to get even with the 'M' character, Head of MI6 (and Bond's boss). Mallory feels she betrayed him (not sure if that's what really happened, but Mallory has strong opinions on the matter). Mallory also has an island with a super-network of PC's and enough programming & hacking skills to set up a wave of explosions and mayhem to shake MI6 to its very foundations. Bardem is excellent, especially during his scenes with Daniel Craig (James Bond). I don't think I can give away any plot points or real spoilers - what I have related so far drives the action, but this is NOT a plot-driven Bond flick. So, buckle up and enjoy.",8,2,9,24 November 2012
Madagascar," Madagascar - a great ride!
","Lots of fun - I saw it with the grandkids and a theater full of families. a great time was had by all. technically speaking, one might say that the story was 'uneven' in places (can you say *that* about animated films? (-:) -- I mention this because there has been some needlessly negative feedback here at IMDb. On the whole, though, the presentation is quick-paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. There are also some unique, quirky scenes (i.e. animals nonchalantly getting on a subway?) - I love to see stuff I haven't seen before. that's not easy to do, you know - by all accounts, 'everything has been done on film already..' - (if you catch my drift). so, give credit when due! enjoy!(-:",8,125,185,29 May 2005
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman 2, Tobey missed, too!
","I read the IMDb lead (cheery!) report of the 'unemployed critic' - I must respectfully disagree. My son warned me that Parker comes off as a whiny brat in this one, and that the film just drags on and on. That's what I found, too. I don't think a great trilogy is in the making -- I think I've had my fill of the follies and perils of our webbed friend.I don't blame Tobey-- I think the screenplay just asked that he gripe too much - and lose too often! I know the character is supposed to be 'complicated' and 'tragic', but why not save a little for Episode 3 and 'cut to the chase?' sooner? I could have used a lot more of the evil Doc. (by the way: if Tobey was ever 'born' to play a character, it's Bix Beiderbecke, the jazz cornetist. do 'tragic' there, Tobey and do 'action hero' in Spiderman (--: ) Now, there are some great FX's in this one, and some clever scenes. But pacing is everything. You don't need 1/2 dozen 'longish' scenes with the same conversation to establish Spiderman's troubles. We get it - OK? Add to that, the innumerable endings! ouch! ever hear of 'anti-climactic?' Maybe I'll take a beating on this one, but I feel the basic problem is editing. When you watch 'deleted' scenes on DVD's, the directors moan about great scenes they had to cut to move the story along. Those 'deleted' scenes are still in this one - and they're not great.Swing and a miss. maybe next time. (--:",5,0,1,9 September 2005
Alexander," Nice cinematography - problem screenplay
","I appreciate the passion in the review of 'gest1969'. I've felt the same way about certain 'problem' movies. Yes, Stone's cinematography was spectacular.. and there's a lot of historical ground to cover. But the script just wasn't right. It's an old problem with movies of all sorts, but, surprisingly, all too common with big budget productions.There have been documentaries with or without re-creations recently (i.e. the History Channel production 'The True Story of Alexander the Great', and a fantastic British re-telling: 'In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great', both of which I recommend.) So, what went wrong?Stone's screenplay continually 'regresses' - the flashbacks are too numerous and lengthy. Maybe it was more of an 'editing' problem (the Director's cut DVD had no 'deleted' scenes) than a script issue? When you watch the 'deleted' portions in a typical DVD, you see some not-so-bad scenes that were, nevertheless, chopped, for the sake of pace or continuity. What did Stone cut from this one? Jolie and Kilmer are big names, but their roles in this flick were of a 'supportive' nature. yet, we continually re-visit them for repetitious information of limited value. Farrell (Alexander) looked confused. It became tedious. I had my hand of the FF button throughout the 2nd half. Anytime after his entry into Babylon, I was ready to pack it in. (well, I stuck around for the battle sequence against elephants.. decided that life as a Greek soldier wouldn't have suited me).For those who still disagree, try watching the other 'Alexander' productions (there's a ton of 'Alex' movies made in Asia, if you can get your hands on them, and at least one older Hollywood - 1960's?).Finally, there is 'gory' stuff (well, what do you expect in a battle for the world?) and some needless sexual content... not for kiddies.",6,1,1,23 August 2005
The Aviator," Avaitor flies..!
","Stunning cinematography! The DVD also contains great inside info on the making of the film and the 'Hughes' character himself (i.e. interviews about his 'OCD' - obsessive-compulsive disorder). I've seen other films about Hughes, but nothing that offered this kind of insight. L DiCapprio and Martin Scorsese worked hard on this project. The casting and character-portrayal are flawless. AND...... (I'm not sure that there has been much comment on this): the soundtrack is well-choreographed to highlight the sounds of the emerging 'swing' era and the mood of the unfolding action (Artie Shaw's theme 'Nightmare' was a great choice to underscore Hughes' periods of great angst).

The Color of Money," Great performances by Newman & Cruise.. but a bit 'uneven'
","If the performances were so great, why only rate it a 7 out of 10? To begin with, I watched this with my kids back in the 80's and we got hooked on 9-ball right away--we would play in this garage, and I would dominate until one of my younger kids dropped the 9-ball by accident, ending my streak. So, the film has sentimental value to me.In the clear light of day, however, I re-watched it recently, and recalled what annoyed me the first time: Newman's reactions to Vince seem inconsistent and inexplicable. When Vince (Cruise) does what Newman (Eddie) tells him to do, Eddie is angry - when Vince does the opposite, Eddie gets mad (once, even driving off and leaving him). I didn't get it.We are supposed to view Eddie as the mentor here, but, frequently, the roles reverse. For example, when Eddie decides to play a competitive game against a stranger (a young Forest Whittaker), he finds he is the victim of a clever con-artist -- he throws a hissy-fit, but Vince's reaction is the correct one: 'Forget it - we'll get this guy next time.' Eddie won't listen. Who is the impetuous proteg√© now?There are some great pool sequences, however, and a glorious scene where Vince - armed with a totebox containing a world-class cue - encounters the Hall #1 player, who asks: 'What have you got there?' 'Doom', replies Vince with a big smile. Wish I had the game to say that.So, if you can tolerate characters that react unevenly to situations, and aren't always likable, you might enjoy this unique film featuring Paul Newman's only Oscar-winning role (he shoulda won for Cool Hand Luke).",7,1,2,12 December 2013
The Dirty Dozen," Solid Actioneer holds up well...
","The Blu-Ray edition just arrived from Amazon (good price - so shop around) - sharp picture, great sound, and decent extras. The acting and storyline hold up after 45 years. What struck me at once was:1. the number of camera angles--some very imaginative. making real movies was hard work: all that effort for a few seconds of frame.2. the fabulous characterizations by a great ensemble cast. in 1967, there were still such a thing as supporting actors, and character actors (it wasn't just about, for instance, Angeline Joliffe, her boyfriend, and lots of CGI).3. the dialogue is crackling.Funny - I've considered myself a sharp movie watcher for decades, but I missed the above before. Maybe watching Hollywood 'blockbusters' made in the past 20 years has sharpened my appreciation for great art in cinematography? Closest thing I've seen recently in ensemble acting with comparable dialogue would be 'Oceans-11'. Other than that, when was the last time you saw more than 10 very distinct characters portrayed on the screen, long enough that you could form a real liking, or distaste for all of them?",9,0,2,13 June 2011
Gone with the Wind," In retrospect, maybe the best ever...
","Aug-2019... Time for a late-breaking review from the kid who took a pretty cheerleader to see the first restored GWTW in 1970. I bought the LP Soundtrak with all new simulated stereo sound (wish I still had it-worth a fortune to a collector). Yes, maybe GWTW is the greatest film ever made, esp. now that a wonderful digitally restored version is available on DVD (there is a bluray also, but the DVD is superb).Surprise! I bought the DVD Scarlett at the same time & watched it first. Pretty good story. The 'back' story of the casting & production of GWTW is the stuff of legends & documentaries. Here's my belated summary:1) Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable performed magnificently. It was a crime that Gable was overlooked for an Oscar. Both actors were also very attractive in their roles.2) The photography is stunning-'spared no expense', indeed.3) I love the first half, but the sequence of tragedies that steadily unfolds in Part 2 always turned me off a bit. We are watching a tragedy rushing to it's conclusion. As my wise older brother once explained it to me: At the end, after Melanie passes away, Scarlett comes sobbing out of that room, and 2 men are waiting-Rhett and Ashley. If she runs to Rhett (which she should), we have a happy ending, and a melodrama. But if she runs to Ashley for comfort, Rhett is done with her-forever. A Greek tragedy. Rhett will survive. Scarlett is a tough cookie, who always believes she can get to tomorrow, and 'tomorrow is another day'. Sadly for Scarlett, her tomorrow, as far as a future with Rhett, had passed. Like the hapless Great Gatsby chasing Daisy, 'it was already past him'.. past HER, in this case.Anyway, despite the falling action that gets you to the finale, you will really love this new presentation in digital format.",9,2,3,22 August 2019
2012," 2012 (minutes, maybe?)
","Yes, it's a tad long - but it isn't really 2012 minutes - it just seems like it. John Cusack still gives an excellent performance as a family man trying to rescue his estranged loved ones (excluding the dork who has taken up with his wife) from a coming world cataclysmic event. The problem with these FX is that they go over the top: same as Twister, or the conclusion of Armageddon, where debris and rocks are swirling over the heads of our heroes, or smashing into their equipment but they escape--equipment intact--without a scratch. We can only suspend our belief so much. Here, in the early going, Cusack drives a car through a decaying city, miraculously evading destruction while buses, trucks, and buildings are crushed like paper dolls. (Give me a break).The other problem is that these 'modern' directors/screenplay writers have forgotten the basic tenets of cinematography: 1) a scene must develop character or advance the plot, or you discard it (invented by Disney) 2) preferably, do both at once. In 2012, the action stops with resounding CLUNK while we stop to discuss Cusack's marital problems or his relationship with his kids. HEY DIRECTOR: WE ALREADY KNOW THE WIFE GAVE UP ON HIM TOO QUICKLY, HER NEW BOYFRIEND'S A DORK, AND THAT CUSACK LOVES HIS FAMILY - HE IS RISKING HIS LIFE TO SAVE THEM ALL. so, shaddup and get on with the story, will ya? I wouldn't pay to see this film. If you can catch it on TV, and fast-forward the commercials, give it a try - once should be plenty.",5,1,2,19 August 2013
Titanic," Cameron Delivers..!
","For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to 'My Heart Will Go On' (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.For one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in 'steerage' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There's the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the 'new world' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.The sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).This film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping 'Citizen Kane', 'Amadeus' or Sir David Lean's entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the 'mix' and 'editing', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay 'missed' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.Having said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven't seen that before, very unique and effective.9/10 - canuckteach (--:",9,3,5,2 March 2008
