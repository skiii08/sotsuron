The Blair Witch Project," A terror in your own head...
","The Blair Witch Project is the most unique approach to horror that I have ever seen.  This is the first time I have actually felt the real emotion in a horror flick.  And though the film itself is creepy beyond creepy, the most unsettling thing about it is that I found myself incapable of turning my bedroom light off that night.  And I DO mean incapable.  The film plants unpleasant seeds in your imagination.  And therefore the audience brings the horror home with them. The shaky camera handling and home video feel of the film convinces us that we are seeing something real, something that perhaps we are not supposed to see.  Such an effect can only result in tension and suspense, making for an interesting reaction when things finally go bump in the night. An incredibly imaginative and clever film, The Blair Witch Project is a definite must-see for anyone immune to motion-sickness.",8,0,1,6 August 1999
