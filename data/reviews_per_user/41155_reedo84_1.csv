The Avengers," My review for one of the best movies of 2012: The Avengers
","The Avengers(2012) was an awesome movie, saw it in theaters with my dad and my brother, all of us loved the movie I liked the post-end credits scene with Thanos, I hope he will be the villain for The Avengers 2 coming in 2015, It is my top 3 movies of 2012, It is one of my favorite movies, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was awesome 10/10 on him, Mark Ruffalo was a very good Bruce Banner/Hulk but Norton was better, I'll give Mark Ruffalo a 9/10 on his 1st role as The Big Mean Green Guy, I like the part when Hulk just beats the crap out of Loki when Loki kept on saying stuff and then Hulk says after he's done beating him up'Puny God'. It was one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 it was just awesome if you haven't seen it then rent it or buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray, Just see it it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,2,5,21 June 2013
