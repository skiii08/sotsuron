The Blair Witch Project," This movie sure scared me!
","This movie is definetly one of those movies that people either loved, or hated.  There is no in-between with this movie.  I loved this movie.  I thought that it was so creepy scary!  What made it so creepy was the fact that we don't know what exactly was hunting the three filmmakers.  I think the fear of the unknown is more scarier than any digital monster or made up guy with a hockey mask...(although, I was scared by Halloween as well).  My brother and my Boyfriend both did not enjoy this movie.  They thought it was boring and unrealistic.  I can see their point as well.  When I put myself in their place, I know that I would not be filming anything.  I would have left all the camera gear and followed the river out.  It makes no sense at all.  But movies aren't always supposed to make sense.  Movies are merely meant for entertainment purposes only.  Also, concerning the motion with the camera's, I am the type that gets motion sickness extremely bad.  I can't even ride on a kid's swing with out wanting to throw up.  But, I didn't find the camera movement bad enough that I felt sick.  I loved the movie!  If I were to find one bad fault with this movie (besides the students' stupidity) I would say that I hated the girl in the movie.  She had a really annoying voice.Go see the movie!  ****/**** stars!",10,1,2,16 September 1999
American Pie," This is a FUNNY movie!
","When I went to the theatre with my boyfriend to see this movie, we both got carded!  I couldn't believe it..her we are 22 & 25 respectively, and we are getting carded for a movie...this one must be really raunchy I thought. I was right! For anyone who liked 'Something About Mary', you will definitely like this one.  It had me laughing so much, I almost fell off my seat...literally!  There is one scene in particular that had me gagging and trying not to throw-up, both from laughing and from the grossness of the scene. There is not much more to say than GO SEE THIS MOVIE with out giving out the details of the movie.  You won't be disappointed!",Null,1,1,11 August 1999
