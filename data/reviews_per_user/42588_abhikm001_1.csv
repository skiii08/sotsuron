Skyfall," W O_o W !!!
","So ... here goes the much awaited SKYFALL The stakes were sky high, so where the fear that it wont be able to please the audience who were expecting the ultimate blast as in 'Bond's 50th year' style. Well, good news ... Mr.Craig n party didn't disappoint.Starting from the signature style 'all guns blazing' intro action sequence to the dramatic OMG moments in classic 007 movies ... you can see it all.So we talked about the hero, and here comes the baddie ... honestly he is the highlight of the movie (for me). After 'The Dark Knight's Joker', I didn't got 'WO_oW'ed on a performance by a Hollywood villain ! Don't wanna spoil it ... see for yourselves.Heard many people complaining 'Dude, we expected GORE !!! WTF is this ?' *Bitch Please* if you wanna see ALL BLOOD GORE, then go for Rocky Balbova :| 007 is all about class sophistication and style ! So beat it :P This one is emphasizes more on the relation between 'M' & her loyal commander 007.There is no shortage of fire works, blasts n booms ... only thing, 'you gotta wait for it' :PThe plot may seem sluggish if you neglect the dialogues in the first half, I find them fascinating as always. Once the story sets pedal on the accelerator, the action explodes ! (literally) :PSo my take on 'James Bond - Skyfall' - A very nice Bond movie, a sure shot entertainer and a must watch to all Bond fans ! ----- > 7.5 / 10 (It ain't as gud as Casino Royale but never the less far better than many of the previous films made on 007)",8,1,10,11 November 2012
