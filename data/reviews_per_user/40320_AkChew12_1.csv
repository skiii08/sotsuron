Ali," This movie moves so fast I get sick, bad movie
","Oh, this movie is hideous. Okay, I'm 15 years old, and I personally don't know much about Muhammad Ali, other then he was a great boxer, he's a legend, etc.. Maybe that's why I didn't like this film, I'm not sure; but what I do know, is that for most of the film I wasn't sure in what direction it was going- in a bad way.The film seems to want to show me what Ali did in his life, his accomplishments, his falls, the interesting stories that surrounded him and the people around him, but unfortunately mostly all I get to see is WHO he did in his life, and THAT isn't even portrayed well. This film blasts through major events, important conversations, and pivotal moments so quickly I can barely understand what's going on. I understand it would have helped if I knew a bit about the man himself before I saw the movie, but the day I start studying to go see a movie isn't anytime soon.The whole movie I felt like I had missed something important, but I didn't, it just goes so fast it seems that way. If there is any savor in this entire film it's Will Smith's performance, which was in fact worth mentioning, I feel bad it couldn't have been used better.",4,0,0,25 January 2002
