The Ring," I'll have to see it again, I think
","I really like movies like this but I think I'll have to view it one more time before it goes back to the video store just to make sure I didn't miss something. The boy who played Adan was really good. His face is really expressive, especially the eyes. I like the movies where there's a lot to figure out and there's only so much time to do it. I also like how you think it's over and all is well but, .......",Null,0,1,5 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Little Hoakie but I liked it
","Aside from it having Johnny Depp (I'd see anything with him in it) I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think it was meant to be a deep thinkers movie just good entertainment and that's what you got. Orlando Bloom was boyishly handsome and charming and the perfect gentleman and Depp was funny, not moody like a lot of his characters are so that was a nice change. Even Jeffry Rush was light hearted and dark all rolled into one. I loved the special effects of the skeleton pirates, they were so errie looking but they even played humor into that in several scenes. Over all, I really enjoyed it.",Null,0,0,17 July 2003
The Others," Much better than I expected
","I never could manage to get to the theater and see this movie when it was out so when it hit the video stores this week I was all over it. I had heard great things about this movie and I wanted to see it for myself. Let me start with I am NOT a Nicole Kidman fan but I thought she was great in this movie! Unfortunately, I had to watch this movie in pieces because I started it so late in the evening but this turned out to be a good thing. I watched about 45 minutes the first night and I hadn't quite put it all together yet and just knew there was something coming to do just that and I was right. This was reminscent of The Sixth Sense when things start to all fall into place and you say to yourself 'I should have known that.' It's shot in very low light so it's very dramatic throughout. The other thing I really liked about this movie was that there was really only 6 main characters so you could really focus on what's happening without all the distractions of a lot of extras milling about to fill up space. If you liked The Sixth Sense, you'll like this one too.",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
Troy," so many beautiful men ...............
","I saw Troy today and I don't think I have ever seen so many beautiful men in one movie in my whole life. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, all of them beautiful, yet so macho (well maybe Orlando wasn't so macho). Who cares if they spend the entire movie in skirts they looked fabulous??? The bloody battles were just as I would have pictured them to be. The honor between kings or leaders and the men who laid their life down for them was awe inspiring. The sets were amazing, the interspursed stories between battle scenes were touching. All in all I really enjoyed it. I love these epic movies! I saw a few faces that I hadn't seen in a while, Nigel Terry (who I will always remember as King Arthur in 'Excalibur) There was also Peter O'Toole (who could forget those beautiful blue eyes of his), and Julie Christy. If you're going to see this movie, please see it in the theater, that's the way it was meant to be seen (then you can rent or buy it on DVD and watch it at home).",Null,0,2,18 June 2004
Twilight," Not as good as I hoped ....
","Well, all the people I talked to it was 50-50 on how they felt about this movie. I decided to go check it out before it left the theaters and well me and 4 other strangers (along with 2 children under the age of 2) watched a movie that could have been so much better. I was disappointed I really expected more after hearing all the hype. It was very slow, and there was a lot of holding back (I guess due to the rating?). The girl who played Bella was BORING. The guy who played Edward was over the top, you know, over acting. The guy who played Jasper, what was he doing, was he channeling Edward Scissorhands, come on. I guess since this was really meant for younger viewers the whole thing was really tame so in that sense it was okay. I guess I'm just so used to seeing no holds barred in any movie or TV these days I'm getting a bit callus about sweet and innocent. I read the 4 book series and liked all but the last one so I'll give the next movie a chance as well. Parents there is nothing to worry about in letting your teenagers see this movie. Things I really liked was the scenery and the copper looking contacts the vamps wore when they were newly fed other than that, I got nothing.",4,1,4,11 February 2009
Mulholland Drive," Did I miss something???
","Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention or maybe there was just too much silence going on in this movie but whatever the reason ..... I didn't get it. Normally I like movies with more than one story going on but this was more than that. It was, to me anyway, the same story over and over with the characters changing names but using the same characters (I know that doesn't make sense but if you see it you'll know what I mean). I'm not sure about any part of this movie, what it's about, what the point was or if it even had one. I can safely say that I have NEVER seen anything like it (I don't know if that's good or bad).",Null,0,0,25 April 2002
The Last Samurai," Saw the film because Tom was in it but ...........
","I was really impressed with the story. I love Tom Cruise and have seen everything he's done so this was just another Tom Cruise movie, right? Wrong! What a wonderful story. You just feel everything in this movie. The acting was great from everyone. Although a lot was in Japanese (with subtitles of course) I think you could have figured out what they were saying just by watching their expressions. The chemistry is so fluid between these characters that you really feel this was how it was in this time. I went in there just to see Tom Cruise but came out with an appreciation of a wonderful story, that, I didn't expect. This is a MUST see film and I am keeping my fingers crossed that this year will be Tom's year to win an oscar.",Null,0,0,23 January 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Bravo, Russell
","I thought this was a wonderful movie!!!!!!! I like to see movies that I know nothing about going in and all I had heard about this one was 'You got to see this!!!' I'm happy for Jennifer Connelly getting supporting actress, she wasn't great, but I've seen her in many things and she needed this to make her shine for future rolls. I don't like Ed Harris to play the heavy but he did a great job. Russell Crowe was AWESOME!!!!! I had no idea he was such a well rounded actor. The only thing I haven't seen him in was The Insider, but I will. HE WAS ROBBED!!! He should have gotten an academy award for his performance, he was flawless!!!! I feel this years awards were merely for show and these recipients were already predestined to win, no matter what. As Dennis Miller says, ' That's just my opinion, I could be wrong'.",Null,0,1,3 July 2002
Signs," Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!
","What a great movie!!!!!!!! This guy has got his stuff together in the movie making department. His camera angles and attention to detail and lighting are phenomenal. He has a way of making everything exactly like it would really be if you yourself were there experiencing it. You feel the characters feelings, when they are scared YOUR heart is racing right along with theirs and when they settle down, so do you. I loved The Sixth Sense!!!! Unbreakable was to much like a comic book hero type thing but all the good elements were still there, it just wasn't my kind of movie. He's like your favorite author, once you've finished his new book you want to read another one right away. Well, I'm ready for his next film, right now. Hope I won't have to wait too long.",Null,0,1,5 August 2002
Identity," Very surprised
","Wasn't sure what to expect from this movie because there really wasn't much out there about it. I went mostly because John Cusak was in it but as it turned out the movie was really quite good and I was very surprised by twist at the end. I never would have expected that at all. It was some what slow in pace but picks up toward the middle and then keeps on rolling till the surprise (or surprising for me, anyway) ending. Since there's no great special effects or anything in this film waiting for it to come out on video/DVD would be my advice (it's a little cheaper that way).",Null,0,0,16 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Say it ain't so
","Well, now that I've seen the last in the trilogy what am I going to do for my LotR fix??? I guess I could pop them in the old DVD player and watch them again and again but nothings as good as your first time. This one was wonderful, as were the 2 before it. Every time I'd see one I would think they can't make one better than that and I'm always blown away when they do. Those of you who haven't seen The Return of the King, what are you waiting for??? Stop wasting your time reading these reviews and get out there before it leaves the big screen!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,10 January 2004
Donnie Darko," Liked it but, not sure why
","Jake Gyllenhaal was both really sweet (you just want to hold him and make everything alright) and really creepy (when in the presents of Frank). This is one of those movies that some may need to see again to make sure you got everything the first time around. I always enjoy a movie that gives you a glimpse into the lives of others that on the outside seems 'normal' but in reality they have some hidden 'secret' beneath the surface. This movie has it all, fear, sadness, romance, confusion, horror, sci-fi, and a scary gray bunny.",Null,0,0,26 March 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," Non-stop action
","For those of you who really liked The Bourne Identity, you will REALLY like The Bourne Supremacy. It is non-stop action for the entire hour and 48 minutes you're there. I don't know about anybody else but I have been pleasantly surprised by Matt Damon's abilities in the action genre of films. I always thought of him as goofy but he has made a believer out of me that he CAN and HAS pulled it off not once, but twice! There are many twists and turns and a few surprises as well. There were several big names in this one as well Julia Stiles, Brian Cox, Joan Allen and, an added bonus (for me that is), Karl Urban. I enjoyed him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and was glad to see him in something completely different (all though I have seen him a few low budget films). Anyway, it's a great movie and you should really see it in the theater to get the full effect.",Null,2,4,29 July 2004
