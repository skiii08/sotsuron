10 Cloverfield Lane," Really really bad
","This would have to be on my list of one of the worst low-budget movies ever. We had a hectic week at work and thought we'd go and watch this one. Wow- a total let down. Plot was weak, acting was average and the 'believability factor' was a huge 0.Please don't waste your money. Seriously - caught between a nut-job and aliens? Who on earth thinks of these silly plots - obviously someone did!Acid baths, cold blooded killing, nut jobs, aliens, scary monster - really really not good",1,11,28,11 March 2016
