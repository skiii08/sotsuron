The Blair Witch Project," Fairly original, but uninvolving
","Having seen this movie after hearing so much about it I cannot be but disappointed. While the plot is fairly original and the film is atmospheric I find it impossible to relate to or sympathise with the characters. It is clear that this film appeals to a younger American movie audience, but I suspect older Europeans like me might not be that keen about it, even if they are horror film fans (and I am).",4,0,1,8 November 1999
The Mummy," Average entertainment
","The Karl Freund classic has been remade as a movie that is more Indiana Jones than horror. A distinctly juvenile approach definitely ruins this for fans of horror movies. What is left is just an average adventure film. Excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, though. The state-of-the-art sound mix and special effects make it enjoyable for Dolby Surround addicts and sfx fans.",7,0,0,19 December 1999
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," All the ingredients are there...
","What do you expect of an action/fantasy these days? Whatever you expect, you get all of it here and something additional that's sadly lacking in many, if not most: imagination. The creature designs and the special effects that make them come alive are first class, state-of-the-art - I cannot praise them enough. The details I caught made me want to watch the film again immediately to catch the ones I surely missed. Fantastic storytelling and direction from Guillermo del Toro. I now believe the man cannot do wrong. An experience to enjoy again and again. The best film of 2008 so far - and it will be hard to top.",9,2,6,10 July 2008
Cloverfield," Quite gripping and much better than I thought
","I live in Thailand and caught the first show today. After all the hype I was pleasantly surprised. The story starts a bit slow, but the monster attack began before I got bored. The shaky camera work puts you in the middle of the action. Other than 'The Blair Witch Project', to which this has been compared, the characters are sympathetic enough to make the story compelling. There's so much action that the movie seems to be much longer than the actual running time.The monster design is fine, if not completely original, with flailing, spider- or crab-like legs. The 'face' reminded me a little of Ray Harryhausen's Ymir. The beast has only one clear close-up shot near the end of the movie, but its massive body is glimpsed several times before. It looks very impressive. The small offspring or parasite monsters are barely glimpsed, but they are vicious.No explanation is given about the monster's origin. The camera-bearing protagonists are all killed - no Hollywood ending for this movie.Altogether a solid entertainment with a big potential for sequels. Also one of the best uses of surround sound ever.",9,2,7,17 January 2008
Wanted," Ultra-brutal action posing as entertainment
","Mindless action films abound and can be fun. This is not a mindless action film, but its 'mind' caters to nerdy dreams of becoming a more-than-human being. Wouldn't we all like to suddenly have $3.5 million in our bank accounts, tell off our extremely annoying boss (is there any other kind?) and get trained as an ultra-assassin? Then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience, then shoot them - cool? Not.One scene is ripped straight from 'The Matrix' series of films and the overall feeling is overwhelmingly Matrix/Terminator. Perhaps it's overoptimistic to look for something new in a movie of this type, but there's hardly anything original. This is not a film the world needs now - or ever.",1,185,326,27 June 2008
The Dark Knight," Mixed feelings
","I'm in Thailand which has a release date of today, so I actually saw this film. My feelings are somewhat mixed. It does succeed as a hard action film, but was definitely too long. The joker character is truly terrifying this time around and the film's tone is appropriately violent and dark - both figuratively and literally, much of the action takes place at night. The script caters for the American audience by making the joker and his cronies less criminals and more terrorists - who are probably what Americans are most concerned about. This made it less appealing for me. Much better than average, but still not more than 7 out of 10.",7,4,38,17 July 2008
300," All style, no substance
","When I noticed this movie on the release schedule I checked the plot and forgot about watching it immediately. No need for another lesson in ancient history. It should have stayed like that, but I was coaxed into watching it after all. I've since had a chance to take a look at the comic book and must say that if the intention of the filmmakers was to capture the comic's style they succeeded admirably. The story contains nothing that hasn't been told before. I won't even go into issues of warmongering and political correctness. Many pop-cultural events have been called 'the ultimate triumph of style over substance'. This movie takes the crown for now.",1,4,11,12 March 2007
Annihilation," A simple analysis
","This film is meant to approximate a psychedelic experience. (I cannot be the only one who noticed the quotes in the music cues from some of the mind-bending sequences in 2001: A Space Odyssey.) The story's not important, just look at those beautiful colours. Nice to put yourself in a drowsy state, but as a film it's worthless. I did buy the soundtrack album (and fell asleep while listening to it).",1,2,6,15 May 2019
