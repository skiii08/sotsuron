First Man," A subtle, slowly and beautifully crafted cinematic jewel
","I wonder if there will ever come the time when finally the reviews of art cinema, or author cinema, art house or whatever defines high quality movies get separated from the average Hollywood entertainment. It is absolutely ridiculous that IMDB and other sites use the same rating system to evaluate such different cultural products. Wouldn't this separation solve, for instance. the problem with the fake reviews and the misleading subjective opinions that place the last superhero movie above a Bergman classic, for instance?Anyways, talking about First Man, here we have something that leaves the average movie goers frustrated. What a disappointment for those folks who can not appreciate the subtleness of the human soul and the aesthetical beauty that comes with the slow exposition of emotions, sensations and feelings. The slow dance that First man resembles will definitely put millions asleep. Instead of focusing on the external aspects of that historical moment that brought the United States (and mankind) to the moon the movie goes to the backstage and illuminates the darkest rooms, exposing the subtle and harrowing drama of the people closely involved in the events. I would even say that the dramatic role of Neil's wife is as significant as that of the protagonist in carrying the emotional load of the story.This is not new. We have seen this writing strategy before, and again, we've seen the final product thrown to the flames by the disappointed mob of spectators. Remember Last Days, by Gus Van Sant? That masterpiece has 5.8 points on IMDB. Had Van Sant made First Man it would probably be even more obscure, more silent, slower, and people would trash it mercilessly.So, if you are in the mood for a popcorn spectacle on a boring night skip this. Looking for a wonderful cinematic experience? First Man will satisfy your needs. And don't forget to express your appreciation to the fantastic group of actors, writers, the director and every one who participated in the making of this jewel, even if it is anonymously, subtly, silently, in the deepest and darkest room of your soul.",8,1,4,17 February 2019
