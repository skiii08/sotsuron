Ford v Ferrari," Solid Flick
","Its entertaining. Cliche at times but the movie moves rather fluidly. Forget about the inaccuracies thats what books are for, this a hollywood film so expect hollywood stuff. The sound editing is killer and the cinematography is great also.",6,1,3,29 November 2019
It," Pissed Off
","Why must a person fall when running in every horror film. This is another cliche horror flick. Turned it off after 20 minutes just because thats my threshold, I relly wanted to tune out right after the scene with that dumb ass kid with the lisp played near a sewer talking to a scary ass clown. Plain grabage. Far cry from the original.",1,0,3,2 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Entertaining AF
",Its worth the watch. Good laughs & cool action scenes. I just did not like the fight scene with No Doubt as the background music during an action scene. Other than that its a decent flick.,7,7,13,23 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Entertaining
","Other than the cliche destruction of a major city, this is a entertaining movie. Grab your popcorn and drink.",6,0,0,1 June 2018
1917," Stay Home and Chill
","Boring, over rated, slow, no action, no memorable lines, mediocre acting, predictable plot, the only good thing is the cinematography. Wait till it is on your streaming service.",3,14,34,19 January 2020
