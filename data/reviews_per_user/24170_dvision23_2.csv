The Ring," paint by numbers
","This film started off good as though it was going to be what it promised, a really creepy, clever new twist on the horror genre.  It ended up (for the most part) with the script concept on the level of an afterschool special. With wooden acting for the most part, a ten cent script, yet camerawork, photography and art direction that was absolutely fantastic - to die for. That was the Dreamworks touch.Let's see what else - an awful, unsatisfying ending.  To put it another way. It's for morons.  Or to be more fair, it's kid stuff.  Kubrick and Lynch could have had their hands in the same type of film.  One that looked and felt just like this one.  Only the script, casting and acting would have been SOOOO much better.  Hopefully the director will learn by working at his craft.",3,0,1,12 July 2003

","Yes, that was a joke, but seriously, this movie was very poor in my opinion. I, too, believe that the majority of IMDB respondents are a tad skewed. Yes, the movie was different.  But could you really get excited about a film in which the star can't remember very much from one time period to the next. I watch a lot of movies, I can recall (another joke!) a number of movies that have gone out on a limb, and done a dozen times better than this (Usual Suspects for one).  I wanted this movie to be better, and instead it was torturous.I don't think it would be a spoiler to say that the ending was ridiculous, because I'm really describing the whole movie.  I keep coming back to the IMDB itself.  I guess I dont put my two cents in enough.  Hey out there, if you see a movie you don't like, let the IMDB know so movie reviews don't become totally one sided.For the thousands of IMDB'ers that liked it, we can agree to disagree. There's STILL is no accounting for taste.",1,20,42,13 April 2002
