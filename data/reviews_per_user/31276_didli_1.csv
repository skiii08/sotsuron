The Incredible Hulk," Hulk is the stronger one there is. This movie is the worst one there is.
","Hulk is a very interesting character. One with a Prometheus fate that could destroy a whole city in a few minutes in a brutal and fierce rage. The one you will see in this movie ? Well... he loves to run in dark places (you know, places where we can't see him very well), yell a lot, stay quietly in love with an ex-girlfriend, yell a lot, break some glasses and, Ã” surprise, yell a lot and take the time to kick the ass of the bad guy, surprisingly more bigger and ugly than Hulk. The other surprise of this movie is that the bad guy won't even try to kick Hulk's ex-girlfriend ...huh ... wait ... wrong, he obviously tried it of course, with Hulk aaaaaaaaall the way yelling at him ! (remember, Hulk yells a lot). Thanks to Edward Norton, there is some things to save from this film, as well as most of the (few) FX present in this movie. Nevertheless, there is still a possibility that you enjoy the movie. I think.",1,25,54,19 July 2008
