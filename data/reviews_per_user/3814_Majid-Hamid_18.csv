Scarface," Pacino's Scarface... 10/10
","So far this is best Pacino's movie since The Godfather. In fact, this movie does surpassed The Godfather in certain aspect involving violence and it's gritty. Plenty of action, good dialogue and superb acting given by the actors make it worth watching Scarface even though it's 3 hours long. It deserve to be in the list of top 250 movies all time. Everyone who watch Scarface will give positive review. Haven't met anyone who claim that this movie is a waste of time. I'm gonna watch this movie again for 90th time. It's just brilliant.ps : i do prefer watching Scarface rather than watching Godfather or Goodfellas ;)10/10--->EXCELLENT!!!",10,0,1,11 September 2007
Mississippi Burning," Hackman & Dafoe Are At Their Best !!!
","never underestimate the ability of hackman and dafoe... that is the only thing that i can say.... we have seen a lot of movie involving hackman, and this is one of the greatest performance from him...don't ever judge the acting by comparing to his age..he will always be one of the greatest actor for all time...Willem dafoe is just like the underdog...sometimes he has given a very powerful acting in a movie,and it was proved by two movies...this one @ Mississippi burning..and American psycho..thus to these performances...hackman was nominated for Oscar...he really deserves it !! Frances Mac dormant is also very good...and so she won an Oscar too..it is only i am not satisfied that dafoe did not received any Oscar for this movie...sometimes an underdog like him should be given a chance...nothing to say about this movie...the plot and story line are definitely superb!! the acting from everyone are great!! Michael rooker has always been good in his movie.. he played as a villain,and so.. he has proved that he is also great at playing as a villain...just like Michael ironside..overall...i give this movie 10 out of 10 stars...Bravo For Mississippi Burning !!!!!",10,11,18,21 October 2008
Over the Top," 4.5 out of 10 stars??? Gotta be kidding me...
","What the hell...?? What on earth is going around?? OTT only given 4.5 out of 10??Oh my god...that's brilliant...very brilliant indeed!! I just can't believe this! I checked in IMDb, and look at the biography of Stallone and it says OTT was not a successful movie and only mediocre. How could that possibly be?? Just because it is only a low budget movie and it should be considered as non popular movie? By far, to me this is one of the finest movie Stallone ever had! The story is good, and the acting is well. I just don't see what is wrong about this movie! Of course there are some flaws, but who cares?? Even Rocky have flaws, and i can tell u what it is. But it is still a good movie isn't it?? And i don't see what's wrong with this movie. What's make this different from from Rocky?? Why it wouldn't become success as Rocky?? Someone.. please explain this to me!! (10/10**)",10,3,5,23 October 2009
The Thing," best Carpenter's movie ever !!
","for sure this is the best and greatest movie by Carpenter ! not only that, this is also the best performance from Kurt Russell in his carrier!! this movie really scares me...it has a lot of suspense and good techniques.. no porn inside this movie with no actress at all!! it is really hard to find a movie without an actress nowadays...John Carpenters are simply great!! Kurt Russell is superb !! Keith David is entertaining!! i don't want to comment a lot about this movie...the only thing that i can say is that this is one of the greatest horror movie in history, and it is absolutely perfect !!! 10/10***",10,0,1,31 October 2008
The Shining," 2 Razzie award for this movie???
","What the hell??? How come there are 2 Razzie Nominations for this movie??? Shelley Duvall nominated for worst actress??? How the hell it was given to her??? Honestly i really think that she is one the reason and character which makes this movie a classic! Let's us think again... Shelley is definitely NOT a pretty woman at all. Nowadays directors only focused on pretty woman and chicks and gave them important roles to make their movie a success, because they thought people would watch pretty woman in a movie instead of judging their acting performances. Well, this does not happens in Kubrick's The Shining.... Shelley was given the role because she is a natural. The role for her perfectly fits her, and she has the ability to control her emotion and tension. She didn't become totally insane and scared because this is how normal people naturally become when something happens. Jack Nicholson has shown a superb acting especially when turning into a maniac! I wonder why he didn't won any Oscar for this kind of performances??? And as for Kubrick...how come he is nominated as the Worst Director???? This is totally insane!!! Come on people...we all knew the Shining is a classic until today!",10,1,3,8 April 2012
Quantum of Solace," The Worst James Bond Ever...Daniel Craig !
",casino Royal is stupid... and this one more stupid than ever... i can't believe that people are saying Daniel Craig is a great actor as a bond!! he is just plain idiot!!! not even worthy to be called a bond!!! he is the worse bond of all!! the story crap...the acting is bad as well...the script does not go very well indeed...what else can i say??? casino Royal and quantum for solace are the worse James bond movie after all in history!!!!!! even timothy Dalton and George lazemby are far much more better than stupid Daniel Craig!!!!! overall...0 out of 10 stars........0/10*****,1,9,19,21 January 2009
Gone with the Wind," a superb....greatest classic in history..
",i really have to say that this movie is the greatest in history.this movie is the greatest among the greatest ! i would like to rank this movie as no 1.and this movie should be ranked no 1 in the IMDb..NOT THAT STUPID BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT !!!! this film is far more better than the godfather and star wars..GWTW is a the most successful epic movie i have ever watched in history.even though it has more than 50 years...this movie will surely be remembered as the greatest@the king of all movie..once again i would like to say... this is the type of movie that should be ranked as no 1 in IMDb..NOT THAT IDIOT BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT !!!! 10/10**** (SUPERBLY EXCELLENT !!!),10,1,2,11 August 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," what else can i say???
","this is a very brilliant movie.. i thought that this is quite a boring and slow. I atched this movie before, but i jumped for a couple of scene, and i decide to say that this is a boring movie..not good either.. but then, i was determined to watch this movie again. This time, i watched it carefully for more than 3 hours long! Then only i realized, this is the best epic movie ever! To me, everything in this movie perfect! Please do not consider about the history if u want to judge about this movie. I am a Muslim, and i know that this movie insults the Arabians for being a puppet to the American. It is true that the Arabs is a puppet to the American till now. But that's not the point! The point is how a good movie should be created. David Lean has proved that an epic movie should be like this one! It's just another masterpiece such as Gone With The Wind! To me, i really would like to vote this movie and ranked this movie as no 1 movie in the IMDb list! For sure no 2 should be given to GWTW.. This is the top 10 movie in my list (which i think should be top 10 in the IMDb list !!) :1. Lawrence of Arabia 2. gone with the wind 3. 12 angry men 4. rear window 5. Ben hur 6. the great escape 7. the Poseidon adventure 8. the bridge on the river kwai 9. north by northwest 10.the dirty dozen",10,1,3,15 April 2009
JFK," Oliver, Costner and Tommy Jones makes JFK one of the greatest politician crime movie in history...EVER !
","I wouldn't like to talk much about this movie...if you really want to get know more about the assassination of JFK, then grab some money and watch this movie. If you're not a fan of political movies, then consider this movie as a crime, and for sure you will still love this masterpiece! I have been watching most of Costner and Oliver's movie, and i found that this is one the best movie of their's! There is no doubt that Oliver was nominated an Oscar for best director, but i had a doubt why Costner was not given an Oscar for best actor??? He has always been good in his movies and far much much more better than other actors such as Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves and others..why??? What about Tommy?? There's no answer to it..but you can judge it after watching JFK. To me, it is definitely correct that he should won best supporting actor in this movie! Bravo ! Overall..JFK definitely a classic! 10/10 (A++ * very recommended!)",10,3,15,12 March 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," a legend......
","I have to say that this movie a legend. This movie probably is the best for al pacino. I mean, it is as good as the godfather part 1 and 2.My fren used to tell me long time ago about 3 best movie of pacino after the great godfather movie. And here, the three movie which i check out in the movie database, as one of the top movie in the world. At that time, i still haven't watch these movie. It was none other than SCARFACE, HEAT and of course, DOG DAY AFTERNOON! The first movie of al pacino that i watch is SEA OF LOVE, and so ifall in love with al pacino movie. Let me tell you,i'm really a fan of al pacino after watching his movie. SCARFACE is the 2nd movie i watch and consider the BEST! Then i watch HEAT,of course,as good as SCARFACE.But..after watching DOG DAY AFTERNOON...(by the time i'd watched GODFATHER 1,2,3), i had to admit, this is the BEST of his carrier ! no wonder there are nobody say this movie is stupid,because it is the greatest ! I can guarantee that nowadays,nobody will be able to create a special movie like this !Pacino has given his finest performance in this movie.I juz disagree that this movie is not rated as high as THE GODFATHER. Spend your money and watch this movie. You wont lose anything about this movie. The actor are definitely great,(especially CHRIS SARANDON),the director himself,(who won an Oscar for this great movie),and the storyline, are all powerful indeed!! A very classic movie..a legend...don't lose it! buy it! 10/10*******",10,0,0,31 January 2008
Black Hawk Down," Total lies.......Black Hawk Bulls**t !!!
","This is the most bull**t movie i have ever seen in my whole life! The story are totally full of lies, because the American soldiers NAVY SEALS at that time, are WHIMPERING asking to be saved. Everyone knows bout this. I have a business partner who was involved at that time, and he is a Malaysian, where he was the captain of the squad leader. He told me all the actual stories. The Malaysian fighter were ordered to retreat, but he changed the goddamn order and brought his men for a rescue mission. He and his men found the NAVY SEALS soldiers whimpering and crying out loud asking to be saved, and he knock that guy out and drag all of them to safety. The Malaysian soldiers went through again to find any survivors and rescued all of them. By the time, the NAVY SEALS were in truck retreating.These Malaysian squad who went back there and saves people lives! Not the f***ing NAVY SEALS. And yet,this film trying to prove that the American soldiers are the real heroes, when it is not! It was the Malaysian fighters who rescued those people.Best of all, avoid this nonsense movie. Shame on you NAVY SEALS !!!(0/10 stars)",1,5,13,27 August 2012
The Fly," i was wrong about this movie...
","About a couple of months ago i watched this movie i found that this movie really sucks. Then i checked in the IMDb list and was surprised to see that this movie rated 7.4. Therefore i comment on this movie by saying that this movie is really bad. Last night i bought a DVD and my friend and i decide to watch this movie. I told him that this movie sucks.. but after watching it again, i realize that i was completely wrong about this movie. Truly this was a great movie.. I doubt if there are more movies like this nowadays. So today, i opened back my account in the IMDb and delete the old comment. I would like to apologize for my bad comments over this movie. Honestly, it was a classic.Don't believe me??? Watch this movie and comment on it.10/10*** (excellent)",10,0,1,22 August 2009
The Untouchables," not an average mob movie...
","this one perhaps one of the best movie from De palma! why??? i can't really tell about this movie...of course it has some flaws...but it is extremely great movie! Kevin Costner has always been great in his movies...and this one really stands out! i really think that he should be nominated an Oscar for best actor in this film...he has performed a good job in JFK,and yet he didn't receive any Oscar...except for dances with the wolves..how bout other actors??Sean Connery...undoubtedly he has been the best in this movie... and received an Oscar for supporting role...and he really deserves it... Andy Garcia??? he has been good too...Robert De niro??? nothing to be comment about...we all know how powerful he is in every movie... Charles martin smith?? perhaps this is his best performances ever in his whole life...De palma has been a great director...and this one is the best of his career! the story is powerful,the script is great..the action is superb!! this movie should have been listed in top 250 in the IMDb list..i can't believe people are voting 10 out of 10 for stupid movies such as the dark knight, iron man, sin city, batman begins, the matrix, and many others! are they stupid ??? i was thinking how they judge a movie!!! giving a stupid crap movie a 10 out of 10....this is idiot !!! why others good movies such as this one, the french connection, JFK, the Poseidon adventure,dirty dozen,where eagles dare and many others others are not listed in top 250 movies in the IMDb list??? why???anyhow...this movie does really stands out...watch it!!!10/10*** (mid)",10,0,2,19 October 2008
Psycho," Hitchcock...At His BEST !!!!!
",WOW!!! this is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror film of all time!! this film is not overrated...it deserves to be in the top 100 movie... but i really think it is unfair for other horror movie like exorcist and the omen...i think those two movies are the best horror movie of all time!! this movie could be rank as no 3 in my horror movie list...Anthony Perkins proves he is one of the most greatest psychotic actor ever!!! Vera Miles and Janet Leigh have proved themselves as one of the greatest actress in history!!i think Anthony Perkins should be nominated an Oscar for this film...i wouldn't want to say anything more about this movie...judge it by yourselves! watch PSYCHO (1960)!! psycho 2 and 3 are okay...but not a masterpiece...i don't know about psycho 4..BUT...AVOID THE REMAKE !!!Overall...i give this 10/10*** :),10,0,0,30 October 2008
