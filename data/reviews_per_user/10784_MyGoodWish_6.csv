Lucky Number Slevin," Bruce Willis has so much Cooool some rubbed off on Josh
","Finally a movie I can suggest a family member pay to see on the 'Bigscreen'.Not since Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang have I been able to do that.This is a good movie for anyone that likes mystery hit-man movies with mood swings.There's some violence but not the nasty stuff and brief nudity, but not the nasty stuff.Even if you figure this out early ,you won't mind cause there's still a lot going on thats very well done and keeps your interest. Bruce Willis is such a cool hit-man in this you might find yourself thinking 'didnt I see this cat play tenor sax in that joint'... Okay Maybe I stretched that one but that's because I forgot Bruce can do cool really well.I'll bet he practices this stuff because he's got it down. Pretty boy 'Joshee-poo' Hartnett finally put on his 'I can do good movies too' outfit and held his own amongst pros, imagine that.Lucy Liu is not her usual Asian Fighter Bitch...Thank God. Frankly you wont recognize her in a normal part, it's so refreshing. I can honestly say I have never liked a single performance of hers until this. Ben Kingsley again with the seething heat..he just rocks.Morgan Freeman gives a good performance,no surprises.I could watch this again right now and still enjoy it,you'll like it too. Give it a try.",Null,17,40,6 April 2006
Crash," Poor Vicious Racist Los Angeles
","There are no gushy heartfelt moments in this movie which really works for me cause I'm sick of crappy Hollywood feely feely flicks. I've lived in Los Angeles for most of my life so I might relate too much to this movie ...there's no way for me to know. There are a lot of good actors in Hollywood these days and there was no shortage of them in this movie.Even bad actors looked good in this movie because the dialog is present. Racism is the disease of the day in this movie and it's not cured in two hours with the high school marching band ending as is usually the case.Sometimes I feel and say uncomfortable racist things too often,then I feel bad and try the next day to be a better person.But it seems every time I drive down Ventura Blvd.and get cut off and sneered at that I'm right back at prayer one.I guess thats why I liked this movie!",Null,2,9,6 May 2005
Million Dollar Baby," This Ain't No Dike Boxer Flick--This Is Really Good
","I'm a little prejudiced because I enjoy watching Eastwood,Freeman, Swank,and Eastwood and Eastwood and Eastwood....but watching them all 'enteract' together is an intense treat.Unlike other movies based on a boxer or athletic woman, Swank does'nt suddenly change into some tough jock-itching butchy bruiser.In other words shes 'femtuff', only Matt Damon has a smile as honest as hers.She's so unassuming and easy to watch you forget she's acting. Freeman and Eastwood are effortless--just so enjoyable to watch you just can't get enough of them. The dialog is refreshing and solid scene to scene with no meaningless lengthy up-close nostril shots.The direction is not blatant but instead its seamless and hidden in full view.This is one of those rare movies that comes along that I want to buy not just rent.",Null,1,4,1 January 2005
Mystic River," Finally A REAL Movie
","Clint Eastwood really yanked the best out of all of these actors. Sean Penn has finally come of age,with a burn like scotch not wine. Clearly Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon just needed juicy characters to chomp on because they're unrecognizable in this film...the best they've been in years.Laurence Fishburne can actually act without sunglasses on and he's tastefully understated.The womens characters played by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are powerful and sneak up on you, but the story does too, which again speaks to Eastwoods abilities.If your sick of those silly juvenile joke flicks you'll really like this story movie.",Null,1,2,22 October 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," I loved this movie in spite of Brad & Angelina
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith fortunately has the same director as Bourne Identity(my favorite action flick)and his brilliance shines through in every scene. I've seen a few Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie movies before and frankly I never thought too much of their characters or talent.But in this movie whether they have real acting talent or not you don't notice cause you're too busy enjoying the movie with them being very good in it.The 'Express Yourself' fight scene is one that is one in a million and even if you don't like action movies you'll recognize fast cool here as only this director can create.I've seen this movie 3 times now, mostly because I missed what they were saying at times but really because it was much better than the other stuff out there.The dialogue is to be commended for lack of stupidity,it was fast paced and very funny and clever.I still don't give a flying **** about Brad and Angelina but I will be buying the DVD when it comes out.",Null,0,3,17 July 2005
Hustle & Flow," This story is unbelievably good I had to like it
","This movie was a lot better than I expected, and I expected something decent -in spite of the usual rave reviews that everything gets these days.I was really smacked upside the head by this one because it was unique with the casting and the underlying tension in the story. This is not that boring ass 8 mile crap,and if your afraid of hearing the 'N' word then just don't go to see this movie. This story is painfully easy to relate to because it's about struggling to achieve a blurred dream and convincing yourself that 'it ain't over for you' as one of the songs say.Most people can relate to this unless they've already given up.The casting has a natural racial mix that really really felt good. Too bad Spielberg and Scorsese can't cast like this. The raps were hard and good ...they were actually a member of the cast and a real pleasure.Whether you like rap or not you'll enjoy the honesty of it. Terrence owned this role while not over acting it,like so many actors do lately.I'll buy this soundtrack even though I'll have to use earphones on it because it's pretty raw.",Null,0,0,30 July 2005
