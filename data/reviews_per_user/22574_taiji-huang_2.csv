Iron Man 3," disappointed with the mandarin
","I am completely disappointed in the portrayal of the Mandarin. The Mandarin, being Iron Man's archenemy and all, turned out to be a persona that Killian (Guy Pierce) invented and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was nothing more than a decoy. This made me extremely angry considering that I have always liked the Mandarin from the comics. In my opinion, Killian completely differs from what the Mandarin actually is and this also leads to the problem of whether the Mandarin still exist in the movie universe. The action scenes were spectacular but that is about it. The plot twist that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was just a decoy was definitely meant to be one of the main points of the whole film. However, I just did not like it at all. And everything that follows the plot twist was just action. What I really wanted was a Mandarin based on the comics to carry the plot forward. While I think it's quite unfair to judge a whole movie based on a single character, the portrayal of the Mandarin completely destroyed the film for me and I am extremely disappointed with Marvel/Disney for changing the character.",1,177,356,27 April 2013
Man of Steel," makes no sense
","one of the biggest problems i have with movies is that they make no logical sense, even in universe. correct me if i'm wrong, but how did superman not die from getting blasted by the giant blue laser from one of the Kryptonian aircrafts? Kryptonians only have super power because the earth's gravity field such and such are incredibly weak compared to krypton's. so therefore wouldn't a laser from a krypton aircraft kill superman? because, they are designed to kill Kryptonians? also, how did superman manage to smash through the Kryptonian spaceship? again, being built by Kryptonians on krypton, how can it possibly be destroyed by a Kryptonians? that's like the equivalent of a human smashing through a rocket ship with his or her bare body. how did an airplane crash through the Kryptonian mother ship? wouldn't the material used to make the mother ship be much stronger than anything on earth because, you know, its from krypton? also it seems that about 100 people in the united states knows Clark Kent's secret identity. he doesn't even try to hide it at one point in the movie he just tells a priest straight on that he was the guy general zod was looking for. other times, characters are just plain stupid. faora decides to go into a airplane and then proceed to kill everyone on board one by one instead of just throwing the airplane into the ground saving time and making it impossible for the Kryptonians to lose (EVEN THOUGH THEY Shouldn't HAVE ANYWAYS BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE NO WAY FOR THE AIRPLANE TO CRASH THROUGH THE KRYPTONIAN MOTHER SHIP). also apparently Jor-el's consciousness knows how to speak English despite only knowing about earth few moments before his death.apart from all these blatantly obvious logical flaws (apparently they did not even try to hide them), the movie is insufferable. the patriotism is dialed up to the extreme. there was always this talk about dying and honour and such and such. also, the message about someone (superman) being born special, and meant for greater things gets annoying very very quickly. there wasn't much acting involved for Henry Cavill's Clark Kent. Amy Adam's Lois lane was just plain annoying being in the middle of the action all the time despite the fact that she obviously should not be. Laurence Fishburne's character served no purpose at all and actually advocated keeping a story out of the papers despite being a journalist. (maybe this is an attempt to brainwash the population into thinking that whistle blowing is wrong and talking about 'state secrets' is bad after the Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden scandal?) however, i did think Michael Shannon's General Zod was brilliant and he would probably be the reason to ever watch the movie.",1,4,14,24 June 2013
