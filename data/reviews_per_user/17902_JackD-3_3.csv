Requiem for a Dream," Not exactly the feel good movie of 2000
","Requiem for a Dream is another screen adaptation of a Hubert Selby novel, and like 1991's 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' no one gets out of this one unscathed.  It's a powerful movie and a bit difficult to watch at times, but it's worth the ride to go down with these characters to depths from which they will never emerge.  All the performances are solid, but Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her life as a woman who just wants to wear a red dress that reminds her of more hopeful days.  Jared Leto -- where did he come from? -- gives an equally impressive performance as her totally hapless drug addicted son. This movie is a great antidote to morally bankrupt films along the lines of 'Trainspotting' that portray serious addiction as glamorous. 'Trainspotting' made an episode of cold turkey look like a really cool music video with a baby crawling on the ceiling.  When Ellen sees the refrigerator comes sliding and grinding across the floor in 'Requiem' it is neither cool nor glamorous.  The word 'malevolent' comes to mind.",8,0,0,10 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," What's all the fuss about?
","I had heard such unmitigated praise for this film that I went to it expecting to see something really special.  Instead I saw a good film that was beautifully shot, engaging story, well put together, very dreamlike. . . but the best film of the year?  I think not.  Not even in the year 2000 when there was a scarcity of good movies.  And certainly not one of the best films ever made.  I don't understand the fanatical devotion that many people seem to feel for this film.",6,0,0,16 February 2001
Signs," Holes in the plot -- SPOILER INCLUDED!!!!
","SPOILER WARNING: There are plot details discussed in this comment so please don't read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.  I enjoyed watching this movie, but once it was over I was annoyed at some enormous holes in the plot.  The most obvious gaping hole is that the aliens could be destroyed by water.  Don't you think that if they had the intelligence to send fleets of ships through light years of space they would have known to wear some type of protective covering on earth with its water laden atmosphere?  These creatures would be killed every time it rained. For us it would be like going to a planet where the rain is a powerful acid instead of water.  We would wear some type of protective clothing.  These aliens wouldn't even have been able to run through the corn field at night because at night in the summer the corn stalks would often be covered with dew.  Another hole:  the aliens made these giant signs in the corn fields which people suspect (correctly as it turns out) are aids to navigation.  First of all, you would have trouble seeing them from space, especially if it's night on the ground.  Second, don't you think the aliens would have some better form of technology to navigate the earth's surface?  And most important, wouldn't some bright person have gotten the idea to mow the fields where the signs had been carved to erase the signs?  Another hole:  the neighbor (played by the director) catches an alien and locks it in the pantry.  Mel Gibson knows it's there because he cuts its fingers off.  Shouldn't one of these guys have mentioned this to somebody like maybe the police or the military?  Said something like 'There's a spaceman in the kitchen'?  Instead the neighbor drives off to the lake and Mel runs home and boards up the windows.  That just doesn't make any sense to me.  Like I said, while the movie was playing I really enjoyed it because the performances are uniformly strong and there are some wonderful moments of suspense and humor.  But afterward I just felt annoyed.",6,0,1,7 August 2002
