Vertigo," not casual viewing.....
","The first time I attempted to watch 'Vertigo' I fell asleep.  That was mostly because I was tired.  I made a small attempt to catch up on what I missed while I napped, and when the film ended I was not too impressed. Because of that, it has taken me some time before I decided to give this film another chance.  Thank god I did.  The first thing I realized is that you have to pay attention when you watch this film because it isn't lite viewing.  The characters have a lot of depth and if you don't pay attention you might miss it.  That would be a tragedy because then you wouldn't get to fully experience the absolutely stellar performance by Novak, and the even more stellar (and extremely intense)performance of Stewart.  Their chemistry is great, and it made for a very rewarding viewing experience.The film is also quite lovely to look at.  Much like 'To Catch a Thief', the cinematography is excellent.  The sights are as much of the film as the performances.  There is also a great dream sequence, kind of like the one you would see in 'Spellbound', in comparison.  The color scheme is well defined, in the movie as well as the dream sequence, and that is a large amount of reds and greens.  Of course the direction is excellent, and that is no surprise.  The first time I saw this film I hated it, the second time I loved it.  The story is simple enough, but the characters have a depth that isn't all that common in Hitchcock movies.  Usually there is mystery, but the humanity isn't always there like it is in this movie.  A visually and psychologically compelling movie that is among the best Hitchcock ever did.

Requiem for a Dream," brutal....
","I know no other way to describe this film than brutal.  That doesn't mean that its bad.  In fact it is an excellent film.  It is not for the casual viewer though, and it certainly isn't Friday night popcorn fair. If thats what you want or expect, then leave it.  But if you can take it, its a very worth while watch.The film does start rather slowly.  It put me to sleep the first time I watched it.  But in the spirit of always finishing what I watch, I gave it a second chance.  Good thing.  Early in the movie, about the first half or so, there is some excellent editing.  It was excellent, but at the same time it was over used, and thankfully was almost completely left alone in the second half of the movie.  The image of the dilated pupil is a very common and strong one in the film.  I do feel, however, that some of the camera work did take away from the humanity a bit.  At times it was brilliant in that it disoriented the viewer and put us in the characters place, but at certain times I feel it was a little out of place.The acting is excellent, and extremely brave.  Burstyn, as mentioned many times before, is great.  The big surprise is Marlon Wayans.  Yes, he plays a drug addict again, but for once it wasn't in a spoof, and it wasn't for laughs.  It was nice to see the change from him.  Connelly is always good, so there's really nothing you need to say about her performance that wasn't expected anyway.The one thing I usually don't mention in a film is the score.  I'm usually indifferent to it.  In this film, however, the score was not only brilliant, but it was used to perfection and captured the tone of the movie.  It was necessary, and really heightened the downward spiral of all the characters.Speaking of the downward spiral, I feel this film captured that really well. The beginning is slow, but with the characters lives beginning to spiral out of control, the pace gets quicker, much quicker.  The second half of the film is very fast and dark, and you can't take your eyes off of it.  I'm not sure if the pacing was deliberate, but if it was then it was executed to perfection.To sum up, this film isn't an easy watch, but its a good one.  The direction and editing are good, the acting is top notch, and the story isn't at all forgiving.  I'm thankful that it never took the easy way out, and thats what makes it memorable.  9 out of 10.",9,0,1,29 June 2002
Lifeboat," another great experiment....
","'Lifeboat' is an excellent film.  It is a great achievement by Alfred Hitchcock that he could create a film set on only a lifeboat interesting for its duration.  Hitchcock had a knack for experimental films, such as 'Rope', which seems to be one continuous shot, and 'Rear Window', which features one small apartment and a man in a wheel chair. With so little, he is always able to do so much. In 'Lifeboat', we start out with the sinking of a ship and people gathering on the lifeboat.  It's really that simple.  This is a character driven film. There are no lush chase sequences, there are no gunfights, there is no mystery.  Nope, its all about how this collection of characters interact with each other.  Its a study of how difference of opinion can creat tensions, and how people can deal with those tensions.  Its really fascinating to watch, and when its all said and done, you get the impression that it wasn't just an experiment, but that it had something to say, and it did.The only slight flaw in the film is that we don't really get a sense of how long(exactly)they've been at sea.  I 'Cast Away' we saw Tom Hanks lost a considerable amount of weight and grow a considerable amount of hair.  Well, that is the one thing you don't see with this movie.  Its really a minor quibble anyway because it doesn't diminish the entertainment value at all.Hitchcock was the master of suspense, but he was never afraid to try other things, from screwball comedy(Mr. and Mrs.Smith) to psychological thrillers(Vertigo).  This film is definitely one of his best and most interesting experiments.  9 out of 10.",9,65,77,23 May 2002
Chinatown," I hate film noir and I always will......
","Film Noir has to be the most overrated style of film being made.  'The Maltese Falcon', 'L.A. Confidential', and now 'Chinatown' are film noir films I have seen that are highly overrated pieces of s**t.  Someone has to say how crappy this style of film is.  But perhaps I am the only one using my brain when I watch these over complicated, yet extremely simple, and most of the time non-existent and forgotten about plots. First of all, the plot twists.  There are too many to count in every one of these.  She could be a daughter, then a lover, then a wife, then a man. It doesn't matter, apparently all of you fools will buy into anything they tell you and call it a masterpiece.  You may as well watch 'Days of our Lives'.  I bet they have great plot twists for all of you to sink your teeth into.  There's sure to be double crosses.  And as long as there are ten or eleven of those, contrived as they all are, you seem to love it.Now 'Chinatown' is no better than any of those.  Jack Nicholson was a million times better in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', and that had a coherent script.  So I guess thats out.  Plus that had characters that you could have sympathy for, where as in film noir, this film is no exception to the rule, all of the characters are just a tool for the plot twists.  They don't have personalities or souls, they just have surprises, all of which are surprises because they come out of nowhere and don't cohere with the story they initially started telling. And continuity, can I get a little of that, please.  By the end of the movie, the main story element didn't even matter.  All of the plans to move water out of L.A. are forgotten about, and then some contrived soap opera story line takes center stage. I will, however, admit that I did enjoy the scene when Dunaway tell Nicholson her big secret.  It was just so damn contrived and out of nowhere that I found myself laughing a little and with a small smile on my face. All though, that was the only brief amount of enjoyment I got out of it, because the rest was just so slow.  And its built up like we are supposed to be exposed to this great finale, but alas, we are not.  But it was all silly, contrived, out of the blue, and a great plot twist that makes no sense, so I'm sure all of you were breathless when it was all said and done. And I have news for those of you who are so impressed at how good the atmosphere in this film is.  Guess what?  This isn't the only film thats been shot half decently and has atmosphere, all though not much of one.  A lot of films have a great atmosphere.  'The Godfather' has a great atmosphere.  'Das Boot' has a great atmosphere.  But these also have better direction, better stories, and better characters that we can care about. Am I really asking for too much in wanting that.  Those two are great films. This is really more of an attack on the genre on the whole, but this movie is no better than any other ones.  Nicholson was fine, but thats about it.  I'll take a movie with characters I care about from now on, and maybe a cohesive plot and story.  Thats all I ask, and I don't think thats too much.",4,31,65,6 August 2001
The Others," good, not great......
","'The Others' is a movie that is extremely rich in atmosphere.  Kidman's character, Grace, and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a mansion that is constantly surrounded by a thick fog.  Plus, most of the movie is candle lit.  The light, and lack there of, plays a huge role in much of the movie, and creates a thick sense of tension and sometimes dread.      However, no matter how good the atmosphere was, the pacing was a little awkward.  It was generally slow, sometimes bordering on being to slow, all building towards a supposedly startling conclusion.  I will admit that I thought it was decent, at least somewhat original and smart.  In a lot of ways however, it just wasn't worth it.      You could probably talk to your friends afterwards about what made you jump, what didn't, and what you thought of the ending.  All in all it was a movie that had great potential and lived up to most of it.  It was good, but I wouldn't highly recommend it.  7.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,13 August 2001
Scary Movie 2," I didn't expect much, and I got less......
","I found the original Scary Movie to be quite funny.  The same can be said for Don't Be a Menace While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  Scary Movie 2 was a huge disappointment.  You can tell that they cranked this movie out in a year and didn't put much thought into anything except trying to make a quick buck.  If you're going to make fun of movies, at least make fun of semi-good ones.  But they made fun of the likes of Hollow Man, the Haunting, and the dismal Save the last Dance, threw in some Weakest Link and a basketball commercial.  None of it was funny. The casting was horrible.  I don't have a whole lot against Tori Spelling, but why was she even in the movie.  She did nothing.  Well, most of the cast is wasted here.  The Wayans can, and have been much funnier. Tim Curry didn't belong. Chris Elliot is usually much better and more effective, but he just wasn't.  David Cross is one of the funniest people I have seen, and his comic prowess is wasted in this movie.  Just avoid Scary Movie 2.  Go see a decent movie for a change. 3 out of 10.",3,0,1,25 July 2001
Taxi Driver," just a few minutes too long.....
","This was an absolutely great movie, until the end.  I am tired of some people saying that the ending doesn't matter, because in this film, it kills the whole movie. We had the potential for one of the best, and most effective final images at the end of a movie.  That would be Robert DeNiro pointing his bloody finger at his head like a gun, after his brutal shoot out.  Then they camera follows a track to police cars and they should fade out.  We would have a had a dark, brutal film with an anti-hero. Then it goes on for a few more minutes, and Robert DeNiro has friends and is a hero to everyone.  It changes the whole tone of the movie, and I feel that Scorcese copped out at the end and softened up the movie.  It went from a masterpiece, to a decent movie.  I am just disappointed by how he decided to end it.  It ruined everything.  Thats why this is only a 7 instead of a 10.",7,3,6,25 July 2001
Full Metal Jacket," a prime example of why Kubrick is over rated....
","'Full Metal Jacket', like every other Kubrick film, is full of great imagery and fine performances, most notably here from the always fantastic D'Onofrio.  What is also the case with every Kubrick film is the uneven pace with which the movie progresses.  There are always great scenes, and then long droughts that are sluggishly paced.  This movie has a few great scenes, most of which are in the first half of the movie, all in the bootcamp. 
The first forty five minutes or so, which do take place in the bootcamp, are brutal to watch.  D'Onofrio is fantastic as the tortured Pyle.  The rest of his 'brothers' are good as well.  The bootcamp scenes are probably the most realistic and brutal ones ever shot of such events.  The cruelty exerted upon everyone by the drill sergeant is shown without softening anything up. It shows how people are trained to be killers and how the army(or marines)take ordinary people and systematically break them down.  It is very well acted, shot, directed and executed.  The first forty five minutes were great, and the last scene in the bootcamp is extremely powerful.  After that it is all downhill.The last hour or so is just a basic Vietnam movie.  Its really nothing that you wouldn't see in movies such as 'Platoon', or the great 'Apocalypse Now'. There is much devestation, and issues of morality.  Almost all of the scenery is on fire and engulfed in a thick black smoke.  No originality at all, and the pace slows down to a crawl.  It becomes another pretentious Kubrick vehicle that is self serving, and to be honest, bland and rather boring.  On top of that, I thought that the musical choices at the end of the movie were rather horrible and out of place as well.  However, if you do sit through the rather boring and standard hour, you will get the only good scene in the section, which also happens to be pretty much the last scene in the movie.  But it was a really good scene.Had the movie been more bootcamp, or only forty five minutes long, I would highly recommend it.  As it stands, I feel Kubrick is highly over rated and generally ruins his films with his own pretention.  If you want a good vietnam movie, watch 'Apocalypse Now', as they don't get any better than that.  It has the same issues, but its absolutely a great movie, and 'Full Metal Jacket' is not.  I will give it 6 out of 10, but that is mostly for the bootcamp section of the movie.",6,0,2,9 September 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," amazingly cute....
","I found it hard not to have a smile on my face while I was watching this movie.  It is so amazingly cute.  Pixar studios have made another amazing movie to add to their list.  Unlike the others however, this movie really doesn't work on two levels, just one, cute.  It appeals to the children and the children in the adult.  On top of that, it contains one of my favorite sequences in a movie that I've seen for some time.  For those of you who have seen it, its the door sequences in the different countries.  For those of you who haven't seen it, I am sure you will love that part as much as me, it was brilliant.  Fantastic movie, I recommend it to anyone.  9.5 out of 10.",9,0,1,12 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," and the story has barely even started.....
","I had extremely high expectations going into 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. It is absolutely the greatest book I have read, and one of the greatest stories ever told.  So to expect something short of it being one of the greatest movies ever made would be foolish.  I wanted a film that would blow my mind, and I honestly thought they couldn't do it, and I thought they would disappoint me.  When I left the theatre, however, the movie still had a strong hold on me and it is the best thing I have ever seen put on film. I thought my expectations were as high as they could be, and this film easily surpassed them all and took me along for the ride.
First of all, I have to say that Peter Jackson is absolutely brilliant.  The direction in this film is astounding.  He took what was probably the most difficult book to translate onto the screen and he excelled in a way that I didn't think was possible.  The performances he got out of his actors was amazing.  Even more amazing were some of the shots in the movie.  The cinematography was absolutely amazing.  Those of you who thought 'Crouching Tiger' was beautiful, well it doesn't even compare to the awe inspiring scope of this film.  The whole sequence in Moria is breathtaking.  I don't remember blinking when I was watching it.  It is so astounding to watch it that you wonder how it is even possible that they did it.  I've never seen anything as amazing as the Moria sequence and I doubt I ever will again. 
The acting in the film is also fantastic.  I was watching it and I did something I rarely do, I forgot that they were actors.  Ian McKellan IS Gandalf.  I never saw anything but a powerful wizard.  He was so amazing and was how I saw him in my imagination.  Elijah Wood IS Frodo.  I assume you get the picture.  I do have to comment on Viggo Mortensen as Strider and say that he is the absolute perfect choice.  I always see Strider(Aragorn)as the ultimate hero, and Viggo captures my expectations in that character and made me believe in him.  No one is out of place in this film at all, and Ian Holm is especially great as Bilbo is what portions of the film he is in.  The casting director did the perfect job and I couldn't have, in any way, done it better myself.Lets not forget to talk about the incredible sets and special effects.  The Moria set is just astounding.  I can't describe it to you, but when you see it, you'll get the picture.  Lothlorien was beautiful.  Different than what I pictured, but effective all the same.  The Shire was perfect.  You can tell that they paid careful attention to detail and finely crafted everything.  The evil characters in the film were also great.  The Nazgul were terrifying.  There is really no other way to describe them.  What amazed me the most was the Balrog.  I had some ideas of how it could have been, but the image they gave me of it was great.  I could also tell you how great Mordor looked, and how great the eye looked, and how great the two tower looked, but I won't. You just have to see it all for yourself. At the end of watching 'The Fellowship of the Ring' a couple of thoughts occurred to me.  First of all, it occurred to me that I HAVE to see this film again, and soon.  And secondly, it occurred to me that nothing has even happened in the story yet.  LOTR is of such a huge scope, and they have just touched upon it.  This film absolutely blew my mind, and I am positive that the best it yet to come.  That said, I have never in my life seen a film that was as good as this, and as a fan of the books, it was really powerful for me.  It was not a film you sit in the theatre and watch, is it something you experience.  The film sucked me in and it still has a strong hold over me.  It is a very powerful film, one that everybody should see.  Greatest story ever, greatest film ever(only until the sequals of course!!!!).  Thank you so much Mr.Jackson and everyone else associated with it.  And of course, thank you J.R.R. Tolkien.  An astounding 10 out of 10, it doesn't get any better than this.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
North by Northwest," doesn't entirely hold up today.....
","Most of this film holds up entirely well by today's standards.  There is excellent suspense and some extremely memorable scenes, specifically the one of the plane chasing Cary Grant.  The only real problem with the movie is the famous Mount Rushmore sequence.  Most of the time Hitchcock never relied on special effects to create suspense, and it doesn't stand the test of time here. We've been treated to some amazing looking things as of late, and its hard to believe that the characters are in any real danger while they are supposedly on the face(no pun intended)of the mountain.  Its a shame, because up until that point the film was perfect.  Cary Grant plays his part well, a very suave man, and his usual fast talking self.  Eva Marie Saint is a great partner for Grant.  Of Grant's Hitchcock movies (including 'Notorious' and 'To Catch a Thief') I feel that this was the best chemistry he had with the lead actress, and I mean no disrespect to Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly, who are both brilliant.  Hitchcock's direction is superb, which should come as no surprise.  The beauty of this film is that it is Hitchcock on autopilot.  'Vertigo', made the year before this film, was a movie that you really had to pay attention to to get all the details.  It's nice to see that he made complex movies as well as great suspense movies that are extremely well paced and very entertaining.  It was what Hitch liked the best I think, a wrongly accused man involved in an international plot he knows nothing about.  Would have been perfect if not for the Mount Rushmore scene.  9.5 out of 10.",9,0,0,22 June 2002
Spider-Man," The almost amazing Spider-Man.....
","'Spider-man' is an extremely entertaining movie.  It is well cast, acted and directed.  This movie thrives not so much on action, but on characters, which is the ultimate strength of the movie.  I am thankful that there is a good deal of dialogue because otherwise this movie would have been a lot less.Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker.  His early relationship(and awkwardness)with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)is played out to perfection.  We get a character we can relate with, in Parker.  This is the relationship that drives the movie very well. William Dafoe also plays his duel role to perfection.  This is also a credit to Sam Raimi.  The Green Goblin is captured beautifully, and the Osborns are portrayed true to the comic book form.  The relationship between Harry and Norman is very accurate.  Actually, every relationship in this movie is very true to the comic book, and I appreciated that, and they could set up the next movie quite logically.What I didn't like were some of the special effects.  I understand that it is near impossible to capture the movements of such a character, and this movie made a very noble attempt.  It is obvious, however, when they switch between special effects and the live action actor.  The movements of the special effects Spider-man are much to quick, without gravity, and at times, specifically in some fight sequences, a little to bouncy.  The same can be said for the Green Goblin.  At times though, they are quite stunning. 
The effects are good, but the best parts of the movie are when the characters interact without the use of the effects.  The final showdown is specifically well done, and one of my favorite parts of the movie.  Sam Raimi did a hell of a good job directing this movie, and I am looking forward to a sequel.  8 out of 10.",8,0,0,15 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," if only they didn't speak....
","'The Fast and the Furious' is good when it is both fast and furious.  The problem with the film lies in between.  Well, actually the problem with the film is any time an actor opens their mouth and spouts out some sort of inane dialogue.  Paul Walker delivers his lines with the same deadpan, almost non acting approach that has made Keanu Reeves famous.  His voice sounds the same too.  If I had closed my eyes I would have sworn it was Keanu. I was just waiting for him to spout out the words 'Whoa' or 'Dude'. No such luck however.  Vin Diesel was disappointing as well.  At least acting wise that is.  He does fill in his role well, as he has the right look.  The acting and directing, still, are both horrible.  The parts of the movie with dialogue are horrible.  The parts of the movie with the cars, however, are not.This movie has the absolute best, most high octane and exciting car racing(and chasing)scenes I have ever seen in my life.  The movie excels on this level.  It is a great adrenaline rush just watching it.  I wish the movie was silent with a lot of the car scenes because then we would have had a great action movie.  Unfortunately they bogged it all down by trying to incorporate a plot(a bad one I might add), your standard romances, and you standard double crosses.  It excels on one level, but on the level that makes a movie great, it completely flounders.  It is worth watching to see the car races, especially if you like that sort of thing.  But if you are like me, and you require good acting, good dialogue and a good story, well then you probably won't be that impressed.  5 out of 10.",5,0,1,26 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," uninteresting at best.....
","I really thought 'Traffic' was an excellent film.  It was inventive and extremely interesting.  'Ocean's 11' is the complete opposite.  It is a constant waste of good talent.  The direction is adequate, but it isn't Soderbergh's best work to date.  In fact, it may be the worst thing he has done thus far.  Julia Roberts is under used and her character is of no importance.  She is obviously just in the movie for name sake.  George Clooney is adequate as well, and he and Brad Pitt have excellent chemistry and timing.  Unfortunately the dialogue isn't quite up to par with the talent that they bring to the table.  The only thing in this movie that I loved was the poker game at the beginning of the film with Topher Grace, Joshua Jackson and Holly Marie Combs(I think thats her).  That was the only thing in this film that stood out, and otherwise it was all fairly bland.  A huge disappointment that I couldn't in good conscience recommend.  5 out of 10.",5,0,1,19 December 2001
Schindler's List," left me speechless....
","After having finally seen 'Schindlers List', I can say that it is an absolutely fantastic and emotional experience.  When I was finished watching the film I was left completely speechless.  I couldn't actually find the words to describe it.  I'll give it a try now.    On technical aspects of the movie, everything was solid.  It was a very beautiful film to look at.  Shot in black and white, there was very little color, except at the very end of the movie.  Also, a little color is inserted into the film highlighting the often mentioned girl in the red dress.  It is a beautiful scene, but I am a little unclear as what the symbolism of it actually was.  Even being unclear about it, one theory I saw was that it highlighted her as an individual, and in doing so it creates and individual story, showing that every person there was an individual in and of themselves.  I'm not sure if that is true, but it makes sense.  I often found myself wondering about her fate, so my theory is that Spielberg gave us a person to wonder about, if they had lived or died.  Then we may feel like all the Jewish families who were not positive of the fate of there loved ones until much later on.      There are way too many powerful, and at times sad and disturbing scenes to talk about right now.  Of these scenes, there is the all to disturbing liquidation of the ghetto.  The forced labour camp scenes as well were very disturbing.  They were mostly disturbing because of the head of the camps, Amon Goeth, a very ruthless and awful human being that just seems to shoot people for fun.  Just because.  And its disturbing to watch the disregard with which he does it.      Amon Goeth was played disturbingly by Ralph Fiennes, who should have won an Oscar, but thats neither here nor there.  He was some absolutley disturbing scenes that are just brilliantly played out.  I can point out a few, for instance a scene when he is talking with his Jewish servant(I will not tell you about what)and he does the whole conversation himself. Watching him just change his tone, psychologically, in a matter of seconds is amazing.  Another I remember, is one when he is going to shoot a Jew in the back of the head, and his gun won't work.  Its just a terrifying scene in many ways, but Fiennes plays it in such a way that you can tell he has no morals or cares for Jews, but a blood lust.  Other than that though, his stare, his evil stare showed nothing but hatred, and I don't know how Fiennes did it, but it is a horribly evil stare.  His eyes said everything. This was the highlight performance in the movie.    However, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley put together two great performances as well.  What is amazing between these two is watching their relationship change throughout the movie, until Neeson(as Schindler) is repentent and changed, and really sad he didn't do more, as he felt he could have.  Really, one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film is when Schindler feels he could have done more and that he just didn't do enough. In the film he goes from an opportunist to a true hero, an unselfish one. The gift he gets from the Jews, and his embrace of Itzhak Stern(Kingsley)are truly wonderful and, apparently real moments.  Its hard not to be touched.
    Not surprisingly however, the direction was absolutely brilliant. Spielberg made a movie that was close to his heart and this was a labour of love, and it will stand as his masterpiece.  You can always tell you are watching the hand of a master, and I knew that when I started this film, Spielberg was going to give me something special, and he did. 
    The only mild flaw, most people seem to think, is the small portion of the film at the end that is in color.  It seems a little out of place, and that Spielberg added it on maybe for himself.  And I think he should be allowed to do so after the three hours before hand that were extremely emotional.  I didn't hate the very end like some people though, because to me it was a way to show us that this disaster, the Holocaust, happened only very recently, only fifty years ago(at the time this movie was released). The fact is that some people who lived through this tragedy are still alive, and Spielberg, I feel, uses the end of the film to bridge that generation gap and remind us how recently this all happened.    So finally, all I can say is wow.  Not many movies has left me speechless.  This was one of the most emotional films I may have ever seen, remembering that I ended up crying a bit in three different places.  Usually I might cry once, but not three times.  It is subject matter that isn't taken lightly, and shouldn't.  Everything in its three hours are necessary and brilliant.  Everyone should see this movie once, if for nothing else than an education.  Just a brilliant film.  10 out of 10.",10,9,14,21 August 2001
Mulholland Drive," was it all just a dream.....
","Before I watched this movie I read a review by Roger Ebert who said the best way to explain this movie is to look at it as a dream.  It is a bunch of events that somehow interconnect and yet never make much sense.  So I watched it and I didn't expect it to make much sense.  I expected a fantastic looking film that would be confusing and somewhat frustrating.  It is confusing, but somehow it is never frustrating.  What makes this movie great is the same thing that would make a poem great, and that is this:If one hundred people read a great poem, all of them would have a different interpretation of what it meant.  Well, that goes for this movie.  It isn't frustrating because it is consistent in its surrealism.  From start to finish the images and happenings are all quite bizarre(especially the last half hour).  That is what makes it all so captivating, and the consistency provides each viewer the opportunity to try and piece it together.  You don't have to, but for me it is like a puzzle, and I want to solve it.  I have my own theories as to what it is all about, but I bet whatever you come up with will be completely different.  That is what makes this movie so unique and gripping.  Normally I wouldn't go for a movie like this, but when its this well done you can't help but fall under its spell.  9 out of 10.",9,1,2,9 June 2002
Annie Hall," I guess I just missed something.....
","This movie, for the most part(that is the most part of 90 minutes) wasn't funny.  Woody Allen is quite annoying as Alvie Singer, and after a half hour of his predictable neurotic tendencies I was just getting tired of listening to his voice.  I honestly didn't care about his relationship either, all thought Diane Keaton was respectable playing the title character.  I can appreciate the fragmented time line, the animation and so forth, but Allen just grates on my nerves.  Its certainly nothing I would jump for joy about. If you love it, great, but I can't see why.  5 out of 10.",5,6,13,14 May 2002
The Graduate," not as good as I expected it to be.....
","****CONTAINS SPOILERS****I sat down to watch this movie, and I thought that it was going to be something special.  It started off that way.  Dustin Hoffman is great as confused youth Benjamin Braddock.  His performance is really the only reason I kept on watching this movie.  The best part of this movie is the first forty minutes or so, mostly focusing on Mrs.Robinson(Anne Bancroft) and Ben.  The early scenes which show her confidence and his nervousness and inexperience are funny and honest.  They are perfectly played out and directed.  A memorable scene is Ben getting a hotel room under a fake name, and claiming to have luggage in the car, only to reveal it as a toothbrush.  Hoffman is extremely funny, and is a character you really feel for.  After that, however, the script starts seeming more fragmented, the characters and character development become less important, and everything starts to just happen and all becomes rather silly.  His rash decision, and quick love for Mrs.Robinson's daughter, Elaine, is never developed.  The soundtrack is also repetative, and this becomes quite annoying. 
The last scene in the movie was okay.  What I realize now, however, is how well 'Wayne's World 2' parodies it.  It was an okay movie, but Mrs.Robinson didn't seduce me, all though she tried.  6.5 out of 10.",6,2,5,14 May 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Not usually a fan of Kubrick.......
","I am not personally a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick.  I had a hard time sitting through both '2001' and 'Dr.Strangelove'.  All though, I have only seen both of those films once, I didn't feel that there was enough there for me to have multiple viewings.  So when I sat down to watch this film, I wanted to like it, and surprisingly I did.    First of all, Malcolm McDowell is excellent in this film.  However, Kubrick always gets excellent performances from his actors, and this has never been a problem for me.    More importantly, the pacing of this film was much quicker than most of his other films.  His other works seem to me to have a deliberately slow pace, but with the exception of about twenty or so minutes in the middle of the film, the pacing was excellent.    I won't go into the details of the script.  It was very clever and well done, and had a very circular approach to it that I rather enjoyed.  Plus it was very original back when it was made, and holds that originality until today.  It has standout scenes that I will remember for the rest of my life, and that is always the sign of a fantastic film.  Specifically, I will remember an early scene with the use of Malcolm McDowell doing 'Singing in the Rain'.  Very shocking, and it is hard to shock me at this point because I thought I had seen it all.      So with memorable scenes, a script that tackles many issues, for instance morality and ethics, just to name a couple, this is a film that you should check out at least once.  It wasn't perfect in my opinion, but if I watch it again I may change my mind.  But still, 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,7 August 2001
Stalag 17," did this inspire Hogan's Heroes....
","From what I've seen of Billy Wilder, his movies tend to have well defined characters and a clear course of action.  Sometimes they are funny, and when they are funny, they are funny by virtue of being clever.  As well, the pacing in his movies always seems to be one of a sense of urgency, as if every moment is important.  There is really never meandering and wasted moments.  At least in his best works.  Unfortunately this movie is not one of his best works.  It is just okay. The problem with the movie is that it takes a while to get off the ground and there never really seems to be a sense of urgency and real tension, not until about the last half hour that is(and that saves this movie).  The comedy is more infantile, and mostly produced by a character called Animal. However, Animal comes off as more annoying than funny, and is over the top. A poor directional choice from the usually outstanding Wilder.  It seems that the movie tried to take itself seriously, without ever really doing it. William Holden gives a fine performance, and was really the only character that came off as interesting.  However, he was in another POW movie called 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.  All though the latter isn't a movie that makes the greatest philosophical statement, it is much more entertaining throughout than this movie is.  In all fairness, this is a fairly well directed movie, and if it was directed by John Hughes or Chris Columbus then it might be considered a greater achievement.  As it stands, Wilder did work that was much better than this, so the expectations are high, and it didn't meet them.  Still, the last half hour saves what would have otherwise been a wasted experience. 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,7 June 2002
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his finest...
","I am personally a fan of Alfred Hitchcock films, so my opinion may be a little bias.  Having said that, still, this is a film that anybody that watches movies should check out.      It says much on the morality of peeping into other peoples lives, and if we even have the right to.  The genius of all of that is, is that we too get caught up in these lives that we view from afar.  We view them through the eyes of Stewart, but still, we are never any better.  And we always want to know more.  If that doesn't interest you, however, you can still watch a great story unfold.  A mystery that keeps us guessing until the end, and possibly after the movie ends.  I won't ruin any of that for all of you though.     Hitchcocks direction is excellent.  As with all of his great films, for instance 'The Birds' and 'North by Northwest', the pacing is great, and we never get a chance to get bored.  Excellent, as well, are the performances from the entire cast.  Whats best is the whole world that is created for us, from afar, based on assumptions that are speculations at best.  Hitchcock never does tell us exactly what is going on.  That is best left up to us to decide if what we see and what we are being told that we see are the same thing.    This film is so multifaceted that I really can't describe it all right now, you will have to see it all for yourself.  It has a point that is relevent still, even more so today with the huge success of reality television, and the media lust for celebrity gossip(paparazzi).  Take that away, and still you get a great suspense movie.  We are all voyeurs, and through Stewart's eyes is each and everyone of us peering into the lives of everyone else.  This is as good as Hitchcock gets, and properly earns him the title 'The Master of Suspense'.  Fantastic.  10 out of 10.",10,1,3,12 August 2001
The Birds," mildly outdated, yet still has suspense.....
","I am a fan of most of Hitchcock.  I was pleased when I watched 'The Birds'.  There are many things in this movie that are quite outdated, such as some acting techniques, as well as special effect techniques.  Even with such faults, minor ones if you ask me, Hitchcock manages to create some real suspense that is still effective today.  Specifically in the last half hour of the film.      He creates great suspense with his incredible use of sound effects creating the deafening noises of the birds attacking a house.  What we get to see is the terror the people inside the house feel.  In this whole sequence of events we get an excellent climax.  Plus he gets us very well, not by making things happen, but by putting the thought into our heads that something could happen.    The most ominous parts in this movie are not when the birds attacking, but when Hitchcock frames them gathering.  The attacks are excellent in and of themselves, but its the waiting that creates the suspense.  Its our knowing something that the characters don't that make it exciting, and Hitchcock does a great job of utilizing that here.      Its not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it was very good, and even with some things being outdated, it was still an innovative idea and you should check it out at least once, just to see for yourself.  8 out of 10.",8,0,0,31 July 2001
Rock Star," half way to a good movie....
","Half way through 'Rock Star' I was still enjoying myself.  I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's performance(all though somewhat similar to his character in 'Boogie Nights').  Jennifer Aniston was better than usual as well.  This was the first movie she was in the I didn't see Rachel Green from 'Friends'.  At least she extended herself past that for a change.  After the half way point however, specifically after Wahlberg's first big concert, the movie goes downhill.  It gets boring and repetitive.  It also tries to speak out against the indulgences of the rock and roll industry, mainly sex, drugs and rock n' roll.  During the last fifty minutes or so only one thought kept popping into my head, and that was that I had seen all of this before.  Not only had I seen it all before, but when I saw if the first time it had many things this movie does not:1.Well defined characters2.A smooth flowing story3.Good direction 4.Absolutely stellar acting5.A great script with excellent dialogueThe first time I saw it, it was called 'Almost Famous'.  This movie is nowhere near as good.  Just watch 'Almost Famous' because its really not worth wasting time on 'Rock Star'.  It started out promisingly, but then it degenerates into a bad bad movie.  Disappointed at the end.  5 out of 10.",5,0,1,26 September 2001
