Deja Vu," A film to make you think
","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and enjoyed the way that everything came together at the end. It is true that you can think about it deeply and maybe spot inconsistencies, but they introduce the split timeline theory halfway thru to explain all that away.If you liked this movie then you should see a relatively unknown independent movie called Primer. It is about some guys who invent a time machine and is really nicely put together on a very low budget. The reason being that it doesn't tie up the loose ends so you'll literally spend hours trying to figure out what the hell is (or was) going on.As with this film, if they had tied up the loose ends completely, it would've been dull. At least it makes you think.",7,0,1,14 December 2006
