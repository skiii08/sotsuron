The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," the first time i watched this it was called matrix reloaded
","a perfect example of milking trilogy dry for nothing else but pure profit. we all should have seen that coming when they made the shortest of the three books two 2 hour movies. still though i thought at the very least they would do it with some class or creativity. this movie is exactly the same as matrix reloaded but without the effects. looking for 'the one' to lead the rebellion and give everyone hope? who else can do that but Neo oops i mean Katniss Everdeen and Morpheus' s part is played by Julian more right down to the speeches in the dark under ground. they used the same drab clothing, the same set and everything. only difference is everyone's hair grew back.horrible movie thats best feat is making us all so interested in seeing the last installment just to see how they bounce back from this dramatic tale about absolutely nothing.",3,8,14,10 March 2015
The Equalizer," Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side
","In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.",8,48,62,4 November 2015
The Hateful Eight," People are dishing out way to much hate for the eight
","This is an instant classic Tarantino film. It's like all of his other movies put into one. He also uses mostly actors from his other movies... well even more than the usual. Admittedly this film can start off slow if you are not a Quentin Tarantino fan or don't know how his movies are. As a fan you watch and wait anticipating a good finally and it doesn't disappoint. He seems to cater this movie to the fans of his previous titles and so the haters are out strong on this one.Like Django unchained, this film starts off post civil war but doesn't touch on the black and white topic as much. Still though with Samuel Jackson being a black bounty hunter back in those times has its similarities with Django unchained. You will also see major similarities with Reservoir Dogs, but since they are both great movies and he's only copying himself I don't see a problem with that.As soon as you realize that you are watching a 'who-done-it' western you can just sit back and enjoy and watch the characters unfold.The actors all do an amazing job and although not his best... Quentin Tarantino delivers. I gave it a solid 9 out of 10.",10,16,45,31 December 2015
Life of Pi," If not for the unfair haters this would be the highest rated film on IMDb
","this movie has it all from a great story line to great graphics to great relatively unknown actors. it's to bad that so many people in bad moods have rated it 1/10 just for spite. If you go through the ratings you'll see a solid 9-10 average across the board with the odd hater giving it a 1 but then bragging about it's awesome graphics. sorry but that just gets me mad. almost as bad as all of those English Guys giving Brave heart a 1/10 because they didn't like how they were portrayed in the movie.Any way Life of Pi is one of those movies you want to see again aright after watching it. You get lost in and if you had the chance to see it on the big screen in 3D you feel like you are on that boat.no spoilers and nothing to explain, just watch it if you haven't already.10/10 **********",10,4,8,30 March 2013
American Hustle," America hustled
",America did the hustling on this one. hustling the whole world into thinking this movie was any good and not to mention doing it for 138 freakin minutes.. best picture nomination is a joke. if it won I'd lose the last little bit of respect I have for the Oscars totally. As for Christian Bale and his nomination I found back to be a joke as well. He is usually a good actor but in this role he was average at best. I guess all it takes nowadays to get an Oscar nomination is to have someone strap on a fake pot belly to make you look fat and a beard. Way to go Oscars. There was no real plot and this 'some parts true' story was not worth any thing more then a short story book. let alone all the raves it got.girl from hunger games plays her role really well but still her role is small so save your self the time and headache and don't watch this over rated film.4/10 and thats being generous,4,2,4,24 March 2014
Fargo," average story with exaggerated accents
",first time that I've really differed from the rest of the general consensus on IHDb but I guess there's a first time for everything. I honestly don't know if I watched the same movie as everyone else. I get that its supposed to be a dark humour type of movie but it just wasn't thereWilliam H Macey was a little over the top which I know was what he was casted to do. but he did a bad job doing it and so he just seemed like a c list actor.they threw Steve Bushami in there for some comic relief and called it a movie. I call it an overrated movie I won't watch again. and I'd be offended if I lived in north Dakota at how badly they were represented.I gave it a lenient 4/10,4,0,2,25 April 2013
No Country for Old Men," One scene wrecked the whole movie for everyone
",When I first watched this movie I liked all but one scene which I found took from the movie. I watch the movie unlike most on here that rated Al 1 with zero expectations and was very much so enjoying it until the scene that I hate. I just rewatched the movie now and still can't believe that scene maybe even more so now. And so I feel compelled to write a review. Even searching now I see that even critics criticize this scene for single-handedly ruining the movie.Basically the movie is a showdown between a psycho killer and an average but crafty southern ex vet. They do a very good job executing this to the point where you are literally on the edge of your seat for some parts. Javier Bardem helps this by playing his part masterfully. All actors in this film were good but he takes it to a new level. I'm gonna even call his character one of the best villains in any movie. Now since all of that is perfectly fine just picture when you see a whole movie building up a showdown just to find out that the main character or Good Guy character was gunned down off camera by random Mexicans in a gunfight that they don't even show in the film.It's honestly the worst thing I've ever seen happen to a movie. Talking over with friends they said it actually comes up often in lists such as biggest Wtf moments in movies and that it's the Coen brothers messing with the audience but I think it's much more than that. It seriously ruined this movie. I'm still giving it an 8 for it having my attention up to that point and the actors did amazing jobs. But from that scene on I seriously am not even engaged in the movie.Am I alone on this one?,8,2,2,26 November 2017
Django Unchained," brilliance unchanged
","I love this movie from the first time I watched it and somehow can't stop watching. It is a movie that's you watch the second time and catch things you miss the first time or anything like that in just he's getting better. I even keep laughing at the same parts.its has good action, good comedy, and even a good story line. I love it when Quinton mixes sensitive real life historic events with comedic fiction and his own twists worked well in Inglourious Bastards but this time it truly was his masterpiece.it does touch on the sensitive subject of racism and slavery pretty hard so I understand that touchy people that are given django bad reviews but if only they could watch this movie with an open mind so that they could enjoy it I think the IMDb.COM rating would be well into the 9's.go watch this movie right now. oh and I recommend watching it with a good speakers with lots of bass, the soundtrack in this movie is phenomenal.10/10",10,1,4,18 December 2013
Into the Wild," a disguised B movie with pearl jam in the back ground
",Into the wild should have been right up my alley but it was horrible. It just dragged on with No climax or ups and downs. I love movies with people against the elements or showing nature but ..... it felt like a B list movie the entire time but yet overshadowed by Sean Penn directing it and a few other cameo appearances by other name actors. I really don't know how it got such a high rating on here.I like Eddie Vedder but the whole movie felt like a promotion for an upcoming album or something like that. would not watch again and wouldn't recommend. 3/10 and that's being generous just because I like nature.,3,2,3,18 December 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Watch, enjoy, repeat. Groundhog day meets deja vu with a hint of district 9
","I am surprised that I have never even heard of this movie until now. I would have liked to watch it in theatre but it was enjoyable on the basement TV none the less. Because I had never heard of it and had no idea what it was about, I think I enjoyed it more as the ground hog day stuff caught me by surprise. I don't like giving spoilers and so I will not go in to detail about the movie. But I will say that it is a pretty creative concept and although very similar to ground hog day and deja vu... it is unique in its own way and not your average Sci if war movie.Watch, enjoy, repeat.",10,0,1,1 January 2016
Lucy," a movie based way out side the box, given poor ratings by those who live tightly inside the box with no means to look out side it
","I was very surprised to see such a low rating for this movie. It is a new concept inside a world of remakes and prequels. Not only that but it was done well, clear and thought enough for you to atlas entertain the idea that 'what if this were true'The drug concept was a very good twist on some movies that would have Used no creativity and just had a person born that could use 100% of their brain.I truly have no complaints about this movie but it takes a lot to give my movies a 10 and so I rare it a solid 9. It's a must watch film even if you only watch it once. Also it's a different role for Scarlett Johansson but she handles it well.",9,16,30,7 August 2015
The Martian," It's like Gravity but good
","The Martian, is like gravity in the fact that he's lost in space alone and that it is a space film. Other Than that they couldn't be further apart starting with the fact that the Martian actually has a plot. The humour is good as well, not to much to take away from the seriousness of the movie but enough to lighten the mood and let you relax and enjoy it. In terms of a drama/Sci-fi movie I gave the Martian a 7. It's not to say that it's a bad movie, actually I quite enjoyed it but it's not a movie that I would watch again, I know what happens in it there's no crazy twist. It's a movie that you watch, enjoy and then move on from. 7/10",7,1,4,9 November 2015
