Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Repetitive
","If this movie was created from scratch, I'd give it a 9. However, I've already seen virtually every joke from his TV show, I knew what he was going to do from the start of every skit. There were no new catch phrases or scenes that didn't strike me as being very similar to a scene from his show. It feels like Borat is basically selling out, he is giving up the innovation you could see from episode to episode of the show to a bigger budget film with nicer camera shots, editing etc... One could say that this is simply the evolution of his style, people often use this argument to say that Miles Davis never sold out, but I digress. The movie is funny, but I would recommend it only if you haven't seen/have seen little of Borat.",6,0,2,29 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," not worth watching
","Very close to being a great at times, but overall just lacking in so many areas. Its biggest flaw is that everything that happens is extremely predictable, and it is the kind of movie that relies on twists. The grandfather's death, the business deal, whether she becomes little miss sunshine, whether the flight school thing will work out. That last one you had to at least be somewhat awake to notice Olive was playing with the eye tests, I immediately realized that she's probably gonna give the test to him, he'll probably be colorblind since eye surgery can give you 20/20 vision, and he's probably gonna flip out and start talking again. Basically at any given point in the movie you could pause and summarize the next 15 minutes.",3,12,25,29 January 2007
