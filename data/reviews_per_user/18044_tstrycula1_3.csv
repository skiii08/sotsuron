Black Swan," A Beautiful Work of Art
","Overall, I found this movie to be incomparable. I was very upset that I wasn't able to see this film in theaters due to the exceptional reviews it got, but since I got the chance to see it at my home, I was surprisingly pleased by level of depth this movie was able to reach. To me it was excellent on all levels. It had wonderful music, the screenplay was excellent, it was very dramatic and suspenseful at some points, and you were really able to get in touch with the characters. The performances were superb by each actor and they all filled the screen with such passion and emotion that you could really start to feel for them.Aronofsky did a first-class job with this film and really got the audience to react. The only thing that really bothered me was the level of sexuality in this film. Sure some of it was necessary to thicken the plot, but i do feel they overdid some of it. Other than that, I thought that this film was truly magnificent in a disturbing yet beautiful way.",10,1,3,5 April 2011
Insidious," Nothing you haven't seen before. They tried too hard to make it scary.
","I'm sorry, but honestly, I don't get what all the hype is about! To me, this movie seems so overrated! They were trying way too hard just to scare people, that it left no room for a good story or good acting. I actually think I was laughing more than being scared while watching this movie because of the ridiculous acting. And also, does anyone agree with me when I say the music was absolutely outrageous and over the top. Thats what I meant when I said they were trying too hard to scare the audience. Without the music this movie would be totally hopeless.Not to mention they copied probably 3 to to 4 different movies. You got Poltergeist, with the kid getting lost in some other world and the dad goes in to save him. You got Dead Silence, with the smiling, doll look-a-like people. And you have all those exorcism movies with the demons and the devil thrown in there as well. Also, did anyone notice that the music was extremely similar to that of The Exorcist? Total copycat movie.You get nothing new in this unoriginal and highly overrated movie. I would recommend this film to those who like cheesy teen horror flicks and like to be scared by stupid pop-out moments. To me, it was a very over-hyped movie that will probably be forgotten within the next year. I wouldn't waste my money. And if your still interested in this pathetic excuse of a horror movie, I would wait to rent it on DVD. Overall, it was a Hot Mess! Stay Away!My Rating: 0-10",1,120,218,16 April 2011
Titanic," Without a Doubt an Epic Masterpiece! Absolutely Astonishing!
","This movie touches the hearts of many many Americans to this day. Not only will it stand the test of time, but it will remain in the hearts of many people throughout the world.This movie is so touching and moving that it makes you want to start balling right in front of everyone. Not only that, but it takes you on a thrill ride which will be unforgettable. The acting in this film is absolutely superb and could not have been any better. The casting was selected so perfectly and carefully that it could not have gone wrong. And of course the director, James Cameron, is without a doubt one of the most amazing directors I've ever seen. He manages to make you cry, but at the same time is able to keep your heart racing. Not many directors can pull this off.Another factor in this film which makes it so outstanding is the music. The music is very diverse in different parts of the movie. James Horner did an amazing job with the overall score. It can be either very suspenseful, or very soft and enlightening. And I don't know about you but when Celine Dion starts singing, there is no way that you can keep tears from staying in your eyes.Okay sure this film can make you cry, we know this. But this is one of the only love stories to date to absolutely horrify people. Some of the scenes where the ship is sinking are horrendous. The visual effects are exceptional for a 1990's film. They really do look real and create effects which are shocking to watch.Many people disagree that this is a remarkable movie just because it is not completely factual. Well guess what? Get over it. It was not made to be 100% accurate alright. It was meant to show the deep passion between two lovers and there willingness to save each others lives. For all you haters out there, we all know that you force your horrible opinions about a movie just so that you feel special. I mean who are you trying to kid? I know, you know, and America knows that this is one of the most mesmerizing and astonishing films ever made. This is an honorable movie and deserved each and every award that it got.I cannot tell you how much a cherish this film and all of its glory. It is an absolute necessity for any movie collection and is a landmark and role model for any good film to come. Not very many films will ever top it. If this film does not get your heart racing then you don't have one at all. And if this film does not move you as much as it moved me, then you don't know what a good movie is. It will go down in history as one of those epic movies. One that will never be forgotten. And all the haters, don't worry you'll come to your senses one day. Overall, a complete 10 out of 10. An incomparable masterpiece of epic proportions.",10,5,10,29 May 2011
