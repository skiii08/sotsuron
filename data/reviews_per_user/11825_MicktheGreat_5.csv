Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as the first, but still a great movie...
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I had my reservations before seeing Kill Bill Vol. 1 last year due to the amount of gore, killing, etc. However, after I saw it, I appreciated Kill Bill for its precise wit, unique storyline, vivid cinematography, and incredible music. And I thought that the violence was tolerable because it was done in such an over-the-top, fantastical way.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an entirely different movie. Gone are the one vs. an army battle scenes (the Bride vs. the Crazy 88's) from the first movie and there is little to no gore in this movie (except for at the end of the Bride vs. Elle Driver fight...I'll leave what exactly happens as a surprise if you don't already know...). The musical score and choice of songs are not nearly as impressive as in the first movie. Even the cinematography is not as crisp and uber-cool as the first Kill Bill.However, that does not mean that Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a bad movie--only different from Kill Bill Vol. 1. The storyline in Vol. 2 is much more methodical and the characters are given more depth this time around. And the movie is still full of crisp dialogue and humor (Pei Mei's training of the Bride is one of the funniest scenes from recent memory). Vol. 2 with its slow pace and depth is ultimately a deeper movie than Vol. 1 with its nearly nonstop action and comical gore.Chia Hui Lui (Pei Mei) is absolutely hilarious. Daryl Hannah does very well as the sadistically cruel Elle Driver. And Michael Madsen (a Tarantino mainstay) provides a solid performance as the hick/slob of a killer named Budd. David Carradine is great as Bill. The way Carradine portrays Bill with a calm yet unpredictable demeanor gives the impression that he could go off at any minute. Plus, we get a brief Samuel L. Jackson cameo as Rufus, the organ player.However, Uma Thurman's performance is the best of the movie. She brings an undeniable charisma to the Bride and does just as well as she did in Vol. 1 if not better. I think she deserves a nomination for Best Actress and would be surprised if she wasn't at least considered for a nomination.In the end, it's very hard to compare Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as they are very different. In my humble opinion, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is not as good as the original but is still a great movie worth watching.8 out of 10",8,1,2,16 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Dead is a successful remake on most levels...
","Dawn of the Dead is a remake of Romero's earlier work of the same title. The story basically revolves around a storyline of a zombie epidemic. Fighting for their lives, a group of survivors barricade themselves inside a mall in attempts to stay alive. The group consists of a tough cop (Rhames), a nurse (Polley), a couple (Phifer & Korobkina) expecting a child, a suburbanite (Weber), a mall security guard (Kelly), and a cast of other characters.-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-I felt that this movie worked on most levels. I've seen the Romero original before (although it has been a few years ago) and I thought that this was just as good as the original (if not better...). I thought that the characters portrayed by Rhames and Weber were both done very well as I felt bad for those guys and felt that both of them just wanted to do the right thing. Phifer's character also has a speech in which he tells Rhames his concerns regarding the birth of his child that is briefly moving. The action is intense, the zombies are very bloodthirsty, and the story flows well for the most part.My few complaints are that I thought Polley's character was under-developed. I also felt that there were a few slow spots in the movie that seemed to be there just to waste time. Also, some of the characters (notably the girl with the dog, the young security guard, and the snobby guy with the boat) are extremely annoying and for the most part serve no real purpose in the film.Overall, I was impressed. I typically hate most of the contemporary horror movies (from the last 10 years or so) that seem to have terrible storylines, horrible dialogue, etc. I was pleasantly surprised awhile back with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and I was pleasantly surprised with the new Dawn of the Dead. Hopefully, filmmakers will take a note from these two movies and make GOOD horror movies.7 out of 10",7,0,0,30 March 2004
12 Monkeys," Twelve Monkeys is both interesting and a bit annoying...
","***POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS***I saw Twelve Monkeys last night for the first time all the way through. I had seen bits and pieces of the movie a long time ago but never the whole movie. I have to say that I was intrigued by the movie but was a little disappointed by a few things.First, I thought the acting was basically good. Bruce Willis was superb as James 'Bob' Cole, as he was pretty sympathetic all through the movie. He seemed both willing to go back into the past but unsure of whether or not he could really do anything or if it would even make a difference.Madeline Stowe was good for most of the movie as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist. Yet, I thought her transformation at the end of the movie was a little sudden. She went from being a pure skeptic and psychiatrist to a pure believer and love interest pretty quickly once she went back to Philly without Cole.Brad Pitt was certainly memorable as crazy Jeffrey Goines, but I thought his performance was TOO over-the-top and actually pretty annoying. All of the hand motions and the long, mumbling speeches were a bit tiring. I couldn't help but think that Jeffrey was just a hyperactive version of Tyler Durden (Fight Club) or even David Mills (Seven)--all of whom use hand-gestures to excess.I thought the directing was really good from Terry Gilliam. He made the future look very bleak and the way he shot the insane asylum--with its white lights (so white that the only words that comes to mind are antiseptic or clean...maybe if you see the movie, you'll understand what I mean)--was brilliant as it seemed like an absolute daunting and absurd place.The ending was a little strange too. I think there's about two or three ways you could evaluate how the movie goes. That fact will frustrate those looking for closure, but personally, I like deciding how I think the story was meant to end.Overall, the acting ranged from the great to the annoying but the directing was very good and the story is certainly interesting.I give it a 7/10",7,1,2,19 June 2004
Troy," Good epic movie but NOT the best epic ever...
","Like most people, I've read The Iliad, The Odyssey, and various other mini-plays about the Trojan War. For the most part, I enjoyed these great Greek dramas. So, when I heard that Troy was coming out, I was both anxious to see it and worried that Hollywood would mess it up. Fortunately, Troy succeeds on most levels...not all, but most.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***As far as acting goes, there are a few great performances. Brian Cox is absolutely sinister as Agamemnon and I was genuinely glad to see him die (although it's completely different here than in the traditional Greek stories). Sean Bean (Boromir in Lord of the Rings)was very convincing as the great tactician Odysseus, who has the consummate politician's charisma and leadership skills.However, Eric Bana as Hector and Peter O'Toole as Priam steal the show. Bana makes Hector the most sympathetic character in Troy as he is fighting for his family despite the fact that he disagrees with what Paris and Helen have done. O'Toole as Priam perfectly pulls off the long-time leader who is seeing his city burn around him. I wouldn't be surprised if Bana and O'Toole both got nods for Academy Awards.The rest of the performances were only OK or terrible. Brad Pitt as Achilles and Rose Byrne as Briseis were good but nothing special. Orlando Bloom is OK as Paris (an average performance from Bloom is a big deal following his terrible acting in Pirates of the Caribbean). Diane Kruger as Helen, Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, and Saffron Burrows as Andromache were pretty annoying. Brendan Gleeson was under-used as Menelaus.The fight scenes were good (Hector's death, Achilles' death, and Patroclus' death were all great). However, there were some deaths that bothered me. I don't remember Menelaus dying in the Iliad which happens early on in the film. Priam's death was way too sudden. Agamemnon's death was necessary but I like the classic telling of his death more (where his wife kills him upon his return). The death that bothered me the most was Ajax's death. Not because it wasn't cool but because the mini-play, 'Ajax', is one of my favorites (in it, Ajax goes crazy and kills himself).Overall, I think Troy should be considered a success. The fight scenes, death scenes, and acting are all generally good. The setting is great and it definitely has the 'epic' feel to it. A good epic but certainly not the epic film to end all epic films.8/10 (due to performances by Bana, Bean, O'Toole, and Cox)",7,4,8,15 May 2004
Saw," Good story with some really bad acting...
","*PLOT SPOILERS*Two men wake up in a barren room, chained to pipes, unable to remember exactly how they got there. Adam (Whannell) is a young photographer. Dr. Gordon (Elwes) is a successful physician. Another man lies in the middle of the room in a pool of his own blood apparently from a self-afflicted gunshot wound to the head. Adam & Dr. Gordon soon discover that this is the work of the Jigsaw killer, a murderer who specializes in building elaborate plans for his victims to kill themselves or others. While Adam & Dr. Gordon attempt to escape from the madman's deadly game, Detective Tapp (Glover) and Detective Sing (Leung) search for the Jigsaw killer. Soon, we discover that Adam & Dr. Gordon are somehow connected and no one is as they seem.Whannell co-wrote the story along with director James Wan. The plot of 'Saw' is superb with interesting plot twists, nice shock moments, and is nicely structured. Likewise, Wan does a good job of painting the picture very dark and disturbing. Also, Wan does a fine job of portraying the 'room' as being utterly bleak and seemingly inescapable.However, the acting in 'Saw' is the ultimate downfall of the film. Whannell does a decent job of adding humor to the movie but is not very good in the scenes in which he is intended to show deeper emotions. Elwes is absolutely terrible towards the end of the movie. He completely fails to pull off the movie's most demanding scenes which comes towards the end of the film. Glover and Leung are OK (and they have decent chemistry), but they are both under-used in the story. Potter is nothing special in this movie.Overall, 'Saw' is an excellent story, is directed nicely, has some good twists, and establishes a very disturbing atmosphere. I just wish the acting had been even remotely up to par.GRADE: C",6,1,2,30 October 2004
