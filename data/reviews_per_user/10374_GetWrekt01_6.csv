Scarface," The World Is Yours!
","Now I may be a biased fan of the 80's over the top crime drama and action stuff, but I'll give you this as straight as possible: Scarface is up there as one of the best movies that came out of the 80s. It had everything from cocaine cowboys to Brian De Palma's way of showing violence. From Tony Montana's brash, overconfident personality to Robert Loggia and Michele Pffeifer's beautiful, lively acting.Al Pacino really contradicted himself over here with the Antonio Montana character, compared to his other prominent role: Don Michael Corleone. And it really shows how much work he has put under his acting and accent to get things right. He has his own way of bringing life to a middle-aged cuban spic who most people wouldn't bat an eye on if it weren't for Pacino himself.This movie also does the action sequences the right way instead of relying it all on CGI. The lighting is perfect and really sets the mood for the 80s. The music is fabulous and it is written by none other than the great Giorgio Moroder himself! No wonder that every time someone hears the intro tune, they instantly feel like taking over the world.A very worthy 3 hour watch in my opinion. Also if you liked this movie, you might like The Untouchables as well",10,0,0,31 March 2020
The Lion King," Ah yes, 2019, when you can't make movies without them being about a political statement
","Good CGI, horrendous direction, pointless scenes and rambles about feminism and women empowerment in what's supposed to be a movie for children, abbreviated songs, butchered characters, no service to nostalgia and debatably bad voice acting.",1,2,4,22 April 2020
The Untouchables," Never stop fighting till the fight is done!
","Brian De Palma's best piece of work, this movie. I'm a huge fan of the movie Scarface, Palma's other movie and for me to say that this movie even tops Scarface is saying something. Brilliant masterpiece is what this movie is!This movie not only captures the grittiness and corruption of Chicago of that era, it captures the people's emotions and their behavior pretty precisely. We barely see any screen time for Al Capone (De Niro) here and yet, within 5 minutes of starting, we're explained how powerful he really is and it would require a piece of work of a man to bring him down. Only brilliant storytelling and direction will give you that.Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Charles Smith were absolutely brilliant in this movie. If I go too deep I might end up spoiling some fun but all I can say is they played all their roles nicely.There is a long suspense right around the ending of the movie which convinced me to rate this movie as highly as I can. I've almost never felt such suspense from a movie of its time before and it really got to me.",10,0,0,1 April 2020
Joker," One of the best films of the last few decades, no less
","Joker is one of the few movies of this time that I went to see in person, and boy was it worth it. No other crime film has given me such goosebumps that Joker has given me. And no other film ever will. I don't care what wannabe movie critics like Peter Bradshaw say about this film, because they're wrong and sold out.This movie tackles the degeneracy of our society in such a bold manner that it leaves people shocked. If I had to explain someone about dark humor with a movie, I'd suggest them this. And as a cherry on top, this was a very low budget film. Instead of the usual circus party CGI graphics we see from the cinematic universe of comic films, this movie uses traditional tricks like powerful color grading and what not.I vehemently stand against anyone who thinks this movie is anything short of a masterpiece. A must watch, this is",10,3,4,20 April 2020
1408," Rated lower than it deserves to be
","This movie is innovative. It pretty much delves into psychological and existential horror while also containing contemporary horror elements.If you put yourself in the character's shoes, you will quickly realize why it's such a fearful experience. At first, most of the encounters will seem like everything is being staged by the hotel staff but as time goes by, stuff gets crazier... To the point that one might start to question what's real and what isn't. Some people like to disect this movie for having 'crappy' or 'weird' vfx or whatever but I disagree, I believe they were intentional.
The jumpscares in this movie are well timed and feel liked well earned, unlike most modern horror films.
The hype this movie sets up for room 1408 does simply not disappoint. A must watch horror film IMO!",9,1,1,31 May 2020
The Godfather," You straightened my brother out?
","What an absolutely marvelous movie! Ford Coppola is truly an amazing director, and so are the entire cast of The Godfather. If it weren't for the second film of this franchise, and also Goodfellas, I would've undoubtedly dubbed this as the best crime drama of all time.The movie starts out showing the full and yet uncorrupted Corleone family, with Don Vito Corleone as the head of the family, Sonny as the hot headed underboss, Tom Hagen as the Consigliere, Fredo as the weak brother who is something between a soldier and a capo and Michael, the youngest of them all who doesn't want to walk along the path of his father. Soon enough though, internal trust issues arise in the family as multiple assasination attempts are carried out on a few family members, of which, Michael takes revenge for.In an attempt to hide Michael from the ensuing drama, he is sent back to Sicily, where he finds new life and tries to start from there. But his short yet dark history follows him and he is left with nothing after going through all the things he has gone through. The innocent, brave war hero Michael is now willing to take on his father's shoes and bring the Corleone family its lost muscle and respect.In this movie, we see many things that current movie crews can learn from. From using lighting to cover heavy make-up, to an absolute masterful execution of a Juxtaposition right around the end, this movie has it all. All 3 hours of it is a beautiful learning and enjoyable experience.Also just saying, if you're watching this with kids, there's just a few seconds of upper-body nudity here from Simonetta Stefanelli and that's about it. So if your kid is above 14-15 it should be fine.",10,0,0,31 March 2020
