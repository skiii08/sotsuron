Scarface," Al Pacino's greatest film, an American epic.
",Scarface is Al Pacino's greatest work as an actor.  His portrayal of a Cuban refugee turned drug cartel leader is intense and believeable.  The movie epitomizes the dream of the American underworld and Tony Montana is a Gatsby like figure that is unsatisfied by the attainment of his dream that he pursued so long and hard for.  Michelle Pfiefer as Elvira Pacino's eventual wife and Steven Bauer as Manny his lifelong friend just add to Pacino's rivetting performance.  This movie has more memorable scenes than I could dare to recall.  The passion and realness of Pacino's acting are unparalleled.,10,0,0,30 April 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Are you going to bark all day little doggie, or are you going to bite.
","Reservoir Dogs is by far Quentin Tarantino's greatest movie blowing Pulp Fiction, a great movie, out of the water.  The acting by Michael Madson, Harvey Kietel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Joe Tierney and others helped add to the witty dialogue and realistic drama.  The action was first rate, not some 200 million dollar explosion scene, but real shoot em up fight it out action with a little torture (the cops ear) that make movies great.  A great story, great acting, and a great soundtrack make this one of the top two or three movies of the decade.",10,0,1,30 April 1999
Goodfellas," The greatest gangster movie of all time.
","GoodFellas is the greatest gangster movie of all time because it does not pander to the audience like the Godfather's which glamorize the gangsters and the gangster lifestyle without showing a more realistic mob. GoodFellas is based on a true story which makes it more effective.  The acting by Dinero, Pesci, and Liota are extremely realistic and are supported by great supporting actresses and actors like Paul Sorvino and Debbie Mazar.  The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and helps set the scenes of the greatest gangster movie of all time.",10,0,0,30 April 1999
