Source Code," Unrealistic / Unscientific, but still good
","Source Code is a science-fiction mystery film set in modern day Chicago and a government facility in an unknown place. This is one of those movies that will make you think hard trying to figure out what is reality and what isn't. Unless you pay close attention to what's happening, you can easily get confused and lost. It is thus somewhat comparable to The Matrix and Inception. As you might expect, the sci-fi aspect of this film was totally ridiculous, unrealistic and unscientific. The mystery or whodunit aspect could've been more suspenseful and could've used some twists and turns to keep you guessing. If you watch carefully, it is fairly obvious near the beginning of the movie who the bomber was. Overall, this is an above average sci-fi film that is worth watching.",6,3,4,7 January 2014
World War Z," Disappointing
","I gave this a 6/10, which means it's okay but not something I really want to watch a second time. There is one major and two minor problems with WWZ. First, the first 25 minutes of the film is almost unwatchable because the editors kept switching the camera angles every one or two seconds during the action sequences. It makes your head spin trying to follow the action. That's the major problem. Second, the zombies move too fast. They move so fast you can't really get a good look at any of them. I'm used to the slow-moving ones that you see on The Walking Dead. That to me seems more realistic. Third, there's a little too much CGI. It's not as overused like in The Hobbit or 2012, but those action scenes in Israel definitely did not feel real. Overall, this film was disappointing. It's something worth paying a couple dollars for to rent, but buying the DVD or the Blu-ray would be a waste of money.",6,0,2,13 September 2013
The Way Back," Amazing journey but did this really happen?
","It is amazing that this group of people walked so far, first through Siberia during winter, then the Gobi desert, and finally the Himalayas. And the things they had to eat and drink along the way to survive like muddy water. I felt the part about crossing the Himalayas was rushed at the end. The movie spent so much time showing their travels in Siberia and the desert, but so little time showing how they crossed the Himalayas. It would seem to me that crossing the Himalayas would've been the most difficult part. This movie could've easily been stretched out to 2.5 hours.The movie claims to be inspired by real events, but there seems to be questions about whether the book it was based on was accurate. Also, the cover photo for this movie shows Colin Farrel with the desert in the background. Ahh ... this is extremely misleading because (**SPOILER**) his character was only in the first half of the movie and never actually made it to the desert.",7,2,3,28 April 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Nice adventure but disappointing
","Since there are already a thousand reviews for this, let me get right to the point. The first half of this movie is a bit silly and childish, but things get more serious and suspenseful in the second half as the movie begins to resemble the LOTR trilogy movies more. Despite the inconsistency, this is a fun adventure that introduces younger versions of Bilbo, Gandalf, Saruman, and Gollum. The action scenes are incredible if you like CGI, especially the sequence in the mountain, but they are not believable unless you suspend your belief in reality. My final thought is that this movie doesn't make the same emotional impact as the LOTR trilogy and thus is not something you want to watch more than once. This movie goes in the once-is-enough category. And it doesn't make me want to watch the second Hobbit movie coming out this year.",6,1,3,24 March 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," First half great, second half not
","Finally spent the time to watch this from beginning to end. I thought the first half of Vol. 1 was great, especially the scenes at Vernita Green's house and at the hospital. So far, so good. Everything was believable and within the confines of reality. However, Vol. 1 really took a turn for the worse once the scene shifted to Japan. It began with the animation sequence which lasted for several minutes. It was several minutes too long. Should've just used some real actors. But what was really disappointing was the whole battle against the 50 to 100 stooges of O-Ren Ishii. That's when the movie became no longer believable. Are we really supposed to believe that one person can take out 50-100 guys? I'm pretty sure even Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against those odds. And all the gravity-defying martial arts stuff was ridiculous too. Therefore, I give this a 7 out of 10. Solid movie that's entertaining enough to make me want to watch Vol. 2, but the animation and the unrealistic fights were a turnoff.",7,0,3,30 August 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting film based on a book filled with disinformation
","Watching this film has been on my to do list for quite some time, but the long 2.5-hour length of the film kept me away until recently. Despite the length, the film was compelling and kept me interested to the end. It starts off as just a plain vanilla crime thriller, but it gets interesting near the middle when the theory regarding Leonardo Da Vinci, Jesus, and Mary Magdalene is explained. It gets even better in the latter parts of the film which have a few plot twists, even though the final revelation at the end was very predictable. It was basically what I was thinking before the halfway point of the film. So basically the film gets better as it moves along.Unfortunately, some critical historical info in Brown's book, some of which are also discussed in this film, are wrong. For example, Opus Dei is nothing like how it is portrayed by Brown. Although this film is thought-provoking, I would encourage anyone who watches this film to watch or read The Da Vinci Deception (2005) afterwards to prevent your mind from getting brainwashed. It's currently on Amazon Prime Video. The Da Vinci Deception basically explains in detail the things that Dan Brown got wrong and debunks the theory presented by him.Some films are just pure fiction/fantasy and meant for entertainment, but one would hope that a book/film on a religious topic would present the historical background correctly. If it had, I would give this film a 7, but I'll knock it down to a 6 because of all the disinformation.",6,0,0,9 April 2016
