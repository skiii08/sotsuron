Requiem for a Dream," Watchable but overrated
","This is just 'Panic in Needle Park' with indulgent camera effects and---with the exception of Ellen Burstyn---sub-par acting. Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto mail it in. And when Marlon Wayans is on the screen I just keep thinking 'White Chicks'. And I didn't even see that movie. As for the goofy camera tricks, I just wished, as I always do with these goofy 'wow, I'm SO drugged out' gimmicks, I could find drugs that work like that! In the pantheon of drug movies (and I've seen quite a few) this one falls down near the bottom. If you want a depressing, drug addled, waste of 100 minutes, do it the old fashioned way, drop acid and listen to some Pink Floyd.",5,0,1,17 December 2008
