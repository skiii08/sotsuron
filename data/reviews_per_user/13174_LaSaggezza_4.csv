Angels & Demons," Same cake, different icing.
","First, it's okay entertainment and Tom Hanks is great as usual and the film does follow the novel quite well. The problem is that the cat is out of the bag. What I mean is the film simply can't generate the tension nor the surprizes as did the Da Vinci Code because you already know what to expect from having seen the Da Vinci code. Lastly, the plot lacks the sharp twists and turns which one might expect from a fast moving mystery.Don't get me wrong, it's good entertainment on its own, but you won't be as riveted as you might have been by the Da Vinci code.",7,0,0,5 May 2019
The Irishman," The Lonesome Dove of Mob Movies
","Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Welker White, Anna Paquin, Jesse Plemons, Dascha Polanco, Kathrine Narducci to name just a few of the top notch line-up of performers at their very, very best in this tour of the golden age of the Italian dominated underworld' power struggle for union control and government corruption.The story reminded me of a three decade long chronology of 'New York Daily News' (et. al.) gangster hit headlines over those years. (And 'the News' would splash the front page with crime scene photos back then!)In a nutshell, Di Niro, as aged mob enforcer Frank Sheeran, narrates a chronology of the life and times during this 'golden age' of corruption as he and his boss, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) embark on a road trip from Philadelphia to Detroit to attend Bufalino brother's wedding while taking care of business, and one major problem, along the way.That's the good news. The bad news is that this is an 'epic' in every sense of the word. The best way I can describe it would be as the 'Lonesome Dove' of gangster movies. Although riveting in every way, it seems endless and is well the the feature length class as 'Ben Hur', 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Doctor Zhivago', but without a carefully placed intermission. It needs one.Every moment, every flashback vignette is worth waiting for, but there are seemingly an endless number of moments. Plan on watching it over two evenings. Also, keep your mouse pointer near the 'pause button'. When characters are introduced, a too quick 'who's who' description pops up letting you know 'who the guy is'.Overall, this is a classic and probably one of Martin Scorsese's very best .",9,1,4,28 November 2019
Bird Box," Apocalypses on the Cheap
","'Bird Box' is the latest 'apocalypse on the cheap' Sci-fi and some of these features have top-draw names. Robert Duval has a small role in 'The Road'. This apocalypse is caused by a fire which spreads over the globe. There's no reason given, no aliens, no biological accidents. It leaves one with the burning question of 'why'. 'How it Ends', with Forest Whitaker, has a global power failure apocalypse. So you'll know how it ends but never shocked to know why it ends. It just does. And a similar apocalypse sends Ellen Page and Rachel Wood 'Into the Forest' but again, the nagging question of why will stick with you like moss on a tree. 'Bird Box' is different in that the apocalypse is caused by some alien lifeform, but you can't see them. How financially convenient. To be fair, all four above mentioned come off as reasonably good entertainment mainly due to the really good performances by the top draw names. Bird Box goes a step further having two: Sandra Bullock playing the central role and John Malkovich whose performance creates the underlying tension which carries through the rest of this feature.Oddly enough, the problem isn't the stories, dialogues, performances, or anything else which can turn an entertaining feature into a real disaster. What is obvious in all of these 'apocalypses with no name' is that the lion's shares of the budgets of these productions were spent on the well known top-notch names and not a dime on a really good down to earth understandable, imaginative, tangible apocalypses. To put this in context, take the popular series 'The Walking Dead'. Although not one of the original first season cast could be considered well-known box office draws, (to say the least), this production's budget spared no expense on zombies. Smart! How can anyone pass up a prime time Zombie-Apocalypse-action-soap-opera? Now, the costume designers for TWD had to create really convincing looking HD worthy zombies requiring many extras. Else, had they gone cheap it would have turned the TWD into a high-definition one season laugher. The result of betting on herds of zombies over the famous living: the series really took off. The budget for the whos, whats and whys was well balanced. Make no bones about it.The moral of the story: balancing the budget and feeding the fears of the viewing audience along the way really matters.So 'Bird Box' is okay. You might not watch it twice, but having Bullock and Malkovich set the pace makes it certainly worth watching at least once.",6,0,3,6 January 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," One intermission was not enough
","Well, the individual performances won't disappoint. What this 'production' needed, though, was at least four more intermissions.",3,3,7,14 October 2018
