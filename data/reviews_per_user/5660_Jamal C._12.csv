Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie, but still a disappointment.
","Anybody who's anybody knows that Star Wars is a great, timeless, American classic. With a terrific story and one one of the best movies ever made. I am a huge fan of the Star Wars Trilogy and when this came out, I was really excited, i couldnt wait to see it.      But I was greatly disappointed in it. First and foremost, Jar Jar Binks completely weakened the movie, the idea to have this movie aimed at children was a very bad one, Jar Jar would gone better in his own movie, instead of ruining this one, that was my biggest concern. Whoever the genius was that came up with this one is, he needs to be fired, i mean completely, no more movies for him except children's. You wanna make a kids movie, go ahead, have fun, but do you have to ruin one of the greatest stories ever?!?!
     Also, the boy who played young Skywalker is all wrong. I mean, you just cant have the future Darth Vader be played by someone with a 'matter-of-fact' voice tone all the time. no offense to the kid, but whoever hired him needs some help, i mean come on! Off the top of my head, i'm sure Mason Gamble could play him better, he's a fine young actor.     They almost turned Star Wars into a happy jolly story, what happened to the drive between good and evil, it just went right out the window, I blame most of that on Jar Jar.     Okay, enough about the bad stuff, now lets go to the upsides of this movie. First of all, Liam Neeson saved this movie from totally bombing, he was absolutely wonderful. The only thing that made this movie REALLY great and a whole lot more interesting. He subtly shows the greatness of his character, and does a great job of it.      The story wasn't all that bad either, i mean it could have been a lot better, but it still gets its purpose down, and shows a great beginning to the epic tale. But as I said before, cross out Jar Jar, and the movie is twice as good.     Darth Maul also has a cool character and helped bring bring the really great Star Wars characters to the screen that we know so well, such as Han Solo, Chewey, and so many others. I must say his villain was not as good as he could have been, I think if you give him some authority, he has a more powerful and important character, but they still did a good job of making him the main enemy here. So the movie was not a total loss... they salvaged what they could and made a good but scratchy beginning to the Star Wars saga. I am hoping for a better second movie.",6,0,1,2 November 1999
Se7en," DISH MOVIE WASH SHOOO SHTUCKING SHWEET!!!!!
","This was an AWESOME movie... Morgan Freeman is an awesome actor, but Kevin Spacey really steals the show, he plays John Doe so perfectly, and the ending really is the best part of this movie, because Kevin Spacey a great actor and can play psychos so well (but he showed us he can play losers just as well in A.B.). The entire movie leads up to the extraordinarily surprising ending, even though the director wants you to think that the ending is going to be really big, and still surprises you. Spacey's half hour part in the movie is one of the best endings i've ever seen. I say again... DISH MOVIE WASH SOHOOO SHTUCKING SHWEET!!!!!",10,0,0,13 October 1999
L.A. Confidential," ...in a word...OUTSTANDING
","This is an amazing movie. First of all the cast, Kevin Spacey is one of the great actors of our time, and Danny DeVito is also a great actor. They play each part perfectly.      One thing that makes this movie interesting characters and how very different they are. Danny DeVito's character Sid Hudgens the tabloid reporter is very interesting to watch. He just plays him so well, you would think he really is a tabloid reporter. Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Russel Crowe, and Guy Pierce also have very interesting characters.
     Basically, there are these 3 cops, with their own unique opinion of what justice is. They are constantly conflicting with each other until one of them crosses the line... ratting on a fellow officer. Meanwhile, mob boss Mickey Cohen is imprisoned. But organized crime is still very much around. And in their spare time they are working on this case, along with a truck load of suspicious characters. And in a nearby cafe massicre. A well known friend and fellow officer is killed. Coincidence? I think not. Thats enough for now, i'll leave you itching to see the movie. The main thing about this movie that was intrigeing is the complex plot. It gives you many sub-plots to handle in the beginning of the movie and they all seem to come together (in an utterly amazing way!) by the end.
     To me, corruption in anything makes me want to see that movie, you will never figure this one out, at least not until the near end of the movie. It was brilliantly acted by Kim Basinger who definitely deserved that award.     I love a movie that makes me think, and this one REALLY makes me think. I also like a well written script to confuse me at first, but then make a lot of sense to me, getting me really involved in the movie. When you see this one in the video store, don't pass it by, rent it! Trust me it is truly an amazing movie.",10,0,1,18 October 1999
American Beauty," Kevin Spacey is a master.
","I just saw this movie, and I must say, that it is an awesome movie. Kevin Spacey is a terrific actor and showed us in this movie just how versatile he is, moving away from what he is known for.
     The movie is very dark, and strange. It starts out very weird. The plot moves quickly and gets you to identify with all of the characters. Even though all the characters are total psychos!!!      Hmmmmm... how do I explain what this movie is about, it's not very easy. Well, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a total loser. He is trying to find meaning in his life. And says he is reborn when he meets a cheerleader who is a good friend of his daughter, Jeanie. Anette Benning plays Lester's wife. A real-estate agent who really isn't helping Lester's low self-esteem.      Spacey plays Lester Burnham perfectly. That's all there is to it. He is an awesome actor. Anette Benning plays her character perfectly also. A great cast in a great movie with a great story with humor, drama, and just plain immoral insanity. You just can't go wrong.     I give this movie 5 stars, it's just that good. There is no doubt in my mind this will get nominated for best picture, best actor (Spacey rules), Best actress (Benning is amazing). And best original screenplay (i don't even need to explain why).     Just go see it... you wont be disappointed, it's a great movie.",10,0,0,15 October 1999
American Beauty," Jamal, aka Jamal the Camel, Jamal 3, Jamal 4, Jimmy the Wolf
","This was one of the best movies i've ever seen. Kevin Spacey plays the part of Lester Burnham to perfection, I can't see anyone else better than him for that part. Bening was brilliant and very convincing. I see a Best Actor and a Best Actress Oscar nomination in this movie's future. Not to mention best picture. It was one of the most twisted movies i've ever seen... but it was GREAT! You know you've got a great comedy when you can make people laugh. You know you've got a great drama when you can make people cry. And if you can make people crack up and get teary-eyed in the same movie, you know you've got a masterpiece. Wow... way to go Alan Ball!!!!!!!",10,0,0,11 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," My Favorite... EVER
","I recommended this movie to a friend and he loved it, he thought it was the BEST, the ABSOLUTE BEST. I couldn't agree more. For an independent, low budget movie (any movies for that matter)... It rocks!!! The plot just keeps on twisting and turning like an immensely intense roller coaster ride. The director and writer are geniuses, total geniuses.      The ending was an absolute surprise... if you can figure it out, you're a psychic. The ending was perfectly done and makes you just as surprised as if you saw a ghost, it's totally beyond belief.     The actors... Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, and Benitio Del Toro make up a tale of five criminals who somehow get stuck in a police lineup, together!!! Sounds interesting, doesn't it. That, my friend, is only the beginning, this movie goes off in a direction never to be expected. And gives you a totally surprising conclusion that hits you hard enough to make your eyeballs pop straight out of your head.
     You should see this movie, it's that simple. No matter what kind of movies you like. If you have already seen it, recommend it to everyone you know, I know I have. Trust me, the movie is unbelievably great.",10,0,1,14 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," Kevin Spacey is THE BEST Actor of our time.
","This was one of the greatest movies of all time. It not being somewhere in the top 50 on AFI's list of the top 100 blows my mind, I am also somewhat disappointed that it is not in the top 5 on the best 250 movies here on IMDB.com!!! I could go through this movie and tell you every aspect of it, and why every scene was brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and brilliantly put together. But do I really need to? This is one of the greatest actors, in one of the greatest movies of all time. When I look to criticise a movie, look at many different aspects, one of the first ones I look at... the script. I must have seen somewhere around 450 movies, and this is among the best scripts i've ever seen in my life. The first three times I saw this movie, i was dumbfounded... whoa, that was great. The ending was perfectly put together, i've seen the movie about 15 times, and every time I see the end I get goosebumps.",10,0,1,11 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Heart-pounding intensity.
","Steven Spielberg triumphs again. This was an amazing movie. The intensity of this movie is amazing, with cinematography so realistic you feel like you are really there. There are some scenes which are disgusting, but show the horror of war like no other movie has, this was the best war movie I have ever seen.
     Tom Hanks is marvelous as is Tom Sizemore. They make a great team and give the movie even more intensity because of the friendship of the two, and both of them in a war together shows the bond that grows in war, and you feel their pain as well as the soldiers that die in the movie.     It is moving the way this picture is put together and shows that war is more of a surreal nightmare than it is a glorious way to show your patriotism. I think this movie definitely deserved the Best Picture award and is worth going to see, don't miss it. It is an excellent movie.",10,0,0,21 November 1999
For Love of the Game," Best baseball movie ever.
","Kevin Costner has been dubbed the king of all baseball movies, and very simply, because he is. He just does it so well, it's obvious that he enjoys playing the baseball player/fanatic, and does it very well. I know because I am one. I am a HUGE baseball fan and a HUGE movie fan. When baseball movies come along, it is always a treat.      This one was very different from other movies, it all takes place during one baseball game, and unlike other baseball movies, it is about the last game of the season, and Kevin's team has no shot at the playoffs, so this game does not mean anything. But to Costner, it does. It is nearing the end of his career, and his life is falling apart, his team is thinking about trading him, his arm is beginning to fail him, and his girlfriend is leaving him. Needless to say it isn't his best day to go out and pitch. But he still does, he badly wants to.      Costner is having flashbacks all throughout the game; in the dugout, on the field, before the game. We slowly get his whole life, and the father into the game we get, the farther into his life we get up to this point. His main focus is on his girlfriend just about to leave him, she tells him this just before the game.      This movie is very different and much better than other baseball movies because never have they only focused on one baseball game, usually it is the whole season, or just the playoffs or world series. It is just a useless game for the team. That is what makes this movie so much better than other baseball movies, it is hard to really capture the real intensity of baseball when you show each game in five or six minutes. It's just not possible, this is a two hour movie, practically in real time. This really portrays the way you get into a baseball game. Never have I heard the audience clap in the theater, as if they were at the game, until I saw this movie.     Somehow, the movie is able to show the Chapel's entire life and career, while at the same time showing this one, very important game. This has all the elements to be a great movie, and it is, I enjoyed this movie very much. Baseball fan or not, you will still like it.",9,1,2,21 November 1999
The Insider," One of the year's best.
","The Insider is a terrific movie. The story is absolutely gripping and interesting. It runs a long 170 minutes, but stick through it and you'll be happy. It starts out slow and very vague, but it sets up for an explosive one hour climax that will have you on the edge of your seat.
     The performances really were this movie's strong side. Al Pacino gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. And Russell Crowe plays his part very well, giving a powerful performance, his character develops and unfolds very slowly in the story and he couldn't have done a better job on it.      The first hour or so would give you the impression of a story with a simple, easy plot. But as you think the plot is about to take a rest and the movie will simmer down, it explodes in your face, you will be surprised at the way it turns into a movie more about the corruption of our justice system and the major flaw impossible to break. Rather than JUST a conspiracy on the verge of being exposed. Al Pacino's character changes dramatically as does Russell Crowe's. And both actors do an excellent job.
     Although it is loosely based on the truth, it runs unlike other true stories. Some movies try to grab the audience and to become surprised that this could actually be true, and only that. The Insider does that, as well as producing a fine piece of dramatic cinema. Go see it while you can, you won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,14 November 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," An excellent movie.
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of my all time favorite movies. It tells the story about one man's journey through prison and his struggle to find a purpose in his life, in prison he meets a new good friend , Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully accused of viciously murdering his wife.
     In a way this movie is two movies rapped up into one. It not only tells the unfortunate story of a normal man in prison, and what he does there. But it also is about a man rightfully accused of murder, and does his time in prison, we find he only committed this crime as a young, stupid kid, and is full of regret, he has become wise in prison and becomes rehabilitated for normal life, he is no longer a danger to society.      His struggle to be free and search for meaning in his life is his main passion. He is convinced that hope can destroy a man, hope is not a good thing. While Andy believes that hope is the only friend one can have in prison, in solitary, hope is the only way out. Andy acts as Red's mentor and guides him to the right way of thinking. This all leads up to Andy's need of Red, and finally one of the most moving endings in movie history.
     Tim Robbins is excellent in the movie. He gives the performance of his life and plays Andy Dufresne to perfection. Morgan Freeman is also very good. It shows the ups and downs in Red's life, and the way of life for a prison inmate. While also showing the meaning of hope and how hope can keep a man's faith, and as a result, himself, alive. Don't miss this, you really need to see this movie several times to completely appreciate it. But even seeing it once is heart-warming enough.",9,0,0,21 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," A very creepy movie, with a gut wrenching ending
","I just saw this movie and I must say it was very good. I had seen it by accident because the people at the theater carted us before we could see House on Haunted Hill, on the way out of the theater we saw saw some friends there and we decided to see The Sixth Sense because thats what they were going to see. And boy was I glad that happened, because I was so surprised to see this movie, I didnt think it would be that good at all.
     The entire movie was very well put together, and the ending will absolutely blow you away. I doubt you'll be able to figure it out. But some parts, leading up to the end, got dull and bland at times, and a few scenes were not as good as they could have been... but don't get me wrong, there were some times that were quite freaky. But trust me, the end makes watching the whole thing worthwhile. This is a great movie, it's ending gives you a message that you will freak you out about death. The end is completely unexpected, it wont even cross your mind until the very end of the movie. Go see it, its worth the $7.50!",8,0,0,2 November 1999
