United 93," Ingenious...
","That was a really strong and powerful movie,with deep meanings and millions of messages,about how to survive and how to react in situations like this. i don't want to talk about how real is this movie,because nobody found that plane,but this has no importance,the main thing is that this is so possible to occur!The movie is great and I'm ready to watch it again.The actors made their best. if you don't know what really happened on September 11 and which planes crashed and which did not,you wont understand this movie...just try to read something about to can catch and keep in your mind all the information! I enjoyed this movie...",8,3,5,31 October 2008
Kick-Ass," Have i missed something?
","Pure stupid clear American humor.LOT OF VIOLENCE. Judging this rating i thought i would face a great sweet comedy or at least a captivating action movie. THE beginning of the film haven't promised anything so as the end did. NOTHING TO LEARN,nothing to enjoy,or even to laugh,just an usual stupid American comedy with useless and wasteful elements. OK.Acting was good,LOVED THE GIRL.But what about sense? what about the meaning of the movie? isn't it supposed to teach something,to underline some human qualities some happenings that will guide us somehow through life? TOO MUCH VIOLENCE.I really really didn't love it at all.And i don't recommend it to kids,cause is psychological strong adapted,so parents take your children to a simple beautiful animation,don't destroy your kids innocence with such movies. OK from me its 5 cause the actors did a good job,but for the plot and idea is 0. And i simply don't understand how it comes that people loved this film,have i missed something and there is a hidden purpose?",5,11,26,9 May 2010
The Green Mile," Not as impressed
","Actually this movie disappointed me.Not as much but it did.Reading other reviews and comments,promised too much.I was captured at the beginning,the first half of the film,made my time fly up. Im a huge fan of realistic movies,and those based on true stories,i also adore Shawshank Redemption,but this one contains too much fiction,OR ITS FICTIVE FANTASTIC SCI-FI MOVIE,or its a realistic,simple drama or thriller. I didn't like at all the idea with the mouse,its a silly one,i also didn't like the final 'eternal life',and also the screenplay,it could have been done much much better,the words haven't stolen my heart,too easy and empty for a strong person. ...i enjoyed it,the film is so positive,but i don't recommend it for those who are looking for a BREAKHEART MOVIE. 7 out of 10,but ...its because i love HAnks.",7,1,3,27 March 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Unpredictable!
","when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!",10,2,4,8 March 2009
