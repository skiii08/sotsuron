Mission: Impossible III," Utterly cliché but watchable
","In my opinion you can't expect unexpected originality from movies like MI:3.Because the events that might occur in these kind of movies are more-or-less obvious.There is a hero and a world waited to be saved. And mostly it is not probable that hero will fail.I watched MI:3 with this feelings but I didn't expect this kind of ordinariness from this movie.Plot is a parade of clichés.An agent who finds love and wants to settle down ,a wife who doesn't know anything about her husbands profession , a mole who is leaking information out of top secret organization , a bad guy who starts a personal vendetta against the hero.There is even goofy brother-in-law and a sarcastic scientist.I expect much more from J.J Abrams because of the originality and quality of his TV-series Lost.But despite of its ordinariness I didn't get bored while I was watching it thanks to good acting,top of the line visual effects,thunderingly sound effects and historical and exotic places like Vatican and China.From my point of view the cast MI:3 can compete with the first MI and of course better than the second MI.Tom Cruise successfully did what he had been doing since the beginning of the MI series.He runs , jumps, evades , shoots , kills and cries. Philip Seymour Hoffman draws a good bad man portrait with his calm attitudes and charismatic voice. Maggie Q -despite her lack of experience- makes the scenes more colorful with her elegance.Yet another good performance from Jonathan Rhys Meyers who can be seen in the Woody Allen movie Match Point.Laurence Fishburne,Billy Crudup and Ving Rhames are all performed a steady performance that improves movies watch-ability.But I didn't like the performances of Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan. In my opinion Keri Russell doesn't fit the role and Michelle Monaghan simply acts bad.In conclusion , From my point of view MI:3 is not a good movie as it should be.Because the cast and the creative brain behind this project is well above the average Hollywood production has.But watching MI:3 is like watching the home-video of your childhood.You know what is going to be next but this can't hold you back from watching it.",6,0,2,8 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Behind the fancy dialogs
","Behind the fancy dialogs and fascinating cast ,unfortunately there is an ordinary vengeance story.Despite of the wrong place,wrong time clichÃ© , you don't need to be movie freak to figure out Slevin is the little boy at the beginning of the film. The only thing that may surprise you is the partnership between Mr. Goodkat and Slevin which can also predicted. The scriptwriters should have noticed the ordinariness of the plot and decided to sweeten it with clever-riddled like dialogs.I admit that at the beginning I enjoyed the way the dialogs progress but after I while I find myself saying enough already.The best thing about this movie is its fascinating cast.Morgan Freeman,Sir Ben Kingsley,Bruce Willis,Josh Hartnett and Lucy Lui.All of them did a very good job.Especially I really enjoy seeing Ben Kingsley because I haven't watched one of his movies since the performed in Sexy Beast in year 2000.Also I think Paul McGuigan did a satisfying job.And I almost forgot the music of the movie is also quite entertaining.To wrap up, Lucky Number Slevin is nothing more than a typical vengeance movie and if you don't have better things to do give it change not for the plot but for the stars in its cast.",5,56,112,27 April 2006
Two for the Money," one word MEDIOCRE
","When I entered to the cinema,I didn't have a slightest clue about this movie.I haven't knew its plot , I haven't watched its trailer and I haven't heard its name.Right before the start I said to myself 'How bad can it be? at least there is Al Pacino' and after the movie I said to myself 'Yeah it is a waste of time but at least I watched Al Pacino'. The presence of Al Pacino is the only thing this movie can offer. Everything else is mediocre.Plot is mediocre,directing is mediocre,rest of the cast is mediocre and list goes on.About 15 minutes after the start you are able to fill the blanks and the remaining 105 minutes is just a waste of time.",5,1,2,5 May 2006
Inside Man," Pay strict attention to Jodie Foster
","A noble thief , a bank , a so-called perfect plan , a negotiator who negotiate with the thieves to save his career, another negotiator who negotiate with the police/negotiator to get what her client wants inside the bank. Superficially this is about everything the film is trying to tell. But deep down it is trying to scratch much more serious issues like racism , holocaust , 9/11 syndrome ,the influence of gangster rappers and violent video games to young ones of the society.But from my point of view the film cannot executes these ideas as well as Dalton Russell executes the heist.Nevertheless the remaining part of the film is exciting and easy to watch thanks to Spike Lee.I personally love the chaotic rush when Dalton release all of the hostages and the remaining members of his gang out of the bank.The fascinating cast of Inside Man makes the film more enjoyable.Clive Owen is really in the character of Dalton Russell.After his monologue , I was convinced that this Dalton guy is not like any other thief and has a greater motive beside money.Denzel Washington also did a real good job but Jodie Foster is sensational.What an acting.From my point of view she is the best thing in this movie.Normally I'm not really fond of Jodie Foster but she is really sensational.I would never think that she is capable of acting so mysteriously.The eerie smile of hers explains the powerful position of her character.The way she is acting convinced you that her character is at the top of the game.Great acting.Final thing; about the perfect plan.I don't think it is a perfect plan.I think it is just a simple plan. Dress everyone with the same clothes , release all of them at the same time out of the bank and hide behind the walls.It sounds too simple to work or this simplicity makes it work.",7,1,2,4 May 2006
