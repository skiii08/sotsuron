Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Best of the best competition
","That's where we are at with this movie, Rathbone, Brett, are the Holmes of old. Great actors, but now we have another strong group, in a well crafted flick. It was entertaining throughout, which made up for the little glitches. I read Doyle as a child, everything in the library; before Los Angeles got over 6-7 TV channels. I also enjoyed the great Rathbone flicks and all of the later productions, which were lacking until Brett on PBS. The first flick was choppy, but it was the fun in spots. They put in work and made this one a sweet ride. They even tied in the most famous scene of all times from the old classics. What I liked most is how they highlighted the social quirks, of Sherlock and MyCroft alike. This movie was the rebirth of Holmes. Great job. Who is the best Holmes?",10,0,1,17 June 2012
