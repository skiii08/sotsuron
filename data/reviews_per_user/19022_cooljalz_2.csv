Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A game of wit and the wittier
","A certain Mr. Guy Ritchie has a flair and repute for producing pure gems dipped in English culture. This time he has exceeded his previous attempts by keeping the amount of the 'dip' to the just 'perfect level' with getting all the elements required to make an awesome and may be the perfect movie. Take a bow Mr. Ritchie!!! Excellent acting, perfect suspense(an integral part of Sherlock Holmes, traditional English dialogues filled with chivalry and sarcasm that make them so enjoyable, awesome action and maybe the best climax sequence for any movie of the 21st century till date make a game of shadows the perfect action comedy. the exotic sets and props bring the Victorian Era alive with all of its pomp and flair. Robert Downey Jr. continues from where he left and has excelled the previous one. Jude Law is always dependable and shares more screen space which was needed for a friend rather than a sidekick. The support cast,especially Paul Anderson as Sebastian Moran,is up to the job. But it is Jared Harris as Prof. James Moriarty who brings in the ruthlessness as the antagonist and his encounters with Sherlock,especially the climax,which lights up the movie. Even if you see it a number of times the entertainment value won't decrease a bit. Go grab a ticket and watch the movie ASAP, its just too good to miss.",9,1,2,2 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," What an outstanding Movie!!!!!!!! This 'Mission' is 'Impossible' to resist!!!!
","Believe me action or stunts in any form can't get any better than this. Ghost Protocol takes us to witness the zenith of human physical potential. This is the best movie in action genre I have ever seen and it might remain at the top of my list for my life. It is a relentless thrill packed ride which kept me on the edge of my seat and finally when it ended I seriously wanted Tom Cruise to pull out one last stunt in the closing credits. The plot is seemingly straight throughout the movie but Brian Bird has kept some mind boggling twists which makes it one hell of a movie!! Every aspect of this movie is simply awesome, be it bird's direction, use of globally important locations as proving grounds for 'nothing is impossible', acting, dialogues,cutting edge technology and what not. Bird has brought in his imagination enriched by his experience in animation to give some everlasting scenes. Be it the opening sequence, the prison scene ,the burj al arab daredevilry, the missile scene or the climax which is a masterclass. It will be a sin to reveal any detail of the plot because watching it on screen is once in a lifetime experience which I don't want any of you guys to get spoiled. Everyone involved in this movie has given their 100%. But to leave it without mentioning the super cool cast will be silly. Paula Patton has essayed her role of the tough yet loving agent wonderfully. Simon Pegg, just brilliant in bringing comic reliefs in the serious missions. Jeremy Renner, as the mysterious and complicated analyst is just superb, in fact his character is the best written one. Michael Nyquist as the bad guy has that cool menace around him and he proves himself as the unbeatable, smart, savvy villain with ease. But I thought he was given less screen space. There should have been more one on one scenes with the hero. Anil Kapoor has a very small role but has performed it well. But the real star is Tom. He has given everything in his body for this role. He has really cheated death in this one. I feel pity on those guys who compare Shah Rukh Khan with him. Its Nonsense!!! Tom Cruise has comeback with a bang after the failure of Knight and Day and has shown that when it comes to versatility he is the best. He has portrayed a fragile, vulnerable, more human but relentless, master strategist and having never say die attitude Ethan Hunt which is why it makes this character more believable and more likable. Brian Bird also deserves some credit for that. So to summarize, I am giving it 9/10 just because of some minor flaws and also because I thought some human and weapon action should have replaced some technical scenes when it comes to the mission. The action takes the cake for being the show-stealer. But Tom Cruise, I bow several times to you for the amazing for doing this impossible mission because after all difficult is just a walk in the park for you!!!!!!!",9,3,8,19 December 2011
