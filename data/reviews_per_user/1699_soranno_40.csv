The Blair Witch Project," This is supposed to be a horror film?!
","The trailers for this mega disappointment of a horror film inaccurately made it seem like it was going to be the scariest film ever made. When I finally got my long awaited chance to see the film, I kept looking at the nearest clock waiting for something really scary to happen and at other times just wondering when the truly annoying adventures of its three leading characters would end. I think Jabba The Hutt in 'Star Wars' scared me more than this film. It's basically just a tireless exercise in testing the viewer's patience in which a certain word that begins with the letter 'f' takes up about half of the inept dialogue and many things go by unexplained thus confusing the viewer. It all has to do with some legend about some being called the 'Blair Witch' that may or may not exist but long before the time this film ends the viewer probably won't care anymore anyway if it exists. I know I certainly didn't. The shaky camera movements throughout the documentary filmed style mess are especially tedious. One of the poorest excuses for a horror film ever.",Null,5,9,30 October 2002
Alien 3," Not as good as 'Aliens' but still fun
","Renegade space woman Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on a distant planet that is also a penal colony for dirty and illiterate space men. As if she didn't have enough problems trying to get these guys off her back, she soon finds out that an army of flesh eating alien predators have survived the crash as well. It gets worse. Ripley eventually learns that she will soon give birth to an alien offspring. The usual, not for all tastes levels of sci-fi gore take up much of the film which still manages to be a little entertaining. Its predecessor, 'Aliens' is better, though.",Null,1,2,21 October 2002
Antz," An Unlikely But Still Funny Role For Woody Allen
","Casting Woody Allen as the leading voice in an animated film about ants may sound unlikely but it works surprisingly well in this 1998 Dreamworks release. Allen provides the voice of Z, an industrious, if sometimes inept worker ant who is willing to do anything to impress the ant colony's princess, Bala, even despite the fact that she is being forced into marrying the colony's tyrannical General Mandible. Some mild profanity and crude humor explains the film's PG rating but if that can be ignored, this ranks as a fine family oriented film. Its release coincided with that of Walt Disney Pictures similar animated release 'A Bug's Life' and both films met with mixed results. However, I feel that both films were equally good.",Null,0,0,23 October 2002
Chinatown," Suspense at its finest
","'Chinatown' is, without a doubt, one of the greatest suspense/thriller/mystery films ever made. Jack Nicholson shines in his role as Jake Gittes, a private investigation detective whose latest case involves him dealing with a hotbed of corruption and scandal involving the rich and famous in Los Angeles during the 1930's. The entire supporting cast is excellent and make this film a high mark in 1970's and suspense film cinema. In 1990, there was a sequel to this film called 'The Two Jakes' in which Nicholson reprised his role but that one really pales in comparison to this original classic.",Null,1,3,10 November 2002
As Good as It Gets," Jack Nicholson's Greatest Performance
","Films that poke fun at Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and/or other disorders and disabilities usually offend me but this 1997 Tristar Pictures release tends to make the viewer laugh with but never at Jack Nicholson's endearing performance as Melvin Udall, a man who suffers from OCD and has a bad attitude because of it taking his annoyances out on everybody and everything that crosses his path. He eats at the same restaurant every day (even insisting to always eat at the same table and bring his own utensils) and always insists to be served by the same waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). Everybody in the restaurant and throughout much of the city can't stand him but Carol learns to get used to Melvin's sometimes snooty ways. It's by her surprising levels of tolerance for him as well as his having to temporarily watch his neighbor's (Greg Kinnear) dog that begin to inspire Melvin to consider taking a new lease on life and letting every major person in his life join in. Great performances all around. The two leads won Academy Awards (Nicholson for Best Actor and Hunt for Best Actress) for their performances.",Null,1,1,25 October 2002
Citizen Kane," A great film but its so called position as 'the greatest film ever made' is exaggerated
","Orson Welles has his greatest film and portrayal with this legendary 1941 RKO release, a film that is generally considered by many to be the greatest film ever made. It is a great film but I wouldn't go that far in my ways of praising it. This film is loosely based on the life and times of William Randolph Hearst (who originally threatened to sue Welles and RKO if they dared to release this film which he had considered to be insulting). Welles portrays a fictional composite of Hearst. He also supplies the writing and directing for this excellent character study. In my view, several films ranging from 'Gone With The Wind' to 'The Godfather' surpass this one in levels of greatness but this film certainly deserves a very high level of respect.",Null,0,2,10 November 2002
Amistad," Notable Only For Anthony Hopkins' Performance
","Set in 1839, 'Amistad' follows the exploits of the slave ship, Amistad and its African captives who are being brought to America to be sold as slaves. Not wanting to be owned and not wanting their freedom to be taken away, they gradually seize control of the ship. Their acts of bloody mutiny soon land them all in court where a property attorney (Matthew McConaughey) stands in their defense. Anthony Hopkins, portraying former U.S. President turned courtroom offical John Quincy Adams gives a very credible performance and is the only bright spot in an overlong film which sometimes isn't even accurate. It's not too bad but it's not the best film to recommend if you want a quality history lesson.",Null,1,3,22 October 2002
Beauty and the Beast," The worst film I've ever seen
","Walt Disney Pictures has had numerous animated trifles ever since the death of Walt Disney and this 1991 release is their worst one of all. I had seen it during its original theatrical run and even then I voted it the worst film I've ever seen. Almost eleven years later no film I've seen since has been worse and I don't expect any other film to take away this film's 'honor.' The lead character Belle is extremely whiny and insecure as well as unsure of herself. The Beast is actually more scary when he's not trying to be scary. His dialogue is mostly ridiculous. The 'enchanted' objects get increasingly annoying as the film progresses. The so called bad guys are shallow and 'Be Our Guest' has to be the most annoying song I've ever heard in an animated film. The other songs are no better. Film is only about an hour and a half long but it seems much longer at times and long before it was actually over I knew that I wanted it to end much sooner. Once again, my worst picture of 1991, my worst picutre of Walt Disney Pictures history, my worst picture of animated films history and my worst picture of all time.",Null,1,14,27 October 2002
Batman Returns," The best installment of a mostly bad series
","Michael Keaton's second outing as Batman is an improvement over his first but that's mainly because you don't get to see much of him. The title character is considerably secondary and actually has little crucial screen time when opposed to the appearances and plots of this next group of villains which include Danny DeVito (under heavy makeup) as The Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. These two are appropriately cast and make the best series villains. If given a choice between this series' four films, see this one and completely ignore the other three.",Null,0,1,27 October 2002
Chicken Run," Nice computer animation but this comedy could've been much funnier
","After the hilarious success of the computer animated comedies 'Toy Story', 'Antz', 'A Bug's Life' and 'Toy Story 2', it seems as though the humor in computer animated films is beginning to run dry here. The animation in 'Chicken Run' is excellent and the use of an all star cast to provide major voice roles throughout the film is also a plus but this film is usually kind of boring when it is compared to the aforementioned films. It sounds amusing at first but a severe lack of genuine laughs make it a huge letdown in the comedy and storyline departments.",Null,0,2,10 November 2002
Catch-22," Dark comedy satire at its best
","The ever talented Alan Arkin strikes again. 'Catch-22' ranks among his all time best films. It's a hilarious dark satire about an American World War II soldier (Arkin) who hopes to escape from the pressures and insanities of the combat front lines. He devises a scheme to have himself grounded as crazy so he can leave the war. However, his plan may backfire due to the so called 'catch-22' law. Arkin gives a hilarious performance as the harried soldier and he is supported by a huge all star supporting cast who all turn in equally good performances.",Null,16,24,9 November 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Paul Newman And Robert Redford Make An Excellent Team
","Any film that would put Paul Newman and Robert Redford together may sound miscast but the results have twice proven to be pure box office magic. In their first teaming, Newman and Redford portray the two legendary outlaws whose many adventures during the early 1900's are sometimes comedic, sometimes dramatic and sometimes dangerous. This late 1960's classic was one of the earliest examples of the enjoyable modern day buddy films. The chemistry between Newman and Redford was so successful that four years later, they made another film together 'The Sting' which was an Academy Award winner for Best Picture. However, this film was nominated for Best Picture too setting a new precedent for film duo teamings.",Null,1,4,5 November 2002
The Bodyguard," Protect any viewers from having to watch this film
","Kevin Costner seems to be very concerned with making each new film that he does as completely different from the one before it as possible and with this one, this is how he follows up on the much stronger film, 'JFK.' Costner is wasted in the title role and Whitney Houston costars to some level of OK effect but this film is much better noted for Houston's songs than anything else. If you want to see the talented singer Houston make a better attempt to establish herself as an actress, see 'Waiting To Exhale' instead.",Null,1,5,2 November 2002
The Best Years of Our Lives," A strange disappointment considering the talent involved
","How could a cast including Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo and Gladys George under William Wyler's direction and Samuel Goldwyn's producing (through RKO) result in a film like this? It was its year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture but my film tastes generally prefer the delightful and far better holiday fantasy 'It's A Wonderful Life' which was also nominated for Best Picture that same year (1946).",Null,1,10,28 October 2002
The Caine Mutiny," Humphrey Bogart Is Good As Always But The Film Is Not
","After 'The African Queen' the quality of Humphrey Bogart's last film vehicles began to slip when compared to his earlier successes and this 1954 Columbia Pictures release is no exception. It starts out trying to be like 'Mutiny On The Bounty' but later evolves into a World War II sea adventure/courtroom drama. Bogart, as always, delivers a good portrayal and he saves this film from being a complete waste.",Null,1,6,6 November 2002
The Color of Money," A bad shot
","This 1986 Touchstone release is a sequel to 'The Hustler', a film that was never all that good to begin with. Paul Newman reprises his role (badly) as expert pool playing hustler Fast Eddie Felsen. Eddie had been out of the pool halls for many years but he makes a comeback in order to teach some ropes to a rising young pool shark (Tom Cruise, who's once again miscast). It's actually hard to tell whether or not this film is actually better or worse than its predecessor.",Null,0,2,11 November 2002
Cast Away," About as entertaining as watching paint dry
","(CONTAINS SPOILERS)This could've been a good idea for a film but it suffers from an abundance of total silence. For quite a portion of the film, we hear nothing except the waves softly crashing upon the shore as we follow the 'adventures' of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee who survives a plane crash and washes ashore on a small island in the South Pacific where he stays for several years before finally being found. However, the viewer may have a hard time staying awake by this time. It would be nice if something, anything crucial would happen during that time on the island as Hanks' portrayal is practically completely reduced to pure pantomime and grunts. It won't ever reach the heights of such strong Hanks vehicles as 'Forrest Gump.'",Null,0,0,9 November 2002
Aliens," Very gory and very action packed
","So far, I have never seen the original film in this series, 'Alien' but since each film in this series sort of connects to tell one really long story, I consider myself caught up on the saga of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). This time out, Ripley awakens from a hibernation that lasted over 50 years to take on the mother alien and the other aliens at her nest. There's certainly plenty of gore, if you like to kind of thing, to keep the viewer interested and this film stands as an action packed epic and so far the best film in the series.",Null,0,0,21 October 2002
Casualties of War," OK but pales in comparison to many stronger films about the subject
","Director Brian DePalma attempts to continue the vogue started by fellow directors Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick when it comes to making a quality film about the conflicts of the Vietnam War. DePalma succeeds but only moderately as his example is nowhere near as strong as the examples turned in by the aforementioned men. Michael J. Fox has a good rare dramatic role as an army private who, along with his commanding officer (Sean Penn), tries to cover up a young Vietnamese woman's brutal murder. Conflicts erupt and the film turns out being more of a character study than a war film and that may be one of the problems. That would prove that the title may be slightly misleading.",Null,0,3,9 November 2002
Caddyshack," Comedy at its raunchiest
","'Caddyshack' is the best one out of the many, many rehashes of the gross and raunchy kind of humor from 'National Lampoon's Animal House.' There's big laughs aplenty in this tale of a young country club/golf course caddy (Michael O'Keefe) who is struggling to earn a college scholarship and the many odd and vulgar characters he encounters along the way that may ruin his chances. Former TV comedian Chevy Chase carries the film with one of his best film roles (improving considerably on the weak 'Foul Play') and Bill Murray as a crazy drug addled groundskeeper who's obssessed with nailing a pesky gopher supplies many of the film's funniest and raunchiest moments especially the classic 'chocolate bar in the swimming pool' scene. The entire cast is absolutely hilarious. One of the best comedies of the 1980's and certainly the funniest golf film ever.",Null,1,2,6 November 2002
A Bug's Life," An amusing animated fantasy for all ages
","Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and 'A Bug's Life', their follow up to the hugely successful 'Toy Story' ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, 'Antz', 'A Bug's Life' suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as 'Antz.' The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some 'warrior' bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make 'Toy Story' an animated classic.",Null,22,26,5 November 2002
Annie Hall," Woody Allen At His Hilarious Best
","'Annie Hall' deserves to be Woody Allen's best remembered film. It is a shining example of comic brillance. When it coes to writing, directing and starring in light comedies about middle aged and neurotic New Yorkers facing midlife crises and desperately trying to make sense of it all, nobody does it better than Allen. This 1977 United Artists release won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Picture while costar Diane Keaton was voted Best Actress and Allen was voted Best Director. Several future stars including Jeff Goldblum and Beverly D'Angelo make early and noticable film bit appearances here. A highly recommended character study comedy even if you are not especially a fan of Allen's work. This one ranks high above all of his other films.",Null,1,2,23 October 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Stanley Kubrick's Best Film
","Cult director Stanley Kubrick scores his greatest success with this still controversial 1971 Warner Brothers release. It's a lengthy and extremely violent character study about a young man named Alex (Malcolm McDowell). He leads a punk biker gang in Britain and amuses himself and his gang members by going on nightly orgies of rape and murder. His mind gives him the impression that he can not function whatsoever if he does not torture and kill people on a regular basis. Alex is finally busted when he is found guilty of bludgeoning a young girl to death with a large phallus art sculpture. Sent to prison, he is soon picked up as a potential guinea pig for a rehabilitation experiment that just might take those evil thoughts out of his mind. However, the results of the experiment go awry and Alex begins to show some rather unpredictable behavior changes. Not for all tastes and may be way too violent for others (it was originally rated X) but if that can be tolerated and if you're looking for a fine showcase from a masterful director, then 'A Clockwork Orange' is just the film.",Null,0,1,11 November 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," William Holden's Greatest Role
",This 1957 Columbia Pictures release is more than a classic. It's a masterpiece. One of the very finest ones out of all the World War II films over the years and certainly the greatest performance for the legendary William Holden. He portrays an escaped POW who leads a small American troop into a stealth mission to destroy an enemy bridge. Gripping action and suspense are featured throughout the lengthy but excellent film.,Null,1,3,5 November 2002
Army of Darkness," Not enough laughs but plenty of action
","This film usually describes itself as more of a comedy than anything else but the humor is practically nonexistent when opposed to the incredible action scenes and great special effects. It makes up for its lack of humor with an abundance of action. This third installment in director Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' series once again features Bruce Campbell as the brave but dense Ash. This time out, an evil magical book transports Ash back to medieval times where he must do battle with several Dark Knight foes before he can return back to his own time. As usual with these kinds of films, there's enough gore to keep fans of that genre interested.",Null,1,2,25 October 2002
Con Air," An action packed thriller
","Nicolas Cage recovers from the letdown that he suffered from 'The Rock' with a strong action hero lead in this 1997 Touchstone release. The genre gets a twist here. Cage's character is actually a criminal but he gradually tries to turn himself into a hero when upon getting paroled and boarding a criminal infested plane back home, the plane is hijacked by a psychopath (John Malkovich). Just like he did in 'In The Line Of Fire', Malkovich handles portraying a sinister villain to great effect and Cage can really deliver when the right scripts and roles come along. Genuine action, suspense and thrills abound in this film that ranks as one of Cage's very best.",Null,3,6,14 December 2002
Carrie," Be careful who you pick on
","Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a bashful and at times rather clumsy teenaged girl who is forever being picked on and humiliated by her peers. She is also constantly being hassled by her overprotective mother (Piper Laurie). When her high school's prom comes along and her peers actually make her a prom queen, Carrie begins to realize that she may be liked after all. However, it all turns out to be a set up as her peers have positioned a bucket of blood above the stage and release it to pour all over her. For a few seconds, everybody except Carrie enjoys a good laugh at her expense but at this point, Carrie decides that it's time to finally let out years of pent up rage and not being able to stand up for herself so she does so....with very deadly results. Vintage blood and guts horror thriller from the late 1970's and a faithful adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling novel of the same name.",Null,1,1,9 November 2002
Any Given Sunday," A Good Film But Al Pacino Is Too Miscast To Make It Great
","'Any Given Sunday' is a lengthy and mostly satisfactory football drama epic. It is given several strong performances by the likes of Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, and Jamie Foxx while several other familiar film and TV faces as well as popular football personalities contribute costarring or bit parts. Foxx is the main focus of the film giving a strong dramatic portrayal as a disgrutnled young quarterback who gets into frequent spats with the team's veteran coach (Al Pacino). The only sour note of an otherwise fine film is in the performance of the usually great Pacino who just isn't entirely believable as a football team coach. Don't leave it on the sidelines but there are some better (and more appropriately cast) football films of various genres out there.",Null,0,0,23 October 2002
Ben-Hur," MGM's triumphant swan song in its dominance of Hollywood
","The massive success of this 1959 MGM release came with a downside. It was with this film that the studio's thirty-five year long dominance of the Hollywood scene came to an abrupt end. The full reasons for this are a Hollywood mystery. With this film, the studio certainly had a very hard act to follow either way. Charlton Heston is superb in the title role and offers another example of why he could always be depended on to make a religious epic film a grand piece of entertainment. Film is especially noted by many for its incredible chariot race sequence. One of the very last classics of the Hollywood studio system.",Null,1,2,28 October 2002
Bull Durham," Almost as bad as 'Field Of Dreams'
",Kevin Costner's first entry into his so called 'baseball trilogy' (followed by 'Field Of Dreams' and 'For Love Of The Game') is the best one but that doesn't really mean that it's necessarily good. Costner portrays a veteran baseball catcher who helps a newcomer (Tim Robbins) learn the ropes. The film also involves Susan Sarandon as a baseball groupie whose reputation of sleeping with one player every season leads her to pursue Robbins and Costner as her next conquests in that 'field.' Not nearly as funny as it should be but at least it's better than the overly sappy baseball fantasy 'Field Of Dreams' which was released the following year.,Null,1,4,5 November 2002
Cinderella," Another example of animated boredom from Walt Disney Pictures
","The truly best years of animation production at Walt Disney Pictures were while Walt Disney was alive but the horribly dismal results of this film gives an indication of how really bad it is over there today. There's just not much to keep 'Cinderella' going in levels of interest as it is just an animated rehash of a story that has been filmed and written way too many times. This film's only highlight and mild levels of amusement comes from Gus and Jaq, Cinderella's two pet mice (these Walt Disney Pictures fairy tale adaptations usually add a couple of new characters in an effort to be more interesting and original). They provide this film's very few good moments with their antics.",Null,1,9,10 November 2002
Casino," Robert DeNiro Triumphs Again
","Robert DeNiro has yet another great role in this 1995 Universal release. He portrays Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's. He gets married to a smart mouthed and money driven casino hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and makes a longtime friend named Nicky (Joe Pesci) his business partner in casino operations and dealings. Nicky is very defensive of Sam and would do anything to help him make money and stay in business. He especially doesn't mind beating bloody pulps out of people who refuse to cooperate with their demands. Sam is a little more restrained and only really cares about making money so he disapproves of Nicky's highly volatile behavior on several occasions. Meanwhile, Ginger just can't seem to leave her days of greed behind and forms an alliance with Nicky and other high rollers in a quest to help her get a huge share of the casino business profits. It's a lengthy film with an abundance of graphic mob violence, drug use, sexual content and some rather colorful profanity but it still ranks as a very high point in recent cinema and a very fitting follow up to 'Goodfellas.' Director Martin Scorsese follows up on the 'Cape Fear' and 'The Age Of Innocence' fiascos with a film that finds him very much back in his signature element, the epic crime drama. Nicholas Pileggi, the man who wrote the novel 'Wiseguys' that eventually became the film 'Goodfellas' once again adapts his novelization stories into film form and just like 'Goodfellas', this film is a dramatized and fictionalized account that's modeled after a true story.",Null,1,1,9 November 2002
Aladdin," The scenes without the Genie and Iago are the slow ones
","After making me vote their animated version of 'Beauty And The Beast' the previous year as 'the worst film that I have ever seen', Walt Disney Pictures follows up on that flop with their animated version of 'Aladdin.' 'Aladdin' was a little known fairy tale before the old mouse house popularized it. The story has to deal with the decisions that have to be reached by various characters. There's Aladdin, a young streetwise beggar who has to steal food from the marketplace in order to survive. There's Princess Jasmine who has to find herself a permanent suitor before her next birthday and there's Jafar, a wicked royal vizier who is obsessed with his ambitions to become sultan. These three characters eventually come together and it's not an entirely pretty sight. However, all of this is secondary when compared to the hilarious genie whom Aladdin and Jafar both fight for the ownership of and then there's Iago, Jafar's hilariously smart aleck parrot sidekick. These two characters are the highest points in what a basically just a minor improvement over 'Beauty And The Beast.' As for the rest of it, the songs and other supporting characters are a little weak.",Null,2,5,20 October 2002
Braveheart," One Of Mel Gibson's Best Films
","Now that Mel Gibson has finally finished what I like to call his 'unsuccessfully going out of character' trilogy ('Forever Young', 'The Man Without A Face', 'Maverick'), I can finally go back to seeing him as the action man that I know him best for. The time, setting and overall plot are considerably different here but the result is a film that stands out as one of Gibson's finest hours (or three hours in the case of its running time). He portrays William Wallace, a brave and determined Scotsman who leads a rather small but equally determined Scottish troop in a revolt against the English oppressors. Very bloody and brutal at times but if one can stay strong and patient through it all, it's well worth it. Gibson also seved as this film's director and producer (a Paramount film released through Gibson's Icon production company) and does well on all counts. The first of Gibson's ultra violent and lengthy war epics trilogy (followed by 'The Patriot' and 'We Were Soldiers').",Null,1,3,4 November 2002
The Breakfast Club," Talky and nothing more
","Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall portray five of the most annoying young characters ever put together in a film.

That annoying song by Simple Minds, 'Don't You Forget About Me' doesn't help either.",Null,2,6,4 November 2002
Born on the Fourth of July," A fitting follow up to 'Platoon'
","Oliver Stone, one of the most talented and inventive film makers of recent Hollywood history had previously captured the brutalities of the Vietnam War in his critically acclaimed 1986 film 'Platoon' which won an Academy Award for the year's Best Picture. Three years later, Stone followed up on that success with a film that is good and was also nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award but pales in comparison to 'Platoon.' Tom Cruise follows up on his 'Rain Man' success with another incredible true life portrayal. This time, he's Ron Kovic, a soldier in the Vietnam War who became paralyzed and later became a controversial activist figure against the war. More of a character study biopic than a war film. Some great performances but those who are looking for the thrills of 'Platoon' may be disappointed.",Null,0,1,4 November 2002
Back to the Future," Horrid time traveling fantasy comedy
","Michael J. Fox portrays Marty McFly, a teenager who, with the help of crazy scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travels back in time to 1955 and must ensure that his then teenaged parents get together romantically. I found this first installment of a trilogy to be so bad that I didn't even want to see its two sequels.",Null,1,4,26 October 2002
The Birds," Alfred Hitchcock's Best Film
",Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock scores his greatest one out of his many triumphs with this 1963 Universal release. Hitchcock's usual mix of horror and laughs works extremely well in this 'what if' tale about what would happen if the birds took over society. The results are often too frightening for small children so don't let them confuse this film for something else. A true standout classic in Hollywood's otherwise most lackluster decade.,Null,1,2,30 October 2002
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton's Leading Performance Is Hilarious
","After flops like 'Johnny Dangerously' and 'Gung Ho', Michael Keaton's once promising film career seemed to be on the verge of being completely dead but it was suddenly revived with the success of this 1988 Warner Brothers release. Keaton is hilarious and has his best role in this bizarre fantasy comedy about a recently deceased couple (Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin) who really disapprove of the new couple (Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones) that has bought their house. A manic poltergeist (Keaton) offers to help the spirits rid their beloved house of these newcomers since they can't scare them themselves. A bad situation quickly turns worse through a series of incidents blending horror and fantasy with comedy. The special effects are impressive and come at a nearly nonstop pace. Keaton is the real star here portraying the title role with some of the best comic moments of 1980's films.",Null,0,1,28 October 2002
All the President's Men," A gripping and accurate account of the infamous Watergate scandal
","The most amazing thing about this landmark of a suspense film is that by the time I saw it, I knew how it would turn out, it being about the Watergate scandal after all, but I was still hooked on its suspense. Now if that's not excellent suspenseful film making, then I don't know what is. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman give top notch performances as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two Washington Post reporters who were the lead investigators of the 1973-1974 Watergate Hotel scandal that rocked Richard M. Nixon's presidency and caused extreme controversy within the White House. Alan J. Pakula's maverick direction propels this fine film as does an Academy Award winning performance by Jason Robards Jr. as executive editor Ben Bradlee. No other political film has managed to be as powerful as this one. It is a must see.",Null,1,1,21 October 2002
