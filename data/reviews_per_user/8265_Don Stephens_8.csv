Ali," A Subtle Downhill Slide
","For those who don't know boxing history, there are spoilers in this review.We open in an R & B club, and Sam Cooke is taking the stage and sings a medley of his best songs.  As we see the crowd in thrall to him, we cut back and forth, from one of the most electrifying men on stage to the most electrifying man ever to step into the ring, Muhammed Ali.  We see him train, and watch Sonny Liston dominate an opponent in the ring.  We watch the twinkle in Ali's (Will Smith's) eyes as he finds his destiny.This is the best part of Michael Mann's new biopic, simply named 'Ali.' D.P. Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful transitions from film to digital video, and Mann's direction of actors Smith, Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, and Ron Silver in muted camera filters and silence, provide a beautiful contrast to the fire of Cooke's music.  (One might sense that Mann is trying to imitate Scorsese, but is that really all that bad?)And from there, almost invisibly, it starts to go wrong.  For the first two hours of Mann's 157 minute opus, there is no wrong step taken.  Ali is shown as a contemplative and confused man who runs for comfort in all the wrong places; in adultery and a horde of yes-men who vanish without a trace when his license is revoked and rematerialize magically when he gets it back again.  Will Smith is fantastic both in trash-talk mode and in his brooding silences.  Some will say that Ali was not as stoic as Smith and Mann make him out to be, but you get no complaints of historical inaccuracies from me. I pity the fool who tries to get his history from motion pictures.Almost everything is covered.  His conversion to Islam, his refusal to cooperate in the draft, the subsequent suspension of his license, his first fight with Joe Frazier, his relationship with Howard Cosell, and 'The Rumble In The Jungle.'  It's that last one that gave me problems.  Imagine if you will, a long pane of glass going along a conveyor belt.  This pane is without blemish or smudge until the very edge of the pane is smashed by a hammer.  Not only does this ruin the edge, but makes cracks all the way through.The fight at the very end against George Foreman in Zaire, is the typical sports movie ending, where Smith takes a boat-load of punishment and then comes back to knock out his opponent.  This will inspire some people to clap in the theater, but that is a shallow response.  In the previous two hours of the film, we see Muhammed Ali as a flawed man trying to figure things out.  It was a sensitive and convincing portrait, but shouldn't that render a boxing victory meaningless?  They went from a potentially great film to the next 'Rocky' sequel.  Michael Mann is a great director, whose 'Heat' has a place right beside 'The Godfather' in the pantheon of great crime films.  And his work on 'The Insider' not only should have made more money, but was cheated out of a few Oscars.  There must have been Columbia executives breathing down his neck for a more upbeat ending, because you get the sense that Mann should have known better.  At least with all the money this movie will make, he can start work on his next masterpiece.**1/2 out of 4",6,0,0,29 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Take Notes, Kids. This Is What Ambition Looks Like.
","Ever since 'Braveheart' came out, the rebirth of the Epic Motion Picture has made its way to the silver screen.  Movies like 'Titanic,' 'Pearl Harbor,' 'Gladiator,' and even 'The Mummy Returns' try to imitate the vast scope of movies like William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur,' D.W. Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation,' and both of Cecil B. DeMille's versions of 'The Ten Commandments.'  Wyler, Griffith and DeMille are considered the architects of the Epic.  The spirits of these men, and even James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott must make way for the Epic's new all-time master: Peter Jackson.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is the best movie I have seen in recent memory.  Some may hate this film: People who have been mired in motion picture realism and don't take to epics very well.  Normally I would be venomous and outraged that some people would dare attack a movie of such scope and depth, but in this instance, I don't care.  The delicate yet masterful direction of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic novel has elevated me into the ether, and all is at peace.  It's that good.Never have I seen an event film that could be so minute, and yet so massive. Take into consideration the battle scenes of the evil orcs against the men and elves.  When you see a 'Star Wars' picture, ships whiz in and out of the frame, shooting laser beams.  They're here and they're gone, leaving no lasting impression.  But in Peter Jackson's film, (And I don't know how he does it.) each of these tiny, computer generated figures has a life of it's own.  They struck me as characters who had travelled great distances to engage in a war, and had either been cut down, or had risen victorious.The main actors achieve a delicate feat.  The line between the actors and the characters blur, and they're so good that they're practically invisible. There is no force in Ian McKellen's raised eyebrows, Christopher Lee's evil sneer, or Sean Bean's descent into madness.  It is all natural, and always stunning.  Did these actors know they were creating icons?The action feels spontaneous instead of being locked into some kind of plot structure where the movie stops for an action scene and then resumes. Everything is in a nice leisurely flow, and requires attention to be paid. Never does this movie pander, or have low expectations of its audience. 
Peter Jackson is a director out of New Zealand who has made cheapie horror movies like 'Bad Taste' and 'Braindead.'  He has made an Academy Award nominated art film ('Heavenly Creatures') and has had one previous Hollywood effort ('The Frighteners').  While watching these films, I always wondered what he would make if given a real budget, and how it would look.  Now I know.  Mr. Jackson has shown me places that have eluded me in my wildest dreams, and creatures that dwell in the inkiest corners of my darkest nightmares.This reminds me of something that Whoopi Goldberg once said:  'Movies have to be big, because if they're not big, they're television.'  And 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' sure as hell ain't television.**** out of 4",10,0,0,29 December 2001
Ocean's Eleven," When it turned into a remake of 'Entrapment,' I tensed up.
","Steven Soderbergh is one of America's best directors, which is why it shocked me that he would willingly direct such easy entertainment.  His success with 'Traffic' at the box office proves that his usual analytical art can make a hell of a lot of money.  'Ocean's Eleven' is an all-star remake of the 1960's Rat Pack classic about a daring casino heist.  Not exactly 'sex, lies, and videotape II,' now, is it?The first ninety minutes of the film is very entertaining as Soderbergh returns to the verve that he had with 'Out of Sight' and 'The Limey,' with very good performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and a shocker from Bernie Mac.  The first half of the film is stylish and surprisingly believable, but then descends into what can be referred to irrationally as a remake of 'Entrapment', complete with sporty silver suits, and laser beam sensors.  Soderbergh should have known better.An even bigger bright note though:  Julia Roberts is in the film and she doesn't smile once.  There is a God.*** out of 4",6,0,1,5 December 2001
The Pianist," Intelligent and Powerful
","'The Pianist' is the kind of assured, confident movie that only an older director can make.  Sure, directors like Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have exhibited prowess beyond their relatively young years, but the allure of a seasoned professional is unmistakable and inimitable.  He knows you'll be impressed through sheer storytelling magic, and won't jump through hoops to get the audience from point A to point B.I have read Michael Medved's deliriously inane comments on film and film criticism, and he wrote Roman Polanski's best work since 'Chinatown' off as simply a 'Holocaust drama.'  I disagree.  Yes, the main character is Jewish in the nineteen thirties and forties, and the Holocaust is used as a backdrop, but this is a simple story of survival.  Ronald Harwood's screenplay does not go into tons of exposition about who the Nazis are or what they're doing there, and doesn't use insulting little title cards to sum up the situation at the beginning of the film.  It respects the audience's intelligence.  We know what the Nazis did, and it doesn't labor the point.  Polanski is gentle, yet masterful, letting the story flow instead of yanking it one way or the other.  It uses a minimum of dialogue, and doesn't try to convince us of what is wrong or right.  It expects us to know better, and therefore doesn't enforce a kind of ham-handed moral high ground that would be easy to trip over in a film like this.  It accepts everyone involved as human beings instead of faceless and soulless killing machines in gray.The centerpiece of the film is Adrian Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, the Polish piano player who watched his family get packed on a train heading to a concentration camp.  With Polanski's spare direction and Harwood's lack of dialogue, Brody is the only thing to focus on.  One should not underestimate how daunting of a challenge this really is.  Actors have broken under lesser pressure, and something like this requires whoever plays the part to immerse himself wholly in the role; to become the character instead of looking like an actor going through the motions.  Brody more than rises to the challenge.  The soldier from Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' and the punker from Lee's 'Summer of Sam' vanish.  Brody is Szpilman, it's as simple as that.  The feat is superhuman.'The Pianist' is everything a great movie should be.  The direction, writing, acting, and everything else are exemplary.  All so much so that they become invisible.**** out of 4",10,0,1,1 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," As everyone tries to figure it out, David Lynch smiles.
","After a plethora of surrealistic neo-noirs that went next to nowhere and the great (albeit defanged) story of Alvin Straight, David Lynch has made the film that one gets the feeling he has tried for a decade and a half to get down pat.  'Mulholland Drive' takes the flashy imagery of 'Lost Highway', the feel of noirs like 'Touch of Evil', and the products of his own nightmares and exudes an unruly brilliance.This film takes place inside a dream, (There is no disputing that since the second shot in the film is a POV shot of someone going to bed) where things such as reflections, reversals, recurring images, childhood fears of the boogeyman, self-idealizations, and images of one's parents are the norm. 'Mulholland Drive' is like a textbook of the florae and faunae that reside on the oneiric plain and doesn't resort to psychoanalytical claptrap.  For this alone it should be praised.The performances are wonderful, (Especially Naomi Watts who inhabits both sides Hollywood female ideal) the technical credits are great, and the script, which most would spit upon, does a great job of becoming more and more abstract the more you try to make sense of it.  Those who would say it's a bad script are those who would be looking for a story, which Lynch plainly doesn't offer.  Blasting 'Mulholland Drive for a lack of cohesion would be like blasting a Charlie Chaplin movie for a lack of dialogue.What I personally find most entertaining about 'Mulholland Drive' is nowhere to be found on the screen, but rather in the reactions of those who don't get it.  I get the feeling that as he hears the drivel of the poor inhibited souls who bemoan this film for 'not making sense,' David Lynch smiles at a job well done.**** out of 4",10,2,2,5 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Press Return...
","Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind' is just the kind of movie Hollywood makes. An eccentric genius falls in love while battling his personal demons.  It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but I've seen it before, and in a better version.Avid watchers of film will equate 'A Beautiful Mind' with a little indie flick that came out in 1998 called 'Pi.'  (The actual title is the mathematical symbol.)  That film also depicts a mathematical genius, number theory stretching beyond his control, and the game Go.  But 'Pi' itself was possessed of a spiraling madness.  A reclusive mathematician whose computer spits out a 237 digit number which could be translated through Hebrew into the name of God, and thus finding patterns in all the chaotic events of daily life.  It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, (who also directed 'Requiem For A Dream' and is in talks to helm the 'Batman: Year One' film) and was shot on grainy, 16mm black and white.  'Pi' had edge and daring and a lot of other stuff 'A Beautiful Mind' doesn't have.That being said, 'A Beautiful Mind.' is a lovely little film. A man's battle with himself, and a love story to boost ticket sales. It's one of those slivers of a true story that is mostly fiction but we all wish happened anyway.  Russell Crowe, in a brilliant performance, plays John Nash, a West Virginia math prodigy who can afford to be arrogant because he's always right.  The rest of the movie for the most part is nothing new, but the character of John Nash is something I don't remember seeing.  Mumbling in his near indecipherable accent, hobbling along as he ages, looking positively ill at ease in a tuxedo.  This is a new level of fearlessness for Crowe.  After a guy plays a disgraced-yet-studly Roman soldier in one of the most overrated films ever made, there is a level of coolness that one might feel the need to live up to.  Not Crowe.  He takes off his leather skirt and jumps right back into the deep characters where he left off with 'The Insider.'As a director, Ron Howard is shamelessly commercial.  That's not always a bad thing, but it ain't always good either.  From his worst movies ('Dr. Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas') to his best, ('Apollo 13') Howard shows no artist's touch whatsoever.  My feeling is that he just falls ass-backwards into the scripts that'll probably be the highest grossers. Well, more power to him.  If he makes more movies like 'A Beautiful Mind,' he may find himself with one more fan.  But pay Aronofsky some royalties, will ya?*** out of 4",7,0,1,16 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," ...or IS IT?
","There are spoilers here.  Be forewarned.Between 'Waking Life,' 'Mulholland Drive,' and this one, 'Vanilla Sky,'  I'm wondering when the hell *I'm* gonna wake up.  Dreams have had a rebirth in the medium of motion pictures, and why not?  They're fertile ground for material and give the director a much more broad visual landscape.  Remember when studios had animated bugs, haunted houses and comets battling each other at the box office?  And they say the movie industry's gone down the toilet.'Vanilla Sky' is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film called 'Abre Los Ojos.' That film was directed by Alejandro Amenabar.  While I admire Amenabar's work, (He went on to direct 'The Others.') his source material doesn't hold a candle to the remake by vastly underrated writer-director Cameron Crowe. Crowe has done two personal and character driven masterpieces ('Say Anything...' and 'Almost Famous.') and I must admit that I had some hesitancy to see the advanced screening that I saw this evening.  Crowe's forte is small, personal films, and the previews would have us believe that this is some super-charged erotic thriller designed purely to earn untold millions.  But in reality, 'Vanilla Sky' is anything but.  What I love about Crowe's films is that his characters always have the right things to say. Not so much in the dialogue sense, but in the fact that one line an actor can deliver can give a very real sense of a feeling or an emotion.And the cast Crowe has wrangled to deliver these lines is top notch. Penelope Cruz gives off great vulnerability that would not be normally seen when her sex kitten image is taken into account.  Cameron Diaz is very good at using her face to reveal dark undertones through a sunny demeanor.  Jason Lee has a believability that could convince one that he could walk off the screen and talk to you.  But the really impressive performance is by Tom Cruise, who plays a millionaire womanizer who is horribly disfigured after a car accident.  He hits his notes of bitterness very well, considering that he's Tom Cruise and has precious damn little to be bitter about.'Vanilla Sky' is so full of secrets that I've probably given a few away already with out having meant to.  Sorry about that. But this movie is about the domain of dreams, and the only problem I have with 'Vanilla Sky' is at the end, everything is explained.  This is not bad in and of itself, but 'Mulholland Drive,' David Lynch's far superior film, deliberately didn't explain anything.  That left the viewer with an urge to make up an explanation and become an armchair Freud.  This leaves you with nothing to say but 'Wow.  That was a good movie.'***1/2 out of 4",9,0,0,11 December 2001
Amélie," I walked out grinning like an idiot.
","I am a hard-hearted cynic of the first degree.  I loathe children and see animals as potential footwear.  It takes a hell of a movie to make me care or even crack a smile, but man, if I didn't walk out of 'Amelie' grinning like a complete and total buffoon.  'Amelie' is cinematic wizardry of the first order.Paris has never looked better as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet centers his story on an Oscar-worthy performance by Audrey Tautou.  So vulnerable, so cute, so unabashedly good, the emotions of the character of Amelie Poulin seep into the minds and hearts of the audience.  She is surrounded by quirky neighbors and co-workers that make up a few major strokes of 'Amelie's' canvas.  Jeunet also populates his film with bizarre special effects that provide a better grasp of the interior of Amelie's world, making the entire movie a free-for-all funhouse of imagination and wit. 
Anything could happen, which is not something you could say for ninety-nine percent of the romantic comedies that are released in America.  Freddie Prinze Jr./Tom Hanks/Richard Gere falls in love with Jessica Biel/Meg Ryan/Julia Roberts, but doesn't really talk to her very much, before gunning to the airport to talk her off a plane before she goes to New York/San Francisco/Los Angeles for school/work/her fiance.  Here, time is taken, characters are developed, and a journey is made instead of stagnant scenes where the male hero talks to his insipid best friends.  'Amelie' is so full of brilliance and charm and full on verve that the pat and simple ending may not come for those who want it.**** out of 4",10,1,3,9 December 2001
