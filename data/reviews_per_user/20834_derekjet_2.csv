Walk the Line," A very good movie, songs are amazing!
","I saw the previews about a month before it came out, an decided to go see it just because it looked interesting. What I got was totally different(in a good way). It was a very emotionally gripping movie. It told the whole story of Cash's life, focusing on his relationship with June Carter, and his drug addiction. Joaquin Phoenix was EXCELLENT, as was Reese Witherspoon. The songs they sang were amazing. I wasn't ever much of a Cash fan, and after listening to Phoenix and Cash sing, I almost like Joaquin better. Reese Witherspoon was at her absolute best in this movie, she did an excellent version of Jukebox Blues. Again, the acting and producing is so good you really feel like you are there, you even get attached to the characters. Note: There are some sad parts, sensitive people bring tissues. AWESOME MOVIE!!!!",10,0,1,30 November 2005
Jarhead," Not What I Expected, to the point of Disrespecful
","When I went to see Jarhed, I was expecting something more along the lines of Black Hawk Down. What I got was a totally different thing. In some scenes, the movie was so realistic that it was almost boring, but in other parts it so unrealistic to the point of total BS, not in a good way. The writers basically took all the bad stuff that only a fraction of the people do in the Marines that nobody knows about, and put it in the movie. In addition to this, there were many things that were un-explained, especially towards the end of the movie. There is actually very little action in this movie, opposite of what I was expecting. Lastly, don't bring the kids to this movie. There is some mild nudity and major sexual content. There were at lest 100 people in the theater, and it would have taken all of them counting on their hands and feet to count how many times there was cussing. Also, every other scene either involves sex, or talking about sex.",1,0,1,13 November 2005
