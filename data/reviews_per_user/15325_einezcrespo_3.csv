Marie Antoinette," Pretty sets. Not much else.
","I had high hopes for this one since I love reading biographies. Granted that not everything is accurate nor can be fit into a movie we can only make do with what is presented in this case an overlong rock and roll video that has pretty sets and costumes. Marie Antionette came off a little slow and boring though life in the French Court and it's protocols were very amusing to quote MA in the dressing scene 'This is ridiculous.' Sofia Coppola could've have focused a little more on MA's loneliness in a lousy marriage and the court intrigues and a little less on the extravagant shopping sprees. What is surprising is the infamous Necklace Affair wasn't even included since most modern historians agree MA was innocent from that scandal. Acting wise Kirsten Dunst pulled off a difficult job of playing a childlike queen upfront but a woman who suffered humiliation behind the scenes however it is Rose Byrne who stole the show (along with the sets, costumes and the yummy cakes) as the Duchesse de Polignac a role she plays with believable aplomb. Asia Argento looked a little old for Madame Du Barry and Mary Nighy is nice as the Princesse Lamballe, another unfortunate victim of the Revolution. Jason Shwartzman plays a rather stiff Louis XVI while Jamie Dorman is hot as Count Axel Fersen. Everyone else like Judy Davis, Shirley Henderson and Molly Shannon had nothing to do but gossip and look silly. Marianne Faithful floored me with her regal Maria Therese. In the end the movie was a little shallow and the rock and roll soundtrack seemed out of place. It was like watching a 80's music video.",6,1,1,19 July 2007
Van Helsing," Campy, silly but fun.
","OK, it's not Oscar material but this film as Stephen Sommers has said is a homage to 30's Horror films. It's supposed to be fun and campy. Did it hit the mark? I would say yes. Thanks to a lot of campy acting most of it from Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and a hilarious 'friar,' Carl played by David Wenham you could either cringe at former or laugh at the latter. Still these two guys steal the film from both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Also a standout in my opinion is Elena Anaya's screechy vampire bride Aleera who just can't seem to shut up! Apart from that this movie is fast paced and a bit nerve wracking. The downside is too much CGI effects. It's like the special effects is the star of the movie. Everyone else may be except Roxburgh and Wenham are perhaps along for the fast paced ride.",7,0,3,2 November 2010
Pride & Prejudice," This version is not all that bad!
","I have to admit I never saw the BBC series so I don't know why the critics are harsh. I liked the film. OK so it doesn't have Colin Firth and that Matthew MacFadyen looked 'nerdy,' to the eyes of the fans of the BBC version but I loved the interaction between him and Keira Knightly. His Mr Darcy and Miss Elizabeth has attraction written allover. Both Knightly and MacFadyen are great. Her Elizabeth embodied the spirit of an independent mind who brought out Mr. Darcy from his dour prudishness to a passionate though still reserved but attractive man. Another couple who had great chemistry is Donald Sutherland as the patient and harassed Mr.Bennet and Brenda Blethyn as eternal nagging wife Mrs. Bennet. Despite appearances these two showed their characters love each and tolerate whatever imperfections they may have. Rosamund Pike is ethereal as Jane while Jenna Malone nailed the irresponsibly spoiled Lydia while Tom Hollander is perfect as the pompous Mr. Collins. I wasn't too keen with Simon Woods as Mr Bingley. He really looked like the nerd here but one can feel the earnestness he brings to his character's apology when Bigley confesses to Jane of his love for her. Dame Judi Dench's bit role as the imperious Lady de Bourgh reminds me too much of her Queen Elizabeth I turn in Shakespeare in Love. One can't help but feel she is in danger of being typecast. This movie may split Austen fans but it is worth watching even for curiosity's sake.",9,4,8,20 June 2007
