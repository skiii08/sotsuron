Blade Runner 2049," Will bio-engineered humans take over the future?
","This is the sequel to a cult classic of the early '80s. It is the next phase of a dystopia that was created on earth due to the depletion of natural resources. Bio-engineered humans developed to a level where they can now reproduce themselves, instead of just providing slave labour. What established Blade Runner among hard core fans is the artistic perspective this dystopia is based upon. It creates vivid and mixed human responses including fear for the future, sadness for the current quality of life and short-term hope, according to the technological advancements like the flying cars or the ability to enable the space travel.The main evil character is Wallace (played by Jared Leto), a man that tries to re-enable the ability of replicants to reproduce themselves just like normal human beings. The actor is very successful in his role due to the devotion he showed. His words contain poetic expressions for communicating the views about replicants and their purpose, to the audience. This is a peak moment for the story since this psychic person is a fundamental aspect of the story. While trying to be more realistic, he didn't protect himself from exaggerations though. He blinded himself for a short period of time just to get a better understanding of his role. This is a false reaction since the main purpose of an actor is to emulate a different personality, not to try becoming one. He has no real experience in this state (as a blind man), so he has more chances to behave inconsistently. The basic weakness of this movie is the wooden way the actors play their parts. This can give the reason of the low financial earnings during the first availability to the public. Replicants are not robots, they are humans. There is no reason for them not to behave like typical human beings, showing feelings and vivid behaviour (bear in mind the first Blade Runner). The mechanical way the actors portray their roles (like 'K'), leaves the audience in a state where they cannot connect to the protagonists by observing their character development. For example, 'K' is a completely different character from the female hologram which is coded to show vivid human behaviour. They don't breathe the same way and this looks non-functional to the audience.The complexity of the script and the long running time are not show-stopper factors. There are many successful movies that approach the 3-hour timestamp and are complex as well. The viewers don't get bored due to the duration, but they do so when there is no connection to the main characters. The so-called slow pace (have you seen European independent movies?) is not show-stopper either. It can be considered as part of the art. It leaves time to the viewer to assimilate the environment and become one with that.",9,3,8,17 April 2018
Interstellar," The most 'down-to-earth' space travel.
","Interstellar is part of the latest generation sci-fi cinema that exploits some concepts of cosmology like the wormholes and blackholes. These became well-known due to the work of scientists like Stephen Hawking. Though it is difficult for most viewers to understand the mechanics of a multi-dimensional timespace, in this movie the elaboration on the topic and its presentation are meticulously approached, for making it quite apprehensible.The earth is at the point where the depletion of natural resources is imminent and there is need for migration to exoplanets for the survival of the human species. This state of the earth creates a feeling of melancholia and fear about the foreseeable future that is conveyed properly to the audience. This dystopia is a key factor for the movie's success.Instead of the scientific scope, the relation of the main character (former scientist and current farmer) to his daughter (future scientist) is developed with intimate approach and it is described by deep human feelings. This connection creates a perfect balance to the scientific side of the movie, making it attractive to a wider audience and contributing that way to its final success.There are some moments that may initially seem not to be based on reality (more likely being paranormal) like the attempt from the father to communicate with his daughter behind the bookshelf. The good point is that scenes such as this, are explained in a scientifically consistent manner at the end. 10/10. Get the 4K physical medium version (more bitrate usually equals better a/v quality).",10,0,0,1 May 2018
Blade Runner," How the future looks like...
","'Time enough'...This is a sci-fi classic that stood the test of time. It became a classic due to the great representation of a dystopia, i.e., a projection of the future that creates mixed feelings. Great technological advancements, and on the other hand, misery and low quality of living (actually... survival). The wealthy people abandoned the earth for other planets due to the depletion of resources. It is inhabited now by the poor, what is today... the cultures of the developing world. The way this environment is depicted and the human responses it triggers, created a uniqueness that made the movie a cult classic. The scenario is of lower importance. Eventhough it is strong, it is there just to exhibit this great dystopia. Most actors play their roles in a satisfying way. The fact that some of them play replicants (bio-engineered humans), doesn't deter them for portraying vivid human behaviour (like sarcasm, fear and protective instincts, among others). This is a key factor for the success of the movie, i.e., not behaving in a mechanical style that lacks human traits. They are still humans and this is connected to the audience in a great extent.Another integral part of the movie's DNA is the soundtrack by Vangelis. The former is difficult to exist without the latter and vice versa. It adds a great soundscape to the environment that provokes a feeling of melancholy and paranoia. Consider as an example the death moment of the replicant leader. The electronics (mostly analogue synthesisers) of the early '80s are exploited to their limits providing a timeless experience.There's no other movie or series that comes even close to this dystopia. All attempts have failed miserably. There's a surprising exception though which is a trilogy of computer adventure games of the '90s by the main title 'Tex Murphy'. Their representation of this environment is majestic. ...'Time to die'!",10,0,1,14 April 2018
