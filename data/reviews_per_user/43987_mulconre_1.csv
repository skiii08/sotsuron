Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Only one word: IDIOTIC!
",This movie was an insult to the intelligence of everyone with an age in double digits. Everyone who enjoyed the first two movies was let down enough by the cutesyness of the 'ewoks.' This movie takes that 'unstrap me so I can puke' feeling you get from the Ewok scenes and multiplies it tenfold with Jar Jar Binks.,1,1,3,26 November 2000
