The Incredible Hulk," Watchable!
","The Incredible Hulk works well for most part. No, its not going to go down as one of those classics that will live timelessly, but 'Watchable' would probably be the best way to describe it. Edward Norton delivers a fine performance as Bruce Banner and carries the movie on his shoulders, while Liv Tyler, William Hurt and Tim Roth are adequate in limited roles. The scenes early on in Brazil are well-conceived; I liked the manner in which they trace Bruce Banner to his location in Brazil and the sequence with Blonsky (Tim Roth) chasing Banner over the roof-tops in Brazil. The special effects in the movie are decent for most part - I especially liked a sequence in the middle, where they corner the Hulk in a University. But the climax, where the Hulk takes on a super-strong monster version of Blonsky (called the Abomination), is a let-down. Since the focus is on Bruce getting cured for about 75% of the movie, the final fight between the monsters doesn't have the right lead-up to it. The scenes leading to the climax are full of clich√©s and are cringe-worthy. The final fight itself is not so good, with the two monsters seeming right out of a cartoon. Perhaps it is a nod to the comic book, but doesn't sit well with the tone of the rest of the movie. In a Nutshell: Barring a few scenes and the climax, The Incredible Hulk delivers good popcorn entertainment and is a good way to kill a lazy couple of hours. The fans of the Hulk series and teens will probably enjoy it a lot more, but still, it is a decent motion picture.",8,2,5,11 July 2008
The Love Guru," This One's gonna win a lot of Razzies!
","This movie presently has a rating of 3.2 / 10. And I still feel its over-rated!!! That's how awful this movie is!! ...I was on my to the theater to see another movie but my friend who wanted to see this managed to force-feed this poison to me. Bah! Such a waste of money and time!!! ..Not that I expected a great plot or anything (as a matter of fact, I dint expect any), but the 'comedy' in this movie is so bad that I had to constantly repress my urge to throw something at the screen. There were concerns raised abt this movie offending Hinduism - Well it does make an attempt to parody Hinduism, but the attempt really is too lame and moronic to take it seriously at all. I think Hindus need to be least worried about this; there are more important things to worry about in life than fretting over this.OK, with the Hinduism angle aside, What you actually get from this movie is a collection of various size-related jokes coming your way along with some truly horrible performances by the ensemble. If anything is offending in this movie, it is actually this. Come Razzie-time, I predict that this movie is going to nominated in multiple categories: Mike Myers for each of his roles; Ben Kingsley and Justin Timberlake will compete for supporting roles (My vote to Kingsley!!) and needless to say - the writing, directing and the picture! If you can, stay as many miles away from this one as you can!!",1,20,41,5 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Close to a Masterpiece!
","As I write this, I've just seen the Dark Knight an hour back. Its been a while since I've been blown away by a movie. It was great to have that feeling again after a very long time. This one is an absolute stunner! - A blockbuster that lives beyond the hype!!! .. The movie plays like a grand crime drama, the co-incidence being that the players are from a comic-book landscape. It has a great plot, amazing visuals and stunning performances! The movie deals with a lot of serious issues in subtext- especially relevant ones in the wake of the War on Terror. The action scenes play brilliantly on the giant screen. The humor, if any, in the movie is very dark - right from the pencil-disappearing trick to when the Joker retells the story of the origin of his scars.This is one of those rare movies that upstages the prequel - right from the start it grabs you by the collar and two and a half hours whiz away in a hurry. There is still a hangover from the movie - I just can't get the dialogue away from my head and that maniacal laugh.While the entire cast is very good in their roles, the star of the show is definitely Heath Ledger, playing the frightening anarchic, psychotic Joker. Ledger has created an iconic villain here - right up there with the likes of Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, Anton Chigurh and the like. He's made himself immortal with this role. Christian Bale once again puts in a strong performance that easily makes him the best Batman/Bruce Wayne, while Aaron Eckhart pitches in a moving performance as of a man who falls from being Gotham's knight of hope to a deformed, demented villain. Gary Oldman is brilliant as the righteous Commissioner Jim Gordon.While I am raving abt the movie, I think one probably needs to watch Batman Begins to know the characters and their motivations well (Heck, do I even have to mention this??). I think I should also warn ppl that this is not a conventional superhero movie where the hero has cool lines, flashy action and rides into the sunset with the girl .. If that's the only stuff you expect from a superhero movie, this movie is not for you. The movie has a brooding, tragic feel about it that some of us may not like.Its a hard-hitting motion picture that asks its audience serious questions and yet say 'Why so serious?' .. The entire cast and Director Christopher Nolan certainly deserve a huge applause for an almost-flawless movie that is sure to be a path-breaking one in the superhero / comicbook genre! The I-max ticket was worth all its money!",10,4,8,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Awesome!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this awesome movie!! I am a Potter fan and the first 3 movies dint impress me that much. But in this one, the director had succeeded in doing justice to the book, and as he says, brought it out as an 'action epic'.Barring the over-energetic, screaming Dumbledore, I liked every bit of it. The acting from the trio (particularly Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) has really improved, and their teenage woes are really well brought out. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Lord Voldemort, but the one who really stood out in the cast was Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody! I was skeptical when pictures of Moody came out before the release, but I was compelled to change my mind after the movie.There are changes in the plot, but they settled well into the movie. A well deserved 10/10.",9,8,15,21 November 2005
