Sucker Punch," Snyder's misunderstood fascinating masterpiece
","An impressive and inspiring fantasy movie with impressive visuals and impressive cast, a fascinating movie that tried to speak to you outside of reality, a movie that inspires you to dream, to live in a reality where you can control everything, a movie that deserves to be called a masterpiece, a movie that teaches you that it doesn't matter where you are the mind will always be our home sweet home.Strong and solid performances in the movie, worth to mention Emily Browning as the lead character that connects with the audience and Abbie Cornish as the fascinating strong headed deuteragonist, Carla Gugino outshined half of the cast with her solid performance as Dr. Vera Gorski, but Scott Glenn and Abbie Cornish are the ones that truly shine in this fascinating movie with strong and solid Golden Globe worthy performances.",10,14,24,10 October 2015
Paranormal Activity," Boring, lame and crappy movie
","Boring movie with basically no plot, just a couple of cheap jump scares for no reason, a crappy movie that deserves a 0.1 rating, i would rather be tortured Saw-esque than watch this crap again, i can't believe people like this crap, it's so boring and bad acted, just a couple of jump scares, you know i considered Sharknado the worst movie ever, but after seeing this crap i must say Paranormal craptivity takes the f**king cake.If you like boring movies with cheap scares and no plot then this is your kind of movie, but if you like a good movie with a good plot and scaring scenes go watch The Ring or Supernatural or anything that is not Paranormal craptivity.",1,1,4,29 October 2015
