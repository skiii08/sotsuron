Lucky Number Slevin," not bad, but don't compare it to the usual suspects
","I saw this movie a few weeks ago & its not bad, but not great either. What surprised me is IMDb's recommendation 'if-you-liked-this-movie you-will-also-like' The Usual Suspects. huh? This movie *does not compare* to The Usual Suspects. TUS was a standing ovation, chills-down-the-spine, watch-it-several-times movie, and incredibly impressive. I had Slevin figured out 30 minutes into it, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Its like comparing Star Wars to Tron: same genre, different league. Entirely. I also expected better from Kingsley, Freeman & Willis. Maybe it was the direction/tor. I don't have high expectations for Lucy Lui or Josh Hartnet, so not real surprised there.",6,1,2,8 November 2006
