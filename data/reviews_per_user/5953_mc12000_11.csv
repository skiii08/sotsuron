Iron Man 3," Marvel fans *** AVOID THIS FILM ***
","It's far too late to say this now and besides, I won't be the first to say it. Neither am I the first to fall into the trap of either:a. Believing some fool who told me that it's the best of the trilogy.b. Feeling the need to complete the series. c. Ignoring the bad reviews here and deciding to make up my own mind.Now I just feel that I have wasted the price of a cinema ticket :(I'm just sad that most (if not all) Marvel fans would have seen this film already and are sharing the exact sentiments which I have.Lesson learned is, trust the reviews when more than a dozen say a film is bad...",1,7,19,11 May 2013
The Impossible," Biased. An insult to the real heroes
","I went to watch this film based on the rating given here. I did not see the trailer or read any spoilers.To sum up my opinions, I was disappointed. The film placed a clearly biased attention on a white family and did not spared a thought for the local population, who suffered a lot more and had to remain with the situation. I was expecting at least a tribute to the volunteer rescue efforts at the end of the film. There was none.I think this film does a great injustice to those who deserve the attention. It also relies far too much on the shock factor and the overall tone gave far too much Hollywoodism to be desired.The only redeeming part for me was a line uttered by a dying woman. 'I am saving my energy to see my family one last time' And lastly, maybe Thailand was the worst affected country for white people but the worst affected country overall was Indonesia.",1,11,30,12 March 2013
Terminator Salvation," A disgrace to the franchise
","I normally do not bother writing a review for a film which received as many reviews as Terminator Salvation has done mainly because I believe that my input would just be lost in the huge pool. But I have to say that this film angered me so much that I had to break the habit...Acting: In a word - Terrible. The best actor/actress was the little mute girl. That's how badly I rated the actors/actresses' performances. I won't name anyone in particular because everyone was as bad as each other.Action: Nothing special that I haven't already seen in another war blockbuster or Terminator movie. This film steals many ideas from the past Terminator movies.Storyline: The worst element of the film. There was absolutely nothing convincing about the storyline and definitely nothing that was original. The film stole many ideas from the old Terminator films (dialogue and action sequences). Characters developed feelings for each other without any substantial reason.Special Effects: Not much to speak about here. Terminator 2 featured more state of the art effects in comparison. The only thing that impressed me was the T800 and how they made it look exactly like Arnie from the first Terminator.Direction: McD should stick to directing TV shows and music videos. However, the sponsors are ultimately to blame for giving this film into the wrong hands.",1,4,7,18 June 2009
Man of Steel," I agree with the critics...
","In contrast to the 'most useful' reviews, I actually agree with the critics. The budget clearly went into the action and for this, I score the movie 10 out of 10. The fight scenes are an incredible match for what you see in the cartoons, and I was very impressed. Unfortunately, there were only two other positive aspects for me:1. Russell Crowe, who gave a surprisingly good portrayal of Jor-El. 2. Although I disliked the rest of the movie, it is still better than the rubbish that is called 'Iron Man 3'.Although you could argue that this was the Superman from an alternate age, I did not get any kind of feeling for the actor's portrayal. Disappointing since he obviously felt bad after losing the 2006 role to a relatively unknown actor who, in my opinion, did a better job of playing Superman than he did. We waited 7 years for him to do a better job and yet, we get a lifeless wooden performance instead. That said, Amy Adams was no better. Both the leads gave very wooden lifeless performances which was a big big letdown. For me, the lead actor and actress had no chemistry whatsoever.I normally hate reboots but after watching this version of Superman, I can't wait for another reboot.... the decision to pull the plug on Brandon Routh was a stupid one.",1,9,22,16 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Could / Should have been much better
","Being a X-Men comic fan, I could not wait for this movie to come out. Days of future past is one of the story arcs which define the X-Men comics and seeing that Bryan Singer came back to direct, I thought that this effort would surely bring back the X-Men franchise in the eyes of the fans....or does it. Seeing that Rogue was cut out of the theatrical release was not a good start. But when I saw that there were plenty of other mutant characters I kept my hopes up for a classic offering.As there was not a single cinema in town that offered the film in 2D in original language, I was forced watched the 3D version. Totally unnecessary and the viewing experience is made worse because the polarised glasses make the 'future' scenes even harder to see since they are mostly filmed in darkness.My first complaint is that the movie dives straight into action. A fight between the last of the mutants and the sentinels. There is no explanation on why these were the last mutants standing, and who they were. The movie also ignores the otherworldly Marvel characters who would be more than a match for the sentinels. The sentinel powers are also given a twist, plus their design differs from what we know from the comics. Now a great start for me.Most of the film is based in 1973 and, during these parts, we see a total of 6 mutants with 4 or 5 other cameo appearances. There was no logical reason for why Wolverine chose Quicksilver for breaking into the Pentagon. Whereas the first Bryan Singer X-Men movie gave us 4 mutant villains, this movie only contained misguided characters. When compared to the other X-Men movies there are relatively fewer action scenes which really show off the mutant powers. It just felt cheap to me and to be brutally honest I was more impressed by the trailers than the film itself. I genuinely felt conned by Days of future past.The mid-credits scene was also placed after ALL the credits have rolled. That means you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of uninteresting info. I won't give away what it entails (although you can easily do a google) but I would say that it brought me very little excitement as it does not tie in with any of the other Marvel movies.The first X-Men movie in 2000 was a no-nonsense classic. The Wolverine showed promise in bringing back the same gritty action. Unfortunately, Days of future past was a disappointment for me.",3,23,42,30 May 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Big is not always better
","People will always compare it with the LOTR trilogy, consciously or otherwise. And that is the biggest challenge facing the Hobbit trilogy. After watching it my first comment was, it should have been made before the LOTR trilogy.As a film on its own, it is overall a very impressive effort. I read many reviews which criticised the inflation of certain scenes to make up the 3 hours and I entirely agree. I also agree that certain characters did not need to be in the film. But when I saw the Warner Brothers and MGM logos at the start of the film, I did wonder what level of control Peter Jackson had over the script content...The Hobbit should not be a trilogy and the films do not need to be 3 hours duration each. There is no need to force the story to match the LOTR trilogy. I dread to think what extra material is going to be included in the Director's cut...",5,13,30,19 December 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Don't believe the hype
","Like some films, I came to this one having heard all the hype and bonanza. To be honest I hadn't planned on watching it until the DVD came out - I tend not stay away from films that have received a lot of hype. Apart from one single negative review (from someone who does not lack cynicism at the worst of times I might add), everyone else had given this film the thumbs-up. So I sat in anticipation. The slow start certainly made me wonder what all the fuss was all about. But gradually, the film began to unwrap and it displayed some impressive cinematography. We're also given a lot of martial arts scenes where reels upon reels of strings must have been used up to achieve the ridiculous flying sequences. I've watched many an Oriental martial arts movie in my lifetime and never before have I seen such spectacular heights. The one piece of credit I will give to the action is the lack of fake sound effects whch are often the bane of martial arts movies (yes, even Bruce Lee fight scenes. ESPECIALLY Bruce Lee fight scenes!).  The main bulk of the acting is actually done by Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi who both put in extremely intense performances. I've always viewed Yeoh as ranking alongside the likes of Maggie Cheung and Anita Mui (Funnily enough, they all made a film together). The way in which they express emotion is something that most Hong Kong movies sadly lack-but then, most HK movies are action-orientated. Zhang portrays a somewhat different character to Yeoh's. being younger, we see a brash, rebellious and brave individual who yearns to break free of tradition. In a way, Ang Lee is providing a picture of The modern Oriental female's inclination in life. In Zhang's character, we see both innocence and petulence and this is why the audience is immediately taken to her. As for action, I wrote off all the fight scenes except for two - the one where they are trying to take down the baddie, and the one in the courtyard between Yeoh and Zhang. The latter was breathtaking and is amongst the best I've ever seen. I suspect that there were various ideas for the film's ending. I suspect this because I would've chosen a different ending myself. I must confess that I did not understand the point of it until a friend explained what she thought it meant. And if it is what she thought, then I'd have to say that whoever decided upon the ending must have lost the plot. After all, there is a limit to romanticism which one can objectively justify, even in a romantic storyline. To put it another way: If the film was animated, then the ending would've been apt.",Null,0,1,13 July 2001
Prisoners," Arguably the best film of 2013
","As all other reviews have stated the strength of this film lies with the quality of acting, and with the number of A-list stars this is exactly what we expect. I was also impressed by the tempo and atmosphere. There are moments where the silence itself gives you cause to expect the worst, and this is a prime example of a film where the acting, camera-work and script all come together to generate the sense of foreboding. It is the difference between a good horror film such as Ringu and a slasher title such as Scream.I can't help but feel that there was a change in script because the abrupt does not really deliver its intended impact. If you have watched the film then you will understand what I mean. I would not be surprised if there was an alternative ending in the DVD release.I did not give it a perfect 10/10 purely because the ideas were not original. But in a year in which there have been a huge number of blockbusters that failed to impress, this film is truly a welcome relief that 2013 was not a disaster the movie industry and brings relief that artistry is not lost.",9,1,4,12 October 2013
Green Street Hooligans," Strong, gritty, gutsy and violent
","Broadly speaking for me, there are two types of films. Ones that inspire serious thinking and discussion, and ones that don't require a lot of thinking about. 'Green Street' was strange in that I did not know what to make of it. On face value, the simple storyline places it in the latter category (possibly on the mindless violence shelf). But after watching it, I was hoping to find some kind of excuse to salvaged the film from the trashy depths. For one thing, I thought the acting was good and convincing and I could be made to believe that the actors (bar Elijah Wood) were/are from hooligan backgrounds. Then I tried to decide if I felt any sympathy for any of the characters. After all, one character lost his teenage son in a street brawl, another character lost his chance for a reformed life and finally, the main protagonist is killed. And yet, I couldn't help but think that these characters got exactly what they deserved because of what they have done or what they are doing. Hence, I could find no reason for feeling anything for the characters. So what about the film's message? Here, I was equally confused by what the Director was trying to get across. The obvious message is to highlight England's football hooligan culture and thereby issue a warning to those out there. But I also got the sense that the film was glorifying the whole issue. For instance, making martyrs out of the main characters and promoting the whole ethos of hooliganism being about reputation. That is not to say that I did not enjoy the film. After all, strong performances from the cast kept the momentum moving at a solid pace. I felt that someone less 'flimsy' than Elijah Wood would have made a better lead but he wasn't bad. The film was full of holes and coincidences which would only be found in a fictitious world but again, I don't hold that against any film. Putting these 'negatives' aside, I would recommend it to the 15-40 year old age group, even if it is a Cert 18 in the UK.",7,0,1,14 September 2005
Mama," Not bad
","Not a bad horror film but the ending was too soppy for my taste. It has its spine-tingling moments but, as someone already said, it also falls prey to standard horror clichés. I was a little disappointed by the lack of screen presence from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. I was also expecting a back story of the Father somehow helping to save the kids, but this was not developed. There is obviously the glaring hole in the plot which surrounds the cabin in the woods, and how the kids managed to survive for 5 years without being discovered by anyone, and how they survived hypothermia. But, as already mentioned, just take the whole thing with a pinch of salt and you have a half-decent horror flick :)",6,0,2,18 May 2013
Princess Mononoke," Very good anime feature
","I had previously heard a lot about this Japanese animation feature that had been taken by the West and given a thorough and professional voice-over by well-known actors/actresses. Having seen it pre-advertised in various internet DVD sites, I came to te conclusion that it must be pretty good based on the fact that even big stars would spend their time on a project such as this. And I'm not far wrong from this conclusion. The film is immaculately drawn to the minutest detail, the storyline is as good as any fantasy goes, and there is even the odd blood and gore scene for the violent anime fan too! Weighing in at a hefty 134 minutes, this is the longest anime feature that I've ever watched and the action keeps the film going. There is little to criticise apart from the slightly weak ending but one could argue that this is the case for other similar anime of this genre. I personally could not fault the film simply because I enjoyed it very much. The only thing I would say, coming from an Oriental background, is that the storyline boasts nothing new. And this is where it scores highly with Western audiences. The concept of civilisation battling against nature is a subject that the West is actively emerging themselves into at present so I have no doubt that this film will bring inspiriration to those who need it.",Null,0,1,13 July 2001
