The Blair Witch Project," SCARY! SCARY! SCARY!
","This is one of the scariest movies ever made!  Granted, you have to wait until almost the very end until things get REALLY scary. but it so makes up for it!  I know a lot of people hate this movie (and I mean a lot), but those people are just very close-minded.  You can't go into it thinking you're gonna see some witch chasing people around.  It's not like SCREAM or HALLOWEEN.  It's all in your mind.  And that's what makes it so scary!  You have to finish the story with your own mind.  Did they die?  What happened to them?  How did they die?  It still gives me chills.  Too bad part two ruined for everyone.",10,2,3,19 March 2001
Scream 2," Up to par with the original
","This is one of those sequels that is just as good as the first.  Nothing was lost in the transition.  Supposedly there was a different first draft of the script that had a different killer, but I don't see how it could've compared to this.  Don't get me wrong, the first one is by far better, but this one is also good.  The only problem I had with part 2 is the whole part about the copycat killer.  I would've made for a better plot if that angle were carried throughout the film.  And once again, the opening fifteen minutes are extremely gratifying.  Too bad Mr. Williamson didn't stay around for the third installment.",10,0,0,19 March 2001
Scream," Almost the best movie ever made!
","I almost didn't even want to go see this movie when it came out, but after some convincing from a friend I reluctantly obliged.  I was so blown away by it!  I've have never been more satisfied after watching a movie in my life. This has everything a person could want from a movie; laughs, scares, drama, action, etc.  The opening fifteen minutes alone leave a person breathless. Because of this movie I have found a new home in horror movies.  They are my favorite to rent and go see.  I used to be utterly frightened by them and now I watch them religiously.  I'd just like to take the moment to thank Mr. Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven for opening my eyes to such an exciting and profound genre of theater.",10,0,0,19 March 2001
