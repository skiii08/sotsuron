Men in Black 3," Better than the last one ..
","Pleasantly surprised. Sure, some of the jokes are right out dry and Will Smith's humor and facial expressions are very much a repetition of previous films. But I actually found myself laughing out loud, as I was tempted to laugh, several times.Do not know if it is the movie that was better than the past ones or if it's my own sense of humor that has changed over time. Men in Black is the state's secret police who handle extraterrestrial beings and are responsible for the public to stay ignorant of the existence of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. International villain Boris the Animal escapes from a high security prison located on the moon and go back in time to help his former self to kill Agent K and allow the alien invasion of Earth. Agent J following the year in 1969 and teams up with contemporary young Agent K. hails jokes throughout the film, not everyone goes through, but enough is so good that the movie doesn't fall flat. It is also seen that the fx-guys put in some extra effort into creating new creatures and not clone something that we already have seen in other films. A favorite scene is definitely when Agent J fighting in the streets against an alien fish. The film also gives a completely different view of classic terms such as time jump. So I will give an additional plus for a lot of fresh ideas.The 3d-effects was not OK at all. They sucked.Finally, I recommend the film, it has a good entertainment value and is both fast-paced and fun.",6,1,3,30 May 2012
