Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky's expert depiction of exponential decline into helplessness
","Pragmatically speaking, there is little more to the plot of Requiem for a Dream than watching four people take six months to approach the inevitability of completely destroying their existences with drugs. Aronofsky's depiction thereof, however, is positively masterful. The hundred minutes are woven together into three signposted segments (summer, fall and winter), each of which is a continuous aptly scored orchestration of addiction and emotion, punctuated only by Aronofsky's rapid-cut drug-use sequences.Summer sees the four all content, with their respective addictions well-supported, their lives all headed in the correct directions, albeit down ominously crooked paths. The score is light. Aronofsky concludes summer with an emotional and lengthy confrontation between Harry and Sara Goldfarb - clearly the longest cut in the film, and the first in which the characters begin to feel uncomfortable. This uncertainty and tension spills over into fall, when everything begins to turn sour, and the score begins to intensify. The framework supporting the quartet's addictions begins to fray, as Sara begins to increase her drug intake, and the relationship between Harry and Marian begins to falter.Hitherto, Aronofsky had depicted a fairly stagnant summer, with situations slowly worsening through fall; winter sees the supportive framework around each character collapse, with Sara's physical and mental condition deteriorating, Harry's arm worsening, his relationship with Marian shattered, and Marian's reliance upon prostitution to support her addiction, all with exponentially increasing intensity. The score and cutting subtly follows suit; through the entire winter movement, the music increases in intensity and malice (Marian's score, little more than a light piano melody, grows eerier as the music around it intensifies), and the cuts from scene to scene become faster, and the horrors depicted in them become harder to watch. When the film has finally surpassed its climax, Aronofsky offers no comforting ending: just a portrait of the shattered lives of four helpless individuals.The purpose of the film is clear: portray the unforgiving result of hard drug use, and; to show how a situation which has been stable for a long time can spiral into oblivion in a fraction of that time. Aronofsky, with a film which lives up to the term 'requiem,' as well as the four lead actors in the film, succeed in depicting exactly these things in a film which demands its viewers are made to feel as uncomfortable as possible for at least ten or fifteen minutes leading to its climax. Very powerful, very moving, and quite excellent.",9,0,1,8 February 2006
Zodiac," Just didn't do enough
","Entering the cinema with no knowledge of the Zodiac killer left this whole thing as a very hollow experience. Two hours and forty minutes of what, for all intents and purposes, was little more than an unnarrated documentary, rather than a film. And balance was difficult for Fincher to achieve: eventually, the time devoted to the facts of the Zodiac case, and all that tedious police red tape and discussions about fingerprints and handwriting which may or may not have existed meant that the characters suffered. I got a reasonable picture of the Paul Avery and Dave Toschi characters, but none of the others - and to me, they weren't really characters interesting enough to transfer into a film anyway. Finally, while I am well aware that the case remained unsolved and so forth, for Fincher to deliver this and sundry information via six or seven faceless captions at the end of the film, after over two and a half hours of film, was a terrible cop-out. I was dissatisfied with the quality of this piece, and must learn to be more careful when considering films based upon real events.",4,1,3,5 July 2007
Ocean's Twelve," Just not good enough
","SPOILERS WITHIN One would have thought that the sequel to a hugely popular and very entertaining heist movie would be, well, another heist movie, with an elaborate scheme that at least attempts to rival the first movie for ingenuity and intrigue. But, unfortunately, they just decided to take a bag of unwanted script pages from other movies, shuffle them, and adjust it to suit the Ocean's Eleven characters. Quite simply, this is the least relevant sequel I have seen for a very long time - even American Pie 3, the Wedding was more warranted than this trite.In a seemingly extremely unlikely twist of events, Mr Benedict is back and wanting all his money back. So, all the eleven come back together and try to figure out what heist they should do. Sol decides to leave instead. They go to Holland, and find that their heist is done by another master-thief on the same night - the Night Fox is his name. Seems he's got a bit of an ego about Ocean pulling off a better heist at the casinos than he's ever done, and he challenges Ocean's team to what is essentially a heist-off - both teams will try to steal the French Coronation Egg.This is where the movie gets even worse. Practically everyone gets arrested, leaving only a handful. They call on Tess to help in their heist, and perhaps in a desperate attempt to force me to leave in disgust, they have her disguised as Julia Roberts. But, she and everyone else gets arrested too. So, with Ocean's Twelve all in a European prison, how are they going to escape? Easy! Linus' Mum disguises herself as a European prison officer. The Night Fox shows off the Coronation Egg which he managed to steal from within a room of randomly moving lasers - which we saw in a minute-and-a-half display of impossibly fortunate gymnastics - to Ocean, who then reveals that he stole a replica, and that he stole the real one. What was the elaborate heist scheme used to capture the priceless artefact? A two-minute switcheroo of bags on a train. Getting the picture? Throw in an illogical, predictable, and largely unrelated story arc with Zeta Jones' character, and it's done.There were positives. Zeta Jones' performance was, as usual, pretty damn good, with a character who was enchanting, despite the complete lack of impact she had on the story. The original, shorter heist, where the Night Fox got there first, also recaptured some of the good work from the first movie. But I can't fathom what they were trying to get out of the rest of the movie - the characters' original witty charm was replaced with the occasional unfunny wisecrack. The first movie attracted a large number of fans through its charming characterisation and elaborate story, and since there was essentially none of that in Ocean's Twelve, it was simply baffling that this film was even made - from an artistic standpoint. From a marketing standpoint, it was perfect - use the popularity of the first movie to sell the second without having to make any effort at all. It worked on me, didn't it?4/10",4,0,0,9 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A tough one to rate
","Overall, it was very difficult to discern exactly what I thought about Burton's adaption of Dahl's novel. At times, I felt that the biggest disappointment about the film was that the storytelling was at times garbled and at times confusing, given the impression perhaps of relying more upon readers' existing knowledge of the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to fully appreciate the interpretation of the film; admittedly, a good knowledge of the story was fairly certain from most viewers, however this sacrifice in storytelling left the film lacking full integrity. Particularly laboured was the portion of the film before the children entered the factory - as a true case in point, Burton reprised the 'fake golden ticket' storyline from Stuart's movie, but dealt with it so rapidly in passing that its real value in the movie is questionable.In analysing Depp's interpretation of Wonka, it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Wilder's, but as the characters were so vastly different, comparisons become difficult. At times, Depp felt unsettling: while the darker aspects of his Wonka were a refreshing body added to empty shell which was Dahl's original Wonka without compromising the allure of the eccentric, the childish insecurities he displayed were more difficult to accept. Wilder's Wonka, while darker than Dahl's, never lost his likability nor his powerful standing in the factory, but Depp's Wonka in his more childish moments seemed to lose charisma; a charismatic Wonka surely should be considered the key to a good portrayal of this story. As a case in point, it is difficult to be drawn to Depp as he insecurely jokes about cannibalism.Emphasis of the other characters shifted in Burton's Charlie and the Chocalate Factory when compared with Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. In Stuart's movie, the parents of the children were given the starring support roles, in particular Roy Kinnear's Mr Salt and Leonard Stone's Mr Beauregarde. Enjoyable as these characters were, it detracted from the fact that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is supposed to revolve around the characters of the children and revealing why Charlie is indeed the moral superior to the others. As such, Burton deals with these side characters better than Stuart, and with the exception of Augustus Gloop, whose character has no real scope for embellishment, the four other children are the supporting characters who shine, in particular Jordan Fry's Mike Teavee and Annasophia Robb's Violet Beauregarde, whose characters were altered significantly from Dahl's hollow beginnings. Of the parents, it is only Missi Pyle's Mrs Beauregarde who displays any substance of character, working beautifully in tandem with Robb to present the stereotypical corn-fed American mother-daughter team. In this respect, Burton hit the mark much more closely than did Stuart, but given that the original book offered no substance to any of the parents or children, both have dealt with the problem in appropriate manners.Charlie's devotion to the wellbeing of his family was well written and believable by convincing performances by Highmore, Carter, and Taylor. However, it was included as an antithesis to Wonka's own family traumas, and these segments of the film, in which Wonka lapsed into flashback and then the conclusion towards the end, felt laboured, especially given the uneasiness of Depp's Wonka. Highmore's Charlie, and the little yet obvious moments in which he puts his family first, are endearing.The key drawcard of this film was Elfman's score, particularly the instrumental score. The rousing instrumental number over which the opening credits ran was simply brilliant. The oompa-loompa songs, each performed in a different style - each performed in a different style, as compared with the well-known oompa-loompa songs from Stuart's film - added some light-hearted diversity.The visuals were disappointing. Much of the interior of the factory was excessively cartoonish, particularly the room with the waterfall, or the nut sorting room. Furthermore, the exterior of the factory and some of the corridors were very sterile and uninviting. The enhanced realism of the sets in Stuart's film made that factory more engaging.As negative as this summary is, a lot of it is made in comparison with Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which would receive a rating of 9/10. Burton portrayed the same classic story with better supporting characters, but in a confusing manner. Furthermore, it is still difficult to discern whether or not Depp's portrayal of Wonka should be hailed a success or so-so. Even so, it cannot be suggested for a moment that Burton has done Dahl's classic anything but justice, and for that it receives 7/10.",7,0,1,30 September 2005
