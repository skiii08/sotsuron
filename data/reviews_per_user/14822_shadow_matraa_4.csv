The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Better than expected.
","Better than expected. The acting has improved and so has the intensity and the storyline. Was much expecting more action but it was fine. It was also great to see wolf telepathy and more dialogue and screening time from the wolf-pack and other cullens. the directing and pacing was alright, but it got a little bit boring and slow during the first half of the movie. There could've been much more execution from Jacob but all in all, it was a good try. Condon did a great work, much better than previous directions. I didn't expect much - but the movie did exceed my expectations - so 7/10. Will be expecting the 2nd installment. This is coming from a 13 year old.",7,4,12,18 November 2011
Hotel Transylvania," Hotel Transylvania: 7 Star Hotel.
","I thought this movie had a lot of potential and the trailer made it seem a lot better than what it was.The movie itself was good, but the story was weak, the characters were extremely annoying and there were many paths the story could've took but didn't unfortunately. My favorite part of the movie were the voices, they were brilliant! Adam Sandler did a great job as Dracula and everyone else in the cast were splendid. The special effects were my favorite. They were brilliant and executed well.So my summary is that the movie is good, has it's funny moments, it's boring moments and it's ridiculous moments. It has great visuals, a weak story and sometimes VERY annoying characters. (especially Jonathan)",7,7,23,20 September 2012
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows: Overshadowed
","I'm a big fan of Burton, Depp, & Bonham. But this excuse for a movie was bad and fairly confusing. The acting was top notch, the cast was amazing & the effects were tremendous. But the story/plot was weak, the accent (I did not understand 25% of what they were saying) and the subtleness was just...awful. I didn't expect that much 'adult humor' considering that it was a PG - 13 movie. My brother had me answering tons of questions related to the 'sexy time' scenes (as he had called them).Chloe Grace Moretz did a great job, but it was like she was trying to be a teenage prostitute or something. Her character was pretty lame. Helena Bonham Carter - like always - Oscar Worthy, but her character in the movie was a tad confusing. Her desire to become immortal because of beauty was a little bit eccentric and not believable. The only fairly good character was Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Her presence was a huge hit for me. It made me like the movie even more. Anyways, the movie was alright at its best. If it wasn't for the last 20 minutes of the movie, I would've gave it a 3 stars.",4,3,8,11 May 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Great, but..ehh.
","The movie was overall: great. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. Hogwarts and the way the directors and screen writers had shown it was brilliant! But there were many let downs; the style of Yate's directing is simply 'let's just get to the point.' There were a few good and bad things. I'll name just a few:Good: Neville was really good. Liked him. Gringotts was well directed. The acting was at a great standard. The battles were quite good, could be a little better. Costumes were brilliant McGonnagal's fight scene against SnapeBad: They should have showed a few more memories of Snape. I was looking forward to Hermione, Luna and Ginny battling Bellatrix before Molly stepping it. They should have allowed a little more dialog; Bellatrix taunting Molly about the death of George. It was too vague and too fast. You would've missed Bellatrix spell hitting Ginny if you blinked at the wrong time. I was also expecting McGonnagal's, Slughorn's and Kingsley's battle with Voldemort. Hagrid hadn't showed any real emotion when Harry 'died'. There were no real strong interactions with the characters except the trio. Bellatrix, Luna, Lucius (and many more) was left out with their brilliant acting and weren't really shown much throughout the movie. They should have added little cameos of The Divination teacher enchanting the magical balls and throwing them at the Death Eaters, a few Hogmeades villagers fighting against Death Eaters, other creatures coming to help etc. Another disappointment was the death's of main/side characters. Fred's, Tonks and Lupins death was a disappointment. They just...'died'. Nothing more, nothing less. They didn't even give us time to grieve or look back at anything. Well overall, the movie was great. But, they could have added just 10 minutes to the movie to allow more emotions and depth to it.",10,0,0,2 August 2011
