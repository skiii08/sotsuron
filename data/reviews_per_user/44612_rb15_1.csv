The Blair Witch Project," Disappointingly amateurish!!
","The hype preceding the opening led me to believe this movie would be a nail biting, edge of your seat frightener.It turns out to be something my grade nine nephew and buds could have been attempting to make for a school project.If you were blonde and fourteen you may still be laying awake nights, otherwise the movie was a deceptive time waster.",1,2,4,15 July 2001
