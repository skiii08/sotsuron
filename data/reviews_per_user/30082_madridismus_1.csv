The Expendables 2," Van Damme was The Bad Guy Jean Villain
","The last time I can think Jean-Claude Van Damme (JCVD) played the bad guy role was as Ivan Kraschinsky the Russian in No Retreat, No Surrender back in 1986. It's ironic because Expendables II takes place it old Soviet military zones. His role as Jean Villain beckons his former brilliance with great kicks and fighting style. The only thing you wished for in this film was that he kicked more and had some more beat downs showing his dominance in order to achieve what he wants and the way he wants RESPECT! There is a big fight scene at the end, but that is about it. He has his mercenaries do the job most of the time with guns.The opening scene of the film was excellent, in fact awesome. But there is a gap of action in the middle of the film with meaningless drama. This should of been filled with Van Damme action. They should of created a little more drama in the middle of the film with Church, the girl, and Corporate Conspiracies. The film is too predictable in some ways.JCVD has noted in some interviews that he thought Sly should of altered the script more than he did for him, but he did not wish to push this matter because he has become Expendable in his acting career and needs the work. But if you see the film JCVD is no way Expendable. Van Damme is In-expendable! He is by far the most exciting asset in the film altogether.If it was re-done or there's a part III I heard, I think Sly should of stay at the intensity of the opening scene throughout to the end with some sort of climax in the middle. Trickery is good to mix in.If there is an Expendables III, add Matt Damon into the mix. Maybe he can be the sniper's (Billy) brother. Or add Billy Zane! Rocky Johnson would be interesting. Dennis Rodham or Wesley Snipes also would be interesting all into the mix as bad guys I think. I heard Steven Seagal would like in, but as a good guy. I think the third one should be a little crazier plot, double agents, double crossing, test of the mercenaries wills, loyalty, also the money needs to make more sense. 5 million for a kilo of plutonium or whatever, does not seem like a enough these days to get off the couch. Up the ante, instead of millions, let's have billions at stake. So bigger dogs, leave the cats at home, also add conflicting bad guys, usu. they are fighting for the same bone. If the actors are making more money than the professional mercenaries and bosses that makes no sense. And cash currency is not enough, let's talk gold, intellectual property, secrets, etc.",8,2,5,1 September 2012
