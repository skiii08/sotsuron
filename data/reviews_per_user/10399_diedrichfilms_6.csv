Requiem for a Dream," Grotesque and Original, Requiem for a Dream has made its mark on the world
","Please disregard as many low reviews as you can. The overwhelming majority is contrived and show no real knowledge on what they're talking about.The film starts off as a simple, flat story until their first disaster strikes. This is called the Act 1 climax. The first tough break in the main characters happens and they are sent spiraling into the second act. This is when they lose their money in the box, as well as everything else along with it. The film goes against the majority of all other storytelling ideas of: Act 1 and 3 are short, and Act 2 is long. The film reverses it, making the beef of the film the first and third acts. Most would say it is insane to do so.To go into more depth, the music is pristine. The effect music has on our interpretation of a film is possibly the most important piece. Many filmmakers pay little to no attention to that aspect, but it seems to be the majority of time was spent on composing and collecting the music for the film.The film's imagery is immaculate. Many will say the film was made to show imagery, but on the contrary, it is nearly impossible to truthfully say so, as the imagery, however grotesque and bitter, is still woven strictly into the storyline as just an aesthetic add-on.For the fourth section, the film isn't only very well made, but most of the facts you see are true. The story shows the extents people will go to get that next high. The ways shown in the film are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. There are so many more things to go along with sex trafficking and amputated limbs.Many low-rate reviews are focusing on a few points of the movie that the writers felt were 'bad parts.'1. I've read many reviews pointing out that the doctor toward the end wouldn't treat Harry, and that could result in his receiving a lawsuit and that it is unreasonable to think a doctor wouldn't treat a patient, especially in the condition he was in. In actuality, that sort of thing happens all the time. When an obvious drug-abuser is sitting in your hospital, you have a choice: run the risk of killing the patient; not knowing what drugs they were using and giving them a specific medicine may turn fatal. As a doctor, being the catalyst of someone's death is not on your top 10 list. So it makes sense not to treat Harry at that time, because it was obvious that there was no over-dosage, so leaving him be wouldn't kill him.2. Many also said that the pimp for Marian was an idiot to pay for hookers with drugs. Again, that's incorrect. This happens more often than not. He doesn't pay for reputable hookers. He pays for girls who have a lack of a better idea. Marian is given his phone number as a 'shove it' move from Harry, but she later acts upon being given that number. As she is in desperate 'need' of drugs, she is willing to do anything for them. Hence, her lesbian sex scene.3. Sara Goldfarb and Harry Goldfarb's relationship is forced. Reading this idea, I was, at first, confused. The relationship is contrary to what the popular belief on the subject is. Sara is aware of Harry's problem in the opening of the film. She knows he's a drug-addict, but doesn't quite understand how she's fueling his ability to be one. When she ends up becoming one herself (when Harry visits her), she doesn't notice her behavior because she hasn't been around her son's drug-abusive behavior, so it slips from her mind. She finally realizes her problem at the very end of the film when she walks out and sees her friends sitting at the table. This, again, slips her mind when she is watching her show in the asylum.4. Finally, the 'I want to be on TV piece is poorly motivated.' I've read countless times that being on a TV show wouldn't do anything for her. This was the hardest one to swallow, because that means the central idea of Sara has been lost for so many people who viewed the film, which is by far the reason the film was so well done. Sara Goldfarb has lost her husband, and her son. When Harry visits her and she says 'I lost you,' she is not referring to him being away. She is giving her confession that she knows what he would do with the TV and that she knows what he would do with the money he got from the TV. The whole time, she had hidden from him the fact that she knew. This is why she wants to be on television, because she knows that when she tells Harry, it'll be all over. We see how this affects him, due to his physical appearance, and his mental instability from that point on to either end of the film. She wants to be 'on her show' because that's the last thing she can look forward to, as well as her last chance to help Harry get away from his addiction, however it backfires on her, and she ends up getting an addiction herself.With a film so well thought out, and perfectly finished; polished with the shiniest substances, you may wonder why so many low ratings are given, but it is simply due to peoples' lack of observation in the film.",10,1,2,19 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the best Star Wars movies
","This movie is actually good. Beautiful choreography paired with amazing cinematography, although there are some pretty bad lines, give this film an amazing feel. Although you don't need this film to finish the rest of the saga, likable characters and amazing saber fights with dips and dives not imagined will have you wanting to see more. Arguably the best of the prequels of the amazing adventure of a series. Watch this movie without adding it to the rest of the movies to get the best feel and an amazing standalone film. Don'fall into the bandwagon of hating this movie! I loved it as you will too. Of you liked any of the Star Wars movies, you'll understand how good this film really is.",8,5,6,12 May 2016
The Hateful Eight," Possibly Tarantino' Best!
","I know a lot of people are degrading the new Tarantino movie, but without watching it for yourself, you'll never know for sure if they're right. This film shows the amazing director Quentin really is. Although there is a gay sex scene, top much profanity, and a ton of guts, you should be able to look past it. But also... What Tarantino movie doesn't have a ton of guts and language? Beautiful cinematography and choreography. This film beats the great, yet confusing storyline of Pulp Fiction, the action packed revenge story of Django Unchained, and the horror classic, Deathproof. Although there isn't very much action, it is made up for in surprises, dialogue, and suspense. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed!",10,2,5,12 May 2016
Suicide Squad," Wonderful film!
","Suicide Squad great film showing just how complicated the DC universe can be. With wonderful performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie, as well as terrific special and practical effects, David Ayer really comes through. Although critics hate it, the film does have beautiful cinematography and great action-packed choreography. It is definitely better than its previously made partner film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, however it does have its own subtle flaws. It is a very odd film and is executed almost perfectly. Do go watch this movie, it will definitely be worth your tine and money! You will NOT be disappointed, even through its few flaws. This film begins with somewhat sleepable work and finishes strong with the final piece!",4,2,4,5 August 2016
The Number 23," Purely and Utterly Genius
","The Number 23 is a well-paced, cunning thriller that has you on the edge of your seat almost the entire time. With great performances by Jim Carrey and Virgonia Madsen, the story of Walter Sparrow, a local animal control officer, turns dark when he is bitten by a dog, making him late to pick up his wife, Agatha, in front of a used book store. Tired of waiting, she decides to go inside. She finds a book titled 'The Number 23: A Novel of Obsession,' written by a mysterious man that goes by the name of Topsy Kretts. After skimming through the book, she decides to buy it for Walter as a birthday gift. Walter, hoping it is a fun read, finds the sinister twists it has to offer, while implanting the number 23 in his head. He starts obsessing over the number, trying his relationship with Agatha, and pushing on his mental stability. This movie is geniusly created, showing close to no signs of 23 in the beginning, and toward the end, every small corner you may turn to, there is a new 23 just waiting to happen. From colors to the alphabet to dialogue, 23 is shown in every place it can.",10,2,4,12 May 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not as good as critics say, but not as bad as you may think
","The one-shot film Birdman, however is meant as satire, doesn't fully prove its worth. Although it is very impressive and very funny, the first act is hard to stay awake through, as well as the last act being a struggle to understand. Michael Keaton does come through with a wonderful performance, as well as Edward Norton. The overuse of 'f*ck,' however, dumbs-down the greatness. The comedy is quite amusing and the one-shot look (however there are cuts in the end) definitely is astounding the genius needed in the cameraman, editor, director, and most of all, the actors. Everything needed in a satirical film, such as Birdman, is definitely present, however it just doesn't all perfectly add- up as you may have hoped. This is still a good movie, just not great. Definitely one to watch, but definitely not one to be overjoyed to see, or obsess about.",3,1,1,5 August 2016
