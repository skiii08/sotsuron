Ford v Ferrari," Hollywood, But in a Good Way
","Yet another example that the adjective 'Hollywood' is not always a pejorative. This movie had all of the elements of a big Hollywood blockbuster: a noble goal, two attractive protagonists fighting against the odds, an evil power-broker, and a wrench. The wrench part only makes sense if you've seen the movie, although I wouldn't classify this as a spoiler.It's based on a true story, but there probably isn't any more history to back this up than there was for the Star Wars movies, but we get it. As facile and clichÃ© as this was at times, there were some great performances and just enough solid drama and humor to pull it off. Like so many films these days, I thought it was a bit long at 2 hours and 32 minutes, but it wasn't intolerable.",8,2,3,4 January 2020
Moneyball," 'It's hard not to be romantic about baseball.' Impossible, perhaps.
","Whatever problem you may have with the accuracy of the history of the A's ascendency in baseball in the Billy Beane era, the movie rates as one of the finest films about the game—and that's saying a lot because there are a hell of a lot of good baseball movies. They certainly over-played Art Howe as the bad guy but fiction needs a villain, or something close to it. With the truth put aside the story is a great one and the major points are history. As James Thurber says, you can look it up. What makes it even more exciting for me is the fact that I was right there in Seattle watching—like a train wreck—as the A's took the lead in August with their spectacular 21 game streak.The acting and writing in the movie are sublime at every turn and some of the best examples come in the form of one-ended phone calls—usually with Brad Pitt shoving some sort of junk food in his pie hole.Just because the A's didn't win the World Series doesn't mean that moneyball doesn't work. Every team loses every yearexcept one, and that team is always a rich club. More than anything this movie screams out for revenue sharing in baseball because without the A's there can be no NY Yankees. Spanish soccer could definitely learn something from American football as 2-3 clubs seems to dominate here year after year (it's mostly Barça and Real Madrid).This is a brilliant observation I found in the forum from user tricksoftrade01: 'Rooting for the Yankees or the Red Sox is like cheering on the schoolyard bully who knocks down a smaller kid, steals their lunch money and then kicks them in the balls.'",10,1,4,15 December 2014
Blade Runner 2049," So Much Better than The Original and You Don't Have to Suffer Through as Much of the Wooden Harrison Ford
","There are so many whiny children out there crying because they made a sequel to their precious little film. Except it wasn't your movie. Blade Runner was hardly a masterpiece as the geeks keep saying. Harrison Ford and Sean Young must have been carved from the same tree to put in such completely wooden and uninspired performances. Ford has been brought back from the dead for one last (we hope) performance.Gosling is a million times better in this version and the sci fi story is superior to Dick's hack job.I'm just kidding about Blade Runner 2049 and the 10 stars. It's incredibly slow and stupid, mostly. I just wanted to get under the skin of the sci-fi dorks. The film was WAY too long.",10,1,7,31 December 2017
John Wick," How Do You Say 'Steaming Pile of Dung' in Russian?
","One sure way to spoil this movie is to watch it. Don't.One Star means awful, as it says here on IMDb. Yeah, that's about right, awful. Did I say awful? Sorry, I meant offalor did I mean fecal? John Wick is another 'action' movie obviously written by someone who built the script with the clichés of a couple dozen other lousy 'action' movies. Not a bit original or cool on any level.A summary: A murdering psychopath falls in love, quits his job, and becomes a sweet and lovable charmer who likes dogs. Wife dies. OK, even if that isn't the stupidest introduction to a character you don't need 12 minutes to say this on screen—the mistake of many hacks. For motivation you kill his dog and take his car? Really? Is that all you could think of? How long did it take the writer to come up with this gem? He kills 12 paid assassins who invade his home yet he gets his butt kicked by three punks? I guess he wasn't wearing his superman outfit. He kills a whole heck of a lot of people (I lost count after 17 or so). Most of them had nothing to do with killing his puppy or stealing his car.I kept waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen, something that wasn't a complete insult to the intelligence but it never came.",1,30,66,22 January 2015
The Death of Stalin," An Unlikely Story for a Comedy but Very Funny
",An incredible cast led by Steve Buscemi in one of his best roles-and he's had a lot of great roles. He gets the lion's share of the jokes along with Jason Isaacs in his role as Zhukov. This was such a great surprise and turned out to be one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a while. The film captures the lunatic paranoia of the USSR before and after the death of the great leader. Just the right touch of history but while taking the p*** at every step.,10,9,21,20 February 2018
Darkest Hour," The Role of Gary Oldman's Career, or Anyone's Career
","As intimate a look at Churchill as we may ever see-something only possible in fiction (sometimes called a bio-pic). Gary Oldman portrays the statesman as he moves into power at one of the crucial junctures in human history. Had things gone against Churchill who the hell knows what would have become of the world? It's worth the price of admission just for the scene when the Prime Minister takes the underground in an effort to get a feel for the will of the people. Of course, this scene paves the way for one of the most moving speeches in recorded history and one of Britain's proudest moments, if not the proudest.",10,1,6,21 February 2018
Just Go with It," Dumb and Offensive
","Why do people always say 'I just want to be entertained' when talking about a horrible movie? As if anything that isn't completely moronic couldn't possibly be entertaining. This movie didn't have a single shred of honesty or humanity. The plot seemed to come directly from some Microsoft program that creates boilerplate scenarios for lame romantic comedies. And why does every movie have to be about rich creeps? I'm certainly no Bolshevik but I am thoroughly sick of watching movies about people who live in mansions and spend $1,000 on a single pair of shoes. When was the last time you saw a movie about someone who had a normal job?",1,55,116,2 April 2011
Spotlight," Child Molesting Priests: Worst Human Filth in History!
","Why the FBI didn't attack the Catholic Church like they did the mafia is a mystery to me. They could have used the RICO act to convict dozens of high-ranking officials for the disgusting criminal conspiracy that they worked feverishly to cover-up at every step along the way. Although I am a life-long atheist I grew up in a Catholic family and was forced to go to mass every Sunday. Of course, the priests wouldn't have preyed on a kid like me because my father would have beat them to death with a bible had he found out. This film describes how priests chose children from broken families and on boys who showed signs of homosexuality. This isn't about some priests smoking pot or betting on football games; this is about men using their exalted status as servants of their church to rape children. Catholics who deny this horrible abuse are accessories in these horrible of crimes, a crime which even among prison inmates is the lowest, vilest act.Spotlight does the job that the press has largely been unable to do in recent years: bring an important story to light. Since the days when the story first broke in the Boston Globe the print media has been ripped to pieces by budget cuts and only a couple of truly good newspapers exist in America today. So who will do this sort of investigation in the future? More than likely it just won't be done because TV news doesn't have the patience to investigate anything other than a terrorist bombing or a celebrity sighting.Michael Keaton was the big surprise for me in this film. I've always considered him more of a comedian than an actor but I'll have to update his status in my thinking. Liev Schreiber is brilliant as the voice of reason at every step in the process.",8,1,3,13 January 2016
Juno," Not as Good as the Sum of Its Parts
","First of all, if these kids are so clever, how do they manage to get her knocked-up from a one-time fling? Weren't they paying attention in sex ed? The boy is supposed to be some sort of science geek yet he doesn't understand the consequences of ejaculating inside of his BFF?Secondly, she doesn't get an abortion because she didn't like the magazines in the clinic (among other, petty complaints)? Buck up and have the procedure. Just because you have a kid and then hand it over to someone else to raise, doesn't mean you've done the world or anyone any favors. The kid will always wonder why you abandoned them. No aborted fetus ever did that.As I said in the title, while I liked many parts of the movie, the message was sort of creepy an irresponsible.",6,1,3,28 March 2020
Concussion," Football Fans Have to Watch this Movie
",Football is an exceptionally violent game. Everyone already knows that. The violent aspects of the game are one of its biggest selling points. The same is true of hockey. I almost forgot about boxing. The fans love the violence. The fans need to know the consequences of the violence on the field or on the ice or in the ring. I can't believe a parent would allow their child to participate in these dangerous activities. The movie does a great job of making this important story available and accessible to a wide audience. It also presents some pretty damning evidence against professional football but big companies acting badly isn't exactly news these days.,8,1,4,20 March 2016
Molly's Game," Hollywood's Top Writer Gives Us Brilliance from Start to Finish
","I was completely surprised by this movie, in a very good way. I generally don't like movies about gambling, a pastime I despise. And I really hate bio-pics, at least generally. What I like in movies, what I like in this movie, are people I like. I liked Molly, her lawyer, and every single person who sat down to play cards at her table. Even the very minor players had a fun story to tell, like the guy who brought an original Monet painting as his collateral for the buy-in. The film's structure is a terrific blend of getting the audience up to speed on the events of the story mixed with narrating everything that led up to the pot boiling over.",10,1,5,20 January 2018
Black Mass," Gangster Movies Are Officially Dead
","It's like every gangster movie made in the past 15 years is just a weak pastiche of previous gangster movies. Nothing new has been added to the genre in a long time and this film certainly isn't adding anything but canned dialogue and a pointless story. 'F you, you F-ing F bal. I'll kill you.' For me the roles have reversed between TV and movies. TV, once the ugly step-sister of feature films, has completely usurped the position of movies in modern pop culture. Movies just seemed overly formulaic, the character development is either lacking or forced, and there just isn't room for surprises.We start off with one of the central character's thugs being interviewed. A promising start but this kid all but disappears after the first couple of scenes. Why? Because there are WAY too many characters introduced in the film. The wives, the bosses, the cop's partner, the hit man, the cop's boss, the DA, and on and on. In a TV series this would be possible but not in a two hour movie (that seemed like four hours). How about having a better tory and many fewer characters?And just look at all those movie stars. Movie stars, at least to me, are a complete liability and watching a bunch of tired hacks sleep walk through an even more tired script like Black Mass isn't my idea of a good time. 'Look everyone, it's Johnny Depp! He's acting! He's really acting!' I just can't get beyond the fact that I'm looking at Johnny Depp and can never get to the point where I'm seeing a character. I also couldn't get past the fact that it looked like he was dressed up for Halloween as Freddie Krueger. I'll take the TV no-name actors every time.And please just stop it with the accents! I have dedicated my life to learning languages and nothing mugs me more than a phony accent. I have worked to perfect my accents in French and Spanish for years and years yet I would never try to pass myself off as a native.As I've said before, I wouldn't trade one episode of Breaking Bad for all of the movies I've seen in the past three years. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.",4,4,7,4 October 2015
Rush," Ron Howard Has Another Classic
","I don't even like Formula 1 and I thought that this was the best movie of 2013, at least of the films I have seen thus far. The two principal actors deserve whatever awards they give out for a profession hardly in need of giving out awards (actors are already rich and famous beyond most people's wildest dreams so why would they need to get prizes?).The story follows two F1 drivers in the 1976 season, something I remember as F1 was much more popular in the USA back then than it is now. I certainly remember Lauda's horrible accident. The film does a good job of telling the story while developing the two characters through a few memorable scenes. I especially liked the scene where Lauda is picked up hitchhiking.This is just great filmmaking from start to finish.",10,2,5,28 December 2013
Baby Driver," Murder and Mayhem as Bad Art
","How many chase scenes can you put in a single movie?Baby Driver. Can't believe the 8.2 rating on IMDb. I should give this a 4 Star rating but I'm trying to offset all of the grade inflation here.Stick with music videos if that's your thing.First scene: Is the kid some sort of retard? I LOVE to watch someone play air guitar. He drives away like a maniac so, of course, the cops are going to chase him. Had he driven like an old lady they would have cruised away unnoticed. It morphs into a completely stupid-as-can-be chase scene. He loses one car in some far-fetched manner only to have another car immediately on his bumper.Scene 2: They divvy up the money from the bank and one criminal, who is obviously a tough guy because he is wearing a black leather jacket which is what all tough guys wear, messes with the silent kid while the girl puts on a clinic of really bad acting and Kevin Spacey does his thing being the boss. Scenes after those two: Lip synching? Do criminals plan stuff out on a chalk board? The plan on the board looked like what an eight year old boy would imagine a criminal plan to be but the movie version of the heist of the truck looked like a five year old kid wrote it.A stylish shootout scene topped with what they think is witty banter: murder as art.And then the Post Office job got seriously stupid. What I like to call a Chinese Downhill.",1,41,86,13 September 2017
Salt," Completely Stupid from Start to Finish (I couldn't finish)
","This movie makes zero sense if that matters to you and it should matter. Because it sort of does to me and this thing is completely stupid and improbable at every step of the way.It starts off pretty stupid. They lost me with Lee Harvey being a Soviet double. Completely freaking stupid and done many, many times before.She wouldn't have run if she were innocent.A known Russian agent overpowers two security personnel in the elevator and disappears yet it's a pain in the butt for someone who works there to break out? They go in to a city apartment without knowing who is inside with concussion grenades. Just too over the top and stupid.She jumps on to a speeding semi and yet somehow the agent catches up in city traffic and has time to shoot her again? And then again after she jumps on to yet another truck going another direction. How does that happen? In the hotel she steals some random clothes from the rack. Do they fit? Who cares as this would have been the least stupid thing about this movie up until this point.She beats up two and three dudes at a time. Is this a comic book? She also seems never to kill the Americans she incapacitates. 'Part Two: we seize control of this country's atomic weapons.' OK, time for bed and I'm done with this pile of horse manure.",1,4,10,18 August 2016
Disturbia," Nothing Good Happens in Disturbia
","So the kid kills his dad in a car wreck because he's a lousy driver and was talking on the phone and tailgating another driver., then he punches out his Spanish teacher because he's too stupid to learn Spanish (it's the end of the year as the kids are talking about what they will do that summer, so the kid has had at least one full year of Spanish, yet he doesn't know anythin), then he treats his mother like a servant, he's just under 18 and can't take care of himself, and he's basically a brain-dead product of too much TV and video games. This is how the story begins. If the kid dropped dead, I think the world would be a better place for it.This set-up was just poorly written and conceived, and I'm only 16 minutes into it. If his father was such a great guy, why is his son a moron? Of course, the family is rich (their neighbors have a pool) because this is Hollywood and they probably think that people who live like this are middle class.Yet another story that is almost entirely predicated on the fact that no one closes their curtains, ever.The girl was gorgeous, but that just ain't enough to carry such mediocrity.",5,5,9,8 February 2020
Collateral," How Could Such a Good Movie Have Such a Terrible Ending?
","At the end of the very forgettable 1984 ski movie, Hot Dog, the protagonists decide to settle their quarrels by competing in a 'Chinese Downhill.' In one of the movie's few jokes, an Asian companion of the heroes—who has heretofore not uttered a word of English—asks, 'What the f#ck is a Chinese Downhill?' Allow me to answer that question. A Chinese Downhill is any movie ending that—lacking any shred of originality, purpose, or reason—simply devolves into a chaotic and completely stupid string of car chases, mindless violence, death, and mayhem. This boring cliché is to be expected of a low-rent mess of a movie like Hot Dog but some viewers expect something a little more sophisticated in big-budget productions, many of which make Hot Dog look like Citizen Kane. A paroxysm of bomb blasts and gunfire is a pretty lousy substitute for good writing; it's not even a substitute for really bad writing.Collateral has some brilliant moments and a couple of scenes that set it apart from any other action movie. The acting is top-notch all around with Tom Cruise putting in a stellar performance as the frightening and completely believable hit man. The shoot-out in the disco rates up there with the best shoot-outs in movie history, perhaps topped only by the botched bank heist in Mann's Heat. So why does he end the movie with the really stupid coincidence of the cab driver actually knowing one of the victims? The only thing stupider than this coincidence is the final chase scene and totally unbelievable shoot-out on the train. Heat also had a completely stupid ending, if you will remember which ruined what was a really great movie.So, in review, don't end a movie with a Chinese downhill.",6,5,7,1 April 2016
No Country for Old Men," Flawed but Fun
","I had read No Country for Old Men in Spanish a couple of years ago and although I liked it very much I found the story to be unconvincing in many places. I read it again this morning in one sitting, this time in English after watching the movie last week. The book and the movie are both brilliant but I was left with the same problems in the story line. Had I been asked to advise the Coen brothers I would have told them to end the movie with the scene when Chirugh returns the money to whomever he was working for (a scene left out of the film).Some of the major events that compelled the plot just didn't make much sense. First of all, there is just no way in hell that the protagonist would have returned to the scene of the drug deal massacre just to give a man—probably dead by now—a drink of water. And why, when he kept getting found in hotels, did he keep staying in hotels? Was he afraid to camp out for a bit? If the character had a lick of sense at all this detail was left out of the book and the movie. He made one mistake after another until he ran out of mistakes.I think that McCarthy is a terrific writer and his conversations in this short book prove this over and over. I don't think it would kill him to use a bit more punctuation but that's just how he wants to write so what can we do? I suppose his style works but sometimes he sacrifices clarity for style. The main purpose of grammar and punctuation is clarity.I think that one of the things that I like best about the book is the idea of someone having to disappear. It's a fun thing to consider, at least for me. I remember ten years ago, maybe more, a guy who worked for an armored car company made off with one of the trucks and something like $20 million in cash. He got away clean, at least at first. Months later, pretty much after the police had given up, he was captured by Wells Fargo agents who were tracking him for the company he had worked for. The guy had put a gun on his partner and tied him up. He transferred the cash to a van which he drove from Florida to (I believe it was) South Carolina. He ditched most of the cash in a self-storage unit, drove to the border, and crossed into Mexico.The problem was it was a one man job and he had no way to access the money other than return to the States and get it himself. I don't think he liked it in Mexico much because he shouldn't have even needed money so soon after the robbery. Had he stayed away a bit longer he probably could have seriously reduced his chances of capture upon returning for more money. I doubt that the people whose money he took would give up on him, not after stealing that much, but after a while their passion for the crime would diminish. Anyway, he made out better than the character in No Country for Old Men.I've dabbled enough in crime fiction and movies to know that an important thing is to stay disappeared directly after the crime. The last thing you want to do is exactly what Lewellyn did in the book which was to drive back to the scene of the crime. How stupid would you have to be to leave your vehicle near the scene? It's easy to track the owner of a vehicle and it's even easier to see it out in the middle of the desert. I just think that McCarthy could have found a better plot device for Lewellyn getting found out by the thugs than his own stupidity. I suppose I understand the author's motivations, I just don't agree with them.So in review, if you are being pursued by pitiless psychopaths, don't leave behind anything that leads directly back to you—like your truck , you idiot. And you definitely want to stay away from hotels if you are on the run. Most of them these days require identification and perhaps a credit card. You may as well ask to sleep in the city jail.Lewellyn took over $2 million from the drug dealers which can buy you a lot of options. Of course, you can't travel by air unless you want your name showing up, ditto with renting a car or using any vehicle remotely traceable back to you. In No Country for Old Men he didn't plan on taking the money, he just happened on it by chance. This means he had no time to make a plan and little time to dream one up as events occurred. He should have stayed with his wife as there wasn't much advantage in splitting up and possibly double the risk.",8,2,5,31 December 2013
Non-Stop," Whodunnit? Who cares?
","It's easy to keep people guessing about who-done-it if the premise is completely freaking stupid and this premise was completely freaking stupid. Everything about it was really stupid from the very start. Planting red herrings right and left is no excuse for a script.The plot is absurd. That's a bad place to begin.Why? Why? Why in the hell would he trust a woman he had only just met? Because she is one of the red herrings. And, of course, there is the good Muslim to be mistrusted by all.Just when he wants to see who is texting they hit turbulence. Darn!He roughs up an innocent passenger for no decent reason. The plane goes ballistic and he hits the ceiling? Because the pilot croaked? Since when do pilots even fly the damn plane? And all of this happens before it goes completely overboard on intelligence-insulting crazy stupidity.",1,13,24,14 June 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Lots to Love with Some Annoyances
","Spoilers, Ho! The first scene in the Normandy cemetery of Saving Private Ryan is enough to put me on my knees and from there it gets even more emotional as we see the faces of the troops about to be the first to set foot on Omaha Beach which has since become a synonym of hellish warfare. It's hard for me to watch anything about vets of WWII without losing it. Just the damn trailer for Saving Private Ryan deserves an Academy Award. Brilliant.The acting is great to not-so-great depending on the actors (and non-actors). I think you call it 'screen presence' wherein you like seeing some people while others make you cringe. Great: Tom Sizemore, Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovani Ribisi, Matt Damon, Adam Goldberg. I won't go into detail on those I didn't like but to contrast the cast of this movie just take a look at Band of Brothers. I loved every character in that series. I just jotted down a few thoughts as I watched this classic for the umpteenth time: The initial fight for the beach was about as intense as movies about war can be.Although a visual masterpiece, the scene of the official car going to the home of the slain soldiers was a bit over-the-top as far as Americana. She should have been baking an apple pie. Any home in American, any crappy flat in New York would have served the same purpose without being quite as maudlin.Vin Diesel couldn't get killed too soon for me. Had he met his maker during the opening credits would have been better but this was soon enough.There is no freaking way they would have let that German soldier go. He would have picked up the first available weapon and continued fighting.The pansy translator kid was terrible, both he and his role. I didn't like anything about him and the film would have been better without this character. There is a right and a wrong way to do smarmy.Dying sucks, we get it already. I just thought they over-did this a bit. I realize this is a movie about one of the bloodiest wars ever but the long, drawn-out death scenes became corny and not dramatic.There were a couple of great moments in the film. When Tom Hanks sort of splits through the tension verging on mutiny with the story of where he is from and what he did was the best of scene in the film. Matt Damon's dialogue about the last night with his brothers could have used a little work (the story about his brother trying to screw some ugly chick in the barn). It was a poor bit of writing.",10,2,6,17 August 2016
The Pianist," Perhaps the Best Film About the Holocaust*
",*and that's saying a heck of a lot.I saw the movie first and then read the book. Polanski did an uncanny job of bringing the book to the big screen. It is such a compelling story as are almost all of them on this subject. I'm sure that I'm not alone in my fascination with the horrors of WWII and the Nazi rise to power. I would have found it hard to live with myself had I escaped death in Eastern Europe without killing at least one Nazi bastard.This movie portrays the Nazi era more accurately than any film I have ever seen. An unflinching and brutal film that only surfaced after the book was republished after the fall of the communist era.,10,0,1,26 March 2016
JFK," A Complete Lie from Opening Credits until the Last Frame
","This entire movie is a preposterous lie from start to finish. It's based upon the lunatic fantasies of a New Orelans district attorney and Stone's final conclusions made me laugh out loud in the theater. It's all just so incredibly silly except when you realize that most Americans believe in one stupid conspiracy theory or another regarding the death of JFK. Read the Warren Report. or better yet, read Vincent Bugliosi's definitive book on the subject and stop making a fool of yourself by parroting the lies found in this ridiculous excuse for a drama. The worst thing about this movie is how he presents it almost as if it were a documentary when, in fact, it has little bearing on the truth. Stone should be ashamed of himself.",1,4,22,17 December 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Mediocre, But Still Better than Most Films Lately
","Better than most films today, but that isn't saying much in superhero and comic book land that is Hollywood today.It was too long and rather pointless, but somehow compelling. Tarantino can do that, make a 3-hour movie that is mostly stupid but it's entertaining. I can't even explain it except the actors are good. It's almost like a magic act in which the Great Tarantino pulls away his cape and three hours have passed. Taa Daaa! Where has the time gone. However, Tarantino's walk down memory lane was mostly way too slow. Had this movie clocked in at the appropriate 90 minutes, I think it would have been greatly improved, but who am I?The golden age of Hollywood? Not really, and definitely not a good time for TV. Sorry Tarantino, The FBI was the worst TV show in history, even as a bored-as-hell kid I couldn't make myself watch it. I'd rather be water-boarded than forced to watch an episode of that TV turd. Now he wants to resurrect the career of Sharon Tate, as he did for Pam Greer (and others).So, it was basically a 3-hour movie to justify a two-minute revenge fantasy about the Manson Family? Over-the-top violence because they are the Manson Family...except before the Sharon Tate murders, they were just stinky hippies so this violence was hardly apt. The Manson cult played the part of the Nazis in this story.",7,0,3,13 December 2019
The Lives of Others," One of the Top Films of the Decade in My Book
","I watched this movie again after reading Anna Funder's book, Stasiland, about life in East Germany under the paranoid psychopaths of the state security police. The film is a masterpiece of tragedy and hope and the triumph of good.One of the most moving scenes in this and in any movie is when he discovers that his copy of Brecht is missing which, of course, has been nicked by his nemesis/deus ex machina in the Stasi. We cut to him reading it at home. 'Can anyone who has heard this music, I mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?' From what I have read about the Stasi I doubt that anyone would have talked freely on a telephone line in this era but I could see how the writer, after years of keeping within the party lines, would think that his home was not under surveillance.'To think that people like you once ruled a country.' I had the same thoughts during the Bush/Cheney years in America.",10,4,7,27 August 2014
A Quiet Place," One Side of a Rush Album Would've Killed Them All
","A film has two elements: the visuals and the dialogue. When you take away one entire element you had better have a better reason for denying viewers this crucial half of movies than monsters who don't like noise. This was interminable and it only lasted an hour and a half. It could have been a decent half hour Twilight Zone episode, instead it was a huge bore. instead of watching 'A Quiet Place' I would have preferred listening to the classic easy listening song 'A Summer Place' for an hour and a half.And then we learn that you can blow these very unoriginal looking creatures away with a 12 gauge blast? What were they waiting for? And these noise-haters somehow defeated the armies of the world?Creatures who hunt by their hearing alone don't like loud noises? it takes these morons this long to understand that? They don't deserve to survive. Meanwhile, Jimmy Paige is playing his guitar in his backyard at full volume and doesn't understand why he isn't bothered by these pests.I can't believe so many people liked this movie.",1,14,30,22 May 2018
Amadeus," Amadeus Gets My Vote for the Best Movie of all Time
","It's been a few years since I've seen the film but that is unimportant as I know it like the back of my hand as I do the life and music of Mozart. The movie came first, however. The first piece that I ever played on the piano was the andante middle movement of Mozart's first piano sonata, a piece that doesn't feature in the film but the movie drove me out of my status as a musical dilettante and into the ranks of musicians—granted, a crappy musician but a musician nonetheless. I wonder how many other viewers were so heavily influenced my Amadeus.As good as the performances are in Amadeus (and they are all superb) the real star is the music of Mozart. For many people I am quite certain that the movie was their introduction to the greatest composer who has ever handed down music. It isn't the music alone that makes this joining of music and film so successful but the way in which we are presented with the music, the way Milos Forman deconstructs Mozart's genius for the benefit of those of us without the benefit of a lifetime of musical training. This is especially highlighted in the scene in which Salieri views the young composer's work as he reads it on the music stand (K 361 Gran Partita).'He's taking the conventions but slightly rearranging them to produce an effect of surprise but he's not rearranging them to such an extreme extent that he loses contact with his audience and this is really, absolutely at the essence of Mozart.' This is an unattributed quote from a documentary on the composer which wonderfully describes his music in a single sentence. Amadeus is two hours and 40 minutes but it also precisely defines just what it is about Mozart that made him exactly what he was, is, has become, and will always be for everyone who appreciates music.",10,1,3,5 January 2017
Unknown," The Steven Seagal Awards
","This award recognizes the lowest depths of acting in the genre of action movies, in honor of the master of horrifically terrible action films, Steven Seagal. This is a lifetime achievement award and we regret that there can only be a single winner, and we've had the impossible task of choosing only one actor with so many to choose from.In fact, after narrowing it down to two people, we will ask the general public to vote for their favorite actor responsible for making truly godawful and forgettable movies.Nicolas Cage or Liam NeesonAfter viewing this horrendously stupid movie, we have decided, by a unanimous vote, to present the award to Mr. Neeson. This in no way takes away from the miserable films in the Nicolas Cage oeuvre, but Unknown went to the lowest common denominator, and then dug several kilometers deeper into stupidity heretofore unknown in cinema.This film also wins the award for the worst chase scene ever to make it on film.",1,1,7,27 August 2019
K-19: The Widowmaker," Harrison Ford Talks with a Moronic Russian Accent
","This is everything that you need to know about this movie and the only reason you need to avoid it at all costs. Do you understand?

Pawn Sacrifice," Almost Nothing to Do with the Game of Chess
","In 1993 Bobby Fischer was arrested for playing handball with his own poop. When the police interrupted he was ahead 7-3. He would have won! Idiot-savant Bobby Fischer was really good at a board game. Americans—rightly so—mostly believed that chess was nothing more than a game, like bridge or Monopoly® and chose to pay more attention to other silly games like baseball and football. Bobby Fischer came along and for a brief moment in American history a lot of people feigned interest in chess. Fischer won some tournaments and then quickly went off the deep end and you have the feeling that he was a lunatic who probably walked around with a steaming load of crap in his pants as he played chess games in his head against an imaginary opponent.Instead of the film's long music video sequences which attempt to capture Fischer's Asperger's Syndrome or whatever the hell was wrong with him it would have been infinitely more interesting to see a little more than a stereotypical view of his Russian opponent.Speaking of the music, it was totally dreadful for most of the film and I found it confusing and distracting. I realize that they were trying to add a historical perspective with the music but it came across to me as amateurish and irritating and not even slightly relevant to the matter at hand which is chess. Fischer's personal mental state was absolutely the least interesting aspect of this story yet that's the main focus of the film. The historical significance of the events and how chess became—at least briefly—an important phenomenon in America and how Fischer became a household name seems to me to be a more important and a much more interesting subject for a film.The least interesting thing about this guy was his mental illness. Chess, on the other hand, can be intriguing to most people with even a rudimentary knowledge of the game but it takes a skilled storyteller to pull this off. I would direct you to Martin Cruz Smith's novel Stalin's Ghost. The author's description of a speed chess tournament (called a blitz) is absolutely the finest writing about the game that I have ever come across. Movies try to make chess exciting by having players hurl pieces around the board and slam the clock after moves but this short episode in a book that has little to do with the game is positively thrilling. It is truly a masterpiece of writing. And maybe they could have talked a lot more about the game of chess which was barely broached in the film.P.S. I know that I said this before but the music in this was just about the worse use of music I've ever seen in a film.",5,2,5,24 December 2016
War Machine," 'Please, Leave Now.'*
","*Words of an Afghan villager to the American general.That says it all. We should have never gone in the first place. They criticize Obama—at least obliquely—but I think Obama wanted no part of these wars that he didn't instigate. When he took office the military elite treated him like an ignorant child and I think Obama just said, 'OK. I'll let you idiots own these completely failed wars.' If you are still blaming Obama for these nightmares then you are a complete idiot or an amnesiac.It isn't a very cinematic depiction of war but it could be the most realistic telling of how wars are fought that has ever been put on film. Of course, I'm not including documentaries and this would have been much better as a documentary. Just why this wasn't a documentary or why they didn't call General McCrystal by name seems like a mistake to me.War isn't cool or sexy, the way it's portrayed in dung heaps like American Sniper films of that ilk that glorify killing and mayhem.Our military leaders since WWII have been the very worst of our elite in America, even worse than our financial leaders who are thieving scoundrels with the morals of snakes. Our military leaders are blind half-wit unable to learn from their many, many mistakes over the past 70 years and almost every move they have made has been a mistake.McCrystal was exactly the delusional creep that the reporter in the film calls out: 'As an elected representative of the people of Germany it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check. You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war and this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition. This is the great moment of your life.It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious. It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.' Just what did our military elite think would be the result of our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq? They couldn't give a straight answer to the American public and the Bush administration tip-toed around anything that hinted at predictions. They ridiculed reporters who asked them for predictions. Isn't a lack of predictions evidence of a lack of a plan?So instead of any coherent strategy they gave us platitudes about facing evil. In the film before the General's big plan we get a rousing and moronic locker room speech reminiscent of Henry V and then a chaplain gives an even more moronic and insipid prayer.(Perhaps you should begin by rereading the Rolling Stone article that shanghaied the career of the general. For the July 8, 2010 piece Google: rolling stone mcchrystal)",10,4,12,29 May 2017
Taken," Father Keeps Daughter from Her Dream of Being a Tramp
","Yet another entry in the 'Violence if Fun' series. The hilarious thing about modern cinema is that you can't kill a dog in a movie but you can murder 1,000 people and viewers won't bat an eye.This movie spawned a flood of even worse imitations so it's sort of like the new Die-hard. I can't believe how popular this is considering that it doesn't make much sense from start to finish. First of all, white slavery does exist but almost all of the women are from poor countries and are lured away by promises of jobs. Kidnapping a middle class America girl just wouldn't be a prudent venture for scumbags.Liam Neeson is a bit long in the tooth for this project, at least in my opinion. He's like 50 years old and he's constantly diving through windows or jumping off a five meter wall.Then there is the matter of how he manages to shoot and kill about 50 dudes yet he seems impervious to bullets. In one scene he jumps behind a sofa for cover. That's like a little kid hiding behind a curtain with his feet showing below. The hand-to-hand fight scenes were a mix of old kung fu movies and an 11 year old child's idea of how a fight goes down (or are those two the same thing?.",1,1,6,9 April 2017
La La Land," Charming as can be, visually stunning, but falls flat musically
","This movie is so sweet that it's almost impossible to criticize. With that said I felt that the music fell well below the standards of the rest of the elements of the film. Even when simply lumped with other film scores La La Land doesn't rate very high and alongside musicals it fares rather poorly. There is nothing approaching a show-stopper and the background score is repetitive and facile yet these musical weaklings are meant to propel us through long swaths of the narrative. I would say the same thing about the dancing; it's cute but not compelling enough to fill a scene. Perhaps at 2 two hours and eight minutes they were being overly-ambitious.At their best the song numbers were pastiches of Irving Berlin. The thing is, if you can't write a song half as good as Cheek to Cheek then just steal a song.This reminded so much of El Otro Lado de la Cama (2002) by Emilio Martínez-Lázaro and written by David Serrano, although the Spanish film lacked the productions values of La La Land. The idea was cute enough and she seems like a nice enough kid but Emma Stone really doesn't have what it takes to pull off an old fashioned solo shot in close-up. Who does, really? And once again, the song just wasn't remarkable on any level. The idea was cute enough.The seven note phase of the theme song—as well as the rest of it—just didn't cut it for me and by the final scene I was completely sick of it. And no one would have clapped at the end of his lame piano recital—people who like jazz know good music. There was some memorable dialogue that was fighting in a higher weight class than the music. 'Hollywood worships everything but respects nothing.' The story was as predictable as anyone would/could imagine: boy meets girl, the share their dreams and fall in love, dreams don't go according to plan, boy says nasty things to girl, et cetera. I didn't expect much more but I expected just a tiny bit more. Their break up scene was maudlin and derivative—at best—and on top of that he burned dinner.The photography was wonderful at every step and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce must be positively thrilled. The city has never looked better in any film that I have ever seen.So when I have so many problems big problems with a film why would I give it eight stars? I have at least as many reasons to love the movie as I have criticisms. First of all, as I stated above, it is super sweet. Any movie that doesn't give a starring role to a gun is OK in my book. The next important thing is that I love jazz.",8,1,7,16 January 2017
Groundhog Day," Better than Frank Capra
",This is just about the greatest film ever made. It is absolutely perfect. Harold Ramis is a lot funnier than Frank Capra and this movie is like an intelligent version of It's a Wonderful Life (a film I detest). With this movie we realize that Bill Murray is a really fine actor and the movie is a true classic.I actually started to play the piano because of this film and although I never became the pianist Bill Murray is in that great scene I have enjoyed every bit of the experience. We have choices in life. You can either be petty and mean or you can go out and make something of a decent person of yourself. Start today.,10,2,6,20 July 2013
Limitless," What a Blast!
","This film gets 10 stars simply because the idea is so cool, at least to me. The book was OK but I'm glad that I saw the film first to see the improved form of the book. I often wonder how a writer would change a book after publication if given the opportunity. On a personal level I never feel that much of what I write is beyond improvement. It's such a great fantasy and who hasn't thought of being the best person they could possibly be? I think that I actually reach this point, at least sometimes and for a fleeting moment. But what if you could do a lot better? That's what this film explores.This thing is brilliantly paced and the story picks you up and flies you away almost like the viewer is experiencing the same high as the protagonist. Eddie Morro, thanks to this incredible drug, becomes a sort of modern Superman who is cooler, smarted, and hipper than Superman could ever imagine. There are some menacing villains just like in Superman tales, and there is a beautiful woman. Call me simple but that's all the makings of a great movie.The only thing that bothered me in the film as well as the book was that given almost infinite mental powers he chooses to enter the stock market? I just wonder how the same story could play out if he went another direction with his powers. Perhaps the TV series can explore this further. I can't get enough of the story. I wish that I had thought of it first.",10,1,2,10 October 2015
Sicario," One Character Away from Being a Great Film
","In this case the character was the star of the movie. Ditch Emily Blunt and it's a great thriller.I'm not much of a fan of movies these days as episodic television series have usurped the entertainment role formerly held by features, at least how I see things. I didn't expect to like this movie at all but I didn't allow my negative preconceptions to get in the way of enjoying the heck out of most of the film. The scenes were mostly brilliant and everything you should expect from a big-budget Hollywood thriller. The long sequence of the SUV convoy into very hostile Juárez territory ranks right up there with any action scene ever. I found myself staring in amazement at many shots in the film: a desert sky at night, ominous clouds on the horizon, drone shots of a barren landscape, and many more. A visual masterpiece! It's too bad this movie wasn't made into a series instead as its two hour runtime just wasn't nearly enough to tell this complex story. The characters played by Benicio del Toro and Brolin were only vague hints of what they could have been given a lot more time. The Mexican cop, Silvio, took up way too much screen-time whereas in a series his part could have been a great sideline instead of the distraction it was in the feature. His first scene clocked in a less than two minutes yet it seemed way too long for me.The characters of Emily Blunt and her partner were almost completely superfluous to the story. Remove both of them and the plot would barely have missed a beat. She is little more than a pawn in the story yet much of the focus was on her.When Alejandro talks about the boss of bosses in Mexico he says, 'To find him would be like discovering a vaccine.' He is 100% right so why is she so hostile to their operation? Why does she continue if she is so opposed to it? I never understood this aspect of her character and for me it took away a bit of believability for the story. Her boss asked her if she thought they were winning the drug war even though they had prosecuted more felony drug cases in the past year than in the two previous years. This was a question a reporter put to the 'Drug Czar' William Bennet during his time in that post in the 1980s. He stuttered and stammered but was unable to give a coherent answer. We aren't winning and she knows it as well as anyone. So why isn't she on board? If she isn't on board what does she propose?",9,2,8,20 December 2015
Sicario," So Close, but No Cigar
","I'm watching Sicario now for the umpteenth time as I'm on lock-down due to the coronavirus (all bars are closed and football is postponed-what do you do with yourself in Spain without these options?). I haven't reviewed it before so that motivates me to watch it again carefully. This was almost an excellent film. It's about 80% excellent, and very close to one of the best in this genre. One of the obstacles keeping it from being excellent was Emily Blunt and her character, equal parts of both.What the film does well, it does very well. It starts off with a real bang. The opening minutes a very compelling, and then the story segues into a complicated and interesting story. The action is soon ramped up to the highest level with the scene crossing into Mexico, a scene filled with foreboding and tension until the climax.'Why are we going?'
'Because CIA can't operate within U.S. borders without a domestic agency attached.'This brief exchange is why the movie is good but falls short of great. Had her character not been the protagonist, had some other person been picked for this honor, the film would have been outstanding. The director was a little too intent on pointing out the moral ambiguities in the drug war and ended up erroring on the side of confusing and boring.Instead of highlighting Emily Blunt's character, imagine a lot more time devoted to that of Benicio del Toro. Alejandro had so much more at stake in this war than she. I would have loved to see his back story, the loss of his family. This was something that also could have been covered in the dreadful sequel to this film.",9,0,2,14 March 2020
The Godfather: Part III," Most of the Film Is Forgettable, Fly-Over Country
","Old Francis Ford must have really been off his meds when he made this film. He's lucky they didn't take away his director's chair for good. First of all the three leading women were absolutely an embarrassment to the art of film and I blame terrible acting on the director. It's his project and he can either get what he wants on film or get new actors. I think that just about any three other actresses would have done a better job than his daughter, his cousin, and Diane Keaton. Talia Shire gives an absolutely cringe-worthy performance at every step and Sofia Coppola is just no one's idea of an actress. What was he thinking? Eli Wallach was also completely horrible. Joe Mantegna plays a silly caricature of a gangster which works well in parody form on The Simpsons but is ridiculous in this movie. Even Al Pacino phones this one in.Andy Garcia carries about 90% of this movie and without him it would have been completely awful.'He dips his bullets in cyanide,' it is said of one of the gangsters which is just stupid because bullets are pretty much lethal all on their own.The story is a convoluted mess that tries to wow us with its intricacies but all of the Vatican shenanigans just come across as desperation because they didn't have much of a story to sell.The only saving grace of the movie are the few well-done action sequences and a couple of other scenes that add tension. The meeting between Al, Andy, and Joe in the office, the hit scene in the apartment, the execution of Joey Zaza, to name a few. The helicopter shootout of the casino was way, way over-the-top and stupid.Most of the movie is the film equivalent of fly-over country, or fast-forward country.",6,0,3,5 August 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Not My Cup of Tea

American Made," Solid Film but Nothing New
","Had this come out 10-15 years ago it would have had a lot more impact. In 2017 it's about the 5th best movie/series about the drug trade. Back-tracking to the past doesn't make it any fresher.There is really nothing wrong with this movie unless you expect it to contain a shred of originality. It's exactly, and I mean exactly like about 20 movies in this genre. Tom Cruise plays himself, the hot-shot adrenaline-fueled man with a smile.Music from the era isn't enough to make something a period piece. The music annoyed the living crap out of me at almost every turn, like the music was yelling at you about how you should be thinking about the scene. There were at least a half a dozen music video clips which is about a half a dozen too many in my book.",7,0,4,13 October 2017
Steve Jobs," An 8 Star Review Is a 10 from a PC Guy
","I'm glad this wasn't just a hagiography but it was a two hour plug of Apple computers. I supposed that is hard to avoid when making a film about the company's co-founder. And spoiler alert: he's a complete a-hole.I'm not an Apple person. I'm no tech whiz but I'm not a moron, technically speaking (I'll let you decide what that means). For me Apple products are just way too expensive and not as versatile as PCand you have to pay for everything. Why should I give a hoot about the looks of my computer? And is Apple really 'better looking' than a PC? I don't really even know what that means. I have an iPod that someone gave me as a gift and I don't use it much because iTunes is a nightmare on a PC ad you need that nightmare program to run an iPod. They are also much more complicated than a cheap MP3 player which I use for audio books on my long bike rides. So no, I don't like Apple.The movie was extremely compelling and the dynamic between the two principal actors was as good as anything I've seen in movies for a while.",8,0,1,21 February 2016
There Will Be Blood," From the School of 'If a Movie Is Entertaining, It Must not Be Good'
","I can't even believe that this topped The Guardian's list of best films of this century(https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century). Overall, it was the worse 'Best of' list I have ever read, and I thought this well before I reached the final, number one movie. This movie is loved by those who think that if a movie has no plot, it must be a masterpiece.I love how there are so many reviews which basically state that if you don't like this movie, you have flunked some sort of IQ test. I realize that everything is about personal tastes, but just look at how many 1 Star ratings this movie inspired. Overwhelming. Compare the 1 Star rating of TWBB and Michael Clayton, an excellent movie that didn't make The Guardian's list.Not only does the movie fail to entertain, it bored the living daylights out of lots of people. At 2:38 it's way too long for having not much story to tell, something the director couldn't be bothered with. Instead of story, we get long uninterrupted shots that tell us nothing more at the end than when they began 30, 40, 50 seconds earlier, sometimes longer. Ponderous. Tedious. Endless. Pointless.",1,4,15,13 September 2019

","Because there is a lot of singing and dancing, way too much singing and dancing. There was also a lot of slow, brooding music, long takes of nothing much, and even less in the way of dialogue, more long takes of JP's face, and lots of laughing. We get it: the dude is major-league crazy. The film runs over two hours and you don't have much more information than after you watched the minute and a half trailer: a guy in a clown suit who is insane and possibly dangerous.Had there been nothing from the Batman legend connected to this movie, it wouldn't have made a lick of sense. How this mentally ill, mental midget is to go on to be a criminal genius is a mystery. A terrible script with not a line of memorable dialogue.",1,13,38,10 November 2019
The Reader," Decent Book, Great Movie
","I have to say that this is one of those books that worked better—for me, at least—as a movie. As a book it just seemed a little lightweight, like a young adult book except you would need to remove all of the stuff about a 36 year old woman screwing a 15 year old kid's brains out.To me Hanna's illiteracy represents her absence of consciousness. A person who doesn't read is like a child unable to make proper decisions on morality and must simply follow orders whether they are given by the SS, whatever stupid religion you follow, or Donald Trump's minions in the White House. Trump is a great example of someone who doesn't read, who chooses not to read, which is worse than someone who can't read. At least Hanna knew that not reading was something shameful which is more than you can say about the 45th president of the most powerful country on earth. Trump represents the triumph (once again) of the stupid.The essence of the book lies here:'Did you not know that you were sending the prisoners to their death?''Yes, but the new ones came, and the old ones had to make room for the new ones.''So because you wanted to make room, you said you and you and you have to be sent back to be killed?'Hanna didn't understand what the presiding judge was getting at. 'I . . . I mean . . . so what would you have done?' Hanna meant it as a serious question. She did not know what she should or could have done differently, and therefore wanted to hear from the judge, who seemed to know everything, what he would have done.This was curious because only a day later I read this in a letter from my brilliant younger brother: The problem with 'people of faith' is their inability to accept the failure of their bad ideas, or to recognize when they're being bamboozled by those representing them. When you don't rely on a fact-based ethos, you tend to find yourself confused by outcomes that don't match the faith and fantasy.Of course, the Germans weren't illiterate, far from it, but they followed a dogma instead of making individual decisions and choices. It's hard work making your own choices which is why people find such comfort in religion and superstition and authority.",10,1,3,17 March 2017

Unless you would prefer to skip big ape movies entirely this year which seems like the prudent move, at least to me. The thing is, a lot of people and a lot of money went into producing this chimp-tastic continuation of an idea that was an insult to a child's intelligence the first time it appeared.Here is my idea for a very short film. All of the responsible parties for this movie are forced to climb the Empire State Building and then they are cut to pieces by machine gun fire from old bi-planes. They fall to their deaths to the sidewalk below. A random dude in a tuxedo stops to talk to a cop on the scene, 'It was a complete freaking lack of ideas that killed these morons.'

The Blind Side," Sweet Without Being Maudlin
","I have always disliked Sandra Bullock with 'dislike' being the most polite word I can come up with among the rather ample stable of pejoratives that come to mind when looking over her past work. Add to this the fact that I'm almost embarrassed to glow over this type of movie which is like a glorified after-school special. I read a few reviews on IMDb of the film before I watched it and something someone said sort of stuck and I had an altered approach to the viewing. The Blind Side is almost relentlessly upbeat and Pollyannaish. You could say the same thing about The Beatles 'All You Need is Love' and not many people mock that song. They director manages to be unmercifully sweet without it every being corny or maudlin. It helps when whatever message you have decided to deliver is served with a heavy dose of humor. You can get away with a lot of sermonizing if you disguise it with a few jokes.What struck me about the movie, and something I thoroughly appreciated, was that race wasn't anywhere near the biggest issue. I would also rate this film as more of a comedy than a sports movie or anything else. It was truly funny.I'm sure that this movie has zero to do with the actual events of the lives of the people it claims to represent but it's a damn movie, people. If this movie wasn't political enough for you, or you thought that it condescended to the adopted black boy and that he served as basically a family pet then perhaps you should remember that this wasn't intended as a documentary. It's a movie, folks.",7,0,1,2 October 2011
The Big Short," A Must-See Film for All Americans
","The Big Short should be required viewing for everyone in the world affected by the financial crisis in 2008, which means almost everyone in the Western world and certainly everyone in America. Michael Lewis seemed to be one of the few journalists who actually understood what was going on and described it to readers in his book while Fox News was blaming the whole thing on a few deadbeat homeowners who didn't know the difference between a variable rate mortgage and money left on the street. Even the film tried to place at least part of the blame on strippers with a couple of home equity loans which is complete crap. One of the conversations in the book went something like this: 'Who would take out a loan on a house if they couldn't make the first payment?' This was countered by Steve Eiseman, 'Who would give a home loan to someone who couldn't make the first payment?'The housing meltdown was the biggest crime in US history and, as the film points out, no one went to jail for it except one unlucky Wall Street slob. The truth is that the police should have taped off all of this end of Manhattan and designated it a crime scene and out courts should have brought a huge crowd of people to justice. Instead no laws were changed and the same thing, or something even worse, is likely to happen again sooner rather than later.The film does a marvelous job not only of making the technical details understandable to the layman but in making a supremely entertaining film (the most important thing in cinema). Spoiler Alert: The bad guys win in this movie. The rest of us lost and will continue to lose until we stand up and do something about it.",10,7,14,2 January 2016
Prometheus," Really, really, really stupid
","Is this considered a spoiler? Do not pay to see this film. This movie is a huge piece of crap. How could a movie with this many big name actors, a huge budget, and Ridley Scott add up to a mostly unwatchable sci-fi absurdity? After watching it I couldn't even tell you what it was about. None of the characters were worth investing even the remotest bit of interest. It was like Scott was trying to make a blend of Aliens and Avatar and even if he did who the hell would want to see that movie considering that Avatar was a blend of Lord of the Rings and Dances with Wolves? I can only hope that this thing is/will be a huge flop at the box office. And IMDF doesn't allow profanity? Is it a movie review site or a religious organization?

Win Win," Sweet and Funny and Full of Great Values
","Director Tom McCarthy said in an interview that he can't stand sports movies in which the actors can't play the sport, which is why he chose Alex Shaffer, a state champion wrestler, to play the part of Kyle. Win Win is definitely what you would call a character-driven movie, not that it is lacking in story, but without the performances of the principal actors it wouldn't have amounted to much of a film. Fine acting and some precision dialogue lift this movie well above the formulaic mediocrity filling most of the theaters at the mall mega-cineplex.At first Kyle seems like a typical maladjusted, teenage misfit but we quickly see that there is a lot more depth to him than his rough exterior of monosyllabic speech, dyed hair and cigarettes. 'He's probably on drugs,' one character remarks. Before we see that Kyle is some sort of prodigy on the wrestling mat we see that he is basically a fine boy: polite, sweet, honest, very hard-working, etc.The movie is billed as a comedy and it is, but what drew me in was that it's also incredibly sweet. Kyle is just such a great kid. He's is what you would want your kids to be like. He's who I wish that I could have been more like in high school, a better version of myself, a better version of most people. This is all apart from the fact that the kid happens to be a bad-ass grappler. Although not really a sports movie, there are enough scenes of wrestling to probably qualify it for the genre, and there are certainly a lot of laughs to file it under comedy, Win Win is more sweet than anything. Add that to its other qualities and you have a pretty good little movie in my book.",10,0,2,25 August 2011
Jojo Rabbit," Best Cinematic Depiction of Hitler
","Anyone who thinks that it is some sort of a sacrilege to treat Hitler and the Nazis with humor should just go jump out of a twenty-story window (hopefully they will land on a like-minded person and kill two birds with one stone, so to speak). I always thought that had someone stood up in one of those Munich beer halls and laughed at Hitler, showing the rest of the deranged crowd what a ridiculous little a-hole he was, we could have side-stepped the worst chapter in human history.Laugh out loud funny at times. The bit about the mix up of the dogs was my favorite joke in the film, giving the very funny Sam Rockwell the best line in the movie.The acting was superb all around. The little boy was masterful. I always blame good and bad acting on the director, so chapeau to Taika Waititi. Getting a good performance out of a child is always a masterful performance by the director.",10,6,16,25 December 2019
Midway," Midway (1976) vs Midway (2019)
","For the life of me, I barely remember why I shied away from seeing the 1976 version of the dramatization of this epic battle in the Pacific. I figured it was one of those horrible Hollywood star-studded turds, like The Towering Inferno. Even all those years ago, I had decent taste in movies and books.I recently watched both films back-to-back and I was very pleasantly surprised with the 1976 version. It was a lot less corny than the 2019 movie which places most of the story on the hot-shot pilot who did his best Tom Cruise impersonation throughout.I liked this snappy line from a conversation between the navy captain played by Charlton Heston and the intelligence analyst played by Hal Holbrook. They were talking about what little of the Japanese radio conversations could be deciphered by Holbrook's men.'One word in ten? For Christ's sake, Joe, you're guessing.'
'We like to call it analysis.'The 1976 version relies a lot on stock footage of real air attacks and naval vessels. I have to say that this looked better than the special effects of the modern film. The old movie also did a much, much better job of explaining the tactics and the course of the battle from start to finish.I like the fact that the modern movie has the Japanese actually speaking Japanese, although both films treat the enemy with a great deal of magnanimity, something you wouldn't see in films before the 1970s.",8,1,2,15 January 2020
RED," Completely Underwhelming from Start to Finish
","If you're going to make a comedy farce then make a comedy farce; don't make a lousy action film and then try to masquerade it as a comedy. The first action sequence in Red is so over-the-top ridiculous that it went far beneath even the worst of the genre. And as far as comedies go this was second rate, at best.When the Willis character finds out on the phone that his friend had died it would have been hilarious if the woman on the other end had said, 'Sorry, Mr. Morgan Freeman decided to bail out of this piece of crap movie. You're on your own, baldy.' I gave up on the movie a little after John Malkovich dropped in. Why would I care about what will next? With all of these people with so much experience involved in the making of this movie you have to wonder if it was a huge conspiracy or if they are all incapable of knowing good from lousy.",4,5,10,28 December 2013
The Matrix," Why Non-Comic Book People Hate The Matrix (and other films of this ilk)
","1 Star for Unwatchable We hate these types of movies because they never fully define the powers they have. Just how far can that girl jump? Can she fly? Because it looks like she's flying. The martial arts scenes are completely stupid, at least for anyone who has trained in jiu-jitsu for years. Once again, just how strong are these people? It's like their powers change depending on the exigencies of the plot in that particular moment. It's all completely pre-adolescent.To call the acting wooden is an insult to wood. And yes, I realize they were going for the Arnold Swartzenegger effect but it's just called bad acting and it was bad when Arnold rocked it.I've never, ever been able to make it through this movie. I realize that it wasn't made for people like me and I respect that. I just thought that other people might care to see another perspective on this film.",1,4,19,6 August 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Completely Stupid and Unbelievable at Every Step
","This film was embarrassingly stupid from start to finish. A stinking load of feces with huge lapses in logic and riddled with the most senseless violence with no nod towards reality. It was like some high school kids had an unlimited budget and access to top-notch actors and went on to make a childish mess of a film. I can't believe this was written by anyone out of their teens. I doubt that I will ever be able to take these actors seriously again. Sam Jackson was idiotic as a lisping half-moron, Colin Firth was no better in his role as a Bond wannabe. A hire-the-handicapped assassin? Completely and utterly stupid.I just wanted the movie to stop. Please, please stop!",1,8,21,23 May 2015
Easy A," Socially Distance Yourself from this Virus of a Movie
","Yet another terrible movie that I should have never watched, but in lock-down I seem to have lost all sense of taste. Wait, losing your sense of taste is one of the symptoms of the virus. Wait, I hated this movie, so I think my sense of taste is still intact, which is more than I can say for all of the infected souls who liked this waste of a movie.Why do they make high school movies with adults in their 20s? It's not like they are choosing these people for their acting abilities, so why not just use younger kids who are actually high school age-appropriate?",1,2,4,28 March 2020
Green Book," Pure Hollywood...but in a good way.
","'Hollywood' is often used as a pejorative when describing films. In Spanish they say 'americanada' to mean just about the same thing. Hollywood as an insult usually means predictable, over-saccharin, and always with a happy, feel-good ending. Green Book is guilty as charged. The funny thing about 'Hollywood' movies, they are quite often very entertaining. Once again guilty as charged.I will defend 'Hollywood' to my Spanish friends by simply reminding them that most European movies are dreadfully boring, poorly directed (my biggest complaint), and they could use a little 'Hollywood.'Viggo Mortensen was less than totally convincing as the New York Italian tough guy. The movie held nothing in the way of surprises. I like the fact that it didn't try to rewrite America's shameful history of racism but it at least gave us a glimpse of hope on a snowy Christmas Eve on a rural back road. We can do better as a nation. We have to do better.Green Book is shy of being a good film, but my standards have been lowered considerably because of the torrent of crap I've watched this past year.",6,1,6,1 January 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Violence Without Consequences = Childish Nonsense
","'I keel you, I keel all of you. Kill, kill, and more kill.' And throw in a few completely pointless and stupid car chases and lots of explosions for the mouth-breathers and you have a formula for a successful action movie. We should make violence at least as much of a taboo in film ratings as sex.This is the wet dream fantasy of booger eaters and video game dorks with an emotional age of nine. So John Wick is like the Harlem Globetrotters and the bad guys are the hapless Generals. I think that I was nine years old the last time I enjoyed that bit of entertainment, which was about the same time I gave up on kung fu movies.If someone kills a dog in a movie, a huge segment of our population would blow a bowel in protest. yet there is enough human death in this bomb to fill a mass grave the size of Delaware. Doesn't this seem strange to anyone? I bet this movie is the favorite of potential school shooters, serial killers, and other psychopaths all across America...but he's good to his dog...a pitbull, of course.For all of the hundreds of people he killed in the course of this farce there wasn't a single moment of tension. Ditto this for the hand-to-hand combat scenes. We know the result before a punch is thrown or a bullet is fired. What a completely ridiculous mess.",1,234,473,19 February 2017
The Nice Guys," Fast Forward Will Be Needed to Watch This
","The Nice Guys is another perfect example of why Hollywood needs writers who have never seen a damn movie, ever. To begin with it's a period piece when there is really no reason why it needs to be set in the 70s. Change it to the present and nothing changes.So the formula is this: make zero sense, have groovy 70s tunes, add something about porno and child porno, throw in lots of stupid and gratuitous violence, have a stupid buddy thing going on, and try to hit upon as many clichés in the genre as possible in the allotted time. The shoot-outs were just dumb. At one point a huge palm tree is felled by machine gun fire yet nobody is hit. I gave up caring about the story after ten minutes.",5,20,39,10 July 2016
13 Hours," Well-Done Action Film Mostly Free of Politics
","A decent action movie that sketches the events of the Libya affair that is big news now but doesn't really deserve to be headlines for so long. Excellent photography and great scenery from the island of Malta, a stone's throw from Benghazi.A good adaptation from the book and you have to remember that the book was pretty one-sided as it was written from accounts given by the security detail who did the fighting. There was no input from CIA sources so these guys looked like schmucks in the film and book while the mercenaries were the only heroes.To all of the Hilary Haters out there please just crawl back into the hole where you were born. I just don't understand how people can be so fixated on this event, especially after these same people didn't make so much as a peep during the seven years George Bush led us into the most disastrous foreign policy error in our nation's history. So if you're looking for vindication on your kooky conspiracy theories go elsewhere because this movie doesn't dwell much on the politics. This book and film suffer from the fact that all of the information came from the security detail and nothing from the State Department or CIA thus the narrative is lopsided in favor of the mercenaries who don't speak the language or know anything about the overall situation in Libya.Ambassador Stevens knew better than anyone the security risks we were taking in Libya at this time and I suppose that his energy, passion for this part of the world, and optimism got the better of him. From everything I have read about him he was a credit to our diplomatic corps and a tireless student of the Arab world. We have precious few of his ilk.",9,3,11,28 May 2016
Sully," Spoiler Alert: Birds are Evil
","A guy lands a plane in the river and everyone lives. Sound familiar? That's about all there is to this with a bit of a twist and a little up-close-and-personal B.S. In the end it was the damn birds. Birds are almost always the problem.I'm not much of a fan of Clint Eastwood movies but this is an example of doing a heck of a lot with very little. It has all the makings of an after-school special and a story that could have been adequately covered in 20 minutes. Eastwood was able to draw this out to an hour and a half group hug and tear-fest. It's a really, really good story but turning a few minutes of drama in the air and on the water into a feature film was a big stretch. The only reason that I gave this a chance was on the strength of a few really good reviews here on IMDb.",7,1,5,13 November 2016
The Soloist," Rain Man-esque? Forest Gumpian? I Am Sam-ish? And Not in a Good Way
","Just what movies don't need in my opinion: yet another take on Rain Man or Forest Gump or whatever. Why would anyone want to listen to the dialogue of people who make no sense? I'm really not interested in a protagonist who plays handball with his own poop. If it's music I'm after I'll go to the concert hall.Attempting to portray mental illness cinematically is about as stupid and pointless as doing the same with a LSD trip: it's been done many, many times before and they have all failed. Trying to visualize music is an equally pointless task unless you're out to make rock videos: the lowest rung on the ladder of art.",5,1,6,21 February 2018
