The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It was pretty meh
","I got this movie recommended by a girl in my media class and after seeing that it got a pretty good rating i decided to give it a chance. The movie takes on some pretty big issues/themes as sexual abuse, drug and how tough it is to be a teenager, but i feel like we don't get to reach through the surface and are only briefly introduced to these things which makes it kinda 'meh' And i love 'me and earl and the dying girl' but this movie just didn't get the same emotions through, it had great potential to be one of my all time favorites but it kinda slips several times. 6/10 because i liked the theme and it was slightly above average",6,2,3,28 December 2015
