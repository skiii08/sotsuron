Blade Runner 2049," a brief evaluation
","The story of blade runner 2049 is pretty much intelligible, but it's not easy to really understand the movie's theme. It's a 160-minute movie, and there's a lot of information, and villeneuve has a problem with telling the story too clearly, hiding the clues and information behind the storyline. The slightest indiscretion misses a key point
To be fair, blade runner 2049 isn't exactly a commercial movie, though it's not obscure, it's still arty and slow. However, the visual style of the film was unanimously affirmed",8,0,3,22 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," a brief evaluation
","Kill bill is a mash-up. We can strongly feel the influence of the Hong Kong martial arts films in the 1960s and 1970s in the film. Meanwhile, the early Japanese samurai films have become the symbol throughout the film, and the anime has also become an episode of the director's wonderful works.

Brilliant times, but eventually came to the end, it is his own cause is also inevitable, for his own values too extreme, and finally become a paranoid, will lead to the collapse of his criminal empire.

Fight Club," a brief evaluation
","'Fight club' is a dark, fast-paced movie that audiences don't have much time to think about, but unlike other films of its kind, each of David fincher's quick cuts serves a unique purpose besides keeping the audience from getting bored. The most thrilling thing about the whole movie is not what the movie is about, but how David fincher pushes the audience into the mind of the narrator 'me', forcing the audience to feel 'me' in the real world. It also opens up another possibility for storytelling in the film world",8,0,0,24 March 2020

12 Angry Men," A brief evaluation
","The12 Angry Men is one of those movies that you just have to see. Unlike a Sayles movie, you know how 12 Angry Men will end, but there are such polar opposites on the jury that the intrigue is in what could possibly cause one of them to change his vote. It's not only that you should see it because it's good, you should see it because it teaches, reminds, and/or reinforces very important lessons on morality and how society should function. It's a timeless film.",8,1,1,20 March 2020
Home Alone," a brief evaluation
","Home alone's appeal lies in the complexity beneath its simple surface, which can easily turn into a burlesque rather than a good movie if it's not careful. But Columbus and his team gave the film a three-dimensional feel, added emotional resonance, and suddenly improved the quality. The two thieves, Marvin and harry, can be seen as family interlopers, and the process by which little Kevin tries to stop them is also the process by which he protects the home and the one he loves.

Alien," a brief evaluation
","The film depicts the bleak horror of the extinct outer space to the extreme, stopping for breath several times in the middle of the movie. There aren't a lot of alien shots but they're all kind of gross. You know, you could have made a movie like this in the late '70s",8,0,0,13 May 2020
Taxi Driver," a brief evaluation
","It can only be said that there is no one who does not like the movie. In a work that clearly bears the hallmarks of the 'lost generation', Mr Scorsese captures with the most Hollywood precision the plight of americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam war.

Interstellar," a brief evaluation
","The film's powerful cast lays a solid foundation for a cold space journey. Matthew McConaughey, the oscar-winning actor who won his statuette at the beginning of 2014, has done a good job of playing the role of a father who is caught in a dilemma and put family first. Anne hathaway's dialogue is persuasive in both serious science and the softer parts of her heart; 'Model worker' Jessica chastain doesn't get much screen time, but as part of her emotional arc, she's pretty good, too.",9,0,0,26 April 2020

LÃ©on: The Professional," a brief evaluation
","'The themes of Leon are diverse and can be summed up as the alienation of the individual, the relationship between people, the violent clash of cultures and respect for life, and redemption. 'Individuals' refers to the two main characters in the film, who confront an indifferent and distorted world. The scene in the city is a bit like being in a cage. Irregular, distorted and distorted urban composition can be seen everywhere, with the overall tone biased towards dark colors. Cities, tall buildings, these are the result of human development, but with them, in addition to advanced science and technology, but also breeding, spreading crime. The irony is that the police department, traditionally a symbol of justice and order, has become a source of evil and violence. The police station is also one of the tall buildings, the authority of the whole society, but has become one of the main positions of the evil world. The film expresses the director's indictment and distrust of the world and society. The seemingly inconsequential narrative is the ultimate discussion of the coexistence of human beings.",8,0,0,2 May 2020

The film recreates the spectacular scenes of the earth-shattering Normandy landings more than 50 years ago, leaving the audience agape at the intensity and cruelty of the fighting.

City of God," a brief evaluation
","The film is beautifully edited, with a storylike narrative and subheadings, paragraph by paragraph. For someone with a bad memory like me, that's good.

Django Unchained," a brief evaluation
","Django unchained is a quintessential quentin tarantino work, continuing his usual tight and hyperactive narrative style, full of whimsical humor elements and bloody and wild action scenes, black humor and violent aesthetics to the extreme.

These 3D scenes allow the audience to experience the scene in the cinema, and to participate in Aladdin's adventure from the bazaar, to the desert, to the cave, to the palace of agrabah from both audiovisual aspects.

There are two classic fighting scenes in the movie, one is the group battle of the heroine 'bride', and the other is the battle between two women at the end. The visual sense of the group war is very exciting, flesh and blood flying, everywhere is broken hand broken foot, a lot of blood spattering, have the feeling of John woo's violent aesthetics, she is a god of war character. However, the battle scene shot by quentin is very beautiful. The white scene and red blood depict the Japanese bushido spirit, which is poignant and heroic.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
The Dark Knight," A brief evaluation
","The Dark Knight, arguably the moodiest and most adult superhero motion picture ever to reach the screen,illustrates this lesson in ways that are startling and painful. This is a tough, uncompromising motion picture - one that defies the common notions of what is expected from a 'superhero' film. While there are plenty of action sequences and instances of derring-do, The Dark Knight's subtext has a tragic underpinning that would intrigue Shakespeare or the Greeks. It's about power and impotence, sanity and madness,image and reality,selfishness and sacrifice,and - yes - consequences.",9,0,0,18 March 2020
Life Is Beautiful," A brief evaluation
","The movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh.

Pulp Fiction," a brief evaluation
","The director put the end of this incident, the death of Vincent, in the penultimate part. What is more, Jules's change becomes the last part of this film, although it happens before Vincent died. In my view, it helps to connect the end with the beginning of the film, which means crimes circulate unceasingly. Except that, I suppose this detail is designed to show that criminals should be redeemed from evil, no matter by Christ or themselves.",8,0,0,19 March 2020

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," a brief evaluation
","The first harry potter film was undoubtedly the most emotional for me, as we followed a few of the minor protagonists and enjoyed the charm of hogwarts. Whether it's the giant hagrid or the treasure chest of diagon alley, whether it's the sharp-tonned sorting hat or the wall painting that talks to you at the door, it's all fascinating.
To tell you the truth, the first book was very good in both content and pace, and in just two hours, it not only introduced us to the world, but also told us the story of the philosopher's stone very clearly. To tell you the truth, I didn't really think quirrell was a bad guy at first, and I always misunderstood snape...",8,0,0,20 April 2020

Joker," a brief evaluation
","The joker character flies away with the dark knight, and in Nolan's scene, we see a crazy and rational joker, crazy is that he is not subject to any moral constraints, do whatever he wants. He had no friends, no peer who he is crazy about the social return, his method was to laugh, smile, forever is different from the tears, or the roar, it's a more appealing expression, slowly we can feel his experience, his grief, but you can't deal with the pain, accumulate into laughter at the end. What is the clown laughing at?
He laughed at the absurdity and craziness of the world. There was no reason to talk about it. There were no rules. A lot of people are oppressed, they have a vague confusion and confusion in their hearts, the world should be like this? Should we?
Clowns are acting crazy for what they need, clowns are just too many oppressed people who want to explode.

This film has its value of analysis and the necessity of viewing from both artistic appreciation and technical realization. For the audience, visual impact and auditory enjoyment is an important reflection of a film artistic quality. However, the technical support of science fiction is more important.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," a brief evaluation
","Star Wars ushered in a kind of transcendence
The genre -- space exploration theme, and the film orientation of heterogeneous spectacle has been extended until now, and the genre has evolved into the basic aesthetics of today's 'digital Hollywood blockbuster'
The principle. '2001: a space Odyssey' met with a cold reception at the box office and from the audience, and it wasn't until years later that anyone reconsidered its artistic merit.
But why the difference? It is necessary to go back to the comparison of the two films' creative orientations. 'Star Wars' reduces the content of humanity to zero as much as possible, and its story returns to the ancient 'mythological' attribute of women and children
Children can understand the binary opposition of good and evil. The simplicity of the plot gives a great deal of room for visual expression. Lucas endlessly zoomed in on the movie's alien spectacle list
Now, try to please the audience's eyes as much as possible.
Thus, this kind of film through the performance of heterogeneous spectacle, let the audience at that time surprise! Just like the lumiere brothers first showed the train to the station, audience
