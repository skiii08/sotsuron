Marie Antoinette," artistic
","Just saw this movie in theaters. I like Sofia Coppola's style, but after seeing The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette, I have to conclude that in fact, I just really love Lost in Translation. In comparison to that, I gave this movie a 7. But still! It's worth seeing if you like one of the following things: visually impressive, colorful, artistic movies (like Russian Ark, full of costumes of the times and such); a social, emotionally oriented view of the famous French Queen; subtle humor; a creative rendition of that particular historical time. Those are all characteristics of the film. Unfortunately, those items also make it a fairly slow movie. Now I know Lost in Translation is far from an action movie, and I have no objection to that. But Marie Antoinette is a bit too slow, especially for one who cares more about the characters and plot than about decorum, Versailles and social life at the palace. Though I see the artistic value of this film, and I don't feel I wasted my 10$, I also do not feel that it struck a chord in me. So 7/10 is pretty justified.",7,1,3,29 October 2006
300," Worth the money
","I just saw this in theaters 3 hours ago. I was looking forward to it, and it paid off. It's a good movie to see in theaters. I cannot be very sure about the historical accuracy (I forgot the details of the Battle f Thermopylae) but I am pretty sure this is not bent towards accuracy, but towards entertainment. That said, it is indeed good entertainment. The battle scenes are not a random amalgamation of blood and gore, and the rest of the scenes are pretty meaningful.If I were to compare it to something like Gladiator, I would say that 300 has more of the 'cool' factor, if you will. It is made to make you go 'wow', whereas Gladiator is made to be more intricate.Overall, it is worth the money. If the trailer caught your eye, go for it! You will probably not be disappointed. But If you are a history keener, maybe try saving the 10$.",8,4,9,9 March 2007
