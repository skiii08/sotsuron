The New World," Racism Alive and Well
","This movie is really messed up. The indigenous people of this country are portrayed as animals, running around totally possessed by instinct, grunting, sniffing the English? It's like a whole society of wolfboys. Though we lived in a so called 'primitive culture' does not mean we lived like animals. The mannerisms of the Natives is based on a skewed colonial perspective. This stereotype has been present throughout U.S. history and especially cinematic history and apparently continues today. This film, like the mascots of major league baseball, is a symptom of a racist culture in denial. If you like this movie please try to reexamine it from a Native person's perspective.",1,0,2,15 June 2008
