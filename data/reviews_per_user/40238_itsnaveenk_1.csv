Skyfall," Skyfall
","Well to start with the opening sequence was good compared to Daniels earlier movies. This is a definitely a different bond movie in which the deep emotions have been showed from both Javier and Daniel which I liked the most.screenplay was good, some scenes were super smooth. Cinematography was great, Scotland was explored a different angle.The end is not great it would have been much better by Mendes may be the storyline didn't demand that.Overall the movie is good and last but not least Adele opening song with Thomas Newman music was outstanding.",7,6,14,3 November 2012
