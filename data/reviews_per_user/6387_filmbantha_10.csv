The King's Speech," British film making at its finest
","The King's speech is a heartwarming, inspirational and humorous tale that weaves between elements of serious drama and comedy with ease, thanks in large to excellent performances from the entire cast, with Colin Firth standing out as the stammering King George VI in one of his finest starring roles to date. Geoffrey rush is ever watchable as Lionel Logue, the speech therapist that comes to George's aid in anticipation of his potential to take the throne, and their often troubled relationship provides much of the humour as George's stubborn nature prevents pronunciation progress ( now I would like to see King George get his chops around that phrase), despite Logue's best efforts to conquer his stammer.Alongside the King and his speech therapist, Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter are riveting to watch as his self-righteous younger brother and dedicated wife and although Timothy Spall has a limited amount of screen time, his humorous portrayal of Winston Churchill is an important presence, with his stoic nature and determination providing the King with some much needed confidence. As the king's speech is a character driven plot, it is imperative that we can empathise with the cast and Hooper has done an exceptional job at lightening the tone in key moments throughout the film - to ensure that we warm towards the king and his entourage - whilst still maintaining the importance of the fascinating historical events that unfold as the plot progresses. It is an impressive feat to bring so much drama and tension to a single moment in history and the build-up to the film's climax is perfectly paced as our faith in the king's ability to perform his speech begins to waiver, and at times it is easy to forget that this is a historical drama as the wit and audacity of certain characters appears very current without feeling out of place in 1930s Britain. Basing the premise of an entire film on a speech impediment was a brave move from director Tom Hooper and one that has paid off fantastically with the film receiving a total of seven Golden Globe Nominations as well as being a hot contender for a number of Oscars. Awards discussions aside, The King's Speech is a wonderful film that completely surprised me with its enormously enjoyable storyline and engaging insight into the impact that speech impediments can have on their hosts. This is arguably British film making at its finest with top-notch performances from a fantastic ensemble cast, brilliant direction from Tom Hooper, and a storyline that inspires and amuses in equal measures all adding up to make the King's Speech an unmissable film.

Whip It," Drew Barrymore should stay in front of the camera
","Drew Barrymore's directorial debut has all the makings of a cult classic, from the impeccable indie rock soundtrack to the impressive cast credentials, but unfortunately fails to deliver. Crude, unfunny jokes pepper a storyline chock full of clichés and corny dialogue, whilst the actresses struggle to bring life to the two-dimensional characters they are portraying. The storyline focuses on a teenage misfit, Bliss Cavendar, coerced into performing at beauty pageants by her parents, whilst secretly yearning to explore the wilder side of life when she discovers a roller derby league not far from her home in Austin. As usual in these coming of age stories, Bliss meets a guy, falls out with her parents and flourishes within a new group of friends after overcoming a number of obstacles. This is all very pleasant but far from original, making it very easy to predict the outcome of the movie. The inclusion of Ellen Page as the story's heroine is a wise move by Barrymore, fans of Juno desperate to see more of the star will certainly flock to the movie, if only to be disappointed. Despite this, Page puts in a fairly impressive performance, proving that she is a talented actor, even when presented with an average script.I am sure that the target audience of twelve year old girls will get a lot out of Whip It but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone else due to its lack of broad appeal. Whip it would definitely pass time during the April showers but I would prefer to get wet than suffer through this pre-teen chick flick once more.5/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Juno, Bend It Like Beckham, The Blind Side and Me Without You",5,1,4,2 April 2010
Kick-Ass," With no power comes no responsibility
","It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but Kick-Ass did exactly that; I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences, intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns, Kick-Ass is a welcome addition to the realm of the comic-book movie.I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie, most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal, but Kick-Ass completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film, or even a Tarantino script, in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and Kick-Ass was the end result.The story focuses on Dave Lizewski, your average teenage nerd, whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero, Kick-Ass, despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes, propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.It is not long before other vigilantes surface, some desperate for the fame and attention, others out for revenge, and when Kick-Ass becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans, we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved. There has been some controversy over the graphic violence depicted in these scenes, especially as the trailer is intended to appeal to a fairly young audience, and that comes as no surprise when a pre-teen girl decapitates villains on screen and uses the c*** word. Controversy aside, I cannot deny that this was very entertaining.Chloe Moretz easily steals the show as Hit Girl - the incredibly volatile young superhero with a penchant for explicit language, which will surely propel her into the realms of stardom. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as her doting father, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is ever watchable as Red Mist. However it is Aaron Johnson who shows the most promise as Kick-Ass, with his convincing turn from a bumbling student to a brave and reckless crime fighter marking him as a talent to watch out for.An essential part of the film is its eclectic soundtrack, with choice tracks taken from excellent films such as 28 Days Later and For a few dollars more. Usually I would be concerned at such a prospect but the Kick-Ass soundtrack adapts the tracks brilliantly, making them feel like its own, alongside great songs from The Prodigy and Sparks to name a few. The choice of music fits perfectly with the high-octane action sequences and even adds emotional depth to key scenes - not bad for a superhero comedy movie! Kick-Ass is that rarest of films, a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. My only criticism would be that some sequences near the end were slightly far-fetched but in a film where suspension of belief is required, maybe I'm being a little harsh. This is an essential film for all cinema-goers, catch it on the big screen and I guarantee you will be completely immersed in the explosive yet entertaining world of Kick-Ass9/10 If you liked this film you will also enjoy these: Special, Spiderman, The Dark Knight and Superbad",9,381,558,22 March 2010
Gran Torino," Eastwood does it again!
","Clint Eastwood is a bit of a legend. His mere presence in a film is usually enough to give film fans an indication that they are about to watch something special. Despite being 78, he is still an incredibly hard working man, directing and acting in a number of classic films over the past few years. Whilst Gran Torino is not one of his best films, it is still well worth a look, especially as it will be his last appearance on the big screen.In Gran Torino Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an intolerant Vietnam veteran who slowly discovers that he has more in common with his Hmong neighbours than his own family. As Walt is clearly a racist, it is the cathartic process by which he comes to terms with this that drives the story and raises it to a level above most revenge dramas. Eastwood's low growling voice and intense stares still have the same potency they possessed when he appeared in A Fistful of Dollars back in the early sixties, and it is this which enables Walt to take control of almost any violent situation he encounters.There was no doubt that Eastwood's performance would stand out, he is the only household name in a film full of unknown actors who find it difficult to shine. This is a strange choice as some of Clint's finest films; Mystic river and Unforgiven to name a few, were successful due to the brilliant casting of stars such as Morgan Freeman, Sean Penn and Gene Hackman, which could be an indication that Gran Torino was Clint's final attempt to win an Oscar for best actor.Gran Torino is a highly enjoyable movie, at times funny, often moving and worth watching for Clint's performance alone. The Curious Case of Benjamin button and Slumdog millionaire may have won all the Oscars but this is a far more accomplished film, and i was surprised at the Academy's decision to ignore it in favour of Eastwood's other recent movie Changeling.8/10If you liked this film, you will also enjoy these:Unforgiven, Dead Man's Shoes, Mystic River, A History Of Violence",8,0,3,13 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Lacking depth but visually stunning
","I've eagerly anticipated Tim Burton's latest releases from before I can remember, and with Alice in Wonderland marking his first foray into 3-D, this was no exception. Arriving early at the cinema, we were treated to a live satellite link-up from the world premiere hosted at London's Leicester square. Watching Prince Charles shake hands with almost everyone involved in the film was not my idea of fun but it certainly made an interesting change to the cinema experience. After the formalities he was shown into the cinema and the film could eventually start for him at the world premiere, and me in the comfort of Cineworld Didsbury.Unlike previous adaptations of Alice, Burton takes the viewer on a new journey, only loosely following aspects of Carrol's classic stories 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the looking glass' to create an entirely new experience. Although this may disappoint fans of the stories, there are still a lot of familiar characters to be seen as Alice is portrayed as a young woman returning to the world she first envisaged as a child - almost like an unofficial sequel to Carrol's work.Having only seen two films in 3-D prior to Alice in Wonderland; Coraline and Avatar, I was still unsure whether 3-D was more than just a gimmick, however, it certainly enhanced the visual aspect of the film, bringing life to Burton's dark and mysterious world.There is some fantastic casting within the film, especially Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and although the computer generated effects used to render the characters are impressive, I was left longing for the extravagant costumes that Burton fans are used to seeing in his earlier films - Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands come to mind. Despite this, we still see a glimpse of Burton's once awe-inspiring creations with a number of weird creatures that inhabit Wonderland, as well as some suitably creepy decapitated heads that serve as stepping stones in a castle moat.Putting aside a few moments that young children may find scary, this is definitely a family movie, with elements of humour clearly aimed at the younger audiences. One such moment comes near the end of the film when Johnny Depp displays his 'funderwhacking' abilities, and whilst that phrase may excite people who have yet to see the film, for me it merely conjures up a horrendous image that I would rather forget! Most people will have high expectations of the film due to the calibre of actors and actresses involved but I have seen all of them in much better performances, apart from Barbara Windsor - it's nice to not see her face for once, as Burton does not devote enough screen time to any one of the multitude of characters that inhabit Wonderland.Although Alice is not a landmark film by any means, I cannot deny that I was soon absorbed in the story, despite its numerous flaws. If you do decide to head to the cinema, make sure you see it in 3-D, as this definitely played a big part in my enjoyment of the film. I doubt I would watch Alice in Wonderland again but would certainly recommend it for families and young children.7/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Coraline, Labyrinth, Laputa: Castle In The Sky, The Fall",7,1,3,13 March 2010
Inception," If the Mensa guys made their version of the A-Team...
","Imagine if the brains behind Mensa gathered together one day and created their own version of the A-Team, it would probably end up being very similar to Inception. Basically, Cristopher Nolan is a genius; Inception's storyline is an incredible feat of imagination that will simultaneously amaze and disorientate you with each thrilling turn. The acting is impeccable, with an ensemble cast that is bound to provoke a number of Oscar nominations (as long as the Academy realise that at the core of this science fiction epic there still lies an emotionally draining thriller ) in dramatic roles that will haunt your dreams for a long time to come.The less said about the plot the better, not because its bad, in fact its awe-inspiring to see the lengths Nolan has gone to in order to make this work , but it would be unfair to spoil your enjoyment of the film and would be quite a difficult feat to summarise concisely the key ideas behind Inception. Despite being a complex beast, Inception remains watchable throughout thanks to the impressive visuals and mind-blowing special effects that despite being physically impossible are still incredibly realistic.Its closet comparison would be The Matrix, another game-changing sci-fi that took special effects to the next level by providing the audience with one hell of a story and not relying purely on the futuristic visuals to create the films success. The action definitely has stepped up a notch in Inception, with events in interweaving dream worlds affecting the consequences in others. It sounds complicated but it is a sheer joy to behold as Dicaprio and his team invade people's dreams and simultaneously assault an arctic fortress, defy gravity in an insane hotel corridor brawl and swerve traffic in a deadly car chase. Anything is possible in a dream, and thankfully Nolan exploits this to its maximum potential; trust me on this, the action sequences will leave you stunned senseless.The only thing that dwarfs the intense action is the labyrinthine plot, which requires a great deal of concentration to follow. Luckily, Nolan makes this easy for the viewers by creating a visceral plot that completely absorbs the audience's attention - prompting an almost dream like state of consciousness as the action unfolds before your very eyes.As I left the cinema I was undecided on my opinion of the film, there was just far too much to take in after one viewing. Having said that though, I would definitely consider catching Inception for a second time, the more the film has invaded my dreams since watching it, the more I want to immerse myself in Nolan's incredible imagination once again.",8,3,7,16 July 2010
The Blind Side," Two Oscar nominations? Really??
","I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of sports movies, however, the past couple of years has seen great films such as Invictus and The Wrestler, both showing how sports can be an integral part of a captivating story, and reigniting my passion for older classics such as Rocky and The Hustler. Unfortunately, The Blind Side fails to compete with any of these films, despite being based on true events and receiving two (undeserved) Oscar nominations. Following the journey of a neglected teenager who learns the true values of friendship and family, whilst playing some American Football on the way, this is a film riddled with clichés and fairly average performances - I cannot comprehend how Sandra Bullock won the Best Actress nomination - that somehow manages to entertain despite these problems.We have all seen film like these before, and The Blind Side brings nothing new to the table. Michael Oher, the young boy in question, is a homeless teenager with a troubled past who is kindly taken in by the Touhy family, where he soon becomes one of the family. Although he shows no talent for football, his size means that Michael is soon singled out to be the team's blocker, and eventually learns that his team are his family and he must care for them just like he cares for the Touhy family.I can see many people enjoying this film; it's an easy watch, suitable for all ages and delivers a message, but to me, this is its downfall. My favourite movies tend to be edgy, controversial films that offer something original whereas the only positive way I can describe The Blind Side is to say that it was pleasant.I wasn't bored, but I certainly wasn't entertained either. No doubt the huge publicity surrounding the film since the Oscar winners were announced will guarantee its success but I still can't imagine that it will inspire British children to grab an American football and hit the fields when its released on March 26th.6/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Invictus, Dead Poet's Society, The Pursuit Of Happiness, Stand And Deliver",6,4,6,13 March 2010
Toy Story 3," Pixar never fail to amaze
","When it comes to kids films I'm usually the last in line but the prospect of a new Toy Story was a chance I couldn't miss, Pixar have mastered the difficult task of creating films that entertain all generations, and I had been eagerly anticipating a third film since the credits rolled on Toy Story 2 back in 1999. The first one hit the big screens when i was just eight years old and I have grown up with Andy, watching his toys run amok every time he closed his bedroom door, and becoming completely absorbed in the crazy situations they have encountered.We join Woody and Co. a few days before Andy packs up his belongings and heads off to college, misplacing his toys who end up donated to a children's daycentre instead of being packed away in the attic. It is down to Woody to convince the toys they haven't been abandoned and return them safely back home whilst avoiding crazy children, tyrannical toys and terrifying trash compactors along the way.Whilst the story remains fairly similar to the previous films, the introduction of a wealth of new characters (along with everyone's old favourites) adds to the enjoyment with comic characters such as an eccentric hedgehog, Mr Pricklepants, and the introduction of a hilarious romance between Barbie and Ken fleshing out the storyline with a healthy dose of humour. The eagle-eyed amongst you may even spot a character from one of Miyazakis movies appearing in a young girls bedroom, a subtle nod to one of the greatest animators of all time.One of the highlights of the film arrives after the credits have rolled with an alternative rendition of a memorable song from the first Toy Story, making it essential to stay in your seat right until the lights come up. It is also imperative that you arrive on time, as is usual with Pixar films you are treated to a short animation before the main feature and 'Night and Day' is definitely up there with the best of them, giving the audience a taster of the sheer brilliance they are about to behold.Toy Story 3 is an emotional ride; much like in Pixars recent releases Up and Wall-E, it is surprising how affecting a cartoon can be, with a number of poignant moments that will overwhelm even the most cynical of viewers. Even though the human characters only have minor roles in the story, the few lines they do have will resound deeply with everyone, and the mixture of characters at different points in their lives means that there will be a part of the story that relates directly to you on a personal level. It's not just about throwing out the old toys anymore, its about the process of growing up and those that have followed the story from its first incarnation will be saddened by the reminder that their own childhood has passed.Captivating from start to finish, Toy Story 3 is a triumphant reminder of Pixar's ability to blow all your expectations out of the water and in doing so they have delivered what could possibly be considered their greatest film to date. Essential viewing for everyone, Toy Story 3 is an unmissable extravaganza that is almost guaranteed a best picture nomination at next year's Oscars ceremony. Book your tickets right now, you would be a fool to pass up the chance to catch the final part of the trilogy in its full cinematic glory.",9,1,1,19 July 2010
Get Him to the Greek," Forgetting Aldous Snow
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a dull, unfunny comedy, in fact I would go as far to say that it wasn't comedy but a boring drama. It pains me every time i hear someone mention how brilliant it was, and I really can't comprehend why anyone commissioned a spin-off, on second thoughts scrap that, Forgetting Sarah Marshall made money at the box office, so of course we are going to get a lacklustre follow-up, none other than Get him to the Greek.The story follows Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) as he attempts to escort Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his long overdue comeback gig but struggles to keep the dishevelled rock star away from drink, drugs and desperate women. It sounds like the perfect recipe for a comedy but unfortunately it appears that the writers created a number of key scenes and then attempted to loosely tie them together with a script, and that will never work.It's a shame that the majority of the jokes are clearly aimed at a teenage audience when references to The Mars Volta and Lars Ulrich clearly pay off, film-makers should realise that not everyone in the world is a hormonal teenage lad, desperate for a glimpse of nudity or endless toilet humour, but have faith that intelligent people are out there! Maybe they are just too on the ball and realise that anyone with half an ounce of intelligence will probably steer clear of this film. Admittedly, some of the jokes did bring a smile to my face, but this was not nearly enough to redeem the lack of structure and poor characterisation.If you like your films without meaning, easy to follow and easy to forget, go and watch Get Him to the Greek, the perfect throwaway Summer comedy. Just don't say I didn't warn you!",6,1,4,6 July 2010
The Social Network," An engaging and provocative drama that may just make you think twice before you update your Facebook status in the future
","At the end of the millennium David Fincher's visceral take on Chuck Palahniuk's novel 'Fight Club' defined a generation and, while it seems like only yesterday that it was released, eleven years have passed since Brad Pitt and Edward Norton contributed towards what is now regarded as a cult classic. Over a decade later the revered director has once more attempted to capture a moment in time, bravely deciding to focus his efforts on real events from very recent history, by filming a compelling drama based entirely on the creation of a single website that quickly became a worldwide phenomenon.Jesse Eisenberg plays Marc Zuckerberg, the brains behind Facebook, and The Social Network opens with a snappy dialogue between Zuckerberg and a female companion that ends disastrously, allowing the audience to fully comprehend the social awkwardness surrounding the film's lead, and his motivation for the creation of his website. Assisted by a number of friends, most notably Andrew Garfield in a stunning performance that is reassuring to fans of Spiderman (Garfield is scheduled to play Peter Parker in the upcoming reboot), Zuckerberg utilises his computer skills to create an exclusive club for Harvard students that remains accessible to the less sporty members of the prestigious University. In doing so he unwittingly unleashes a social medium that begins to spread across America and eventually over to Europe, as more and more students become obsessed with their online presence and the ability to check up on their friends, and more importantly their relationship statuses, wherever they are in the world.There is no denying that The Social Network tells an incredible story, with Fincher's visual flair perfectly matched with the powerful soundtrack by Trent Reznor, especially in a standout rowing scene that is guaranteed to get your heartbeat racing, but the only downside is a lacklustre ending which cannot really be levelled as a criticism, after all this is real life and the story will continue long after the credits are rolling. People familiar with Facebook will find a lot to love in this movie, the inspirational story is a great backbone to the character development as well as providing a very personal account of Zuckerberg's rise to fame. The humorous references to situations that most of the sites user's will have found themselves in are very effective and provide a perfect balance to the tension in some of the more dramatic scenes, as well as enabling the audience to connect with the film on a more personal level.The Social Network is an engaging and provocative drama that may just make you think twice before you update your Facebook status in the future. I would recommend it to anyone who uses Facebook on a regular basis; you are guaranteed to give it the thumbs up.",8,0,0,14 October 2010
