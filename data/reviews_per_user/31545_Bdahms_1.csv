United 93," A successfully realistic portrayal of that autumn day
","I saw this film and was left speechless as the ending credits came upon the screen. This film captures that horrific day with startling realism to go along with believable characters, sharp editing and non-stop emotion.Paul Greengrass makes a tremendous and successful attempt at capturing this country's most shocking day. He stays away from big name actors and instead provides his viewers with something they will never forget. We focus on what we should focus on: the people, the locations, and the emotion. He shows nothing of Al Quaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq. We are merely placed in the presence of what those people had to endure, something no one should ever have to go through.This film is a tremendous work of art that transcends most films of its kind. There is no reason for someone to avoid this film because of what they think it may entail. It does not exploit the events of that tragic day; it embraces the unfortunate who were involved and in the right way.See this film.",10,2,4,2 October 2006
