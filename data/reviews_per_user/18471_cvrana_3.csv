The Blair Witch Project," Shocking
","Ok.  I must admit that when I went to this movie, my expectations were very high.  So I went on opening day and viewed 'the blair witch project,'  I left the theatre with my expectations full-filled by much more than what I had even started to expect.  This movie is fantastic.  In fact, it's probably the scariest movie I've ever seen in my entire life.  It's extremely creepy.  I don't know if I've ever been creeped out more than after that last sequence.  Terrific movie, watch it.",Null,0,1,4 February 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," pretty good overall
","I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and I found myself in a room full of old people.  I didn't know that I was seeing an 'old-people' movie at all.Besides the 'old' thing, I liked the movie.  Although it gets a little boring at the beginning.  I stays boring for a while too.  It gets a lot better when you get into the movie.The best acting in the movie comes from Winona Ryder, of course.  I really enjoyed her screen presence.  A 7 out of 10.",Null,1,1,28 January 2000
The Matrix," one of the dumbest movies ever made
","When I saw 'The Matrix' I didn't have big expectations for it, and I was right.  This confused and weak-plotted movie has got to be one of the dumbest ever made.  It made me sick.  It was so corny I wanted to scream. I think that the only reason people like this junk is because they think that the thought of the matrix is really interesting and clever, it's not. It's an excuse to use special effects (that weren't even that great).People need to get a little taste before they call a movie 'their favorite movie ever.'",Null,0,0,30 January 2000
