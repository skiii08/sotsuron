The Hangover," It gets better and better ...
","I thought that 'The Hangover' started out pretty much along the same lines as your bog-standard 'grooms last night in Vegas before the wedding' scenario  with the same formula of a group of lads comprising of 'cool' guys and 'odd-balls'  I wasn't therefore expecting too much out of the ordinary  I was pleasantly surprised however, and I thought that the extra humorous original touches and the cast (or relative unknowns used) were above the average for this type of film  and it WAS genuinely funny in places ..Basically, an odd-ball mix of guys attend a stag do in Vegas just before the grooms wedding  events happen and the group wake up – realising that they have no recollection of the previous night and that they have 'lost' the groom  a very comic 'autopsy' then ensues into what happened the night before and to re-trace their steps to find out what happened  to try to get the groom to the altar on time  each time they discover a little more of what happened – they find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble There was also an 'interesting' cameo role played by a well-known personality that added to the humour  giving it quite a twist  The film just gets funnier as it goes along  It would also be wise to stick around to watch the credits at the end as there are some very amusing pictures of the events of the stag night – don't miss them !",7,106,213,2 June 2009
Star Trek," Set your phasers to STUNNING!!!
","'Set your phasers to STUNNING!!!'It was a terrific atmosphere in a jam-packed cinema  I was SO glad that I saw this at the Empire, Leicester Square, as this is a film that you'll definitely need to see on a BIG screen (preferably with a very LOUD surround sound system!) This adaptation has 'boldly gone' – much further, and better than any previous 'prequel' that I've seen  The action is non-stop  the story line is very strong  the effects are amazing  and of course there is also the 'sub-plot' of the prequel factor – that let's you know how the main cast members first met and grew together as a team  A special mention should go to the Director (J.J. Abrams) for both the way the film moves along – and for the superb casting of Zachary Quinto as Spock, Simon Pegg as Scottie and Eric Bana as Nero was a masterstroke  the rest of the main characters are also strongly cast and are young – suggesting that this team could be together in a series of films that could run and run  This has certainly breathed new life into this already epic story This film has cutting edge effects – Story – Music – Action – Aliens  what more could you ask for ? This was a terrific movie – if you liked any of the Star Trek franchise (T.V or movies) then you'll absolutely love this ! – book your tickets now  !I think that this is the best of all the Star Trek films  This film has all the ingredients to take over a planet in a solar system near you",10,409,775,17 April 2009
Pirate Radio," Review : The Boat that Rocked
","I thought that the idea, the music and the people around the country dancing along and listening to the radio were all done well - however - although I thought that the characters played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans and a cameo role by Emma Thompson were good and enjoyable, it was very, very noticeable that the rest of the cast were incredibly weak, and the story / plot line was very poor – and it (I believe) is the weakest of all Richard Curtis's recent works - and the ONLY saving grace holding it together is the music (which would have carried any film on it's own anyway) - ultimately, (excuse the pun) I think that Richard Curtis has really missed the boat with the adaptation of this – when this film had all the ingredients and the potential to be a much, much better movie.See the film for the music alone ... and NOT for the story or the rest of the film.The soundtrack will be popular.Unfortunately ... I really think that a golden opportunity was missed with the potential of this film",5,9,25,1 April 2009
"I Love You, Man"," Not all it's cracked up to be ... I Didn't love it man ...
","Most people seemed to enjoy it – although I noticed many more women than men laughing.Although this was supposed to be a 'buddy' movie - it is far from being a guys film – I think that this is much more a girl's film (a chick flick) - predominately set around engagements, weddings, etc. and everything leading up to the 'big' event.As comedies go, I thought it was pretty lame all round  it was a very poor script with telegraphed 'humour'  very, very predictable - and certainly nothing original Very run of the mill fare . Not very well written or directed  I just don't think that the two main male 'buddies' in the film were convincing enough to carry the weak scriptPersonally, apart from two 'visual' gags (one at a drinking game party, the other at a golf course) – I don't think I laughed at ANY of the jokes  I don't think I could recommend this film to any guys  but some of the girls might like it",4,17,36,15 April 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Best of the Harry Potter series so far ,,,
","Entering the Empire, Leicester Square felt a bit like entering a Hogwarts 'Chamber of Secrets' as we noticed from the display screen only showed details of films on screens 1, 2, 5 and 6 with no mention of the 'special' pre-release showing of what was appearing on screen 4 - for film reviewers and those lucky enough to get a ticket – this was no place for ordinary 'muggles' ... Directed by David Yates - HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 is the seventh episode in the Harry Potter series and is part one of a two part final conclusion to the story.The film starts with Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) the new Director of the Ministry of Magic telling Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) the details of the lately deceased Albus Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) last will and testament – along with a warning that due to the resurgence and return of the Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and with Dumbledore no longer there to protect them – they are advised that Hogwart's is no longer a safe place for them ...Previous events have determined that the soul of the Dark Lord has been split up and is contained within seven different horcrux objects – in a bid to attain immortality ... and, without finding and destroying all of these unknown objects the Dark Lord could never be defeated ... With this in mind, Harry, Hermione and Ron (HH&R) decide to leave Hogwart's and their families behind by erasing their parent's memory of them  HH&R team up with the surviving members of the 'Order of the Phoenix' to find these seven unknown horcrux objects and to construct battle plans against the ever growing power of Lord Voldermort's Dark Forces  Harry and his friends are soon discovered and are attacked and only some of them manage to escape and regroup at the Weasley's secret hideout  where they count their losses During a wedding held at the Weasley's they are attacked yet again by the Dark Forces and HH&R escape and find themselves alone again  HH&R are now left to their own devices to try and solve the riddles of the locations and form of the remaining outstanding horcrux objects  and how they may be able to destroy them  this also includes a hazardous break-in into the Ministry of Magic which is now controlled by the Dark Lord. In addition they also discover that the negative energy in carrying around one of the horcrux objects without being able to destroy it is affecting anyone who carries it turning them against the others in the group.Meanwhile, with the Dark Lord's forces on the constant hunt for Harry Potter and friends, Voldermort himself wishes to track down the location of the three Deathly Hallows – whom he believes will make him invincible. HH&R soon come into contact with Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius who also lets slip the secret of the Deathly Hallows – and now they must also search for these to prevent Voldemort from getting them first. The race is on! Special mention should be made for the performances of Brendon Gleeson as Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange – who both stole every scene that they were in  and the ever consistent Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.There are many twists and turns and highs and lows throughout to keep everyone entertained through to the end  I took my niece along to this showing for her birthday (she being a Harry Potter expert) and she quotes that 'this is the best of the series of films so far, and is actually the first to better the associated book'  and this coming from such an ardent fan is high praise indeed  she (and I) were not disappointed and we are very much looking forwards to the final installment which is due out in 2011 HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 is 146mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on general release for muggles everywhere from Fri 19th November 2010",8,22,46,15 November 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," You'd be a silly monkey to miss this film ...
","The new movie RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES by Director Rupert Wyatt (The Escapist) is effectively a prequel to the 'Planet of the Apes' and tells the story of a lab that performs genetic engineering on animals to try to get a cure for Alzheimer's – and of the consequences that occur when things go dramatically wrong  A dedicated scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) is trying to discover a cure for Alzheimer's Disease by performing tests on apes.One of these chimpanzees 'Bright Eyes' soon becomes the 'star of the show' of the medical trials and exceeds all expectations for the new drug ALZ-112 – which has been developed to try and slow down / prevent Alzheimer's and shows highly advanced intelligence  until a problem happens in the lab and she goes on a rampage and is killed. Unknown to the lab owners – Bright Eyes had just given birth to a baby 'Caesar' – who like his mother has also inherited all the good things about the new drug – only this time without the bad side-effects. Caesar is smuggled out of the lab to protect him when all the other chimps have been ordered to be destroyed.Meanwhile in the lab, ALZ-113 soon supersedes the original drug – but, it has one very unknown, dangerous side-effect in that it is airborne, incredibly contagious and highly toxic to humans.As he grows, Caesar displays extra-ordinary intelligence – far exceeding even the intelligence of his mother and of humans of a similar age. Will decides that the results on Caesar are so conclusive that he will treat his father (John Lithgow), who is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's with the same drug  which initially not only stops the disease – but starts to actually reverse the symptoms – until side-effects start appearing  Meanwhile, Ape sanctuary owner John Landon (Brian Cox) – is compelled to take in Caesar after he attacks a next door neighbour that has been abusing Will's father.Caesar ultimately discovers where he came from and now knows why he has become so intelligent – and devises a plan to get more of the ALZ-112 drug to give to his fellow apes. Caesar soon takes control of an ape army. Soon Caesar uses his superior intelligence and skills to overthrow the brutal zoo keepers and arranges a mass break-out from the Ape Sanctuary and make their bid for freedom  John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Shrek series, 3rd rock from the Sun) and Brian Cox (Manhunter, Troy) are giants of the acting world – but even these heavyweights were completely overshadowed by the performance of ANDY SERKIS (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Sex and Drugs and Rock n' Roll, King Kong, The Hobbit) as Caesar – who totally stole every scene he appeared in  James Franco (127 Hours, Eat Pray Love) as Will, and Freida Pinto – (Slumdog Millionaire) as the love interest Caroline give good sound performances along with Tom Felton as Dodge – the brutal zoo keeper The use of CGI created monkeys is very good and convincing especially for the close up shots and the battle scenes). The facial expressions and mannerisms of the actors far exceed anything that has been seen before – they are really believable.Though most of these events – especially the portrayal of the monkeys by Andy Serkis and Co. is so convincing that you feel compelled to be on the monkeys side! I feel that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES could easily kick-start the flagging Planet of the Apes franchise – hopefully, they would all be films of the high quality and caliber of this film.RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is 105mins long, is a PG-12A certificate and will be on general release from Thurs 11th August, 2011",Null,0,1,8 August 2011
Up," Excellent - uplifting ... your hearts will soar ...
","An excellent atmosphere in the cinema, eagerly awaited the new film from the Disney / Pixar studios 'UP' – We were provided with 3D-Glasses – so expectations were high, and the mood was certainly improved even further by an excellent 3D animation short from Pixar called 'Partly Cloudy' I thought that Pixar and Disney have a bit of a blockbuster on their hands – this film will be a favourite for kids and families for many years to come  Everything about it screamed out class, quality and imagination  and the 3D animation put it into a class of it's own ... The story revolves around a pair of young kids Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) and his friend (later his wife) Ellie (Elie Doctor) who have dreams of becoming explorers and of visiting foreign lands joining in exciting adventures along the way  Unfortunately, life has a habit of getting in the way and their dreams gradually fizzle out  until – later in life Carl finds himself alone, and after an regrettable accident Carl is destined to lose his house and to be retired off to an old folks home  In rebellion to this  and once more filled again with the sense of adventure – Carl ties thousands of balloons to his house to escape and to drift off to foreign lands and adventures  along the way picking up a unwilling hitchhiker in the shape of Russell (Jordan Nagai) a young boy scout trying earnestly to achieve his 'help the aged' merit badge  You just can't help laughing out loud at some the adventures Carl and Russell get up to  but saying that  his film is also quite moving in parts  This is entertainment of the 'highest' order for young and old alike  This will be a very, very popular film  Pixar have a real winner on their hands  I thought it was very 'uplifting' – your 'spirits will soar' when you see this film  I can't recommend 'UP' enough  see it on a big screen to get the best 3D results ... enjoy  : )",10,2,6,1 June 2009
Limitless," Compelling viewing ...
","Directed by NEIL BURGER (The Illusionist), LIMITLESS is a fast-paced thriller that tells the story of hopeful, but failed writer Eddie Morra (played by BRADLEY COOPER) – who, during a chance meeting, discovers a new drug NZT48 that expands his minds capacity (from the usual 20%) so much he can use his brain up to 100% with much greater efficiency Eddie then starts on a rapid upward spiral in everything he does – succeeding at all tasks that he puts his mind to  Pretty soon Eddie realizes that the drug is starting to change everything about himself – and he realizes that he has become 'super focused' and has a 'total recall' of everything he has ever read, seen or done, an ability that he uses very successfully to his profitable advantage  and business tycoon Carl Van Loon (ROBERT DE NIRO – The godfather, Raging Bull) is quick to recognise Eddie as the ultimate money making machine  But, not everything goes well  and soon after suffering from some of the drug's side-effects, and the realization of his growing dependency on his 'fix'  Eddie decides to find out more about where the drug comes from – meanwhile, Eddie's success is getting noticed in some very seedy quarters by mobsters who also want part of the action  After seeing BRADLEY COOPER in The A-Team, and the Hangover (both fairly effortless / 'passable' movies – with little thinking required), I wasn't expecting much from him in this film  but, as it turned out I was very impressed  it has a good plot, is thought-provoking and has plenty of twists and turns (akin to Usual Suspects / Memento) to surprise the audience along the way  I think it is Cooper's best film so far  which bodes well because he is in pretty much every scene of this film – and in some scenes there is even more than one of him in the scene! Top marks should go to the script which was very well written, the direction very well paced and structured, the camera work and visual effects were excellent, the music also builds up the tension nicely in this finely crafted thriller.Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are convincing in their roles, and they were ably supported by a fine supporting cast – specific mentions go to ABBIE CORNISH (Bright Star) as Lindy, ANNA FRIEL (The Street, Bathory) as the brief ex-wife Melissa, ANDREW HOWARD – as the very convincing 'baddie' Gennady, and JOHNNY WHITWORTH as the ex Brother-in-Law Vernon.I noticed from the credits that Bradley Cooper was one of the Producers of LIMITLESS, so he is really putting his money where his mouth is  and in this instance, I believe he has made a very wise investment  and I would expect LIMITLESS to do very well at the box-office  I wouldn't be surprised if this was one of the biggest grossing films this year  LIMITLESS is 105 mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on UK general release from 23rd March 2011",8,0,1,22 March 2011
Thor," It helps if you are hammered ,,,
","THOR (The God of Thunder) is the latest 3D comic book super-hero roll-out from the Marvel stables – Directed by KENNETH BRANAGH (Wallander, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the film tells the story of the enigmatic, powerful, but ultimately flawed warrior godAfter peace has reigned for millennia between Asgard and the Frost Giants after a brutal war, there is an attempt made to try to steal back the Frost Giants source of power from Asgard – this ignites the fury of Thor and his buddies (the Warriors Three and Sif), who take it upon themselves to teach the Frost Giants a lesson (much against Odin's warnings)  and it all goes horribly wrong  Odin is incensed by these actions and Thor is cast out of the mythical realm of Asgard by his father and sent to live in punishment amongst humans on Earth without his super powers for his recklessness in re-igniting the ancient feudal war against the Frost Giants.Once on Earth, Thor realizes that he has lost his super-powers – and meanwhile in Asgard, Thor's adopted half-brother Loki schemes to take control of Asgard from Odin by covertly teaming up with the Frost Giants Unknown to Thor, his most dangerous adversary is much closer to home than he thinks  CHRIS HEMSWORTH (Star Trek, Home and Away (TV)) plays the title role, he should be a hit with the ladies – but his acting is a bit wooden  The only real acting of any note is by ANTHONY HOPKINS (who else?) who plays Odin the ruler of Asgard, father of Thor and his adopted brother (and nemesis) Loki (played menacingly well by TOM HIDDLESTON), and IDRIS ELBA who plays Heimdall the defender of Asgard and the Bifrost (Rainbow Bridge) is also pretty awesome RENE RUSSO plays Frigga wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, and NATALIE PORTMAN plays Jane Foster an Astrophysist and is the love interest – apparently Natalie had accepted the role before reading the script – and that doesn't say a lot about her judgement  Although it's not in the same league and certainly doesn't have the same gravitas as the recent Batman movies, THOR is basically a bit of fun ... there is no real story line of any note to worry about  it has some good effects, some comic moments, some bad acting and some of the 3D stuff works to make things interesting  so, as long as you are content to switch off thinking for a couple of hours it's a pleasant enough way to pass the time  I think THOR 'should' be successful (even just for the kids toys and merchandise) and It looks very much like there will be a sequel or two in the offing – it has potential  so hopefully when they get a better story line (and maybe a different director) then this franchise may be worth revisiting  THOR was originally shot in 2D format but has since had some 3D enhancements added, and some of the 7.1 Surround Sound Dolby effects are very good.THOR is 114mins long, is an PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday 6th May, 2010",4,14,46,20 April 2011
Zombieland," Awful ...
","Personally, I thought that Zombieland was a useless pile of drivel  (and I'm being nice about it when I say that)  Basically, it's a film that failed on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start ... so, I'm not going to even bother  It's a 'comedy' about rampaging zombies taking over and our four 'heroes' trying to keep out of their clutches  and quite frankly it would have been better for all concerned if the zombies had finished off these four characters in the first act  Apart from a fairly comical cameo by Bill Murray (as himself)  the rest of the film has no redeeming features to speak of  This is definitely NOT a film that you see twice – or can recommend  unfortunately, my main regret is that I got to see it even once",2,15,35,3 October 2009
Joker," Not much to laugh about
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ...Joker is a VERY predictable film that openly plagiarised other films, particularly Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY and Brad Anderson's THE MACHINIST, and whoever choose the totally inappropriate music score needs shooting.Joker is a hard watch, NOT, because of its action (or distinct lack of it), but because it is VERY dark and just depressing throughout.Not a lot of thought seems to have gone into this picture which based around a very flimsy, simplistic plotline.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a socially inept, grotesque and emanciated outcast living at home with his ailing Mother, works as a children's clown and as a part time human advertising slogan board for local two-bit shops and businesses. He suffers from a medical condition (evidently a form of Asperger's syndrome) that causes him to laugh manically and uncontrollably at the most inappropriate times getting him into a series of sticky situations and violent beatings.Arthur's only hope for salvation (he believes) is to succeed in comedy - an art at which he sucks. His hero is the talk show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro - in an almost mirror image of his portrayal in Martin Scorsese's KING OF COMEDY).The frequent beatings continue unabated, until eventually (and so VERY predictably) the worm turns ... and Arthur (whilst still in his clown's make-up) fights back and kills three assailants on a subway train ... which, (inexplicably) leads to a sizeable faction of down and outs and criminals in Gotham City rising up, to praise the 'Killer Clown' and they start rioting against society.Murray Franklin notices Arthur in one of his show's audience and chats to him on-stage, leading to what Arthur believes a connection between them.The Gotham riots continue support of the Killer Clown antics and killings which escalate and get much closer to home after Arthur loses his job.
Eventually, Arthur gets his dream big break, with a guest slot on the Murray Franklin show ... but, by now, he wants to be introduced as Joker.
When Joker realises that he is being laughed AT rather than laughed WITH, the Joker takes a terrible revenge.Ultimately, Joker, as a film ... quite simply ... JUST DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, into what COULD HAVE BEEN, with a bit more forethought and a much better script/director, an intriguing insight into what would be the REAL motivation behind what would create a character like the Joker and his ultimate downward spiral into madness.Joaquin Phoenix may have lost 24kg to play the role as the emanciated anti-hero... but, I just can't help comparing on just how much better Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson were as the Joker.",4,3,11,14 October 2019
The Social Network," I'll be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!
","From the director David FINCHER (The Curious case of Benjamin Button, Fight Club, Se7en), THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of the development and rise and rise of the world-wide Social Networking phenomena FACEBOOK.Shortly after breaking up with his girlfriend, Harvard computer nurd Mark Zuckerberg (JESSE EISENBERG) sits down at his computer and 'blogs' bad things about his now ex-girlfriend .. and, in an act of revenge decides to create a website where students can 'grade' the girls within the university. News of the site goes around like wildfire and they get hundreds of students accessing it  and an idea was born  the power of the internet as a revolutionary new communication medium for social networking  Many began to see the potential in the new social medium and attempt to jump on the bandwagon and get in at an early stage  with the hapless Winklevoss brothers claiming to have spawned the original idea of having a unique 'Harvard' exclusive social site  many tried and many fail  but it is the Mark Zuckerberg's tenacity and clarity of focus with THE FACEBOOK site launched in Feb 2004, that forces it's way through the dead wood and grows and grows in popularity at a phenomenal speed  and pretty soon it has expanded to many of the other universities and schools  As a computer genius come geek, Zuckerberg is himself a social misfit that finds human interaction and communication difficult, and he turns to his one true friend Eduardo Saverin (ably played by Andrew Garfield), for financial support in setting up the servers, routers and infrastructure required to cope with the every increasing demand for the Facebook site  Zuckerberg and Saverin decide to jointly split the company they create 70 / 30 (in favour of Zuckerberg).Things progress well until Saverin decides there is a need for more investment and to get advertisers interested  a move which Zuckerberg opposes claiming that it would detract from the 'purity' of the Facebook idea  Meanwhile on the scene comes the another headlining entrepreneur way ahead of his time – Sean Parker (played excellently by Justin Timberlake) – the founder and genius behind NAPSTER and music downloading / sharing site. Fresh from a recent legal defeat against the Music industry (over Napster), Sean still believes he has won by changing the face of the music industry forever . And he is chomping at the bit for a new challenge – and sees THE FACEBOOK as the next big thing (he is actually the one who suggested renaming it to just FACEBOOK).There follows a series on wide parties and roller-coaster wheeling and dealings and Sean Parker eventually engineers a situation where there is finally a breakdown in relationships between Zuckerberg and Saverin and they go their separate ways.The film is primarily based around the legal dispute of over ownership of Facebook brand and intellectual copy write of the product – by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo Saverin against Zuckerberg with flashbacks to previous times elaborating on claims and counter-claims made during the case.Launched in February 2004, Facebook was born, and a mere six years and 500 million friends later, making Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history ... but as the tagline for the film states – 'you don't get 500 Million friends without making some enemies ' I must admit after seeing Jesse Eisenberg's awful performances in the truly woeful Zombieland and Adventureland movies – I really didn't hold out much hope for his acting career  but I was pleasantly surprised in this instance  as in the Social Network he is 'better' (still not great) but he can actually act  With no real 'heavy-weights' in the acting cast – this was a film that had to stand up and fight with a decent story line – which I was quite impressed with (being a 'true' and interesting story) As a trivia side point, the director of this movie David Fincher will also be taking the reins to direct the 'Americanised' version (God help us all ) of the remake of excellent THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO  along with Rooney Mara (who plays Erica Albright in the Social Network) taking on the leading role of Lisbeth Salander.I imagine that this will be a popular movie as almost everyone I know has a facebook account – and I'll even be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!",7,0,2,8 October 2010
The Fighter," Christian Bale's performance is a knock-out ....
","THE FIGHTER is a new film from director David O. RUSSELL (Three Kings, I Heart Huckabees), depicting the story of the early years of Micky Ward (played by MARK WAHLBERG – Boogie Nights, Planet of the Apes, Italian Job, The Departed) the boxer, known to his fans as 'Irish', and who was trained by his ex-criminal, drug-addicted, half-brother trainer Dicky Eklund who helped him in the early years before Micky went professional in the mid 1980's – on his improbable journey to winning the world light welterweight title.The early part of the film opens with a TV documentary being filmed about Dicky (played by Christian BALE – Batman – The Dark Knight/Batman Begins, American Psycho, The Machinist), who's main claim to 'fame' was that he once boxed in 1978 with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him over  although, the vast majority of people agree that Sugar Ray Leonard tripped  Dicky is the trainer and very much a hero to the gullible Micky  unfortunately, Dicky is living very much in the past and in a drug-induced haze  he believes the documentary is to chart the progress of his 'comeback'  although the TV producers are actually filming it for a different reason entirely  Micky's boxing progress is actually very much hampered by an increasingly unreliable Dicky, and his domineering Mother-of-nine Alice, (played splendidly by MELISSA LEO) who is also his Manager and after a series of mis-matched bouts against vastly bigger opponents Micky starts to think about quitting – until he meets barmaid and love interest Charlene (played by AMY ADAMS – Enchanted, Sunshine Cleaning)who is convinced in his potential and advises him to seek a new manager and trainer  which brings them into direct conflict with 'the family'  at which point all hell breaks loose  There is a fair amount of pugilist action (as you would expect) to keep the fans of boxing happy  are there are some strong performances by some of the cast – namely the lovely Amy Adams and Melissa Leo  The 'real' star-turn of this movie though, is the performance of Christian Bale – who steals every scene he is in with a terrific performance – he has been nominated for best supporting actor Oscar  and on this evidence he deserves it – as his performance was a knock-out ...As for Amy Adams and Melissa Leo – they have both been nominated for best supporting Actress – now that is a punch up I would like to see!THE FIGHTER is 115mins long, is rated an R certificate and will be on general release from 4th February 2011",7,1,1,3 February 2011
