E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," phone home!!!!!!!
","ET is still today one of the most remembered movies of the century with little ET, and Elliot and a very young Drew Barrymore. It is a great film and everyone should like it, it isn't my favorite but I like it all the same A 6 out of 10. One of Steven Spielberg's finest",Null,0,0,7 June 1999
Wayne's World," It`s party time!!!
","This film was inspired from the TV series, and they did a great job in making a movie of it. Mike Myers and Dana Carvy make a great comedy Duo. they have the task of saving their TV show from the money hungry Benjamin.Wayne meets the girl of his dreams in the shape of Tia Carrere, What a HOT babe!!!.Cameo from Alice Cooper, did a great job, better than the sequel. I give it a 6 and a half out of 10.",Null,0,2,18 May 1999
The Terminator," Cyberdyne Systems Model 101
","The Terminator was and still is a one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made, everything about it is wonderfully put together by James Cameron.His greatest movie apart from maybe T2, but he should be very proud of this movie because it is a movie for all ages, well most of it is. Arnie of course plays the almost unstoppable cyborg, who has a mission that is simply to kill the mother of the man who has caused humans to fight back against the cyborgs in the future. Linda Hamilton is the 'Mother of the Future' who is being stalked by Mr. Terminator, but she gets help from a soldier sent back from the future by her son, Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn. A great movie over all and they didn't make a mistake by making a sequel....strange!!. An 8 and a half out of 10.",9,0,0,6 November 1999
Aliens," The best out of the legacy
","Now I might be slightly bias seeing as I saw this movie before the rest, but it is still the best one. The Action, Comedy, Monsters, One Liners, Characters and Tension are all packed together to make this a very unforgettable movie. 'Aliens (1986)' the superior sequel to the 1979  block buster 'Alien' still holds a kind of original but improved cast, although Sigourney Weaver is the only original character from the first. Ellen Ripley is woken from her Cryogenic sleep 57 years after she survived 'Alien'. But now she is with a whole new group of marines on board the Main Ship the 'Sulaco'. Included in the group are Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bill Paxton as Private Hudson, Janette Goldstein as the female version of Rambo, Private J. Vasquez, and Lance Henriksen as the new Android, L.Bishop, plus a whole load more of Lambs that are led to the slaughter. A very nasty character, Carter J. Burke, played by Paul Reiser, convinces Ripley to accompany the marines back onto LV-426 to destroy the aliens, although this is not his real intention. The full extent of his Evil doings is revealed after his failed attempt to let Ripley and Rebecca 'Newt' Jordan played by Carrie Henn, be impregnated by the face huggers. He sent the 158 civilians of 'Hadleys Hope' into LV-426 to be wiped out by the Aliens, only Newt survived, doing so by hiding in the vent shafts that are too small to allow alien access.It is only a matter of time before the aliens reach the few remaining marines, and its a case of once  again hunt or be the hunted. There are some classic quotes, that usually come in the midst of the action, as Venquez and Gorman run out of ammo in the vents with aliens running at them in all directions she calmly lets him know 'You always were an A**hole Gorman!' then Kaboom, their Last grenade wipes them out along with a few aliens.The final showdown between Ripley and the Queen Alien doesn't fail to please, as she gets into the yellow thing, I can't remember what its called, she yells to the Alien who is attempting to get Newt, 'Get away from her, You Bitch!!'A remarkable movie, I give this a 9 out of 10.",8,0,0,9 July 2000
The Evil Dead," Evil comes when you say its name 5 times ..... whoops that`s Candyman
","Evil Dead is the only trilogy that changes its Genre as it goes along.Evil Dead was a Horror, and it was very cool..... Evil Dead II was a Horror-Comedy, and finally Evil Dead III was just a Comedy.There was some intense bits in Evil Dead and It was a pretty scary film at some points. As a Horror fan I was not disappointed with this film, and there was quite a few deaths which is what I like to see in Horror films.This is quite a good film, but believe it or not, I prefer the sequel Evil Dead II, but only just!!Watch this film then watch Evil Dead II then Evil Dead III.I give this an Evil 7 out of 10",Null,0,0,29 April 1999
Army of Darkness," What a Dark Army!!
","Army of Darkness was the final installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy. It was funny, and it still has Bruce Campbell as Ash in it.What I Did not get though was why change the genre of the trilogy as it goes along?. Still it was a good film all in all, but the 2nd movie was and still is my favorite!!I give it a 6 out of 10",Null,0,2,10 May 1999
Scream 2," somebody has taken their love for scary movies and created a not very good sequel
","I thought Scream was by far the best Horror movie, it was like a real life event, there was a clearly thought out motive, and when you did find out who the killers were I was surprised. Now onto Scream 2, this was a good attempt to jump out of the shadow of the original. The story line was weak and there was only one killer who had a motive. I was glad to see they kept 4 of the original characters,but like I said there was a weak story line, the motive by the killer was complete crap and to top it all off they killed off my favorite character.......guess who that is. I liked the scene in the classroom where the students were talking about disappointing sequels. It`s true there are very rare sequels that are better than the first. A 6 out of 10.",10,0,0,12 April 1999
Jaws," It was the first
","Jaws is a first class film and nearly everyone I know has the same thing to say about it..... it is brilliant. And they are right, the 3 main actors are brilliantly put together, and I can`t see anyone doing a better job than anyone in this movie.Robert Shaw was a very very talented actor, in the second James Bond Film 'From Russia with Love'.He played Red Dutch with frightening accuracy and he is still one of the most rememberable characters.But when ever I hear the name of Robert Shaw I think of Jaws.He played Quint the shark fisherman with a slight touch of manic.It was probably the best role he took up.I have heard that he made up the USS Indianapolis story.And I have heard that there might be a 25th anniversary for Jaws, and it will be a special edition like Star Wars.It was a tragic shame that Robert died of a heart attack in 1978, he was a great actor.Richard Dreyfuss played Matt Hooper the shark expert who had the job to convince Amity Island that they had a Great White Shark feeding off the bathers..Richard has starred in other memorable films as well such as Close Encounters of the third Kind.And Roy Schneider played the police chief. He would become the hero of the film and the sequel.And the real star of the film was the shark who was named 'bruce' after Steven Spielbergs lawyer. This is the best film of the series and is the most rememberable film of all, people always say how fake the shark looks but cold they do better?I give this film a 9 out of 10 because of the great actors and story line.",10,2,4,23 April 1999
The Waterboy," H20 H20 H20 H20 H20!!!
","This is Adam Sandler`s greatest performance that he has done so far.He plays a partly handicapped waterboy who is serving an American Football team who does not appreciate him at all. But then he Finds a team which hasn`t won a game for 4 years and who have no money left to spend, but then when the team coach, played by Henry Winkler, finds out that Bobby Boucher (Sandler) and this is his key to victory, just like Forrest Gump did for his Football Team, Booby Boucher did that and a whole lot more for his team,A few well known faces pop up in this great movie, Adam Sandler is the lead character, Henry Winkler who is better known as Fonzie in Happy Days, Kathy Bates plays Hellen Boucher, Bobby`s mother, and Fairuza Baulk plays Bobby`s girl friend.I like this movie a lot, and I have watched it at the cinema for the past 4 days in a row!! A definite Oscar winner, and it is the funniest movie of the month if not year!!I give it a H20 loving 9 out of 10",Null,2,3,18 May 1999
Scream," movies don`t create psycho`s,movies make psycho`s more creative.
","WOW........ this movie was brilliant, it was the most mysterious horror movie that I have ever seen, it kept me wondering who actually was the killer, but then something happened to throw me off track,and I was not expecting it when the killer was actually revealed. I was disappointed at the fact that they killed off one of the best characters , well one of the best female characters anyway.If you think this is a stupid waste of time and it is just the same as any other horror movie, and that it is just 'some stupid killer who stalks some big breasted girl who can`t act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door' well then you will get a phone call......and here`s my advice if this does happen....Don`t answer the phone, Don`t open the door, Don`t try to escape......This is basically a very very good horror movie, that puts Horror into an all new perspective for that genre, and like Billy says.......'life is just one long movie'.Also check out the cameo appearance by the great Wes Craven himself.........this is a top class movieIt gets a 9 out of 10.",10,0,1,13 April 1999
Halloween," Do you like scary movies?? well watch this !!
","Halloween is a classic film, I loved every bit of it. Michael Meyers is by far the most realistic and scary killer in any horror movie, like I said he is realistic and gets hurt he does not just stand there when he gets shot or anything like that........and he does not magically appear in front of you like in all those dumb Jason ' Friday the 13th' movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a wonderful role as the ever stalked Laurie Strode. She is the all time Scream Queen. It was a shame they ruined this great movie by making some crap sequels, well except for a certain couple. All in all this was a great movie with a well thought out ending....it was obvious that there was going to be a sequel. This gets a 8.5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,12 April 1999
Halloween," The start of a legacy
","Michael Myers is perhaps the greatest, creepiest and most realistic serial killer of all time. His mask is really cool too. Halloween the start of it all, beautifully put together. A young Jamie lee Curtis plays the sister of Michael. He has a little mission which is to kill all his family...... OK he must of got bored........he started young though at the age of 6!! A great movie with Donald Pleasance as Doctor Samuel Loomis. A 7 and a half out of 10.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 'WHATEVER YOU DO NOT GO TO SLEEP!!!'
","Well I have finally seen this film and let me tell you, it is the best Elm Street movie of them all!!. You don`t really get to see Freddy Kruiger untill the showdown between him and Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp. Johnny Depp plays a great part as the boyfriend of the heroine.He looks like he bit the dust near the end, but this being a movie you just do not know what to believe. The ending is absolutely unpredictable and is an ending not too many films are allowed to show.Great film, shame about the next 5 movies that followed. I give it a 7 and a half out of 10.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Once they made History...........
","I first saw the sequel and I did not understand what they were talking about, especially about the Princess`. But then I saw this film, and now I understand.The whole film is great and the story line is funny but brilliant, which makes a great Comedy film. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make a great partnership, and a great equivalent to Wayne and Garth. This is a brilliant film and I recommend it to ..... um .....Movie buffs like me.So I will give this a 7 and a half out of 10. And remember ......... Party On Dudes!!.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
The Wedding Singer," Growing old with you!!??
","This is a great comedy and the combination of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler is great. This is about a wedding singer who is engaged to be married but she stands him up at the altar, and at that same time, Julia (Barrymore)is having doubts about her engagement with her fiancee Glen. It`s only until Glen is found cheating on Julia by the Wedding Singer that he decides to move to Vegas with Julia!! So it`s a race against time for Robbie Hart to admit his feelings for Julia.... A great film and a great Cameo by Billy Idol.I give it a 7 out of 10.",Null,1,1,18 May 1999
Evil Dead II," Evil comes when you call its name 5 times .... yeah that is Candyman
","Evil Dead was a good film, and I liked it a lot, but like I said in the comment for Evil Dead, i prefer this one.It still has the Original character Bruce Campbell played by Ashley Williams who is still living through the nightmare of The living Evil Dead.Every time I watch Evil Dead there is one sentence that I always remember....... 'you`re going to die, you`re going to die'.I give this a 7 and a half out of 10.",8,0,0,29 April 1999
