Casablanca," casablanca, a place of love and war or just war.
","'Casablanca'(1942) directed by Michael Curtis and starring the amazing Humphrey Bogart is a film of grand historical value with a stimulating romantic plot buried intimately in the cross fire of what was supposed to be an 'oasis' from the devastating prejudices of war. This film is beautifully shot in black and white with a lighting that is so dramatically soft it sets the audience in a mood to uncover secrets and lies. the shots are still so crisp it is almost colorful. Casablanca is an intelligent film of which was obviously brilliantly edited with every scene character and shot so crucial and significant to general understanding of the complex plot, turn away and your lost indefinitely.",Null,0,2,24 April 2016
Citizen Kane," 'Rosebud'kane
","'Citizen Kane' is perhaps one of the most powerful film productions in American history there is quite a lot to admire and loathe about the film regardless is it thought about carefully and is made a reference of even years after the hit was quite done being a hit. 'Citizen Kane' directed by Orson Wells also stars the incredibly talented director as our protagonist Charles Fster Kaneloosely based on the successful life of William Harst. what truly makes this picture so unique is the form of which is is shot, filmed, and edited. not only is this story told through a reporters research of the late mr. Kane but it is expressed using flash backs of the life and legacy of the wealthy and successful publisher. what is also very powerful about this film is that wells wrote directed and starred in this American classic. wells wrote a legacy of his own. this entire film is not even for a second about the what is happening to the world, or a society, or a family, or to a relationship, or a man. it is dedicated to observing and analyzing one character.",Null,1,2,4 May 2016
