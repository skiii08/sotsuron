Black Swan," Good dancing, awful script
","This film looks like it was made by two directors - one for the aesthetically pleasing dance sequences, another for the atrocious script and weak plot. Credit to Natalie Portman for obviously putting a lot of effort into learning ballet. Also to Vincent Cassel for his portrayal of the dance teacher. Masturbation scenes and lesbian sex however aren't a sufficient replacement for realistic dialogue. They didn't convince me that this would be enough to make Nina 'let go' and produce the perfect Black Swan performance. If this really is the best that Hollywood has to offer this year, then the U.S. film industry must have gone downhill really fast.",6,3,6,24 January 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Pretty But Ridiculous
","This gets positive marks for its nice look - glitzy, slick deco with attractive actors accompanied by hip (or so they thought) music. As to the plot, are we really supposed to believe that nonsense with the giant drilling machine brought in - apparently with everyone else looking the other way, RIGHT UNDER THE TARGET CASINO? Is it usual for private individuals to drill huge tunnels under Las Vegas any time they feel like it?Al Pacino is good in his part as the ultra-slimy casino boss - Dannys bunch of friends, while acting cool, unfortunately don't convince. They're just too clever to be true. A nice comfortable end to the trilogy, but ultimately a let-down.",5,1,1,8 July 2007
There Will Be Blood," There IS blood - right now!
","Right, I'm joining in the chorus of those who are enthusiastic about this movie. It has everything a good story needs - stunning photography, appropriately nervous music, and of course a fantastic performance by Mr. Day-Lewis, almost matched by that of Paul Dano. There are some parallels to 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' of course.Could not the 'blood' in the title refer to today's conflicts over oil and other energy resources? I actually expected to see a lot more blood in TWBB, yet there were two murders. A taste of things to come.To those who find this film 'boring', can you not relate to the universal themes of love, hate, greed and power, religion vs. money? An important period of American history unfolds before your eyes.",9,1,6,15 February 2008
