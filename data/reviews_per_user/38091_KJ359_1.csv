Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie can be described with two words -- VERY BIG !
","Just like the first Star Wars trilogy George Lucas did wonderful job. He was able to achieve all this that he couldn't, back in 1977. The movie really deserves to be watched a couple of times.",10,0,0,21 September 1999
