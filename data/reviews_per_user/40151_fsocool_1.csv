Iron Man 3," Aluminum Foil Man
","Trailers usually indicate or show the movie in summary. How sad that the brilliant trailer was made so well that the movie was a big let-down.PROS: 1. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts 2. Happy Hogan and Downtown Abbey3. Tony Stark and James Rhodes 4. Plane rescue 5. The Tennessee kid (yeah I liked it) CONS: 1. The Mandarin. 'nuff said. 2. The Lego-Iron Army 3. The villain's non-motivation 4. Wasting Rebecca Hall and Ben Kingsley's talents Lastly, nothing ends a disappointing film like a disappointing scene at the end of the end-credits. The brilliance of the past Marvel movies was that the extra scene left me excited for the next movie. This scene was like a slap in the face after being punched in the gut by the movie villain reveal.",2,3,6,7 May 2013
