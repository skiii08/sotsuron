The Avengers," Action Punched And Nothing else !!
",Well the movie was as i expected full of ACTION !!!! i found this movie much entertaining when i put this movie in Action movie categories of the movies i've seen..But when it comes where you expect the complete movie with a good script nice direction nice action and everything a good movie needs...At somewhere in the movie you will feel like something like this was seen in some old movies.. and that's what i hate about this movie i.e. The SCRIPT of this movie is not feels like a freshly new written script...I am giving it 7/10 just because of Mind Blowing Action !!! and for the Punch that Hulk hits to Thor.. :),7,1,6,6 May 2012
