Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very fine beginning
","I just saw this movie again tonight, after six years. More than ever, I think the people who panned it when it first came out (and since) are not making much sense.This is a fine movie, just as a movie. True, some of it won't make a lot of sense if you've never seen any Star Wars films (are there any such people on Earth?). And as chapter one in six chapters, I think it is excellent. It lays the foundation well. Some people complained that we don't know much about Qui-gon. True, but what do you want -- yet more prequels? You've got to start somewhere.If you are at all aware of the original three movies and the buildup to this one, I don't see how you can criticize this one because Annikan is a boy. Of course he's a boy -- that's the whole point, to start at the beginning. Unlike some posters here, I liked that his mother called him Anny. The diminutive is perfectly appropriate. Is his mother supposed to know that he will turn out to be a fearsome figure? His being a slave, with his mother, is a fine idea. His having no father around makes good psychological sense. That there was in fact no father is nice symbolism. I didn't find it hokey. It could also tie in somewhat with Qui- gon's explanation of the force as being produced by micro-organisms. And I for one am very glad to have a rational explanation of the force, even a rather unlikely one as this. Someone posted that this makes it too scientific, less mysterious. Duh! It IS a science fiction movie after all. We need all the rationality and science we can get these days. The last thing we need is more Harry Potter type mumbo jumbo and supernatural baloney.I liked the pod racing and the character of Darth Maul, as others have commented. And Jar-Jar? Maybe he wasn't perfect, and yes I had trouble getting all his dialog, but so what? The underwater city was very cool, and the trip through the planet was cool. He was meant for comic relief and to appeal to the kids. Fine. I also thought Natalie Portman did a great job portraying the Queen. Sometimes she did seem stiff, but, hey the queen is very young and no doubt a bit uptight and overly serious.I suspect that most of the people who wrote negative reviews and seemed to be so disappointed by this movie were kids in 1977 when the first one came out. You're not going to get that feeling back, not with this movie or any. I was a young adult in 1977, so maybe I can be a bit more measured about it. I loved the first movie then, both for its own merits and for the fact that the previous decade had been rather dismal for movies --too much cynicism, too much intellectualizing, too little imaginative, adventurous fun. In 1999 I looked forward to this movie as rejuvenating the franchise and rekindling a lot of adventurous fun. This movie succeeds in that.-- henry",9,1,2,3 January 2009
Troy," magnificent!
","I just watched this movie in its entirety last night. Over the last several years I've seen parts of it on TV and was always impressed, but now that I've seen it all, I have to write a comment.This is a stunning, magnificent movie, perhaps the best war movie I've ever seen. The only better one I can think of is 'Saving Private Ryan.' The acting by Brad Pitt is awesome. Eric Bana is excellent too, as are, really, all the supporting characters. There are no bad portrayals. There is no bad dialog.I will skip over complementing the battle scenes, but, yes, I agree with other posters, the battle between Achilles and Hector is marvelous, and many other ones are very fine.I have been a fan of the ancient Greeks all my life and have read several translations of the Iliad and Odyssey. This may sound like heresy, but this movie is better. The writers have wisely dropped the parts of the Iliad that would be difficult to translate into a film for modern viewers. They have put aside parts of the Iliad and brought in scenes from the Odyssey and other traditions. It is amusing to read the reviews of some people here who complain that the result is not 'historically accurate.' Oh come now. Surely you don't think the Iliad was historically accurate? It's a myth! The truth to be found in myths is not historical accuracy. The net result is that the movie captures the feel of the Iliad for me. Brad Pitt's Achilles is absolutely perfect. The scenes with Priam in his hut begging for the body of Hector, and the earlier scene with his mother before he leaves for the war, are marvelous. This is no comic book or super hero version of Achilles. This is real.One of the finest short exchanges I've ever seen is with Achilles and Briseus in the hut. 'When does it ever end?' 'It never ends.'The only reason I don't rate it it a 10, but only 9, is because inherent in the story is the semi-divinity of Achilles. While that adds something wonderful, it also makes it slightly less relevant to ordinary human life, though you can say that on the other hand it thereby symbolizes parts of human life.In any event, a magnificent achievement all around. Clearly a performance and embodiment of Achilles and the ancient Greeks that can never be surpassed. Way, way superior to the movie '300', which is full of comic book characters.",9,1,3,21 January 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," a very fine movie in the best sci-fi series
","As if we needed another comment, here I go with a brief one.An awful lot of people have written comments panning this movie. I think they are nuts. This is a very fine movie, and a very fine part 3 in the saga. Danes and Stahl are excellent. There is good character development. The occasional humor was excellent. The chase scene with the crane vehicle was superb -- maybe the best chase scene I've ever seen. I've seen this movie at least 3 times, but that chase scene always keeps me on edge and gasping, probably because it's believable. Yes, I know that isn't really what would have happened if the hook had caught on something down in a manhole, but so what? It's a movie for goodness sake. Other critics here have compared T3 unfavorably to The Matrix. Sorry, this movie is far better than the Matrix. Half the time I couldn't figure out what was going on in The Matrix. The fight scenes with the slow motion figures pivoting around are just silly and unbelievable. Furthermore, the basic premise of the Matrix series of movies is unbelievable. The events here in the Terminator movies are much more plausible, like good science fiction always is. The Matrix is more like fantasy, almost like Harry Potter (ugh).No, it's not as good as T2, but so what? It's still very very good.<ul><li>henry</li></ul>",8,5,8,17 December 2008
