Insidious: Chapter 2," Boring
","This movie is absolutely boring. It solely relies on cheap scares, the story isn't believable at all and is filled with clich√©s from other horror movies. The first part of the series was better at delivering horror even though it were nothing more but sudden scares One of the only good things about Insidious: Chapter 2 and the past installment is the music, which is reminiscent of glorious horror films such as The Shining or Psycho. Another aspect worth of mention is the SFX department. It was good to see the use of makeup, camera techniques and creepy settings, instead of the use of too much CGI to create an eerie atmosphere.",5,2,3,30 June 2015
