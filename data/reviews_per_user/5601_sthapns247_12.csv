The Longest Yard," Funny, well directed film.
","Adam Sandler is funniest when he plays a normal person and not an over the top character. The Waterboy and Little Nicky were terrible because Sandler wasn't funny, but like Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, Adam plays a normal guy who says and does funny things. The only problem with this film is that nearly every joke has been done before in other Adam Sandler movies, while this coupled with the fact this is a re-make completely destroys any originality this film has, it did do the IN-original parts in a way that still makes them funny. And it had a good story to back its self up which makes it better than some of the other comedies out there.Now for what makes this movie really great and that is Peter Segal's directing. Every movie he makes I notice his spot on camera direction more and more. In this movie he used music to set moods better than in any comedy movie I've ever seen and I've always said that even if the movie is horrible, if the director does a good job with the camera you are still entertained till the end. (Kinda like Troy or The Patriot.) I enjoyed this movie from and entertainment standpoint only. It's not Adam Sandler's best, but it's definitely not one of his worst.",7,0,2,1 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Well, I guess it's a Disney movie...
","Yeah, it was produced by Disney and the budget had 'Disney' written all over it, but I have never seen a Disney movie quite like this before... and I like it!  It wasn't easy getting me to this movie: I don't see Disney movies in the theaters... ever and I never see pirate movies, but my friend convinced me to go and to be honest the commercials looked good.Well, I'm glad I went.  This was an experience to behold.  The landscapes and cinematography is beautiful and the acting is terrific.  The story is the only thing in this movie that's Disney and that is only the basic framework. I.g.: Don't expect a surprise ending, be prepared to say, 'Well isn't that ironic?' In a sarcastic way.  But that is okay because a movie that ends like that is okay now and then.  Besides, what is inside the frame is totally un-Disney and it made me like pirates.There are many sword fights and many people die... I think just one is a record for Disney.  The over all tone is dark and foreboding and the solution to the plot is more like an Indiana Jones film.  While there are more senses on land than in the ocean, all the scenes are beautifully done and look like something you should see in a pirate movie.Now onto the best part of the movie: Jack Sparrow.  I have a new respect, actually I have some respect, for Johnny Depp; no one could have made the role better.  He plays a headstrong, not-not-so-up-to what he thinks he is pirate.  In fact, most of the amazing stuff this guy pulls off is totally luck and total stupidity on the part of his enemies.  He also brings a level of humor that goes between sarcastic and blunt and back and forth that really makes you wonder what he's going to say. The one liners and over all mood he gives the film makes it all that more enjoyable.  He's like a modern day good for nothin' wannabe hippie that had everything dropped into his lap and if it isn't given to him, he gives up... finally a pirate I can relate to!  Anyway, I hope he returns for sequels.Keira Knightly is, well, a perfect balance between talent and beauty.  While anyone could have acted the role she makes the heroic portions of the role all that more believable and she looks damn good doing it.  She's a woman that you can believe four guys would be going after at once.  She is sexy and strong and I loved her in the movie.  Wish I could say the same for Orlando Bloom, but he really wasn't in his element and obviously hasn't developed enough to make the best of what he's got... he seemed to method act a lot of it.  Geoffrey Rush played Barbossa really well and looked especially well.  I really felt hate towards him.In all this is a terrific movie that deserves it's success.  Anyone who says other wise is looking to deep into the movie... it's Disney, and you can't expect Forrest Gump.Go see it even if you don't like pirates or Disney films, I did and I liked it.How it stacks up to me: Forrest Gump: 10/10 snatch.: 9/10 jackass the movie: 8/10 *Pirates of the Caribbean... ect: 7/10* Phone Booth: 7/10 Tears of the Sun: 6/10",7,0,1,23 July 2003
Happy Gilmore," Possibly the Funniest Movie Ever
","Now I'm not one to throw around the '____est Movie Ever,' but I'm not afraid to use it here.  I don't judge movies on one large spectrum, like many people; I judge them according to what they are supposed to do.  A war movie should appeal to my emotion on human life; acting is not necessary.  A drama should have good acting and a story that matters and is conveyed well. (Hardest to pull off.)  A comedy is just for entertainment.  The acting can be hit or miss, the story should only exist to make funny stuff happen, and it should get funnier every time you see it.  'Happy Gilmore' is like the word 'wiener' in the sense that no matter how many times I'm exposed to it is still makes me smile, giggle, chuckle, or roll over crying.Adam Sandler has a unique comic style.  It is like a combination of Chris Farley and David Spade, two of the cast members he grew up with on Saturday Night Live.  He can be the straight faced, sarcastic person Spade usually is, but he can also do excellent physical comedy and has an enormous amount of energy much like Farley.  All this comes together in this movie to make the lead character funny just thinking about him.  A hockey player playing golf that glides through life and flips out every once in a while... We've all wanted to be Happy once in our lives. (Whether the name or the adjective applies to you is irrelevant.)The story is there only to make the funny happen.  Gilmore is a failed hockey player and those scenes are awesome.  He then meets an ex-golfer with one hand... Wonder why he's an EX-golfer?  This is played into the whole 'Old, seasoned pro teaches the upstart, reluctant newbie to defeat the bad guy and everyone lives happily ever after.'  But the story is not really important because it's a comedy and it's funny.The dialogue is very good in this movie.  There are so many little things that are said that you have to watch it over and over to catch it all. There are so many one-liners and classic scenes... This is by the number one movie I quote with my friends.Comeos are also important in a comedy movie and this one has the greatest cameo of all time... Bob Barker.  When you see the movie you'll see what I mean.  This also plays into the irony that has to be in a comedy movie, but needs to by styled in a way that you can't see it coming and when it happens you let out a fast, unbelieving laugh and then forget about it... It's how these movies work.All this comes together to make a movie that gets better the more and more you watch it.  The movie exists to amuse and it does this better than any other movie in history.  Some people may say that this movie is not the 'Greatest Comedy Movie' because it's stupid and senseless... I just look at them and laugh because they don't know what comedy is. (See that was irony.)There is no reason for you not to like this movie unless you look at it the same way you look at 'Forrest Gump' or 'Saving Private Ryan...' Don't, its not a drama or a war movie, it's a comedy movie... The best comedy movie ever for that matter.NOTE: Watch the VHS or DVD because it is terribly censored when it is shown on TV and it really detracts from the over all mood of the movie.",10,1,1,8 February 2004
Crash," Overrated...
","... Like most of Hollywood's blockbuster attempts at emotion and a 'message.' A message has to be presented to a viewer without patronizing them. Crash patronizes it's audience by focusing far too heavily on the racist and stupid and not enough on the other side. We are presented with a number of different stories and people. All these people are with 100% racist, 100% ignorant, or 100% none of the above. By the end, we are supposed to be believe that all the characters are 100% none of the above, but it is done in an unbelievable way that is too dry and shallow to make a solid point. Of course, if you are naive and easily won over then you will say you love this movie to feel as though you saw 'The art side of a real movie,' but what you really saw was a pathetic attempt at art that neither distinguished its self nor set any type of standard for future films aside from lowering the bar slightly.Let me start with the good things, first. The acting was great, for the most part. Most notable Matt Dillon's character; this is by far the best performance I have seen him give. None of the other characters put forth a really note-worthy performance, but of course Don Cheadle's was great. That goes without saying. The direction is well done, with some nice shots, again nothing 'new,' but very ever little is. The acting is good because of the direction, and movie never looks 'boring.' That said, lets get into the problems.The movie is too racist for its own good. It plays on pure stereotypes and nothing more. There isn't a single 'good and bad' character in the bunch, they are either extreme one way or the other and this is not real, at all. The First hour is pure stereotypical garbage. I'm a believer that stereotypes are based in fact, but not so much as that I hate almost everyone who is that type of person. The character played by Ludicrous the one of the most racist characters I have ever seen in a movie and because of that I hated his character. Even when he 'redeems' himself at the end, I can't say I was glad for him because he didn't do nearly enough to counter his image. I'm not racist at all, so I didn't even see Don Cheadle's character as anything but a person, but I saw Ludicrous as a black thief only because he made such a big deal out of it himself and for this I personally hate the movie. The other stereotypes were spot-on as stereotypes, however, way off in terms as reality. Bullock's sheltered, spoiled, rich wife was too over the top, and then the sudden change at the end was equally exaggerated. The only fairly accurate stereotypes were the Latino and Persian examples, but even those were a little too much. There are many Persian families that come to America to start businesses and know almost nothing about what they are getting into, but the extreme turn he takes seemed a little much. I also know, from experience, that there are many struggling Latino families all over America, so this was probably the only stereotyped character that wasn't massively exaggerated. All Asians, except for a 30 second scene with an insurance agent, were depicted as ignorant, submissive, and could only speak broken English, as well as being bad drivers. These are all stereotypes that not every Asian person falls under nor does one fall under all of them, but this movie makes you think they do. These are oversights that not only ruin a movie, but also lie to a possibly very naive audience and this is not entertainment.The movie would have been a lot better if it had focused only on the cop stories. Good cop, bad cop. Bad cop ends up saving the day and good cop figures out why bad cop could be as angry as he is. But even then it would have been slightly believable at best. At least I wouldn't have gotten annoyed at the other stereotypes.The other major problem I have with this movie is the Magnolia rip-off with the snow falling in Los Angeles, just like the frogs at the end of that movie and the cliché ending. The movie almost laughs in your face and makes everything it stood for seem like a joke when the fender bender at the end happens. It is either saying that this type of thing happens all the time and what you saw wasn't profound or great or it's saying that everyone is like the characters in the movie, which is a laughable idea.Average, misguided movie that's overrated at best and racist garbage at worst.",5,4,9,17 September 2005
Snatch," snatch.
","This is seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen.  In my opinion it is WAY better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  All the characters are developed and explained well and no two are the same.  I actually felt emotion for the main characters, unlike in Lock, Stock.. and I loved all the characters a lot more.  (Dennis Farina is the BEST.)While watching this movie I was constantly wondering what Ritchie was going to come up with next and I wondered that until the last frame.  This is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen because of the way the movie takes its comedy so seriously.  The comic moments are real and not designed to make you laugh on purpose, unlike most comedies.  You laugh about other people's misfortunes and the way they meet their demise and if a movie can do that; it's a winner in my book.  The only character that I didn't laugh at when they got theirs was Brick Top and that was because he was the only non-funny character. (I also love the 'making fun if other people's accents' humor... and the ENGLISH English language is funny no matter what they say.)9/10 and possibly more if I didn't have such a high standard for movies. (It's really my only down fall.; )I just can't say enough about this movie except: See it!",9,1,2,3 May 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The Ultimate Battle Between Good and Evil
","'The Matrix Revolutions' was everything anyone could want out of a conclusion and maybe more.**CONTAINS SPOILERS**While it had its problems, (Personally, the Agent Smith clone in the real world was unneeded to a vast extent, but oh well.) it also succeeded on more levels than I could have imagined it would.  Sure, I've only seen it once, but I feel once is enough to write a favorable review for a very superior movie.  The Wachowski brothers have taken the audience from a real fake world where everything is created to control to a war in which the entire human race's fate depends.  If you think you can do this while putting in all the faith, religion, action, and personal emotion they have you can kiss my a$$ because it's almost impossible.  And because it is nearly impossible a few rough spots and problems are expected and easily over looked.'Revolutions' is more of a war movie that anything.  While it was the technical explanations, religious references, and faith based choices that made the entire series so different, the attack on Zion and the battle that occurred was the heart of the film and was an absolutely stunning sight. Swarms of sentinels moving in huge, organized pods only to be eliminated by bastions of human looking robots all taking place in the surrealistic environment known as Zion is really a breath taking sight.  While it could have obviously been longer, what was there was beautiful and well done.  The personal hero aspect of war was also done well here and fit in nicely with the pinnacle hero theme that has come to be the only linking string between all the stories going on in the Matrix universe.Just like 'Reloaded,' Neo is not really the main focus of the film; the people stuck in Zion fighting off the machines takes the forefront here. These are characters that were introduced in 'Reloaded,' but never really expanded upon and any scene with Morpheus in it is always good.  The feeling of how small the people are compared to the machines is really showcased by the way they have to destroy the drill machines and how there are like 15 sentinels for every human.  The Zion battle scene was executed flawlessly and the minor characters that were brought the fore front was a nice touch to show that everyone was fighting their own personal battle as well as the major one.Aside from the Zion battle, the rest of the movie exists to explain why the ending worked and why it ended the way it did.  The existence of another place between the real world and the Matrix is also intriguing, but sadly the Merovingian is not used as much as he should be, but they had to put a lot into this movie so this is understandable.  To fully understand the ending I will need to watch the movie more times, but I felt that the ending fit the trilogy and did not feel cheated nor rewarded.To fully understand 'Revolutions' you have to look at the name.  The word it plural, so that means there are more than just one revolution, or change, on the movie.  Obviously, the freeing of the Matrix was the biggest one, but there were many more that I cannot get into because of the room I have.The entire series boils down to this: The ultimate battle between good and evil.  While in modern day this would be if Jesus Christ manifested himself to battle Satan who also manifested himself.  In the Matrix it is Neo (Christ) who enters the Matrix one last time to battle Smith (Satan) to the death... And to the death he fights.  While the final battle was very short and not that spectacular, perhaps this was more symbolism in how the final battle between our personal good and evils is or will be relatively short. Either way, the ending was satisfying and was the most logical for the series.This is definitely a trilogy that will stand strong for years to come and gain power as it ages.  'The Matrix' is the premiere episode that started it all and set the scene. 'Reloaded' expanded the Matrix and, in time, may be seen as the better movie and 'Revolutions' ended what obviously needed an end... A perfect trilogy down to the letter.'The Matrix': 10 'The Matrix: Reloaded': 8 'The Matrix: Revolutions': 9",9,0,0,13 November 2003
The Usual Suspects," What more can be said?
","I mean really, what more can be said?  This is totally #1 on my list and should be high on yours.  I love this movie because of the cheated feeling it gives you.  The best way to watch it is to know nothing about it... just sit and watch.  Don't think, just sit and watch.  Trust me, you will love it... unless you don't like being made a fool of.",10,0,1,30 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as bad as some say...
","I got the DVD before it was released because I'm better than everyone else is. Lol, just kidding.  Anyway... Because I didn't see the first one in the theatres I didn't see the second one, don't want to ruin my streak.  I had expectations that were high when it was originally released, then after reading bad reviews, but expectations went down a little.  I have now seen the movie and I am here to say that it is probably the best action movies I have ever seen... And this didn't surprise me.The movie is NOT as good as the original, but surprise, right?  However, the action in this movie is so mind blowing Revolutions better have some kick ass story elements, or it will not be as good as this one.  This is the Matrix in the coolest form... No long boring talks about faith and stuff like that, just pure action.  The first one was needed to set up the story; the second is here to progress the story to the end, which is where Revolutions will come in... That is the only reason this movie exists, to progress the story and anyone who doesn't see this must not have see and of the Star Wars movies.The story is here in this movie that's for sure. However, it is absolutely necessary to see the movies as a trilogy, not independent films So a movie like Reloaded is DEPENDENT on the viewer seeing and liking the first one and at least seeing the last one. But unlike the first one, it is there only to break up the action, just like the action was there in the first one to break up the story.  The visual effects in this movie are phenomenal... You'll see what I'm talking about when the trucks crash.If you really liked the first movie and consider yourself a 'fan' of it, then you will appreciate this one... If not, your opinion is effected by something other than the movie... Perhaps peer-pressure or you constant need to be the special one who can never go with the group.  Either way your complete abandonment of this movie is sad and really puts you in a hole because someone who holds and opinion like that can never become a respected movie reviewer.In closing: If you liked the first one (I mean really liked it.) then you'd better like this one for what it is and not what you thought, expected, or should be.'The Matrix': 10 'The Matrix: Reloaded': 8 'The Matrix: Revolutions': [Pending]",8,0,0,13 October 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Absolutely Hilarious
","I really don't like commenting on movies after seeing them only once, unless they are terrible, but this is an exception. I saw Anchorman last night and can proudly say, that after one viewing, it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I mean, a movie with Will Ferrell with that hair and mustache standing in front of the camera and just making faces and saying random gibberish would be funny. Obviously this means Will Farrell steals just about every scene he is in, but to balance it out more a lot of time went into to making the other characters have very good one liners and some of the scenes where they are all together are some of the finest comedy scenes ever shot.Now in a comedy movie I don't look for story development, great acting, or meaningful love scenes, but I do want very good characters and good writing talent and this is what I got with this movie. To top it off the story isn't half bad (For a comedy movie, very original), the acting is very good for a comedy, and while I'm a strong believer that comedy and romance do not work, Ferrell seems to make it funny.I really don't like ruining good movies for people by telling them stuff that happens in them, so what I'll do is just do some generalization type things:<ul><li>I've never laughed more during a boner scene. - While Ferrell is the funniest anchor, Steve Carrell steals a few scenes from him. - Next to Chuck Norris in Dodgeball, which has nothing on this movie, Jack Black has the greatest cameo ever in a comedy movie. - You don't need to speak Spanish in order to get the best joke in the movie... You just need to think stereotypes are funny.</li></ul>That's it, I'm done. This is the funniest movie I've scene since Old School and I'm going to have to see it again before I say it's funniest than that movie. This is definitely Will Ferrell's best staring roll and I hope he keeps making hilarious movies... He's easily the next Adam Sandler. Perhaps someday he will make a movie that can dethrone Happy Gilmore as the funniest movie ever, but until then... Enjoy what ya got.",8,3,7,11 July 2004
The Matrix," Definition of Sci-Fi
","'The Matrix' is the definition of science fiction stories.  It takes place in a future where the main characters are up against impossible odds in a fantastic environment.  The main character is a reluctant hero that despite his inability to believe in himself still manages to pull of the impossible and save the day and the viewer really feels for him.  However, unlike normal sci-fi movies, there is also another world set in present day reality... Or is it reality?That is the question 'The Matrix' asks.  With this window of opportunity open, the sky is the limit... Literally.  The movie contains Oscar winning special effects and these amazing visuals do not subtract from the story and plot which is a masterpiece of sci-fi perfection.  Borrowing heavily from religious faith, and faith in general, the viewer is pulled into the Matrix by the story telling.  Needless to say, the movie never gets boring.Most people have obviously heard or seen the most famous scenes in the movie. (The rooftop bullet dodge or lobby scene to name a few.) But the entire movie is really one huge special effect.  So many of the scenarios or computer generated and almost none of the movie was shot on spot, but rather in a building with the actors surrounded by green screens.  This has also spawned the Bullet-Time(tm) idea that was design specifically for this movie. (And yes, it was.  Prior to this movie Bullet-Time(tm) did no exists, as it is known today.) And the DVD explains the concept really well.This is more than just a movie; it is a science fiction movie by definition. It is a near flawless piece of cinema that will be remembered for both it's entertainment value and it's originality.  Kudos to you Wachowski brother, you have done us all a favor.'The Matrix': 10 'The Matrix: Reloaded': [Pending] 'The Matrix: Revolutions': [Pending]",10,1,2,14 October 2003
Click," Half comedy, half not...
","Adam Sandler usually makes me laugh. The way he acts/over acts; he seems to act more like a real person than a character.. Most of the time. In Click he is a normal man who works too much and doesn't spend enough time with his family, someone many people can relate too. The first half of this movie is a comedy with some new jokes, some old jokes, and some good timing. The other half is this summer's science fiction thriller with twists, turns, and lessons.Being promoted with the super bowl as an Adam Sandler comedy makes the second half of this movie rather confusing. It's not that it is complicated, it is just that it is misplaced. The comedy portions are unrealistically funny in a good way, then you are expected to take the movie's premise seriously and really care about the main character. It doesn't fail completely, but the sudden switch make this a mediocre movie at best.Adam Sandler is funny and has his moments. Christopher Walken, is well, Christopher Walken.. He's the reason we watch these movies again; all he has to do is be in screen or have his voice heard and we smile. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and that is really all she is for most of the movie and you can tell they try to focus on this, but I'm a guy so I really don't mind. David Hasselhoff is actually pretty good for David Hasselhoff. He has some good lines and is fairly funny when he's on screen. Finally, I'll mention Henry Winkler who always brings a certain bizarre humor feel, which is good and is another one who makes you smile just being there. Oh, and Sean Astin is in it and he doesn't really have a big enough part to make you really laugh, but then again he will always be 'Sam' in my mind.To wrap it up, the movie isn't trash. The actors do their thing well and the jokes are mostly there, but the focus isn't. If you were to start this movie, leave part way through and come back in the last half and hour you would think you were seeing a completely different Adam Sandler movie. This would be okay if you didn't think that while actually sitting through the whole movie. Had a good start, but ultimately lost it's way.5 out of 10 stars.",5,2,8,24 June 2006
Goodfellas," Beutiful...
","This is truly on of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It shows in beautiful detail how the criminal underground works.  The story being true only helped its accuracy.  The lead performances where perfect, especially Liota's, he really made the movie what it is.  The transformation he goes through is really amazing.The perfect balance of violence, crime, and comedy make this movie what it is.  There are enough jokes to balance off the dead bodies and the drug content.  And the cinematography is mind boggling.  The story is flawless and the ending made the whole thing worth it.  It scary to think Conway will be out of prison next year (2004)... I wonder if there will be a sequel in like 50 years about what Conway did after he got out.All and all a brilliant movie that comes so close to perfection it's scary. It's a shame it didn't win best movie, it really was worthy in ever light.9/10, easily.",9,0,0,19 July 2003
