Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 delivers in every way possible.
","The makers of Iron Man 3 used Avengers as a springboard and focused solely on Tony Stark's world. In that context, they held nothing back! They delivered everything and to my surprise, a lot of it I did not expect. How many third films can you say that about? They dared to forge a new direction for a lead character that's been a pure hit in three films, including Avengers. (The scene after the house attack that had him crashing states away and interacting with that kid who doesn't really relate to him as anything but Iron Man was special!) So, kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Hall, Pearce, Kingsley and especially Shane Black! What a film! Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic 'down time' delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?Iron Man 3 delivers in every way possible above and beyond the popcorn fun you'd expect. There's no doubt that positive word of mouth will again carry another Avengers related film because this was as much fun and as well done as any Marvel film and that includes the big dog Avengers.",Null,33,69,19 April 2013
