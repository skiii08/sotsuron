Alien 3," Criminally overrated sequel, pathetic monster movie
","I'm very tired of hearing so much hype about Alien 3. The movie is criminally overrated; here's why....First, the writers failed to go a different direction with this plot. After James Cameron's brilliant first sequel where Ripley and crew had every weapon imaginable at their disposable, it is a very tiresome move that Ripley would be now be stuck to fight the Alien creature again with no weapons at all (Alien, anyone?). This is the direction this epic saga should never have taken. In order for a series to evolve, it needs to make progress and break new ground. Alien 3 failed to do so.Sigourney Weaver puts in the worst performance of the series as Ripley. Charles S. Dutton ruins this movie with his constant overacting. His speeches are terrible! In fact, I think all the actors did a below average job in their roles. The dialogue is awful and basically consists of f-words. Some credit goes to Fincher, who at least tried to give this movie decent cinematography and art direction. On the other hand his approach is often too heavy-handed and his ultra-dark atmosphere does not fit to a survival horror series.The special effects are pathetic... how this movie was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects is beyond me.In short, an abysmal script, bad actors playing one-dimensional characters, facing an all too well-known enemy, worst special effects ever and a lame alien creature that cannot hold a candle to the truly terrifying Alien Queen.",1,4,7,11 April 2001
Meet the Parents," A Modern Comedy Classic
","Few films can make laugh out loud. This film had me rolling! Ben Stiller is hilarious. His mannerisms, his wit, and his timing are impeccable as he turns in another great comedic performance.  Stiller is Greg Fokker, a man in love. Fokker wants to ask his girl to marry him, but first he must get her father's permission. The film is about his trip to meet the parents...with hilarious results!The plot isn't new or original, but its presentation is very very good and very very funny. Stiller sets a new standard for screwup boyfriends everywhere. De Niro is perfect as intimidating and overprotective father. A great supporting cast. Great direction with almost flawless comedic timing make this one a true winner. FINAL RATING: 8/10 A modern comedic classic. Movie fans of all genres can find something to enjoy. Highly recommended!Noob Aalox",8,0,0,30 May 2001
Memento," Great direction of original script and great acting make a great movie!
","When I walked out of the theater after viewing Memento I wasn't sure what to think. This movie kept me guessing at every turn and the final twist at the ending (or should I say beginning??) when everything came together was brilliant , moving, and refreshingly original. This whole movie gets major points in my book for being so original. From the opening sequence to the final credits, the viewer can't guess what is going to happen next. In fact, it is so hard to orient oneself in the movie that some people may be turned off by it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The director/writer Chris Nolan should be given a lot of credit for his great work. A must see movie that one must see several times to really understand the truth (if it can even be found). There were some plot holes I noticed like how does he remember that he has a memory problem? And what exactly are the rules/time limit for how long he can keep his short term memory? These two things were never clear to me. Perhaps after repeated viewings I will find the answer to these questions?!?FINAL VERDICT: Good original screenplay, great directing, good acting, plenty of suspense, great plot twists, and high production values make this a great all around movie. FINAL RATING: 9/10 Excellent original movie with few flaws that stands up to repeated viewings and breaks all genre boundaries.",9,0,1,11 May 2001
Blade," Blade delivers solid comic action fun!
","All this movie needed to impress me (and all I expected from it for that matter) was excellent action and intriguing special effects. This movie delivers these aspects in spades. I was very impressed. Amazing choreography of fight scenes, and the CGI effects blend nicely with the action...The story line is your basic comic book routine: super evil bad guy has plot to take over the world. Mysterious, troubled hero must stop him. Final showdown occurs, and...well, I'll let you guess what happens. Its not the story line that is impressive, it is the presentation that makes this movie worthwhile. Slick directing, cool weapons, excellent action sequences, nice special effects with a sharp attention to detail in the use of CGI. The sets are spectacular, and the acting passable. What more can you ask from an comic action thriller? Not oscar material by any stretch of imagination, but certainly a interesting way to kill 2 hours if action and special effects are your bag. My imdb rating - 6/10 Noob Aalox",6,0,1,18 June 2001
The Mummy," Comic book fun with great modern special effects.
","The Mummy is a pseudo-remake of the 1932 Karloff picture of the same name. This modern Mummy is not like any monster Mummy I've ever seen before. I commend the film makers for making a modern version of this classic monster. Arnold Vosloo plays the antagonist well, he is not the traditional mummy that hobbles about wrapped in bandages. This Mummy is strong, quick ,powerful, has plenty of tricks up the proverbial sleeve, and really is just plain downright menacing. I can't say enough good things about the actual monster and the very flashy special effects used in connection with his powers (e.g. the wall of sand with his face). I give the monster and related effects a 10/10. The plot is pretty good (despite some large continuity problems). Two groups of treasure hunters find a much sought after legendary lost city in Egypt, only to accidentally awaken the Mummy, and thus fulfill a 3000 year-old prophecy of a great curse and plague on the Earth. Now they must save the world. The whole movie has the feel of a live action comic book, which makes Brendan Fraiser's zanyness a great choice as the lead actor. He is surprisingly competent as the kick ass action hero spewing enough one-liners to make Arnold proud. The role doesn't require a lot of ability, and he fills the shoes of the zany American hero well. All the characters (except the monster) are comic book type characters (e.g. the yeeee-haaa cowboy Americans, the bumbling coward brother, the weasel bad guy Benny, etc...).
FINAL RATING: 8/10 The characters don't run that deep but they don't really need to because the story is interesting enough by itself. The great constant action, the excellent scenery, and very cool special effects make a good movie, but Vosloo as the Mummy is the real star here. Consider me impressed. Noob Aalox",8,0,0,19 May 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Kind of fun but hard for me to relate
","Another movie I was drug to by my girlfriend. I went into the picture with no expectations. What I saw was a silly little romantic comedy. Though don't get me wrong, the film was not without its charm. Other users wrote that this movie captured the singleton life at 30 dead on. It is hard for me to relate since I am a bit out of the target range being a young committed male in my 20s. However, I did enjoy several of the film's funnier moments. After it was over, I was generally pleased with the film.Its faults (like so many romantic comedies) lie in the completely predictable plot (I mean this one was super-predictable!) and the mega-cheesy and ultra-predictable ending. The merits of this film are the wonderful performances of Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant. Zellweger's bumbling Bridget provides most of the genuine laughs of the movie. The film did provide good characterization of the Bridget character; we are left caring about her at the end.I was pleased to see Hugh Grant in the role of sleazebag for a change. He plays it with comedic style. His behavior in the movie provides the rest of the genuine laughs. This is the best role I've ever seen him in as he really makes the movie funny.  FINAL RATING: 6/10 A good genre film. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt love it. Other movie fans should be able to find something enjoyable about it. A good way to pass a Sunday afternoon.",6,0,0,30 May 2001
LÃ©on: The Professional," Amazing....
","This movie holds a special place in my heart. There is just something about it that makes me love it so. Maybe the gripping story or the wonderfully complex characters or the beautifully choreographed action sequences. Its a rare combination of action & drama and death & love that gives this movie a unique soul as it deals essentially with the good and evil of the human heart. The depth of the characters created by Besson is wonderful.First, there is the foreign Leon, the lead actor played expertly by Jean Reno. A deadly assassin, a loving protector, vicious cold-blooded killer, awkward quiet man. His paradoxes make him interesting and also makes the viewer realize that he is not good nor evil but human, which is always somewhere in the gray.The troubled Matilda from a broken home is played perfectly by a very young Natalie Portman. Her character struggles with her feelings of conflicting love & hatred for her slain family. She wants to be evil, she wants to kill but is still a child dealing with confusing ideas about love and death. Her strong desire for revenge is eventually undermined by her innocence.
Gary Oldman's over-the-top performance steals the show though as the crooked cop. Truly the only evil character in the movie, he is thoroughly menacing. Several great supporting roles (Danny Aiello and others) are also put in. The powerful action sequences are smooth, exciting, and interesting. Directing is top notch. High production values are obvious throughout.FINAL RATING: 10/10 One of my favorite movies and one of only five movies I have given imdb's highest rating. Its violent and deals with taboo issues and therefore not everyone's cup of tea. However, I recommend a viewing to anyone interested in film.  Noob Aalox",10,1,2,19 May 2001
Edward Scissorhands," A Modern Day Fairy Tale...
","...is how I would describe this excellent movie hatched from the wonderfully twisted imagination of Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Edward, a lovably naive and believably tragic character built by a mad genius (Vincent Price) but left incomplete with razor sharp scissors for hands. Depp's facial expressions and mannerisms in this film are so excellent. Depp is truly one of America's greatest actors.Burton constructs a wonderfully surreal and satirical suburbia world. The bulk of the interest of this movie is Edward learning to adjust himself and his uniqueness in environment that is bland and thoroughly not unique.
Excellent performances all around. However, the ending was kind of cliched and too easy of a way out. This is the only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect score. However, this movie's main underlying morals/themes about being colorful in a colorless world strike a chord of understanding within myself. Those of us who have been different from the norm our entire lives will find a immense love for Edward and a deeper understanding of this film. Final Rating: 9/10Noob Aalox",9,0,0,12 June 2001
The Mummy Returns," Lame
","Two of the best elements of the original Mummy were great effects and a bad ass monster. I loved the Mummy in the original. He was tough, mean, quick, had plenty of cool tricks up his sleeve, and most importantly: he was damn menacing. The Mummy returns in the sequel but is considerably tamer. The action sequences involving him are considerably lamer, and the effects much poorer in both quality and originality.  The opening intro telling the tale of the Scorpion King is the only time this movie really shines in both terms of interest and CGI effects. The rest of the movie's plot and special effects seem to have been just slapped together as fast and haphazardly as possible. The plot is considerably lamer than the original (not to mention much more incoherent and with even greater continuity problems). The curator of Evie's museum along with a bunch of not too interesting henchmen are digging up the Mummy to fight the Scorpion King to gain control of the army of Annubis. Once they have control they are going to (get ready for the shocker) *gasp* try to take over the world. There is some ridiculous subplot about the Evie being the direct descendant (identical twin no less) of the murdered Pharaoh's daughter. She starts having visions that provide information to plod the ridiculous plot along. Imoteph's (the Mummy) girlfriend has been reincarnated. How/Why is never explained. The viewer is supposed to accept this on blind faith. Another ridiculous new element is suddenly Frasier has a holy stamp on his hand that makes him a chosen warrior of God....where were these elements in the first movie? Rick and Evie are now the perfect (and excessively boring) nuclear family with a young kid who I think is supposed to be Anakin Skywalker. The dialogue gets a 10 on the cheese scale. All the good guys are completely uninteresting. The bad guys aren't menacing in the least.  The effects are lackluster best, and the incoherent plot has holes big enough to drive a Buick through. The final showdown sported the worst effects of the whole movie. The Scorpion King was pretty lame and looked like something you'd see on a Playstation.  FINAL RATING: 5/10 A generally mediocre presentation of what could have been a good sequel. Somewhat entertaining but doesn't hold a candle to the original.",5,0,0,19 May 2001
There's Something About Mary," As funny as movies get...
","An excellent comedy that is full of laughs and surprises. The very believable story of your everyday Joe, who is in love with an extraordinary girl. However, he has some stiff competition if he is going to win her heart. A story most can relate with and find some personal truth within. Full of wacky interesting characters and hilarious happenings, I saw this one in the theater three times and laughed myself silly each time I saw it.
Excellent, excellent casting! Matt Dillion, Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller, Keith David, of course the great Chris Elliot, and everyone else are all perfect in their roles. Excellent direction by the Farrelly brothers and perfect comedic timing by the actors brings a great script to life. Truly a comedic gem! FINAL RATING: 9/10. About as funny as movies get. Highly recommended!

Total Recall," Arnold Saves the World in Verhoeven Sci-fi Classic!!
","Spawning from the mind of the great writers of the original 'Alien' (Ron Shusett & Dan O'Bannon), this is a movie that makes us question everything. Question your friends, question your family, question yourself, and, above all, always question reality. This premise alone makes me love this strikingly original and interesting movie. Then add the direction of the great and always controversial Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Basic Instinct) and you have a classic in the making. The movie is a wonderful mix of suspense, action, science fiction, and mystery. Wonderful special effects, beautifully crafted, awe-inspiring sets, gorgeous cinematography, solid interesting action, and great characters. Good performances all around by the cast.  
FINAL RATING: 9/10 A believable original plot, great direction, good cast, gripping script, and excellent production values make this a movie with very few weaknesses. Total Recall will probably reach the status of classic in the years to come. A movie that can reach across genres and interest all movie fans.",9,0,1,18 May 2001
Enemy at the Gates," An excellent World War II movie
","Enemy at the Gates is an excellent WW II movie in which I found few weaknesses. Jude Law really makes the movie great with his excellent portrayal (in tone, facial expressions, and other body languages) of the innocent shepherd boy thrust suddenly into manhood through brutal war, and later the uneasy hero of Russia's propaganda machine.We are told this is based on a true story. I am not a huge war buff so I don't know how accurate the events depicted are historically, but I was very impressed with the atmosphere created by director Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) through the use of crumbled concrete landscapes, wonderful music, and earthy tone colors. This movie is full of stark and powerful images. Some of the highlights include the opening war sequence: Only one rifle per 2 men and the Russian commander yelling 'When the man with the rifle dies, pick up the rifle and shoot!' Young wide-eyed youths getting herded like cattle to the front lines to die, the Russians turning their guns on the deserters...All very powerful and interesting images! 
Ed Harris does a nice job as the stoic and seemingly invincible antagonist. I was hoping we would get a more over-the-top performance from Ed (similar to other great performances 'The Abyss' & 'The Rock') but his quiet, silent, and deadly portrayal as the Nazi top sniper works just as well. I was happy to see Bob Hoskins and Ron Perlman give great supporting performances!
Joesph Fiennes also put in another good performance as the political officer running the Russian political machine. Unfortunately, the love triangle felt a bit lackluster and tacked-on. Rachel Weisz's character felt like a silly cliche. The plot could have done without the love interest aspect. The main characters and action were interesting enough without it. The happy 'love' ending really disappointed me as I felt it detracted from the strength of the film's otherwise strong messages/images about war and death.
FINAL RATING: 8/10 Despite suffering from the Hollywood mainstream 'must have love subplot' and 'must have happy-ending' syndromes that ruin many good plot ideas, this movie still is excellent with its believable and interesting plot, excellent production values, stark and powerful visuals, and generally excellent cast that give excellent performances. It was also refreshing to see a WW II movie that tackled the great war from a new aspect (i.e. sniper view). Fans of all types of movies should enjoy.",8,0,1,18 May 2001
The Waterboy," The world can always use a few good laughs
","The Waterboy is completely idiotic, but it has such a strange and wonderful charm brought by the great comedic performances all around from a great cast. Its not supposed to challenge your brain, so don't analyze it. Accept the Waterboy for what it is (a silly physical comedy with wacky comic book characters) and you'll find a moronically wonderful, very uplifting , and therefore ultimately special movie that I enjoy very much.
MY RATING: 7/10 - Great genre film. A very funny movie that fans of the physical comedy genre and Adam Sandler-type comedy will love.",7,1,1,12 May 2001
The Matrix," One of the best sci-fi movies of modern times...
","Question reality. Question everything. Its hard not to like a film that has this much attitude. Rarely does a big budget Hollywood movie send such a strong message about looking deeper into the world around oneself and thinking independently of the crowd. I saw this movie numerous times in the theater. One of the most interesting and original sci-fi premises of our modern technology driven time. Excellent plot, dazzling stunts, top notch special effects, and great characters all combine to create a wonderful film. Sometimes the dialogue is rather weak, but this movie is so full of kinetic energy, you can't get bored with it. Fans of all genres should enjoy. Final Rating: 8/10Noob Aalox",8,0,0,14 June 2001
