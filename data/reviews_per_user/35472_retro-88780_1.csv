It," How bad can a movie be made for $35million
","Well, this bad. IT is an awful movie which has 14 and 15 year old actors playing between the age 13 year old's. Their acting is worse than the 1990 mini-series. The plot, which is never fleshed out thanks to being based on America's worst living author, is a mix of disjointed fears brought to life with the most fake blood ever used in a movie. I swear the ketchup my brother and I used when trying to shock mom was more realistic. The cinematography was awful as the lenses used and lighting were sophomoric at best. The CGI used was nothing great and was merely on the level of John Carpenter's The Thing from the early eighties. The Pennywise actor did his best Tim Curry impersonation but missed it by a few very large shoes to fill. I know why Pop culture has never been my thing because if the pop crowd thinks this is a good movie, then I feel sorry for our future. Save time money and a 2 1/2Hour dreadful experience at the movies.",2,17,33,12 September 2017
