Casablanca," Thank God Ronald Reagan never got into THIS 'White House'...
","If the above seems somewhat strange, allow me to explain: Ronnie Raygun, once upon a time, was scheduled to take over the role of Rick in the beginning of this film...and the translation of Casablanca from the French means 'white house'. Now that that's been settled, I must confess that I'm at something of a loss as to what to say about this film that hasn't already been said about five times. Here goes...The Humphrey Bogart we all came to know and love first appeared in this crown jewel of Hollywood's Golden Era. Virtually everything we ever associated with a Bogart character (cynicism, romanticism, disrespect for unjust authority, doing the right thing in spite of himself) came from this film. My favorite scene of his has to be when he refuses to let the German banker into the gambling action:'Your money's good at the bar.''Do you know who I am?!''I do! You're lucky the bar's open to you!'Ingrid Bergman has never been so lovely. The charming lilt in her voice never ceases to be music to my ears every time I hear it. I'D fall for her, no doubt about it. Peter Lorre's role is small, but vital to the plot. Let's face it, nobody ever played a spineless, underhanded wimp better than Lorre. Dooley Wilson will forever stay etched in my mind for 'As Time Goes By' so long as I live. Claude Rains, the only person in the entire cast to show off more cynicism than Bogie, is an utter delight, doesn't care one way or another until that last moment at the airport. Paul Henreid, one of the most underrated actors of the '40s (check him out in 'Now, Voyager'), is superbly sublime as the principled, eloquent Resistance fighter. Contrary to some reports, he's not a sap who has no idea what's going on between Bergman and Bogie. My suspicion has always been that he knew a lot more than he ever let on. Finally we have Conrad Veidt, the very epitome of the sadistic Nazi commader. Veidt had inpeccable credentials for such a role: he'd been imprisoned by the Nazis during the 1930's. Plenty of opportunity to study the real thing up close and personal, one would agree.Lest I forget, I feel a special mention should go to director Michael Curtiz, who keeps the plot rolling along at the pace of a bullet train. Anyone who likes this one should check out his other great classics with Errol Flynn, 'Captain Blood' and 'The Adventures of Robin Hood'. A director of good taste and great skill, he should be remembered as well as anyone else for his contribution to this cinematic masterpiece.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
Unbreakable," Sheer cinematic magic...
","'I'm not a prophet or a stone age man,/Just a mortal with potential of a superman,/I'm living on/I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien,/Can't take my eyes from the great salvation/of bulls**t faith'--David Bowie 'Quicksand'When I first heard about 'Unbreakable', I got the feeling that I usually get off present-day movies that look like they might be worth investigating; I call this feeling 'a grave disturbance in the Force'. Of course, the Kubrickian approach to the marketing helped immensely. No one outside the people who have seen the film, to this date, have any idea what it's all about. Such silence I will keep as best I can throughout this review. The last thing I wish to be known as is a spoilsport.I suppose that the best place to start is with the film's director/writer/producer, M. Night Shyamalan. It is good to see that there is finally someone in the movie industry who rewards his audience for having an attention span longer than five seconds. To truly be able to appreciate 'Unbreakable', an audience member has to watch every frame of what goes down, no matter how out there it is. The most significant achievement Shyamalan makes with this movie is his perfect blend of images and words (which, considering the film's comic book subtext, is extremely appropriate). The problem with most films is their habit of focusing too much on imagery, none of it very imaginative (i.e. big explosions, ripped limbs, guns going off by the thousand). On the other hand, there are films in our current day and age that swing the other way, way too much pointless chatter to make up for the fact that the films themselves have inadequate plots, stories, or sense to go with it ('Pulp Fiction', anyone?). No such problems here; Shyamalan's dialogue is as spare and economical as that of Dashiell Hammett or James M. Cain and his imagery speaks a thousand words. One image in particular comes to mind: the immediate aftermath of the train wreck (the only plot element that has been publicly released), as David Dunn steps into the ER waiting room surrounded by all the families of his fellow passengers. In that one sequence, Dunn's relationship with his son, wife, and the world at large are summed up magnificently.The acting is definitely no problem. Bruce Willis gives the most restrained performance that I have seen in any film of his as David Dunn. He conveys the sense of a man lost in the world he lives in but not knowing where he belongs. How many people go through their life like he does, trying so hard to fit in that he denies what he truly is? As for Samuel L. Jackson (one of the few good things to come out of 'Pulp Fiction'), he gives yet another superior performance as comic art dealer, Elijah Price. As played by Jackson, he is a man consumed with a quest, one which he considers nothing less than his life mission. By the end, he lives up to the nickname of his biblical namesake: the Weeping Prophet.Now, as to the ending, maybe it's because I have an easier time believing that such things come to pass, but I had no problem with it whatsoever. Yes, it was a shocker. Yes, I did not see it coming. BUT it was the ultimate revelation that had been built up from frame one. I fail to understand why people have such a hard time with it. My only thought is that they think that it is very improbable. To this I say improbable does not mean impossible. If one is willing to accept everything fantastical that has gone before, it would seem to me as though this would have been EASIER to believe than anything else in the script.It will be very interesting to see where Mr. Shyamalan goes from here. So far, he's delivered two films that outtrumps most anything else in the cineplex. Here's hoping the next suprise up his sleeve is just as compelling as this one.",Null,1,2,5 July 2001
Memento," Perhaps this generation's 'Point Blank'...
","'Everyone complains of his memory, and no one complains of his judgement.'--Francois, Duc de La Rochefoucauld, 'Reflections; or Sentences and Moral Maxims', 1678The above is a very good quotation to keep in mind as one watches 'Memento'. Believe me, it all makes sense in the final context.My main attraction to this movie was Guy Pierce (whom I became acquainted with via 'L.A. Confidential') and the nature of the story. Having heard a little of short term memory impairment via a '20/20' show long, long ago (as I recall, I believe the particular instances cited were the result of a disease transmitted by eating mussels), I thought that it would be interesting to see how a mystery was being investigated by a man with the same problem. My reaction was the same that I got from watching 'The Limey'. It was NOTHING like I was expecting.The opening sequence sets the tone straight away, up the hill backwards, to borrow a phrase from David Bowie. Like a surreal slideshow, we flash backward and forward from the beginning and end points of Lenny's week(?) to figure out basically what the hell is going on (one of Nolan's smartest moves was to film the earliest sequences in black and white and the time just prior to the opening in color to reduce audience confusion). At first, I believed Lenny because he seemed so calm, rational, and assured in spite of his obvious handicap. SURELY he'd know what he's talking about. (bitter chuckle) More the fool me. The whole of his world is constricted to five minutes at a time. Five minutes where every incident, every insult, every indignity that is heaped on him is flensed from his mind like a stain exposed to bleach unless he considers it important enough to write down. How could one possibly trust such a man who's forgotten why he's running away from a man with a gun (indeed, forgotten that he's being chased and not chasing), that his wife was called a whore by a woman who is supposedly helping him, or that said woman spat into a tankard that he then thoughtlessly drinks from...all of it instantly forgotten at the end of his memory cutoff? Nolan deserves additional credit for not letting Lenny off the hook at the end. Yeah, we can see that he's been used by a few folks, but he's no innocent himself.In a weird way, it reminds me of 'Point Blank', another one-of-its-kind crime film with some very unorthodox storytelling methods. It had the same sort of flat characterizations (not necessarily a fault, to my mind; watch one of the many versions of 'Hamlet' if you want characters), the feeling of being unstuck in time, and a protagonist with rigid but flawed moral compass. But there are important differences. 'Point Blank' was like living someone's life the same way Kurt Vonnegut wrote 'Slaughterhouse Five'. 'Memento' is like watching a couple of cars start at opposite ends of a long street and end up hitting each other in a head-on collision. The resulting smash-up, as well as that last, casual line, will haunt me for the weeks the way 'Sunset Boulevard' did. Watch it and see if it doesn't do the same for you.",Null,1,3,13 November 2001
The Mummy," The worst remake of all time (and that's saying something)...
","My only problem with the critical loathing of the Mummy (1999) is that I am convinced that they did not dismember it enough. Therefore, I feel obligated to do such as is my duty as a movie lover. I really don't want to. But somebody's gotta, SO...here goes.One comment that has stuck with me that I heard in the audience the night I went to see this wretched piece of celluloid is someone saying 'This is like Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Which it IS--minus the good parts. One would think with a budget of $80 million that they could afford to a)hire some better actors or b) write a better script. The humor, more often than not, is limp, the characterization is non-existent, all that CGI-animated sand could not hope to begin to plug the frequent plot holes, and I'm convinced that they used Boris Karloff's actual corpse in the initial scenes of the mummy being unearthed to save some money.The film's main problem is that it cannot decide what it wants to be: action/adventure, comedy, or horror. So, by way of idiotic compromise, it tries being all three and, naturally, winds up failing miserably. The elements of the three genres mentioned above are not interchangable and I very much resent the filmmakers acting like they were. Then there's the business of the plagues of Egypt and the Book of the Dead. Excuse me, but the plagues are from Exodus, not Egyptian mythology, and, as anybody who watched the original 1932 classic upon which this is VERY loosely based, the Egyptians didn't use BOOKS. They used papyrus scrolls! And could somebody please explain to me why, if people have been looking for this city for their entire lives without finding it, it took our thoroughly brain-dead cast something like half a day to?Probably the worst crime that this film committed was the evisceration of the character of Imhotep. Karloff portrayed him as a love-lost monster, equal parts sympathetic and repellant. Here, he's not even a blip on the radar screen, character-wise. All we mostly see is this dessicated corpse who, for some non-sensical reason, is afraid of cats (must have watched 'Pet Semetary' too many times), can turn himself in a living sandstorm (which I think makes for a nice metaphor for the filmmakers; both are full of hot air), and has the most idiotic on-screen death ever captured on film. Karloff must be spinning in his grave.Remakes, more often than not, are experiments in re-animation. While the occasional few do wind up being as good or better than the original, most such remakes are failures. Why? Because the ones doing the makeover don't understand what made the film work the first time...and don't care to. That, perhaps more than anything, is why I hate this version of the Mummy. Some things are better off dead.",1,8,22,18 February 2000
Ed Wood," A first-rate film about a tenth-rate director and the insanities of film making...
","Well, what is there left to say after the justly deserved accolades laid at the feet of Tim Burton's direction (particularly his inspired decision to shoot in black and white), Johnny Depp's quirky but on-target performance (the real Ed Wood, from what I've read, truly did believe that he was making films of importance), and, of course, Martin Landau's career-best performance as Bela Lugosi (anyone who likes him here should check out his work in the old 'Outer Limits' episode, 'The Man Who Was Never Born')? Well, how about Burton's subtext about the headaches of getting a movie made?You see it practically every step of the way. Wood trying to find positives in a decidedly negative review of his play. His trying to convince a producer that only he and he alone can film the story of a transsexual. His infuriating said producer twice, first by changing the story to that of a transvetite, then by making it so badly that the producer will never have anything to do with him again. His pitch session with David O. Selznick, which he had to sell an idea off-the-cuff as it were (I imagine Burton has had to go through similar aggrevation with studio suits, whom Harlan Ellison once described as less literate than a dyslexic). His trying to keep his actors happy with their dialogue, parts, etc. so that they keep working. His never-ending struggle to find financing for his films. His duking it out with his financiers (a Baptist church, no less!) over what his vision of the movie should be. I sincerely believe that there is not a director on the planet who could not relate to at least one of these instances, if not several. The scene where Wood meets his idol, Orson Welles (another director who had to swim upstream for his entire career in film), just underscores many of the points made here.Not that anything else that's been squeezed into this picture doesn't help make it great. But that little facet of this gem of a film has never been alluded to and I thought that it would be best if it were. I wonder what the real Edward D. Wood Jr. would make of this representation of his life story?",Null,0,0,19 December 2000
L.A. Confidential," This generation's 'Chinatown'...
","'Come to Los Angelos...it's Paradise on Earth. Hahaha...that's what they tell ya anyway.' Danny Devito's opening voiceover sets the mood for the one of the moodiest and best film noirs ever released from the dream factory that is Hollywood. I first heard about 'L.A. Confidential', appropiately enough, from looking at the ad for it on the back of a tabloid. While I'd not heard of Ellroy prior to this film's release, I was shocked to find out that one of his first novels, 'Blood on the Moon', served as the basis for one of the most foul-mouthed, brutal, and, to my mind, underrated films on the market, 'Cop'. No matter; my subsequent reading of Ellroy's work proves to me that the man is at his best by using the known facts of history as a prybar for showing the rot underneath the veneer.Curtis Hanson remarked, in a documentary about the film, that as he read the book and was introduced to the three main guys (Bud White, Jack Vincenes, and Edmond Exley), he found that he didn't like them. That would seem to parallel my own reactions to them. Bud White scared the hell out of me. Jack Vincenes, for all his smooth charm, disgusted me. Ed Exley, with his wimpy exterior, reminded me a little too much of the kid I used to be. Every one of these cops are corrupt to various extents. But all that changes with the Nightowl Massacre.At roughly the halfway point of the film, when the whole business of the Nightowl killings have been 'resolved', all three of these guys come to the exact same conclusion: this isn't what it's supposed to be all about. It winds up putting them on a collision course for the real culprits behind the crime and for two of these guys, the price of defiance turns out to be astronomical.What fascinated me the most about this film was it's use of actual history, be it Mickey Cohen, Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner, the opening night of 'Worlds Collide', or the beginning of the construction of the Santa Monica Boulevard. These bits of historical grounding act as a wall that the story bounces off of like a racquet ball. Like 'Chinatown', Hanson and Helgelund (and, of course, Ellroy before them) make no bones about the fact that the official histories of 1950's L.A. are just sanitized versions of the real thing. Unlike 'Chinatown', however, the movie doesn't end on a note of hopelessness, though not in the traditional 'justice has been served' wrap-up, either.It struck me, especially considering Hanson's comments on the naturalistic lighting scheme employed by Dante Spinotti, that this piece could almost be considered anti-noir. By that, I mean, it uses the noir conventions that date back to Hollywood's 'Golden Age', but in a way that sets a somewhat different tone. It's not hopelessness, as I've pointed out, but it's not the uplifting feel-good kind of mood, either. It is its own thing. It will be interesting to see if a movie that follows that sort of pattern is made within the next few years.",Null,0,0,13 September 2000
X-Men," The next step in the evolution of the action film
","'If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping on a human face--forever.'--George OrwellI think the above quote suggests that the esteemed Mr. Orwell may very well have been able to appreciate 'X-Men'. Human bigotry, after all, is as old as human existence. Though the trappings seem to border on the preposterous, can one really say that the film's premise is as outrageous as at first glance?I'll be frank. I wasn't expecting anything from this film. Though I am a long-time comic collector, I've learned to hate all things X-Men as time rolls on. There were so many times and so many moments were the film seemed to be on the edge of going down the toilet. Heh...guess I should have had more faith. What I've seen this night is the next step in the action-film revolution begun by 'The Matrix'.Though the X-Men were created in America, the storyline, science fiction elements, characterizations, and outrageous action actually have their roots in both Japanese anime and the German Expressionist film movement of the 1910's and 1920's. These two seperate schools began to merge in the live action arena with the underacknowledged gem 'Dark City'. The neophyte movement finally began to hit overdrive with 'The Matrix' and, with 'X-Men', has finally begun to hit it's stride. I'm not sure what one could call this movement in film (Roger Ebert's term of 'visionary filmmaking' is way too vague to be considered definitive), but hopefully, it will define the action genre for the 21st century.Granted, none of this would mean a thing if the acting or writing weren't top-notch. David Hayter's script is notable for it's lack of verbosity. Taking a cue from the German Expressionist movement, most of the drama is conveyed in images (the shattered gates in Poland, the ominous floating guns during the train station stand-off, Logan holding Maria tight in the hopes of keeping her alive). The dialogue can only be described as adequate. One is not likely to find that many memorable one-liners, but it never becomes so terrible that one winces as he occasionally had to during some of the clunkier lines of 'Star Wars Episode One'. That said, there are at least a couple of good jokes in the script and Logan sticking out his center claw after setting off (and 'turning off') the metal detector is probably the best visual joke. While the plot sets things up for a potential sequel by leaving more than a few loose ends, it doesn't feel forced. Real life is a very messy proposition, after all, and not every square peg is going to fit in the round holes.There's nothing wrong in the acting department by a large margin. Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier is every bit as commanding as his Capt. Picard ever was. It's a credit to the man's presense that his impression on screen remains formidable even if he is bound in a wheelchair. Sir Ian McKellen offers a believably chilling Magneto, a man burning with old hatreds and the need to do something about them. But the central figure of this saga is undoubtably Hugh Jackman's Wolverine/Logan. He plays the role like a hunted animal, barely civilised and totally reliant on his instincts. Close to him in this center is Anna Paguin's Rogue, a frightened young girl with a power she can't control or understand. Her purpose is to reaffirm the humanity in Logan that he hasn't realized he's been missing. The others make less of an impression, mainly because they're restricted to the use of their powers and their interactions with Logan. Still, James Marsden's Cyclops makes a nice verbal sparring partner for Logan and Famke Janssen's Dr. Jean Grey sets the stage for a potential romantic triangle down the line.I never thought that I would say this, but I now do hope for a sequel to this film...only, of course, if they can follow up with the same high level of quality displayed here. I X-pect no less.",Null,0,0,1 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Burton outdoes Irving by a country mile (or maybe two)...
","At the risk of sounding somewhat heretical to the purists who decry adaptations as inferior product, I cannot claim much affection for Washington Irving. As I was talking to a friend of mine who is a literature major, we both agreed that Irving had a lot of good ideas, BUT his execution of them sucked. I've always found him too wordy, too meandering, and too coma-inducing to be considered interesting (and I've read more classics in the last five years than I did the entire time I went to high school). So, this said, it would have to be Tim Burton who would get Irving's most famous tale right.While I'm not a fanatical Burton follower, I do have a great deal of respect for his craft and films that many of his detractors lack and I think that I can safely say that this is probably the most serious film of his that I have ever seen. That may sound strange considering the fantastical elements of this story, but unlike previous Burton efforts (and I include the original Batman on this list), Sleepy Hollow feels more grounded in reality, even if more than a few historical liberties were taken. The mystery of the decaptations, which I expected would be rather quickly resolved (after all, practically everybody in America knows who did it, right?), surprisingly turned out to be central to the plot, which I felt was a good move to give the story a solid backbone. However, it is not a mystery in the traditional sense that the audience can figure out the clues with the detective. Burton does drop a few subtle hints that you're likely to miss because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO. It seemed to me as though he wanted the audience to follow Ichabod's thinking, deductions, and conclusions rather than veer off on their own, thereby adding to the shock when the real culprit is revealed. Such a style requires subtle, painstaking work and it's to Burton's credit that, in my case at least, he succeeded.For all it's decaptations, blood, and somber atmosphere, the story does take a few Burtonesque touchs of humor that you can't help but at least smile at. My favorite has to be during the flashback to the Horseman's death (played with over-the-top relish by Christopher Walken). The Horseman makes a shushing sound to the two little blonds he runs into. One of them promptly snaps a branch to get his pursuers' attention. You have to see it to believe it. Another good one is when Nesmith asks Ichabod, 'Is he dead?' Ichabod's logical but funny reply: 'That's the trouble. He was dead to begin with.' There are a lot of others but I won't reveal any more. Rest assured, though, they are there.Now as to the main cast, what can I say about Johnny Depp (positive or negative) that hasn't been said before? I will say that he is one of my favorite off-beat film actors (still love his stuff in 'Ed Wood) and his portrayal of Constable Ichabod Crane (no, you haven't wandered into the wrong movie; that's one of the changes that was added on early) is perhaps one of the most unlikely anti-heroes ever shot on film. A prim and proper shell of a man driven by reason and science, burnt by anguish over a very nasty childhood, Crane brings to mind Sherlock Holmes minus the nerves of steel (his teaming with young Nesmith would seem to verify this observation). This has to be the only movie that I've ever seen where the hero faints more often than the heroine. Speaking of said heroine, Christini Ricci admittedly does not have much to work with, but she infuses what she has with commendable skill. Perhaps one of the reasons for the minimalist screen time/performance was to increase the uncertainty about her true nature. As to what that might be...I'm not going to tell you. Though his name isn't mentioned often, I honestly feel that Casper Van Dien, considering what I have seen of his mediocre acting skills, was born to play the part of the brave but brainless Bram Bones. His best moment has to be his fight with the Horseman (a piece of macabre comedy that Buster Keaton could have admired).The only other thing I've left to add about the film is that it is best that you pay attention to every detail, major or minor, during the movie. The biggest suprise of the whole film for me was how all the little pieces scattered here and there fit together at the film's climax. It'll be most interesting to see what Burton will pull next from his magic bag of tricks.",8,0,0,23 February 2000
Taxi Driver," I didn't need a second viewing to understand this one...
","I watched 'Taxi Driver' in the wee hours of the morning one night when I was stuck on some hellish late shifts that I absolutely despised. I think that all of us know or have run across at least one Travis Bickle in our lives. The one I know was my father. Over and over again, as I watched the film, I was struck by how much this looked like what my old man would think or what my old man would do. Obsessed with guns, porn, and drinking, casually lying his @$$ off to anybody and everybody, having grand plans that ultimately come to nothing--that's Travis Bickle and that's my old man. As portrayed by De Niro (one of the greatest actors who ever lived, bar none), it is obvious that Travis' problem is not New York, New York, the human sewage he wants to flush down the drain, or even his tour in Vietnam. His problem is himself...one that he can never escape from, though he tries (watch that final shootout scene and see if you don't agree with me).The 'happy' ending is, while unrealistic, very appropriate. Bickle's reward for the good deed of his life is...nothing. Not jail time, not escape from New York, nothing he's been aiming for or even deserves, in the case of jail time. He's just gone back to his meaningless, grey existence, where he'll no doubt remain for the rest of his life. Maybe he'll snap again and go on another rampage; so what? It won't change anything about him. This is the life he's stuck with...for good.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
The Bourne Identity," A 1970's throwback...well done
","For starters, let me say that I have partially read the novel that this movie is based on (published in the 1980's) and found it a sometimes tough, boring slog. The only reason I picked it up to begin with is because I saw the TV Movie in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain. It was the beginning of my understanding that books and movies, by their very natures, are completely different animals. As for this version of 'The Bourne Identity'...well, I wasn't expecting much (though I was intrigued by certain ivory-tower critics who gave this film a second look when it hit DVD and decided that maybe it wasn't so bad). If I was moderately entertained, I'd have called it a success. But I was suprised.For all its occassional hi-tech trappings, this film reminded me, more than anything, of 1975's 'Three Days of the Condor' with Robert Redford and Max Von Sydow (anyone who liked 'The Bourne Identity' needs to see it immediately if they haven't already). It's geared to entertaining the over-18 crowd as opposed to the usual adolescent thrill-seekers most modern action films pander to. There's gunplay, but nothing so overblown as ten thousand bullets for one shoot-out (the cat-and-mouse game outside the farmhouse comes to mind). There's martial-arts (a lesser-known style called Kali), but no wire-fu for once. And, lest we forget, there's one of the best car-chase sequences in recent memory through Paris (who'd have thunk that a Yugo could make such a good getaway vehicle?).But these are general elements. Specific details that brought back 'Condor' memories are as follows:--Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Like Redford's low-level researcher, he plays a man stuck in a situation that he has no idea how he got into and even less of an idea of who's aiming the bullets at him. But it's not quite one-for-one. Redford didn't have anything to fall back on aside from his experience in the Army and Ma Bell. His ignorance is based on his rank in the CIA hiearchy. Bourne, on the other hand, speaks multiple languages, has formidible fighting skills, and is one of the brightest tacticians I've ever seen on the silver screen. But he has absolutely no clue as to how he is able to do what he does. It's all just instinct and reaction. The frustrating conundrum for him (a fact that is made very clear in the initial sequences when his skills come into play) is that, in spite of these advantages, the unknown past may have already doomed his future.--Franka Potente as Marie Kruetz. Potente's role is more of a bohemian version of Faye Dunaway's character in 'Condor' than anything else. But again, there are key differences. Redford forced Dunaway to cooperate at gunpoint, only coming over to his side with great reluctance. Kruetz is made of sterner stuff, as one would expect from a lifetime on the road. Bourne uses that other great persuader, money, to get what he needs from Kruetz and actually gives her the option of getting out while the getting is still good. Their eventual sleeping together even feels a bit less forced than the similar setup in 'Condor' (a particularly novel touch about the inevitable morning after scene is the fact that Bourne is already up, dressed, and has wiped every surface in the room). The relationship is really the heart of the movie. Without it, most of the story is just not there.--Clive Owen as the Professor. While I'm a trifle disappointed that Owen didn't get more to do with this role (unlike most folks, who discovered his obvious talent in 'Croupier', I first saw him prove his acting chops in the video clips for the old adventure game, 'Privateer 2: The Darkening'), his smoky, grey presence brings to mind Max Von Sydow's cultured assasin in 'Condor'(even the 'Professor' moniker seems to hint at such a connection). Like Bourne, he's a killing machine, as impersonal and scary as a fully loaded AK-47 to the head (the scene where he pops into pick up his info from Julia Stiles illustrates this beautifully). The only real difference between him and Bourne is the fact that he knows the answers to the questions Bourne has been asking. That he doesn't mind answering them after being bested calls to mind Von Sydow's killing of Redford's quarry and then politely suggesting an extended vacation in Europe when they both walk outside. A baddie who isn't really a baddie...what a concept, huh?Without giving too much away, I thought that the final twist on what put Bourne out in the middle of the Mediterranean to be both logical and even believable, given everything that came before. This would seem to suggest the influence of John Woo (but only in the arena of character development, something particularly stressed in 'The Killer' and the 'A Better Tomorrow' films). It's basic plot logic: set up the story in such a way that, when the final suprise twist comes through, it doesn't feel like a deus ex machina so much as a reasonable conclusion.I honestly hope that this film is the start of a trend in the action genre. Just because most action movies are the cinematic equivalent of junk food doesn't mean they have to be. What's wrong with a little fillet mignon?",Null,3,4,17 February 2003

I don't religiously follow the books the way some have, but I do think that they are some of the finest gifts that the nation of England has ever given to the world, right up there with the complete works of William Shakespeare. When I first heard about the adaptation of these books coming to pass, I was neither suspicious nor prepared to scream blasphemy. I've seen enough film adaptations to know that some things would inevitably be changed (the merit of such changes, I leave to more die-hard fanatics and anal-retentive scholars than myself). Indeed, just before 'Fellowship of The Ring' came out, Sir Ian McKellan addressed that very issue in an interview I saw in Newsweek, referring to how he always had issues with film adaptations of the work of Charles Dickens, but also said that this was intended to be a tribute to Tolkein, not a crass commercialization that too much of Hollywood indulges in. So I had hope. When I finally saw it...my hopes were surpassed by a VERY large margin (considering how high they were, no mean feat).Yes, there are changes to the story. Even my vague recollection of the tale showed several parts that had been rearranged and/or excised from the film (though I've been given to understand that some of the scrapped bits shall reappear on DVD release). When all's said and done, I can live with that. It takes nothing away from the film itself, which follows the main storyline closely enough to where only the most die-hard Tolkeinite would be displeased.Also, too many people have complained about the CGI in the cinematography, almost as if there was something ignoble about it. I simply see CGI as a tool, one that, while often misused, is capable of being an important partner to a film and not just the only reason to see a film. Inevitably, there were certain parts of Tolkein's universe that could not be duplicated any other way in the real world, ergo CGI was the only way to achieve the desired effect. About the only other director who has been able to use CGI as well as Jackson does here is George Lucas (which, I suppose, is a no-brainer).The acting company involved included many of my favorite supporting players: Sir Ian McKellan (one of the most well-deserved Oscar nominations in the history of the academy), Ian Holm, Sean Bean, John Rhys-Davies, Hugo Weaving, and last, but certainly not least, Christopher Lee (who, even at this late date, has lost none of the menace and majesty that made him Hammer Studios' version of Count Dracula). I never thought that I'd actually see them all in one movie together, but, as I know myself, Tolkein's epic story has that kind of pull on people. Why should the acting fraternity be any different?One personal benefit that the movie has given to me is helping me see the roots of Tolkein's saga more clearly. Odd that they never occurred to me while I was reading the books, but does now that I've seen it on screen. While Tolkein always bristled at the suggestion that it had anything to do with what went down in the real world (I doubt that he would have been persuaded by the late Dr. Issac Asimov's assessment on the subject), I wonder if he would have agreed with what I saw as references to classic legends and mythology:The One True Ring--This corresponds with the Ring of the Niebelung, an accursed ring in Germanic myth forged by Alberich of the dwarves (who has counterparts in both Gollum and Sauron) that caused nothing but calamity by all those who wound up possessing it.Strider's shattered sword--Suggested perhaps by the legend of Siegmund and Siegfried Volsung (whose lives played a major part in Wagner's 'Ring of The Niebelung' cycle). Siegmund's invincible sword was shattered on the god Odin's magical spear, to be reforged by his son Siegfried.Strider--He seems a throwback to King Arthur, who, it will be recalled, was raised by a far different father than his royal sire before taking his rightful place on the throne.Boromir's betrayal--This also seems to follow the Arthur model, making Boromir the Sir Lancelot figure of the fellowship. The only noticable difference between the two is that Lancelot betrayed his king for love of his queen and Boromir betrayed Frodo and the others for want of the Ring's power.Boromir's death--It wasn't until Boromir blew the horn of Gondor that I realized that it paralleled the title character's death in 'The Song of Roland'. Roland, too proud to call for reinforcements before it was too late, blew his horn just in time for his uncle and lord Charlemagne to find his dead body.If there is any one reason why I cannot help but think of this as my favorite movie of all time, it comes down to this: it's the fantasy film I've been wanting to see all my life. No other fantasy movie I have seen--not 'Dungeons and Dragons: The Movie', not 'Willow', not even, to some degree, 'Clash of The Titans'--wove the slow but sure spell that this movie did when all was said and done. Rare is the movie that runs for three hours plus and still leaves you wanting more. While I applaud the wisdom on the part of the filmmakers to break the saga up into three seperate films, I cannot deny that there is a gnawing frustration in the bottom of my soul for the next two parts. Without question, I have no fears that the next two films will wind up being a couple of the best Christmas presents I have ever received.",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
Pitch Black," Paint it 'Black'....
","As I've scanned through here, with varying takes on how good or bad 'Pitch Black' is, it never seems to have occurred to anyone that the kind of story that this movie tells is what science-fiction is SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. Despite what the tagline would have you believe, it was never truly intended to be a horror piece ala' 'Aliens' per se (though the design for these unnamed beasties are definitely ripped off from H.R. Giger's original design). Like many of the best episodes of 'The Outer Limits' (where a story of this sort would have fit perfectly, I might add), it's just old-fashioned science fiction in the fashion of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'...that is, dubious science but believable human interaction.Much of the film's power comes from Vin Diesel as ice-cold, convicted murderer Riddick. His opening voice-over sets the tone quite well. Plenty of time for things to go wrong, indeed. How they go wrong is, in much the same way the dubious scientific mechanics of the eclipse are handled, unimportant. What IS important is how the survivors react to them and each other. While Riddick is about the last person one would want to be stranded on a rock crawling with insects, he ultimately turns out to be the only one who knows how to survive...which isn't to say that he's not willing to leave the rest of them behind. It takes the guilt-ridden acting Captain of the ship to get him to follow through. He's more intrigued by her attitude than moved, I felt. It's not until she comes back to save his bacon that he begins to change (and not that much, considering how he says 'Good night' to the aliens). Add a junkie merc with a badge who becomes the party's biggest liability and the most important components of the story are in place. Practically everything else, by itself, would not have been able to sustain the movie.All right, so 'Pitch Black' is no more 'The Matrix' than it is 'evil vs. evil' (more like 'alien nature vs. human sociopath'). That still does not make it any less a small gem in the all-too barren wasteland of sci-fi.",Null,0,0,17 October 2000
Apocalypse Now," Not a film about war, but about humanity...
","'I am the way to the city of woe/I am the way to a forsaken people/I am the way to eternal sorrow./Sacred justice moved my architect/I was raised here by divine omnipotence, primordial love, and ultimate intellect./Only those elements time cannot wear/Were made before me and beyond time I stand/Abandon all hope ye who enter here.'--Dante, 'The Divine Comedy Part I: Inferno', Canto 3, Verse 1-3Nothing could have prepared me for that opening scene: fade in on a jungle backdrop. Distorted swishing sounds coming through the soundtrack, getting slightly louder as an army copter comes by. Smoke begins to rise as a tinkly bell sounds, seguing into a haunting tune. All the while, like a leitmotif in a Wagner opera, the swishing continues, getting slightly louder as yet another copter goes by. The jungle explodes with fire as Jim Morrison begins singing the first lines of the only Doors tune that I can truly say that I have ever liked: 'The End'.It wasn't until those first few moments that I understood what Harlan Ellison was talking about when he named Francis Ford Coppola as one of the greatest directors in the world (other notables on that list included Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, and Luis Buenel). I'd already heard a little about the background behind this film; Martin Sheen wrote an article about it a few years back. Having seen the finished product of 'Apocalypse Now', I have no trouble believing whatsoever that every calamity that befell the production actually happened. The kind of chaos and darkness that wound up on the screen wouldn't be near as convincing if it hadn't been a reflection of what was really happening on the set.As the POV character on this modern interpretation of Dante's Inferno (yes, I realize this is based on Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', but Dante's version of Hell served as a nice reference guide for reasons I will explain later), Martin Sheen as Capt. Willard is human enough to make the viewer sympathize with him a little and INhuman enough to make said viewer feel repulsed by the depths he winds up sinking to...which is, actually, straight down to the bottom. He's given a seemingly simple mission: kill an insane colonel who's become a law unto himself. But once things get rolling, the simplicity goes right out the window.First we meet Col. Kilgore (a great, memorable performance from Robert Duvall), who actually isn't too dissimilar to Kurtz in that he's doing what he think will wind up winning the war (when he's not busy thinking about surfing; such an attitude would qualify him for the first circle of Hell, Virtuous Pagans). Then we see things escalate, little by little: the riot at the USO show (Lust), the massacre of the tampan crew(Pride), the endless battle of keeping one lousy bridge in operation(Wrath). Along the way, we get to know more about Kurtz's background, which makes him look a little less insane and more rational than the mess he's in. The lines begin to blur.How could I not think of Cocytus, the very last level of the Inferno, when we finally get to meet Col. Walter E. Kurtz? In Dante's conception, the devil stands at it's center, mindlessly flapping it's wings and freezing souls over in the process. It's a fair description what Kurtz has managed to do to all his followers. After all, isn't man his own ultimate devil? The only one who doesn't seem to be too affected (though he's definitely touched in the head by the rest of the insanity) is Dennis Hopper's riddle-talking photojournalist. Kurtz himself (played with great and underacknowledged aplomb by Marlon Brando) is a little harder to figure out. He goes off on bizarre tangents in any conversation, will chop off the head of anyone who threatens him and then seems to regret it, talks seeming nonsense into Army radio frequencies, reads poetry aloud to anyone who'll listen (the choice of T.S. Eliot's 'The Hollow Men' is no coincidence; it actually contains a quote from 'Hearts of Darkness': 'Mister Kurtz, he dead.')but one doesn't get the feeling that he's actually insane (my theory is that those who say that he is have given up trying to figure him out). There's a lot of pain involved with what he's become, but even that doesn't sum him up. Brando's Kurtz is like quicksilver; just when you think you've got a handle on him, he slips through your fingers.Could his end really have come any other way? Eliot said it himself in 'The Hollow Men': 'This is the way the world ends/This is the way the world ends/This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang, but with a whimper.' But it coming from Brando, what a whimper: 'the horror...the horror'. The horror he's talking about is what human beings can allow themselves to become. Not just in war, but any great disaster that strikes at and breaks the foundations of any person's view of the world. That is why this movie is ultimately NOT about Vietnam; it's about what happens to Everyman when he learns dark truths that can not be rationalized and can not be denied. The Vietnam War was Kurtz's catalyst...who can say what ours could be?",10,0,0,17 August 2000
Dark City," A valentine to German Expressionism...
","The classics that everybody talks about years down the road are, most often than not, not recognized as such when first released. Citizen Kane wound up getting knocked out by William Randolph Hearst and a public too content with happy endings to accept this bitter vision. Wizard of Oz didn't become a bonafide hit until it hit television in the 1960's. Night of the Hunter (one of the scariest films of all time in my opinion) was a complete financial disaster for first-time director Charles Laughton. So it does not suprise me overly much that Dark City has gotten similarly, unjustified, downright shabby treatment from most critics and the audiences.At first, I thought Dark City 'a Metropolis for the '90s'. Then I thought that it could be seen as a cross between the aforementioned Fritz Lang masterpiece and his first sound film, M. Now, after several late-night viewings (which for the right effect, I began playing the tape just before dawn, giving my surroundings the right atmospheric touch), I have concluded that it is a valentine to the whole German Expressionist movement: Lang, Murnau, Pabst, Freund. Though I also see it as a precursor to The Matrix (another excellent film to which one could trace its roots back to Metropolis), I also think that, had this been made in the silent era, it would have fit right in.First there's the city itself. Only too obvious that it was inspired by Metropolis, where its inhabitants run on a rigid schedule of unbreakable monotony. But instead of just being factory workers in the guts of a great machine, they're pawns on a chessboard, with the Strangers removing and placing them as they please. The Strangers, again obviously, are inspired primarily by Clive Barker's Cenobites, but Mr. Hand's look is actually more inspired by that of Count Orlok in Nosferatu, right down to the collar. Compare the scene where John Murdoch holds the knife to Hand's face with a close-up of Orlok and you can see that the only thing missing is the distinctive bushy eyebrows. Dr. Paul Daniel Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), a pathetic, twisted, little gnome of a man, recalls not only some of father Donald's more off-beat roles, but also Peter Lorre's turns as complicated villain (most notably in M and Mad Love). The lisp didn't bother me so much, as I reasoned that it might have been a result of his obvious deformities. One of the film's most interesting twists is how this complex character plays a part in the endgame. Finally, there's the names of the main characters themselves. Consider: Murdoch, Schreber, Bumstead, Walinsky. All of them Germanic in origin. One could not make the connection between German Expressionism and this film more obvious.Some decades from now, I believe that this film will be recognized for the instant classic it is.

Blade Runner," Style only carries a film so far; this one has substance...
","As a fledgling writer, I'm always in pursuit of a good story that can, in turn, inspire me with my own visions. However, most movies I tend go after are usually the relatively unknowns (such as 'Hangmen Also Die!', 'Dark City', and 'The Professionals'). In doing so, I usually pass the ones everyone else has seen a hundred times already. Up until two days ago, 'Blade Runner' was part of that group. I'd seen a little bit of it back when I was a kid, chopped up on TV by some stupid telethon, but this is the first time that I've seen it all the way through (with the letterboxed director's cut, thankfully; never trust a studio to edit a film right).Once I got over my annoyance at no onscreen credit for the writers (at least for the opening credits and the tape case; like most people, I don't stick around for the end credits), I realized how much I actually enjoyed this movie. I look at this L. A. in a 2019 that I hope never comes and I see a world that is the logical updating of Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis': dehumanized, dreary, and rotting from the inside. There can be no better representation of this world than the replicants, synthetic human beings who surpass the average human in intelligience, speed, and agility, but who only have four years to enjoy them however they can. Is it truly any wonder, therefore, that the Nexus 6 models rebelled the way they did? Four years isn't very long, so what's the point of toiling under masters you can live without? No wonder the corporations want them dead.Deckard (as played by Harrison Ford) has been called many things: a 21st century Sam Spade, an anti-Han Solo, and even a replicant himself. To me, the true answer is none of the above. Deckard is Deckard, that is all. Unlike Sam Spade, he doesn't enjoy the job he has to do or really even tolerates it. It's obvious that it makes him sick to have to gun down people whose only crime is wanting to choose their own destiny. Deckard doesn't have that luxury and every downed replicant seems to kill another piece of his soul.From this, it's been suggested that Deckard is a replicant himself. Again, I don't think so. Such an assertion is too easy an answer for Deckard's revulsion for the profession he quit once already. Besides, infiltration is something that his employers have undoubtably considered and so probably make a point of screening potential candidates. Add all this to the fact that Deckard can't roll with the replicant's superpowered punchs any better than the rest of the general population and all you have left is a man who is deeply troubled by the trap his life has become.Rutger Haeur's Roy is no less complicated himself. Granted, thanks to the lack of emotional maturity that he was engineered with, he has no qualms about such things as wantonly taking life and serious injury. Yet, for all that, all he truly wants is to live a little longer than what's already been built into him. The whole point of the final cat-and-mouse chase through the Bradbury (also used for 'The Outer Limits' episode, 'Demon With A Glass Hand', and the TV movie, 'The Night Strangler') was not so much kill or be killed as it was to make Deckard understand what it feels like to be a replicant.While there is no denying Scott's impeccable style on display here (any lover of German Expressionism or film noir would appreciate it), the story development involved is not given nearly enough credit. It's almost as if the public wants to forget that someone (in this case, the legendary Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the film's basis, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and Hampton Fancher, who adapted it to screen) had to actually sit down, plot things out, and bang the story into shape. But without the efforts of Messers. Dick and Fancher, there would be no 'Blade Runner' or if there were, it would not be nearly as good. Not even a director of Scott's obvious ability can make up for such a fundamental component (don't believe me? Try watching '1492' without falling asleep or throwing up). So, in spite of the efforts of whoever decided to omit the writing credits, kindly remember the aforementioned gentlemen who did the job. Because of them, 'Blade Runner' will still be talked about another twenty years, I think.",Null,0,0,16 February 2001
The Matrix," 'Metropolis' meets 'Star Wars'...
","I have not seen 'The Matrix' since it's initial release in theaters in 1999 (I, in fact, saw it twice, a very rare occurence for me). The reason I haven't written a review for it before now is that I wanted time to think about it. The reason I haven't watched it on videocassette is because I'm still waiting on the widescreen edition.While I am sure most would recognize the second film above (is there anyone on this planet who COULDN'T?), the first may seem unfamiliar. 'Metropolis' is widely regarded as the first science-fiction film, dealing mainly in the themes of the dehumanization brought on by the rise of the eras of Industrial Revolution and Big Business. 'The Matrix' can be seen as the ultimate updating of that concept, where the fruits of those revolutions have contributed to much of what 'Metropolis' foresaw. What is the difference between being a factory worker and an office worker in our day and age? Both require two things that Stephen King in 'Danse Macabre' said are the only qualification to be a Hollywood screenwriter: a low-alpha wave pattern and the soul of a drone. Most corporations simply don't care if you live or die. If you don't play the game according to their rules, well, you can always be replaced, rather like a cog in a fine Swiss watch. This is the reality of our age because too many people DON'T want to or can't try some other way.Which leads me to the real problem in 'The Matrix'. It isn't, as so many of the short-sighted have said, the machines, it's the people. Morpheus points out that most of the people who aren't clued in to what the REAL situation is simply couldn't withstand the shock. To quote Hamlet's most famous speech, they would rather 'bear those ills they have rather than fly to others that they know not of.' That doesn't make them evil or stupid. It's simply human nature. Neo himself is not immune to this hard blow to his world, as his initial enlightenment session ends rather badly. That's why most dictatorships on this planet stay in place for longer periods than most Americans sometimes expect. People prefer the devil they do know to the devil they don't know.Mixing into this basic core is the mythic elements pinpointed by Carl Jung that, while, on the surface, may seem preposterous, actually have a logical explaination. My pet theory is that the Oracle is actually not a human being, but a computer program. The prophecy mentioned could easily be just the end result of a mathematical probability equation, not unlike the psychohistory concept put forth in Issac Asimov's 'Foundation' novels. If someone like the One could exist once, it is logical to assume that, with the right combination of genetic factors, such a being would come into existence again. When the Oracle was touching Neo's hand, it was, no doubt, scanning for those factors and found them. Still, it didn't tell him that he was the One; it told him what he needed to know to realize his full potential. After all, the prophecy she told Neo DID come true.Of course, it helps that this film combined with it's message some of the most impressive action this side of 'Terminator'. John Woo is the usual one cited in the scenes of slo-mo gunplay, but even Woo owes a debt to the late great Sam Peckinpah, who took the ballet and carnage of violence to new heights while not losing track of the story. The kung-fu sequences are probably the best done in an American film since 'Enter The Dragon'. Top them off with some of the most amazing SFX in years and you have a truly unique experience.Characterization, usually given short shrift in most action films of recent years, is central to the plot. Whether you're talking about Reeves' hesistant savior, Fishbourne's wise mentor (easily the best performance in the film), Moss' tough-as-nails Trinity, Pantoliano's weary traitor, or Weaving's chillingly malicious Agent Smith (the most scary machine character since HAL 9000), I never got the impression I was watching cardboard cutouts, but real characters with real questions and struggles. Without this last element, 'The Matrix' would have been an empty exercise for me. With it, it's a 'Metropolis' for the 90's.",Null,0,0,1 August 2000
Gladiator," Strength and honor
","When one boils down all the elements of 'Gladiator', this is the one phrase in the entire film that stands out the most to me. These are ultimately the words Maximus (played by a stunning, rawly powerful Russell Crowe) lives by and dies by. To most of us at the other end of the two millenia mark, the idea is corny, a punchline for a bad joke (indeed, I felt that this have been the point of the little satirical presentation outside the Collusium). For soldiers, men who put their lives on the line every day, it's a way of life. It's what kept Maximus going, even after everything he ever loved or fought for (the ideal of Rome, the emperor that he fought under for so many years, his family) were no more. There's no honor in going to your grave with business unfinished. To finish it, therefore, you need strength. As the Romans were always hailed as a practical people, the motto makes perfect sense to me.But 'Strength and honor' go beyond even that simple definition in the film's context. Not only does Maximus use his strength to survive another brutal day in the arena against five heavily armed and armored opponents, but he lends his strength to his comrades-in-arm in a fixed reenactment, turning a certain slaughter into a triumph. Not only does Maximus' sense of honor stop him from hailing an emperor who has none of his respect, but also makes him spare the life of a fallen opponent the entire Collusium wants him to end...until the moment he doesn't.Harlan Ellison has written that it is never the common man who changes things, but the uncommon man. If Ridley Scott's sheer visual epic is anything, it is a celebration of that man, a man who still believes in 'Strength and honor'.",9,0,0,22 May 2000
