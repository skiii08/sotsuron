Requiem for a Dream," Dirty, urgent, edge-of-your-seat brutal honesty
","Left me speechless.  I honestly think maybe I should watch this film again before I write this review... I bought the dvd tonight and watched it alone. I am shocked after seeing this film.  As the music cued the ending credits, I just sat in complete awe and tried to process my feelings on the movie, and just couldn't.  I love 'Trainspotting,' which for those of you who have seen the movie, it puts a comedic spin on the truth to drug addiction.  But this shows the raw & harsh reality of it all; Ellen Burstyn's performance is utterly tear-jerking, and you should see this film if for no other reason. I don't think the intent of this film is to induce feelings of sympathy for these characters, we as adults suffer the consequences of our actions, but I personally felt a sense of despair after seeing this, and for that I give it a 9/10, few movies can do that these days.  This is the saddest film I have ever seen, and definitely one of the most moving, along with American Beauty & Magnolia.",10,0,0,4 August 2001
Shakespeare in Love," Gwyneth Shines
","Even if you thought you had enough Shakespeare in high school, and even if you hate 'chick flicks,' if for no other reason, watch this movie to see Gwyneth Paltrow's performance.  Amazing is the only word that comes to mind. Occasionally the powers that be who grant the Oscars truely award them deservingly, and this time they were right on target.  The little twist added in the story was a nice touch, and who knows, it might even be true. But the simple fact remains that this is a wonderful movie about love, and how inspiring it can be.",9,0,0,31 July 2001
Scary Movie 2," Get over yourself & admit it's funny
","For all you people out there who are complaining about this movie - why did you go see it ? ? ?  Just so you could justify the right to complain afterwards?  This is one of those few films that basically gives away what the movie is about during the preview (NOTHING!) - and after the over-the-top antics of the first one, you all knew what this was going to be!  A sequel trying to push the envelope even more, and that's what it did. Yeah so what, it was full of cheesy gags and bodily functions, but come on, at the end of the day, that kind of thing can make you laugh.  It's tasteless, crude, and  it's hilarious!  Movies like this are never made anymore, so be glad the Wayans brothers have the guts to come along and do it, and do it well.  Don't rip this film to shreds, it is what it is - funny.",7,0,1,31 July 2001
American Beauty," A Beautiful Masterpiece
","If you don't walk away without learning something about yourself in the process after watching this film, one would have to be completely and utterly clueless.  Sure, I like a ridiculously stupid comedy just like everyone else, and those are a dime a dozen.  This, however, is one of those rare gems that I think describes how, in one way or another, we've all felt at particular times in our lives.  Very few movies can be funny (the dining room scene after Spacey quits his job is a classic) and be sad & complex at the same time.  I found myself reevaluating priorities in my own life after watching this film, and if that was the filmmaker's intent, he succeeded. Call it too deep, call it crazy, but the fact remains, this movie is about truth.",9,0,0,31 July 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Loud, Breathtaking, & Powerful
","What can I say about this movie?  Personally, I hate musicals.  No, more accurately, I loathe them.  I've never been a fan of Broadway or any sort of showtunes whatsoever.  When you've dated someone who used to sing them 24-7, maybe you willingly begin to despise them;  Call me close-minded, but I assumed this film would be along those lines, and during the opening scene, I was almost blown away.  I have never seen a movie like this in my entire life - and praise to Baz for having the cajones to make this film, he deserves an Oscar for it.  The acting was superb, and who knew Nicole and Ewan could even sing?  I could ramble on and on and use big words to describe how beautiful I thought this movie was, but that's just it in one word: beautiful.  Go see it, I recommend it to everyone.",7,0,0,31 July 2001
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy should've stayed dead
","Now I'm no critic, but this was an absolute horror of a movie; a waste of film really - Rachel Weisz, who I consider to be an up-and-coming actress, will have to answer to God after making this picture - it seems they were merely making this film in hopes of banking $ from the success of the first one - imagine that (but isn't that what most sequels these days are for?) This was one of those films where you look at your watch and realize that you just lost 2 hours of your life you will never get back ... Despite the mediocre special effects, the acting was half-baked and the story was completely fried.  I left wishing they'd all have bit the big one in the end of the film, that way there would've been no hope for another sequel - a boy can dream can't he?",Null,0,0,31 July 2001
