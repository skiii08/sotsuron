Sucker Punch," Your head will collapse... but there's nothing in...
","Movie critics will hate this cause it uses actual movie preferences to elevate itself... movie critics can't have that. We need to live in the stone age and make everything black and white.... or...Well Zach Snyder has always used the cinematic to his advantage and i for one love it. Cause he does it better than most.
And why did we want image and sound? To fully ignore it and talk about the story only? Nah... that would be silly... but.. this is not only the case here... And that is what makes this movie a bit more... it is SO easy to say that it is just sound and vision... but it has so much emotion, so much of a hurtful story that you can't ignore.I will go back to the 80es and say Open Your Mind.",10,5,8,18 December 2018
Hereditary," Gripping is the word.
","I so rarely write reviews despite seeing so many movies. And when i do it is often when i have difficulty understanding the high ratings of a movie.
This time it is different.I have watched so so many horror movies in my life, that it needs something special to impress me. But i have to say Hereditary delivers. But why does it do so?
Having seen so much already i might look for other things than i used to, i don't know.
I don't get scared anymore, i think that is beyond me by now, but i still love a well crafted movie and here is what i think this one did so well:1. The storytelling - It is, for once, really well done and thought through. There is hardly any feeling of 'why do they do that' or 'why do they act in that way in that situation'. It all fits together quite well.
It is first of all a very gripping emotional tale about how a family of individuals cope with heartbreaking events.2. The acting - On top of the above the acting is top notch. I always enjoy watching Toni Collette. I think she is a great actress. Babriel Byrne does a really great job as the father desperately trying to keep things together and i was for the most part very impressed with the young Alex Wolff. He does a very emotional performance that can't have been easy.3. The filming and pace of the movie - For me the movie is almost perfectly shot and the slow pace fits it perfectly. Every important scene takes the time that is needed to really make you see and feel everything, right to the bone. It never gets pretentious or boring, it just works.The only thing for me that was maybe a bit of... compared to the rest, is the ending. But for the most part you have no idea about what it really is about and i chose to embrace it and still gave it a 10/10.Nice to see that it is still possible to make a well crafted horror movie.",10,1,6,19 November 2018
Aladdin," You can't be serious with this rating...
","Another remake from animated to 'real' movie. Except half is still animated...
Ok, i am not a fan of anything where people burst into song every other second but this is just cringy bad at times and just ok when it is not.
I can understand kids might be slightly entertained but besides that... this brings absolutely nothing to the story except bad acting, mediocre humour and tacky song performances.",4,1,3,30 March 2020
