The New World," The film poetry about love.
","People who are not interested in the subject of love should not spend their time watching this movie. If you have felt the pain of unreturned love. If you have felt the sorrow of loss. If you found you can love two people, each in a different way. If you went through love as an illness. If you find the path to ourselves can be found in nature. If you are interested in all these topics, and you actually have a 'heart', then you will not be annoyed by the > two hours of this movie. If not, I think this movie was not shot for you. (I saw many teenagers react very unfavorably to this movie. If you expect a Disney love story forget about it. This is about deep feelings.)",9,0,1,5 June 2006
Ben-Hur," Don't overlook the gospel message in this great movie
","It wasn't until I saw this movie for perhaps the third or fourth time that it finally dawned on me what the point of it all was. The sub title of the novel gives us a clue 'A tale of the Christ'. And until I became a Christian myself, the sheer magnitude and grandiosity of the production overshadowed this most important aspect: healing and forgiveness (which only Christ can give) in a time of paganism and worldliness embodied by the Roman overlords.Judah Ben-Hur goes on a tortuous, harrowing, life draining, gut wrenching journey of Roman barbarism thirsting for revenge. Put on a Roman galley to die by his boyhood friend, only his hate keeps him alive.When they meet for the last time at the end of the chariot race, Judah, having been touched twice by the healing hand of the carpenter, Jesus (whose face you never see), can already sense no feeling of accomplishment by the victory over a dying Messalah (he should have won an Oscar for the death scene alone).The culmination of the physical healing of his once leprous mother and sister (emblematic in the flow of blood from the cross into a stream of water) is one of the most moving in cinematic history. Their faith has made them whole and Judah's new-found faith has liberated him from the hate that had kept him captive.",10,3,7,5 June 2006
