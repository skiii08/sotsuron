Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not The Star Wars We Grew Up With
","The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars movie that has ever been made. Having said that, there is still a lot to like about this movie and it is worth viewing if you have any love for science fiction movies in general or Star Wars in particular. No, this is not as good as the original trilogy. However, the movie does introduce us to characters who we already know and love from the original trilogy in their younger form. The film's characters are not as memorable as the characters in the original trilogy, nor is the story as compelling. There are some very nice special effects, and basically that's what this movie is riding on, the spectacle of the special effects. But it is worth watching, if you can just agree to have fun with the spectacle and ignore the fact that it's not up to previous efforts standards. It's certainly as good as any non-Star Wars scifi action/adventure.",7,4,8,23 August 2004
Collateral," Killer Movie
","Lots of good action in this movie, also some great conversations between Cruise's contract killer Vincent and Foxx's cab driver Max. The plot is well done, you don't know exactly what to expect. There are definitely some scenes that shock. The movie starts off kind of slow with the every day life of a cab driver, but it quickly picks up the pace after Max picks up Vincent, who poses as an insurance agent. Once Max finds out the truth about Vincent then the two become adversarial with Vincent holding almost all of the cards. But later on Max shows that Vincent doesn't hold all of them. We paid matin√©e price for this movie and thought it was well worth seeing. Will probably watch it again when it comes out on DVD.",8,0,0,23 August 2004
