Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Video Store Clerk Gone Wild
","An Amalgam of so many things that it is difficult to get a handle on what it is.  An Ode?  A new direction?  Slow?  Raw?  Egotistical phenomenon of our time?  A Total loss of the vision and focus needed to create the something they set out to create?  They do aim high, I'll give them that.Some things that I loved: Plucking / Injecting Uma / High Level Martial Arts / Time taken for minute beauty and color / magnificent swords. 
Things I had trouble with:  Black and white then Grainy Color then weird white lines then Frame size changes then hokey blurry videosque whatever. Long dialogue by the guy with the lisp.  Pai Mei did not look very old or act very wise ... Poisoned by a student?  Black Screen with breathing and dirt being thrown on a box ... not claustrophobic, not scary.  The `C' word thrown in Uma's face.  `Master Assassins' that always go in thru the front door.It is my hope that when viewed back to back with Volume one this all will somehow work.",4,2,4,20 April 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Chemicals can be bad
","Strange cuts, strange focus, sad reality.  I can only recommend this movie to those that need input on the dangers of putting chemicals into their bodies.  Alternate reality can be fun, but this just did not work for me.Things I liked:  Mom's Hallucinations  Jennifer Connelly gets crazy  Juice adsThings I had trouble with:  Ellen Burstyn lives the juice ads but never does the juice  The Limo driver takes out the crew way too easily  Jared Leto gets all sad about his momma and shoots up in the back of a taxi",7,0,1,16 June 2004
Minority Report," Gee Whiz
","I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan.  But I have seen pretty much everything he's done.  He can carry a movie (Eyes Wide Shut) or destroy it (Far and Away) when he is allowed to engage the audience.  To me this film just exacerbates the trend towards relying on effects to carry the film where plot development and acting didn't quite pull it off.  I would love to Ask Steve Spielberg: Was it Emily Dickinson who said 'A Wooden way / Regardless grown, / A Quartz contentment, like a stone-- / This is the Hour of Lead'?  She had it just about right, Steve, but I think it was 2 plus hours of lead.  And Max Von Sydow  sure he is a great Villain, but you can't help but guess the entire second half of the movie when he shows up in a position of authority. Can't we get a bit of a tease before we run smack dab into the wall of the Hollywood ending?  Samantha Morton has her moments but the plot line really lets her down in the 'mall scene.'  If she can predict the idiosyncrasies of who recognizes whom, when and how to trip the pursuers, why is there any crime @ all?  All of the sudden she can predict everything?  Finally The lighting, the palette is straight out of 'Gattaca.'  Andrew Niccol does it and he gets panned as too distracting Spielberg steals it 'tint for tone' and he is a genius?  See it and decide for yourself.  Where is the man who did 'Saving Private Ryan'?  Is he just too busy to have any passion for directing?",6,0,0,24 June 2002
Underworld," Leather
","It's funny how one or two bad performances can drag the whole thing down. Kraven (Shane Brolly) didn't even fit in with the rest of the strong performances - strong given it is a special effects soup that defies the rules of both vampire and Werewolf 'accepted lore' for no real effect.  Even if you buy the bio-engineering medical technology portion, there is no possibility in any tradition that I am familiar with that the dead can get pregnant.  Maybe I'm a purist, but that bothered me.  And the instant healing is getting a little crazy - The whole highlander x-men thing is getting out of hand.  I think the point has always been that Vampires and Werewolves can eventually recover from anything if they don't lose the will to live.  But instant healing is a little too far out there even for me. Beckinsale is easy on the eyes, but I had hoped for a little more range of emotion.  Sheen and Speedman do remarkably well with what they had to work with and Nighy is wonderfully over the top as the king of the hill should be.  My last gripe is that not enough was made of the vampiric speed.  If they are not going to be shape shifters (as some are and some aren't depending on the movie) then the speed has got to be there.  They started to touch on it with the 'super being cross breed' in the final show down with Viktor but then they just glossed it over.  Plot point deductions drag this down for a high eight in my way of thinking to a low five.  That being said I might watch it again and see if I feel the same.",3,0,0,22 September 2003
Alien: Resurrection," saving the best for the last
","I have fond memories of the first but this is by far the best of the series. Each is different enough to stand on it's own, but this is the one I can watch over and over again.  Maybe it is a guilty pleasure, but I like it.
Things I liked:  Basketball court hand to hand  -  the butterfly getting sucked through the hole  -  The general polishing his shoes  -  Nona is more human that human  -  evil evil doctors. 
Things I had difficulty with:  Ripley should have seen Winona was no human from the get go  -  A flame thrower in the medical lab?  Burning to death is not a way I'd want to go  -  The water scene did not work 4 me.",5,0,1,21 June 2004
12 Monkeys," Terry goes to Hollywood
","Not the Greatest movie ever, but one of my all time favorites.  Sci-Fi, Apocalypse, Mental illness, Blood and Death  it's all there.  My only problem with it is Our two main Characters get crazy together after the penultimate record-o-phone scene, and we don't get to see any of it.  The next thing we know they are in the cab on the way to the airport.  He could have slept all night in the theatre but what theatre runs Hitchcock all day and all night.Things I liked:  Putting the femme in the Trunk of the Jag.  Crazed Dentist and Pimp Scene.  Everything Brad Pitt.  The Board of `Scientists' from the future.  Things I had trouble with:  One Dimensional Cops and Orderlies.  Dorky animal extras.  Psychiatrist for the state has some pretty nice digs.  The 'Mad man' gets away on the plane when she is right there yelling about deadly viruses.",9,0,0,26 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," `You have to get on the train b4 you can get off'
","If you ever needed proof that special effects can make a bad movie good  here it is.  As with the first one, the CGI Spiderman makes the actor look good.  I can definitely recommend it, if you like this kind of movie to start with.Some things I liked:  Mary Jane's life  -  Super Hero's in elevators  - swooping  -  Doc Ock was great  -  J.K. Simmons has got timing to burn  - Nerds in Gotham never get a break  -  Kirsten Dunst in chains.Some things I had difficulty with:  4 arms each with a AI brain and they throw things one @ a time  -  trying to stop a train by putting his leg down -  shrugging his way out of barbed wire wrap  -  How you gonna tie somebody up with that big of a chain.",4,0,1,8 July 2004
The Others," No special effects, just creepy.
","PLOT SPOILERS: I guess I should have seen it coming, what with the sixth sense it's almost like a new trend in plot twists.  But I never even guessed that they were all dead.  And I'm usually pretty good with that kind of thing.  And the equally amazing thing is I liked the child actors.  I usually hate child actors.  Especially those of the home alone and ET variety.  Maybe it's the fear thing, but the last three underage performances I could stomach were Osment, Ricci, and now Alakina Mann. Maybe it is the hope that she could blossom into another Jodi Foster that colors my perceptions.  Maybe it was the overall creepiness that brings a warm glow to all the performances.  Maybe it's the Fred Astaire factor, he could dance with a hat rack and make the hat rack look good.  Acting opposite Kidman makes it all seem easy.  Kidman did it all for me on this one.  Loved the book of the dead.  Had some minor difficulty with the time code though - what year was this what year was that - I suppose ghosts have no way of keeping track of time - but I seem to remember her wearing a watch.",4,0,0,22 September 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," I had such hopes
","Long, Slow, Clichéd   hollywoodification of one future.  It seemed to me that everybody that had done good work else where couldn't here.  I have heard the Greeks loved their morality plays, where everybody in the audience knew what was going to happen before they even got there.  This film may be from that tradition.  The coming changes in our environment do need to be addressed.  The cost of Kyoto can not be compared to the cost of loss of habitat.  My main complaint is that there was not enough death.  Some 213 shots. Tons of NY NY, but the rest is just maps.  Obviously it's very difficult to show world wide cataclysm  but it's very easy to draw people into personal trials and tribulations.  Things I Loved: So many people doing all the wrong things.  Wall of water hitting New York.  Quaid being ignored by everybody.  People whose only reality is financial, coming to grips with just how important other things can be.  Things I had difficulty with:  Cancer boy lives.  Wonderful arctic gear includes only 12ft of rope.  Billions of people and animals die and we don't get to see it.  Days and days and days pass and it seems like minutes.  How do they get the penicillin into the love interest with no supplies or training.  The Hobo's dog.  Everybody in power (including the military) leaves the country and nobody thinks to go underground.",3,0,1,29 May 2004
"I, Robot"," No no, Sonny. No no.
","Playing around with ethics is always a tough sell.  It seemed a little heavy handed, but that could be me.  The thing that really got me *+*+*+ `spoilers ahead'+*+*+* is the big box in the sky taking control of so many [fingers if you will] and then they zap it and all the individuals are instantly just fine.  Seems to me the analogy of updating software would make each independently evil and there would be no instant fix.  Once they think they know better, there is no going back.  Short of erasure.  But that would be a different movie.  Even if the pie in the sky could take control the individuals they ultimately would be deeply effected  sort of a robo-post-traumatic-stress-syndrome.Things I liked: Becoming a slave to our possessions / creations theme  - Buff Will, really cut  -  Street scenes  -  Robot special effects.
Things I had difficulty with:  Product placement  -  When the gang of robots attacked his car he got out of it way too easy  -  The computer did not notice that sonny had not died  -  Robot power source.",6,0,0,20 July 2004
Van Helsing," 'That was pretty good, but we usually hold the old round six hundred '
","What some may consider spoilers, others call considerations  lie  ahead. I like a movie that gets me thinking about the big questions.  Such as: What separates this movie from the Mummy Movie?  Or the Muppet movie for that matter?  FX done Vs. CGI Overdone?  Is Chemistry (of the Leads in love) important?  Is it all in the hat?  Do Sand people (as Servants to the dark god) exist where ever they are dropped in as shorthand?  Is there a `New' Prevalence for endings that don't end?  
I found it very telling that they ran an ad for a Mummy movie roller-coaster-carnival ride Herr Director is Building @ Universal studios directly before the movie.  Marketing, product tie-in, merchandising and the endless trappings of big business (can somebody out there in the freeway of what we call awareness give me an example of something that has gotten better because it got bigger?  Big Government?  Big Religion?  Big Building? Big Hospital?  Big Ego?  Maybe I just need a nap.) add a painful dimension to it all.Things I liked: Flock of Seagulls Friar.  (Sure I'm Catholic  but I'm not a `Good Catholic.') Frankenstein with the zapping blue flowing through his brain.  (I dream of Jeanie with the light bluehair.) Vlad being a tad coy.  (3 Brides, Thousands of Eggs.  One can only visualize Dick and Andy dragging out the old dead horse of: `It's all for the kids.') The back wall pops up in the confessional and there is the Muslims and the Hassassins and the Slave labor building weapons of mass destruction.  (Just like everybody told us.)
Things I had difficulty with: The way the gypsies princess dies. The way the Undead Brides die. The way Vlad dies. The way the Prince of the gypsies dies. The way the Hokey_ss, born dead, green cherubim of blood die. Teeth. Transitions for the shape changers. It seemed really really long.  That's a bad sign.",3,0,0,10 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best so far, by far.
","I am getting pretty tired of the peeps going on and on about how dark this movie is.  Come on Peeps, It is not that dark.  Witch craft.  Mysticism. The undead.  Aren't these supposed to be dark subjects?  School by itself can be a very dark subject.  This was a very light movie and is suitable for all but the most dangerously sheltered individuals.Things I liked:   Dogs and trees and pictures being intelligent - Emma Watson - Emma Thompson  only one forced smile out of Danny Radcliffe in the whole movie  many things happening in the frame besides what one would @ first notice.Things I had trouble with: Hagrid rolling over on the death of the hippogriff like it was nothing  the scar on the forehead moves  The Peeps in the audience feel somehow compelled to bring infants to the theater  the rat was not very rat like, and when he disappears over the cliff he looks a heck of a lot like a mouse  no foot prints in the snow when Harry attacks Malfoy.Just see it and make up your own mind.",7,0,0,10 June 2004
Resident Evil," Two Great Women
","*Warning Plot Spoilers* A few minor plot fluffs that had to have been put in for the Hollywood look, but still a very edgy, action thriller.  After the 5th element I did not have much hope for Milla, but she impressed me.  She has learned quite a lot, and she is still very easy on the eyes.  As to the bothersome plot points  the red Queen is trying to kill the Sanitation crew in a closed tube with a LASER.  First she uses a single beam and then she goes to a net? Would an intelligent computer waste time playing around or just go for one pass and be done with it.  And when Michelle Rodriguez is dying in the train  and then comes back and says I'm not dead yet, but actually she is  come on that has been done to death.  She had done great with that role too.  I'm hoping to see a lot more of both these fine ladies.",6,1,1,25 March 2002
The Transporter," five stars minor spoilers
","You ever want to just yell @ the big screen?  Well --- I do want to on occasion.  I didn't and felt bad afterward.  'Leave the tape on!'  Not that they could get away with that.  But I certainly expected more of Luc Besson in the way of empowered victim dialog.  The quote that really stands out in my mind is: 'He was a bastard, but he was my father.'Statham was very good, but I had hoped there would be more to it than just him.  That being said Statham can carry a movie like Vinny Diesel so far has not.  Eye candy.  Lite beer.  Krispy Cream Donuts.  I like all those things, but there was so much potential --- will Taxi or Transporter be remembered in 50 years?  Maybe as a small part of a body of work.",3,0,0,29 October 2002
A Quiet Place," effects Yes
","If you can just look & not think, then this is the movie 4 U. Visually, oui! Those of us plagued by though & character arch, & where is this going, & human behavior ; Non. K? jus' non. The Monster, Ja. The Monster all day. (spoilers) thems jus' wanna little peace n tranquility. Had a bruder lot like that. Or is it Brotchen? Andy-whoo, whee can all relate to the Beast, so that's huge. For sure. (spoilers) But then we come to this little thing calt 'plot.' Is there any one any where that didn't see that coming? What is the first thing the humans think about when the touch some thing: 'How can I turn this into a weapon to subjugate the masses?' So there's the daddy with Thor's hammer cudgeling the viewing public on every white board & every newspaper. & no bodhi on the eastern seaboard came up with that? Yer killin' me. O, & doors? Hello? Winter? Sound deadening? Gawd! Alls I could think from 10 min in was Unterirdischen Haus. Dig a hole put a couple of good thick doors on it. Mary Mary Mary.On the plus side the remake / Part II will be sweet. Yer governmentals lab what grew & released this is onna large swath of peeps what disagree gonna be a site! So so stoked 4 that.

Hero," Done 2 death
","Fabu Visuals.  Lumbering pace  as befits a massive tale.  Loved the dreams and stories and sand all getting `confudded' with each other.Things I liked:  Use of color  -  Broken Sword  -  Are they living or are they dead  -  wind and leaves and petals and water fight scenes rilly raise the bar  -  Pain and loneliness of a ruler  -  ten paces scene.Things I had difficulty with:  If the big guy is that good with a sword why does he keep so many bad warriors around  -  Where exactly are these people getting their training  -  If the big guy is all that paranoid nobody with an arrow or dart weapon would have been allowed anywhere near him, personal guard or not  -  not enough is made of the purity and speed of these 4 floating individuals.",5,0,0,30 August 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," super fem
","Fun with evil corporations. Kick ass females, Mind control, tons of skin. It's all there, everything I like. And yet  I am left wanting. Maybe it's Leloo, maybe it's me, but I never got the connection with the movie that drew me in deep. Fun and action, yes. Monsters and super beings, sure. Truly evil corporations and doctors, I can buy all that. But at some point I hope to be so drawn into the experience of the movie that I forget my self in the theater and live in the world where all these things are possible. Maybe I have too high of expectations, but I don't think so.Things I liked: women and guns - impossible speed - the coming apocalypse done right - bad doggies - CGI tongues - Alice is back in the lab 4 upgrades and is way more powerful.Things I had difficulty with: The dead in their graves awaken, if the premise is a virus, how does it get to them - dad gets shot and then becomes a zombie and goes after the evil corporate guy, where was the infection - the Nemisis beast was not that scary or much of a power to fear.",3,0,1,13 September 2004
Mulholland Drive," Not just for the hardcore Lynch fan
","What is David Lynch thinking here: Exploring the consequences of Evil? Hollywood is too sick to survive?  Isn't love wonderful in all its complications?  It is almost perfect, I have to give it a 9 out of 10 as I felt the editing left something to be desired.  To me there were several elements that could have been dropped without losing any of it's convoluted majesty.  For instance: decision time  the guy with the hat, the guy behind the glass, or the thing behind the 'Winkies' but not all three.  Or the guy in the booth that talks about his dreams  what  am I missing something here?  Perhaps David Lynch, Francis Coppola and Ingmar Bergman should make all of their movies in 90minute edited versions and 5 ½ hour extravaganza versions.",9,1,1,21 November 2001
Grindhouse," Half is fun
","I liked the Rodriguez portion. It was a fun romp. If I could rate it separately I'd give it a 6. Zombies, guns, people you actually care about, plot. Quentin on the other hand had a major bump in the road. I've seen my share of trash, Russ Meyer, Uwe Boll, Ed wood, but this. This was as close to walking out of the theater as I've been in twenty years. Stay away. As for the IMDb system  as of 4-11-7 this is rated an 8.6. Hello? I gotta say IMDb should take a long look at everybody who voted and see if they have more than 3 votes over the last year to their credit. I can't in good conscious give the Quinton portion a 2. If I could vote separately this would be my first one star movie. Dull, awkward, slow, ugly, dreck. Rosario needs to get a new agent & think about where she wants to be in 5 years. First 'Clerks two' and now this? There is taking risks, and then there is stoopid. 'Monsters Ball' was taking a risk, but the potential was there to make an incredible movie. Halle tried to step up, & should be given major slack for it. This has got me wondering what Rosario has done. If it wasn't for 'Sin City' & 'The Rundown' I'd totally write her off after this. Over all I'm going to give it a 4 but that is in the hope that audiences everywhere will walk as soon as the second half starts.",4,3,8,12 April 2007
From Hell," Is he good/is he bad
","Though I could never agree with the ending, I was deeply moved by most all the characters.  Movies that let you see the complexities of good and evil, the battles within us all, the pain and beauty of so many different lives . must be cherished.  I can only think of what Tony Hopkins is doing with Verrueckter Leichter for a remote connection to this level of essence.  To take us this far into their heads was a fete.    (Then again I must admit I've always sided with the Vampires so you may not want to take my word for it.)  Having been to London, I can tell you they captured it all and more. This movie is a home run on many levels and a must see for anyone with heart, strength and empathy.",8,0,1,1 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," leave'em wanting more
","I paid money to see ''a beautiful mind' is a terrible thing '  Russell Crow.  Very disturbing.  If you like to walk out of the theater queasy and paranoid @ the same time this is the movie for you.  It is my belief that it is a statement on how this society has decided it can and will medicate its problems away.  Don't you worry Mr. Cripple society has decided for you so alls you have to do is sit BAC and enjoy the ride.  Got a problem?  Here take some of these .  I don't have anything against R. Howard personally, but I certainly would like to know who decided our 'hero' should be hetro... just so we can take the box office by storm.  I have this image of a bunch of hypocritical freaks sitting around an expensive table tossing around ideas like: 'Gee, biff, can't we take the easy way out?'  and the ever popular  'I just don't think our audience is ready for your ideas.' 	And yet there is always the itch somewhere BAC there  if this guy had been medicated from the time he was say 4 years old  would he have created? Would he have been @ all?  I gave it a six because IT made me want to dash out and read the book.",6,0,1,24 January 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," give it a go
","Well put together, well paced  -  deep without being numbing / jarring. Well worth a look.  Yet, there is something missing that separates this from movies like The Jackal, or Dr No.  It just might be the substitution of Stylistic jerky camera for raw grittiness of action.  Not that I mind the bounce, I liked The Blair Witch Bounce.  Some people say it detracts & makes them nauseous.  I say if done right it can add a lot.  In this instance something more was needed to give the feeling that something was really happening B4 our eyes.Things I liked:  The limp didn't just go away in the next scene  -  The `all growed up' Russian daughter doesn't have to say a lot, very minimal, very good  -  rolled up magazine & eventuality of death  -  True love floating away under water.Things I had difficulty with:  Not enough is made of the blood  -  rather mild Russian club scene  -  Treadstone millionaire didn't even try to run.",6,0,2,27 July 2004
