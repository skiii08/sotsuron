The Devil's Advocate," Strange Movie, Good acting
",This was a REALLY werid movie....definatly not one for the kids to see. I've seen alot of strange movies that have plots somewhat similar to this...and they were all *rap. But this movie combined good acting a good storyline to make a very suspensful film. The acting was excellent especially when Keanu Reeves 'wife' goes crazy...sometimes you find yourself wanting to say 'shut the crazy up!'. However this movie was too long...after awhile you start to wonder when they're going to get to the end. The end was...well...alittle bit strange (just like the rest of the movie) and frankly I could have thought of some better ways to end it...but nonetheless it was a fairly good ending. I would put it on my to-see list but definatly not top priority.,Null,0,0,13 September 2000
U-571," Not 'historically accurate' but still an excellent movie
","If you want to go to this movie to see a 'historically accurate' film you might want to leave, but if you want to see a movie that shows patriotism, leadership, sacrifice and then is finished off with heart pounding action then this is the movie for you. This isn't one of those 'Rambo' movies where the ship can dodge around 20 salvos of gunfire or the 'John Wayne' type where they spend half the time with the girls and the rest is a mixed bag, this is a movie which should go in a class of it's own. I was most amazed that this movie wasn't based around the latest 'special effects' that required a gazillion dollars, although the scenes were very realistic. The plot was also impressive because it didn't revolve around a 'revenge' or 'save the hostage' theme. Because this movie didn't fall into any of the above pitfalls of the most 'modern' movies then I give it a 9 out of 10.",Null,1,2,9 December 2000
Speed," Action was great, acting was not
","The action in this movie was indeed very intense. The general plot that if the bus goes below 50 mph it will blow up was not only original but gave the story lots of room for plot turns. However Sandra Bullock ruined the action scenes whenever she was anywhere near them....one second we see the most amazing action and then the next second we hear her whining and making some other cheesy comment. The last few minutes where she was 'trapped' in the speeding train were terribly acted....she did a terrible job of saying 'jump, jump while you can'...no wonder why he didn't jump. Keanu Reeves however acted very well...and his 'partner' in the movie (who is killed) did some pretty good acting (especially in his last scene...the look on his face was very well done).A few things about the movie didn't make sense: (1) How come the 'access' panels for the elevator happen to be on every floor, right in front of the door....shouldn't that be where the real door is not 'access' panels. (2) I didn't know there were access panels on the bottom of every bus (3) If Jack (Keanu Reeves) can speed up the train, why couldn't he have simply deaccelerated it?Overall a good action movie...Sandra Bullock wasn't very good at acting but Keanu Reeves was. Don't bother renting this movie though (you can watch it on TV nowdays) but if you feel the need for speed (and a good action film) rent this movie.",Null,0,0,11 September 2000
