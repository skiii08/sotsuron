The Monuments Men," not entertaining, slow pace, boring
","I like war movie very much and I just watched Fury,which is OK, the tank fighting scene is awesome.But The Monuments Men is not a war movie per se.Just watched 15 minutes I felt I am going to fall in sleep. Too much conversation, not much action or interesting things to see. Unless you work in art industry, this movie is probably boring for you.If you need entertaining movie, go to watch Pompeii 2014.If Pompeii 2014 is 10/10, Fury is 7/10, then The Monuments Men is 2/10.Having said that, but from education point of view, The Monuments Men is more meaningful than Pompeii 2014,which is just a fun movie to entertain folks.",2,2,2,3 January 2015
