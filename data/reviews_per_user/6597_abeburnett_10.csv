Deja Vu," Deja Vu is one of Tony Scott's best films
","You can quote me on that if you'd like. Seriously though, normally I don't write reviews on here. It's kind of a pain in the rear since you have to write a specific amount, etc. But the other reviews of this movie all sounded like they might be studio plants (the movie studios have been known to fabricate reviews of their movies on IMDb in order to make their movie look better), so I decided to take the time to write my own review of Deja Vu to encourage people to go see it.In my opinion, Tony Scott either makes really bad, or really good, movies. Domino looked like a steaming turd right out of the gate. Enemy of the State was pretty entertaining. Deja Vu is much more like Enemy of the State than Domino. It's razor sharp, extremely tense, and very well executed. If you like what you see in the previews of Deja Vu you're almost certain to love the movie. At least, that was my experience. I thought the previews looked pretty cool, but, with such a tricky premise, I figured there was almost NO WAY that a major Hollywood studio could do it justice. Hollywood screws up a lot more simpler movies than Deja Vu.Anyway, I digress. Deja Vu is one of those rare movies with a lot going on that actually pulls it off. Be warned, this is a thriller with the potential to seriously confuse the snot out of you, so bring your thinking cap. I loved Deja Vu and I'm betting you will too...assuming you like 1)thrillers, and 2)thinking movies. Enjoy!",10,3,6,28 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A film for anyone who hasn't slaughtered the child within
","Tremendously, poignantly sad, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece of cinema.Pan's Labyrinth is equivalent to our daily experience--in which we wake up every morning bathed in the reality that life is not all perfect, fluffy Disney movies. In fact, life often seems unbalanced in favor of the pain and anguish department. Moments of joy, happiness, love, security, satisfaction--every experience of positive emotion--are fleeting, more mirage than solid reality.Pan's Labyrinth speaks to the child wearing an adults shell. It speaks to our sense of horror at the world and life we're surrounded with. Agreeably, few of us endure the horrors, pain, fear, and despair of Ofelia's life, but by painting Ofelia's demons and nightmares as vividly as she experienced them, our daily struggles are immortalized, honored. We, vicariously through Ofelia, feel that perhaps there's a reason we endure the turmoil of life. Perhaps we too are princes and princesses, destined for greater things. Pan's Labyrinth is a movie for thinking people; a movie for those who feel like there must be more; a movie for anyone who's ever struggled onward, day to day, winning small battles but feeling they're loosing the larger war.Pan's Labyrinth is not for the faint of heart, nor for those who've slaughtered the child within on the alter of harsh reality. Pan's Labyrinth is for everyone else.",10,3,5,28 January 2007
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Loved the first one, HATED this second one
","The only reason I give this film 2 stars (and not 1) is that the acting was good. I thought all the actors did a good job of portraying angsty (melodramatic, self-engrossed, intense, my-life-really-sucks-even-though-there's-nothing-really-wrong-with-it attitude) teenage attitudes.That said, I HATED numerous aspects of this second film in the series. Bella--who reveals herself as a massive flake who won't make her own decisions and who is basically a doormat--spends the whole movie being little but a glorified doormat. She's just in the movie to sit around and preen while two guys fight over her. The thing is, as a guy myself, I couldn't understand what everyone thought was so amazing and attractive and wonderful about Bella. I simply couldn't understand everyone's infatuation with her. She's good looking, true, but she's boring, has no life or hobbies, no great personality (hardly any personality at all), nothing interesting about her, and poor character on top of it all: she's selfish, flaky, indecisive, a bad friend, a poor daughter, and a horrible girlfriend. I hope teenage girls don't take notes from Bella because they'll get the wrong message. Good guys like girls who have their own interests, who are opinionated, who can make decisions and take responsibility for their decisions, who are fun and self-empowered, who treat other people well. Bella was none of those things. I loathed her and I loathed the fact that Edward--who should have enough experience in 109 years of living to eschew such a simpering melodramatic empty husk of a girl like Bella--doted on her and indulged her. And Jacob, the really GOOD guy...I constantly wished that he'd realize that he was WAY too good for Bella and let her know that she had things to figure out and he wasn't going to just 'be around' to be her surrogate emotional boyfriend, while Edward is her physical boy toy, etc.Other than my hatred of Bella's character and how everyone pampered her and coddled her, I also thought the story was disconnected, boring, and repetitive. Indeed, when Bella first goes to hang out with Jake she alludes to how strong and 'beautiful' he is. She virtually paints him as just another Edward: the next super-human boy toy to bend to her whims. Lame. The story just hops around from scene to scene with very little to connect the dots. This film just lacked a lot of the 'magic' that made the first film special: from the awesome soundtrack, to the fact that she had a lot of 'normal life' to deal with like parents, and friends, and stuff going on. In this movie it seemed more like a TV show where the characters don't really have to work, never really go home, and we don't even know if they sleep, eat, or crap.I HATED this movie and highly recommend that people avoid seeing it. If you need your vamp fix, watch Twilight again.",2,23,42,22 November 2009
Guardians of the Galaxy," Just not that good
","There was a lot to like in this film, but ultimately it failed to connect with me... Which is a shame, because I really really really wanted to like it. It had some interesting characters, funny interactions, and sweet effects, but ultimately failed to bring everything together in a way which made the sum meaningful. After my wife and I left the theater I was almost embarrassed to ask her what she thought--because I was afraid she was going to say what I was already feeling myself... and that after I pushed her to see the movie when she was decidedly 'meh' after seeing the trailer. Neither of us really cared for it, and both of us were disappointed. We both walked away thinking, so this is why it doesn't make sense to go see movies in the theater anymore. You drop a lot of money to see big budget extravaganza's which ultimately fail to satisfy. It just felt like a movie which only played lip service to the characters, and dwelled on the action. For me, a lot of action has no meaning without a lot of character substance. And it's a bad sign if I find myself more interested in the 'bad guy' winning and destroying planets, and being generally evil, than I am in the 'good guys' saving the day. This was totally the case here. I didn't really care if the good guys won or the bad guy won. I hear they're already making a sequel. My wife and I have been burned by the first one and have little interest in more of the same. There was so much good stuff here which was squandered that it really makes me sad.",6,3,7,13 September 2014
War Machine," Another stinker from Netflix
","Man, what the heck are you doing, Netflix? I was willing to dismiss Handsome as a inevitable outlier--a lone turkey--but to follow up Handsome with this? It had so much going for it, but the script and pacing sucked. The overall premise sucked. I was super excited for this, based on the trailers, but what I saw was an enormous flop. It reeked of vanity project--and political grandstanding. As if the only point here was to beat us over the head, for two hours, with how pointless counter-insurgency tactics are. Okay, message received, but at the cost of the Netflix reputation. It seemed, other than a meandering script, that the biggest problem with this film is its perspective: that of a Rolling Stone reporter (who doesn't enter the film, officially, beyond the capacity as a narrator, until the mid-way mark). It's littered with awkward and inconsistent narration by this narrator who only serves to remind us of how dumb Glen, and his counter- insurgency tactics, were. It's patronizing, and not at all humorous. In fact, I felt mostly just bad for Glen for much of the movie. He seemed like an underdog, a guy who genuinely wants to do the 'right thing' but is just a little delusional. He's not a bad guy, just a disconnected one. This film would've been far more successful if it had been a present-tense story, where we see things, not from the doomed memoir perspective, but from the perfect plan (well, not so perfect, as we see) unraveling perspective. If it had been played more from the Dumb and Dumber angle, where you can be in on the joke, rather than from a moralizing perspective. Yes, it's about war, and how absurd it seems modern war is when nation building is being attempted, but let the viewer draw their own conclusions--don't tell us how to think and feel about things. A truly intelligent approach to this same story would be to actually execute on the premise of a comedic war movie which is comedic because it's ridiculous. Period. And do so in a tight, well executed, non-moralistic way. Yes, the audience still would've come away realizing how counter-productive all these 'anti- insurgency' efforts are, and they would've been entertained at the same time. Otherwise, you might've just made a (much cheaper) documentary. Granted, Netflix probably wouldn't have funded it to the same tune, and they probably wouldn't have rolled out the red carpet for its release. But at this rate, I no longer believe that the Netflix brand, especially in self-produced movies, is an indicator of quality. Instead the Netflix brand in movies is becoming synonymous with disappointing movies. They're great at marketing them (the trailers are, without exception, engaging and have driven me to watch Handsome, and now, War Machine), but they're doing a really poor job making an actual decent movie. I'm not even asking for a 'great' movie, I'd settle for a merely 'good' movie. This is just a travesty. It hurts watching Brad Pitt and many other great actors, meandering through this pompous, boring vanity piece. It had superb cinematography, and a good sound track, but that was about it. I guess the dialogue was pretty good, even though the overall script sucked (in terms of approach to the story, story arc, pacing, humor, etc). It's a sad day when I have to push myself to even get to the 50% mark, and then start skipping ahead five minutes at a time just so I can get a sense for how it ends. And let me tell you, the ending? Zero humor. Great moral grandstanding, but zero entertainment value. See, the thing which is brilliant about most modern American media, is how it weaves left-wing values into entertaining content. There are a great many shows whose politics I don't agree with, but which I still enjoy and find entertaining. But this War Machine effort from Netflix is just ham handed, sloppy, and a waste of time. But that's just my feeling on it. War Machine fails to either be an entertaining dramatic war movie, and it fails (with very rare) exception at comedy as well. At this point I seriously doubt I will trust Netflix's marketing of any future self-produced movies. As the saying goes, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on you. And there will not be a third time. I just feel offended and insulted and tricked. I trusted the Netflix brand, I trusted their marketing (trailers), and they let me down.",4,11,24,27 May 2017
Avatar," very good but not great
","It's a tremendous achievement of film-making, but it's not the second coming as has been widely rumored. Things I liked: incredible imagery, awesome 3D, excellent acting, a simple well-executed story, characters that we care about (even the aliens), action drama romance--the works. Things I didn't like: I hate it when I see movies which glorify 'indigenous peoples' and act as though our modern day culture has nothing to offer. I think it's too simple minded, and offensive to both sides of the coin. I'm insulted because there's a lot of good things about the culture of the developed world, and there are good things about the undeveloped world--or primitive worlds of the past. However, to paint the Na'vi as a people who're totally happy, need nothing, have everything...who seem, somehow, to have the perfect life living the primitive life they do...it's irritating. It takes greater skill as a writer and director to paint both sides in an accurate way: both sides having good and bad traits (as is realistic), both sides having good and bad individuals. Instead, here we have the Na'vi as ALL good, the scientists ALL good, and the corporate folks all bad. Retarted. Additionally, I felt like the anti-corporate slant was a little tired. It just pandered overtly to the recent anti-'fat cats on Wall Street' and sense of resentment about those unidentified rich people who started the recession. Lame. Grow up. We're such a society of self-loathing, self-hating people who resent it when others make more than we do, always wishing to be like those societies of old who mythically had the perfect life...and this movie seemed to be attempting to tap into that self-hatred. Anyway, masterful film-making with that last exception.",7,4,10,21 December 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Terrible
","I don't even know where to begin... My wife and I just watched this and were appalled. Somehow they managed to suck all the magic out of this classic. We hated pretty much everything about this movie: the new songs, the changes to the original lyrics, most of the CGI, most of the casting, the direction, the script (which tried to fix what wasn't broken)... Everything. The Gaston in this version is a lightweight compared to the terrifyingly sadistic version in the original. This one is just inconsistently written, self- absorbed, and a bit bipolar, but not really scary. The story line about her Mom was a total waste and unnecessary; the village was way too idyllic; the pacing uneven; and there were too many what the heck moments. The whole film didn't really flow at all, and was incredibly disjointed. One of the worst movies we've ever seen, and we typically like or love Disney movies. Oh and the use of auto-tune in this film totally ruined the singing and grated on our nerves. Plus the lip syncing was blatantly obvious, which is really bad for a musical. All in all, this represents a case study in how not to adapt source material.",3,4,9,1 October 2017
The Holiday," Leave the theater happier than when you entered
","I really liked The Holiday. Normally I wouldn't see it since it's rated only (right now) a 6.5/10 on IMDb, but a gal friend of mine highly recommended it. I took a chance on it, and was rewarded with a fun, satisfying evening for one. That is, I'm a single, 29 year old, straight male...who likes chick flicks--or pretty much any movie that's well made, genuine, and makes me feel better about life. Who needs dark and depressing movies to beat us over the head with what we already know: life sucks. Moving on. The Holiday struck me as really speaking to the nature of romance in the 21st century. But then, I'm a child of the era, so maybe it's just a limitation of my perspective, but I think that anymore our communication skills--as a society--have diminished to the point where romance gets more and more challenging. Rather than organically connecting with someone through light, harmless, small-talk, we interrogate them--if we're interested--and don't speak to most, at all, if we're not. We have email conversations, IM conversations, and telephone conversations, but fall on our face when confronted with actually genuinely connecting with others, face to face. This is unfortunate, and sometimes tremendously intimidating. Dates become job interviews, and people that may actually be a good match for each other dismiss each other because--in the course of the interview--they didn't see the spark of...whatever they're looking for.I felt like The Holiday somehow managed to encapsulate the nature of modern dating, and the issues that make falling in love so challenging these days. I left the theater feeling like, just maybe, I wasn't completely romantically hopeless--even at 29 or beyond. Yes, the time it takes to find that love, and the loneliness and frustration that will be experienced in that time, may be arduous...but, ultimately, it is worth it. This movie connected with me, and left my life a little better, if only for a short time. And that, is priceless in its own way. See it!",10,5,9,17 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally, a film worthy of the Star Wars name... and one I don't have to hate
","Finally Mr. Lucas by-and-large nails how to tell this most recent chapter in the Star Wars epic. He pulls out all the stops and other than an occasional hideous line of dialogue (far worse than any awkward line in The Matrix Trilogy), he creates a film that is majestic, poignant, utterly engrossing, and timeless. The single line that made this an 8.5 or 9 film out of 10 was the one said by Obi-wan, 'only Sith Lords deal in absolutes!' This line is so inaccurate that it almost makes the viewer wonder if somehow a massive typo made it into the script and then onto 'film' (of course we all know it wasn't shot on film, but was shot using digital cameras) with no one catching it. Because the line would make sense if Obi-wan said, only Sith Lords DON'T deal with absolutes... It's been so thoroughly established in the Star Wars universe that The Sith and the Darkside were those that got lost when they were led slowly astray by shades of grey until they were wholly in the darkness of the dark-side. The belief in shades of grey, of right and wrong, darkness and right are inherently a belief which is propagated by the 'Dark Side' as it so effectively undermines the Light (or, the Jedi)... it was the shades of grey that were Anakins downfall... one step after another while his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness. In short, as he so adequately established the Jedi Order was all about order, and a distinct right and wrong way to do things. What was interesting was how they depicted the difficulties that even a good Jedi struggles with at times, between right and wrong and what is most expeditious at the moment.This film was brilliant in it's emotionally brutal and poignant progression... how it is Anakins selfish love which ultimately drives his descent into darkness, and how in the end it is the dark-side, that which proposed that it was the solution to his fear of losing his beloved Padame that kills her and finalizes the utter destruction of Anakin Skywalker, leaving just the shell behind, Darth Vader. All in all, an incredible film that will join the first three films (created and released in the late 70's and early 80's) as a true classic. Hopefully at some point Mr. Lucas will remake last couple of prequels... his excuse for them is that they build up to develop his characters and story, in short those previous two recent films were wastes of time... Revenge of the Sith could've stood without them, in fact I enjoyed Revenge of the Sith best by doing my best to forget the last couple. Anyway, great film... maybe we'll be able to order custom DVD's without that horribly out-of-place line of dialogue?",9,3,6,23 June 2005
Warcraft," Awesome!
","I was so excited to see this movie--and also afraid of having my hopes dashed. There have been so many poorly made fantasy movies made in the past (I'm looking at you The Seventh Son) and I was afraid this one would be no different. But Warcraft is everything I hoped it would be: huge, epic, magical, wondrous... This isn't Lord of the Rings, in many ways it's better. LOTR was so focused on being epic that it felt overly long winded. Granted, I suppose that's due to the source material too, but Warcraft manages to cram a lot into it's under two hour run time. Yes, it has lots of magic; yes, it has lots of action; yes, it is a total escape into a world very different from our own. But somehow, even while the film is packed to the gills with the fantastic, it still manages to stay grounded in characters we care about. I was totally riveted for the entire duration of this fantastic film, and I can't wait for the sequel. I'll admit that I was nervous about seeing this film after hearing all the negative press it's receiving, so I'm happy to report that while some critics may not like this movie, I sure did and I highly recommend it!",9,8,13,9 June 2016
