Blade Runner 2049," Pretentious, self-indulgent garbage.
","I loved the original. It created the perfect mood/atmosphere, it had subtlety, originality it's plot moved at a reasonable pace. Dialog was believable.BR 2049, labors along, dialog is painful, moments are drawn-out unrealistically for 'artistic effect' - it feels manipulative.The plot has more holes than a sponge.The only good thing in it is Ana de Armas who is unbelievably beautiful, sexy and for whom I'd march a thousand miles barefoot for.",1,6,12,15 October 2017
