Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Comedy Of The Year!
","I waited for 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' of very long time. Everyone says, that this movie in 'Film Festivals' is the best in comedy genre. And they were right. This movie was awesome! All jokes was rude, but never seen before. Borat wont learns culture of U.S.&.A. ( :) ) , he shows Kazakhstan's 'culture', but I think, that it isn't there, like it was showing on the movie. In movie I was with my mom and aunt. My mom giggled in whole movie. After show, her make-up was runny. She said, that the battle with Borat & Azamat was the funniest in all movie history. I think, that Borat left a huge mark in movies.The new Sacha Baron Cohen image - Borat is muck better & funnier, than Ali-G character. Borat reminds me a some actors in my country (Lithuania). Emotions are really the same, but Borat culture learning is infectious. Nothing is good, as seeing Pamela's and Borat wedding, when Borat putting her in the wedding bad.So, after 3 hours after show, I can't wait for this movies DVD version. And watcher - watch it with subtitles, because you wont understand the Borat and Azamat language :D . 10 with some +++...",9,5,18,3 November 2006
Shaun of the Dead," The Best Comedy/Horror/Romance Mix of All Time
","'Shaun of the Dead' is one of the most funniest Horror and Comedy mix movie of all time. The joke is really funny. They don't use rude joke so it's very interesting.All actors do a great job. Thay acted very funny and entertaining. All chats was interesting with a little bit of humor. Script was good too. The plot is interesting. What more needs this movie? Maybe not everything was smart. But the end was truly funny and I laugh 4 minutes after watching...So, I give to this movie a 1 and I hope, that will goes to the best movie of all time TOP 250",8,0,4,14 October 2006
Hostel," Most uncanny movie in past 3 years!!!
","I though, that 'Hostel' will be scary movie, but my thoughts was mistake. It's very uncanny. I can't watched a cut scenes, because it was sickness. From then I though - what is my price? How much I cost? And that was creeps me out.Acting was fair. Eli Roth thinked, that hot bodies are movies engines, but he was wrong. That's not very bad, but watchable. Some emotions was missed. Script was good to this movie. After watched it, you will think about it all week. I wanted to go to this movie premiere with my aunt, but we change mind and we were right, because my aunt will be pass. DVD release just for me only was much better choice.So, I give a 8, because I can't wait for the sequel. It was creepy, but entertaining for real horror movie fan...",8,1,1,24 July 2006
Silent Hill," Original, unseen & amazing!!! This is 'Silent Hill'
","Game-to-Movie adaptation is a new wave in movie business. History of this adaptations is not very long, but we can see a true leaders of it. 'Silent Hill' is one of the most impressive video games franchise of all time. No one can scare like this game. You can't even go to sleep at night. 'Resident Evil' and 'Doom' was simple game-to-movie adaptation, but they disappointed a lot of game fans. 'Silent Hill' movie makes game fans to play all 'Silent Hill' games again. Those, who not played this game... they will be very impressed.Idea of this movie was supporting by a game. A lot of details was from the game. But I wasn't played 'Silent Hill' games, so this is discovery of the year. Real and another world was showed original. Script is very good. All conversations was like that time atmosphere. Actors acted fine. Even a Sharon/Alessa had different characters.So, 'Silent Hill' is a clear leader in game-to-movie adaptations. It's 5 timed better, that 'Doom' and 3 times better, than 'Resident Evil'...",9,0,1,19 August 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Most Beautiful Movie About Fashion I Ever Seen!!!
","Meryl Streep is one of my favorite female actors. She can act everything. She can be funny, smart, clever, ironic and etc. Miranda Priestly is shows the evil side of Merryl Streep. She acted so real, that I thought, that she is so bad in real life too.Anne Hathaway looks great in Andy Sachs character. She looks very mature in that role (if you watched 'Princess Diaries').Other actors looks great too. Emily Blunt has spice, that makes her a great actress. Simon Baker is one of the worst, but he acts better and better...Movies was fantastic. It really makes my expectation looks like awful movie. I thinks, that it is the best book to movie adaptation in this century...",10,1,5,3 December 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," The Best Horror Movie Remake Yet!
","Wes Craven (the original movie creator) created a good horror movie with psychotic people, who eat other people. I think, that this is the worst nightmare in the desert, I think... Alexandre Aja (the remake movie creator) was show he's talent in 'High Tension' horror movie, that makes you don't sleep three night in fear-ridden... Wes Craven helped Alexandre Aja to create a remake of 'The Hills Have Eyes' and this is the first time in horror movie history, when remake beats the original. It's modern, bloody and more time scarier. It will be more entertaining to those, who don't watched the original one...Idea of the movie is still good. Scrip is great. Actors acted assuredly real. Psychotic people horrible, but assuredly too. So, what can I say - the strong 8. And I pray for the sequel of this movie, because professionals can create better sequel, than the originals...",9,0,0,18 July 2006
She's the Man," The Best Comedy DVD release this year
","Wow, what a great last night was. I talking about this movie. The DVD release of this comedy was great, but movie was more, that great. It's funny, romantic and naughty. I laughed more than 2 time and that means - movie is very funny, because Justin loves Viola, Viola loves Duke, Duke loves Olivia, Olivia loves Sebastian (Viola in man pants), Daphne loves Sebastian (real). Script was written good. The love circles is very charming in this movie. Director make a good job, because was hired the best actors for their roles. I don't think that this movie could be better. It's the best choice and I home, that it will get 7.7 points in IMDb...RECOMENTED",8,1,2,9 July 2006
Saw III," The Goriest Movie In Past 20 years!!!
","I waited for 'SAW III' about 7 months and I finally watched it. It was definitely gory as the creators said. Today I almost lost my reserved place, which I was reserved two days ago. About 88% of all watcher was reserved heir places, because this movie is very very popular and all people are crazy about it.The beginning of this movie was too dark and I cant see anything. But the creepiest thing was showed very good. Everyone in hall was freak out. I was expected the chains scene first, but the bathroom was OK.When they kidnapped a doctor Lynn, then begins THE MOVIE. The rules was really smart and it was definitely entertaining. I don't knew, that Jeff had to revenge for he's angriness. Thoes three traps was not that good, that the original and first sequel, but it was much torture, that psychological nightmare...Actors acted the same wonderful, like in the original. There was more twists and it makes this movie to be ONE OF THE BEST IN HORROR. Script was the same too, because James Wan is the same good, as like in past three years. If it will be a part IV, I will go there sure (if it will be a world premiere). I give a 8 for the one of goriest movies of all time...",7,2,12,27 October 2006
Saw II," The same best sequel, just like the original one
","I don't know how many parts will have a 'Saw' movie, but I think IT will be one of the most successful horror movie sequels of all time. The scriptwriter (who acted in the first movie) had a lot of ideas, that is successful to horror thrillers. Some horror movies try to imitate that movie style, but it was bad try, because just a father knows it's child secrets...When I want to watch 'Saw II', I thought it will be just like a original part, but I was screwed. It was much better. Deaths was unhackneyed...I will pray this year, because the third part will be with two peoples again, and I home it will be not like a first part...God bless the unhackneyed movie... 8/10 (sequel still not better than a first part, but it still unhackneyed)...",8,0,1,13 June 2006
Saw," The first psychological horror movie, that makes you fear to sleep
","A lot of horror movie are copied from other movies and make unoriginal movie be a trash in show business. This movie is the first, who makes he's individual psychological horror movie genre. I first time in my life heard 'He never kill anyone' phrase, because in almost every horror movie, killer kill, but this killer never kill anyone and it makes you stay still watching it. Script was written great. Actors acted great (exept Danny Glover and child). The creator can hire better actor, than Danny Glover.What can I say more? It's worth 7.6 points, because is great and I can't wait for other parts of this movie. So, my vote is 9!!!",9,0,1,12 July 2006
The Descent," The Best European Horror Movie This Summer!
","To America, this is the best quality of horror from European. They will see, what they were looking for. Lots of blood, scary faces, bloody scenes. That's what all horror fans wanted. I like it too. The whole movie makes you feel scary. In the beginning you will not see a horror, but it's great introduction to it. I saw this movie about 4-5 months ago and I not everything remember, but it's enough to recommend to everyone... The idea and script are great. Almost all actors acted good. They introduce themselves in the meeting of friends. This was fantastic, because the end 100% shocked me.So, my rating is 10 to American, because the premiere of 'The Descent' will be in august 4 and they haven't watched it yet... RECOMMEND",9,2,6,18 July 2006
Step Up," Dance movie of the year!
","Tjis year I saw 2 dance movies: 'Take the Lead' and 'Step Up'. 'Take the lead' was boring. Plot was very outstretched. But 'Step Up' was full of action and romantic. Dance and Hip-Hop rhythm makes this movie idiosyncratic.Channing Tatum shows us he's acting in 'She's the Man' and I was exited to see that movie. In this movie Channing Tatum act not that good as in 'She's the Man', but he has some good dance moves. Jenna Dewan had horrible character in 'Tamara' movie. This movie makes her to back in good way of acting. The both are great actors and they will be better in the future...Soundtrack was stylish. Even Ciara with her 'Get Up' song had perfect return to music business.Anne Fletcher had a good debut like Director. So this movie worth a 8 rating, because it's sexy, romantic and stylish",8,0,2,17 December 2006
