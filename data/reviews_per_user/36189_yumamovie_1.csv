First Man," Disappointed
","I loved Apollo 13 which gave me a lot of respect to astronauts in apollo13.
Considering Neil Armstrong is 'the first man' to land on the moon, this movie had to be as good as or better than apollo13 :(
This movie did not introduce Neil Armstrong's great achievement for humankind we know. But it focused on his personal life which may not be accurate. Neil is dead and can not defend himself from that.",1,1,3,30 January 2019
