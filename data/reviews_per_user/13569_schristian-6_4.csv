The Incredible Hulk," Almost Incredible
","I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should 'Hulk Smash' the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.",Null,134,242,10 June 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Again
","I loved this movie...EXCEPT, the camera work. I get that the shaky hand held stuff is supposed to add to the action. But COME ON. The whole freaking movie?? You couldn't even tell what was going on in the fight and car chase scenes. It got old FAST. A really good movie becomes hard to watch. Too bad. I would rave about the movie if it weren't for the motion sickness induced by the camera work. I have two words to the producers of this movie: STEADY CAM. And one more word: Moderation. The story was good, the action was good (of what you could make out from all that shaky cam crap) The acting was good. It leaves you wanting more. (story, not shaky cam) Have I said how much I hated the camera work? It was like Blair Witch with fights and guns. If you can look beyond that it is really enjoyable. Maybe I won't feel the need to puke watching it on DVD when it comes out.",Null,15,29,1 August 2007
Wanted," Wanted Review
","I saw Wanted at a Sneak Preview. First let me say that I went expecting to hate it. Nothing I saw about this movie in trailers or commercials made me want to see it. I WAS WRONG. This movie blew my socks off. I don't go to movies just to watch stuff blow up. I need more, something deeper. Something with thought, and creativity. Wanted delivers all of that and more. Our hero Wesley is reluctantly trained to be an assassin. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything, this is not news. I was reminded of Rocky with the training scenes. Only Wesley is the side of beef. I'll not say any more. The movie has twists and turns and mind numbing action, and a little bit of heart. Keep in mind, this is based on a graphic novel, so stretching reality is okay. Angelina Jolie, while I get tired of her holding orphans and wanting to feed the world, she is incredibly beautiful. And she uses it like a weapon in Wanted. Although she could stand to stop feeding the world and eat a sammich. Don't take the kiddies to this one, I sat next to a family with little kids and the mother had to rush and cover the kids eyes when suddenly sex is thrust in their eyes. Not once but twice. Then F Bombs flying everywhere. Not to mention the gore. There's plenty of that. What I expected to be a 1 * movie turns out to be a 3 *** movie. Butter up the popcorn and buckle up, it's going to be a fun ride.",9,2,6,30 June 2008
The Dark Knight," Amazing!
","Saw it last night. One word....AWESOME. Chris Nolan deserves an award for what he has done to the Batman franchise. Gone are the cartoony colors, the cheesy villains, the bat nipples. The Dark Knight is just that, Dark. in fact, it I have only one criticism it would be that it isn't pretty enough. The photography is gritty, and dark and lit with cold lighting. But its effective. Speaking of awards, Heath Ledger deserves an Academy Award for his re-invention of The Joker. It's really tragic that he won't be around to enjoy the fruits of his labor. This movie will propel him to cult status. His Joker is demented. Twisted. Outright evil. I loved how he made a pencil disappear in his introduction scene. You'll understand when you see it. And you'll love the stories he comes up with on 'how he got those scars.' Another award should be given for the 'makeup' on Two Face. Although it isn't makeup, it's the most horrific and haunting face you will ever see. Very ghastly, yet again, very effective. The movie does an amazing job of telling of his downward spiral. It is long, at 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it does leave you wanting more. (in a good way). It's really two movies in one. At one point when you think things are winding down to a finale, it's just getting warmed up. And when it is finally over, it isn't. There WILL be a sequel. And I'm in line already to see it.",Null,4,9,16 July 2008
