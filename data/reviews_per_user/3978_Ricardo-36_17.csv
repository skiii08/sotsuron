Black Swan," It's 'Eraserhead' for stupid 16 year old girls
","This review has massive spoilers.This movie can be split in two, kinda like the white and black swan analogy. About 15% of it deals with the world of Ballet, in a crude, sort of realistic manner. This part of the film demanded acting, which the whole female cast delivered. It demanded some major dancing, which Portman delivered in a way no other actress has - she really did her homework and delivered an awesome rendition. Wynona Ryder disappears in a great supporting role as well. These 15% alone grant this movie a 6 out of 10, it's that good.The rest... Well, 5% of it are unnecessary masturbation scenes. The other 80% are a stupid mess, mixing the clichéd 'unreliable narrator who is hallucinating and things will show up as they are in the end' with uncomfortable, awkward scenes and a weird 'pseudo-horror' vibe. Like Jack Nance in Eraserhead, Nina goes from one awkward and disturbing moment to the other. All the way through the whole film. It's over the top, it's self indulgent and, aims for an ending that looks like it came from M Night Shyamalan's rejected ideas bin. It's so confusing, we are absolutely lost in the character's madness in a way that takes away the joy of the movie. We are treated to unnecessary injury shots, and the whole Kafkaesque hallucinated metamorphosis too literal (and bizarre) to be taken seriously.And how the hell did she manage to dance with a fatal wound for half of a presentation? How convenient she managed to bleed only at the end.Al in all, it's not that bad of a movie, it's watchable, but don't give it too much credit.",6,1,4,4 February 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worse Star Wars movie
","If you go watch this movie as 'The Phantom Menace', than you can say it is quite good. But if you watch it as 'Star Wars - Episode one', than you have a piece of crap. It is indeed the worse Star Wars movie, but ISOLATED it's good. 'The Phantom Menace' - 3 of 5 'Star Wars - Episode one' - 1/2 of 5",3,1,2,19 February 2000
Gravity," Gravity's charm is in it's bare simplicity, but it brings along flaws
","This is how I would explain Gravity to someone who has not seen the movie, without spoilers, but explaining exactly what they will see:First, take a regular, Michal Bay-ish screenplay about a space disaster. Got it? OK, so now, you take the first 20 pages off (usually the first act), and throw them out. Now, rip off the last 10 pages (the conclusion of act 3), and also throw them out. Now, you get a black marker pen and cross out every single reference or dialog involving:* Any character except George Clooney's or Sandra Bullock's. * Any scenes set in Houston or at other space stations. * Any references to explosions, any references to how things should sound.Now, you get what is left and rewrite it to make it 3 times simpler, but keeping any actions scenes you had.OK? Now, it's time to shoot this baby. So first, you gotta have Cuaron (the director) watch 4 movies over and over again in order to get the feel and the references:1- Pixar's WALL-E. 2- Alfred Hitchcock's Rope 3- Any space walk scene from Brian de Palma's Mission 2 Mars 4- His own Children of Men one shot car sequenceOK, now, make sure you get the best technical crew in Hollywood - because this movie needs to look GREAT.When it's time to mix the audio, all the audio channels with noise, mute them. If the audio guys complain, threat to fire them.Jokes aside...This is exactly how this movie feels. A bare basic second act of a great action film. Yeah, there are technical inconsistencies and plot holes. Yeah, George Clooney is playing himself again... But the charm of this movie is how Cuaron kept the good parts, and only the good parts, and made it work. It's half of an action script with scenes that reminded me of (the awful) Mission 2 Mars, but done in a good way. However, it's simplicity and stripped elements bring the feel that 'something is missing'. Movies have a structure that takes decades to change, and although I am all in favor to change, this is a bit too much in a single direction. As for the long shots, it feels gimmicky sometimes.All in all, a great theater experience, but not something generally amusing to see on a TV or, heaven's forbid, your cell phone. Go watch it.",7,1,3,6 November 2013
Captain Marvel," Captain Mary Sue
","As usual with Marvel movies, this is yet another chapter of self indulgent pseudo-entertainment focused at Millennial man-childs (or, should I say in this case, 'woman-childs'). A pointless story about nothing, just goobidy gook tech mumbo-jumbo and aliens flying around, running around, making jokes. This flat, pointless piece of ego-massage self insertion has Captain Mary Sue, played by who cares, facing the obvious true villain (Jude Law, who surprisingly still gets roles).Obviously any remarks about the quality of this piece are pointless, as it's audience has already decided it will swallow anything their favorite brand throws at the silver screen.Avoid it.",2,91,164,17 March 2019
Midnight in Paris," Brilliant plot idea, superb acting, incredible art design - but lacks humanity
","Midnight in Paris is a movie that really deserves all awards it could possibly get, including best picture of 2011, and yet, I feel it's a movie that does not quite deserve the Best Screenplay award (unless, of course, the competition is too weak).I don't need to go on about the movie itself, as other reviewers already done so. It is technically perfect, the casting is spot on, and the art direction has an unusually high standard, at least for Woody Allen films.However, I feel this movie could be so much more. Why doesn't Gil research a bit more about Adriana apart from randomly finding a diary? Why doesn't he seem torn apart his fiancé and his love from the past? Why does Paul simply vanishes from the movie at the point he is supposed to be flirting with Gil's fiancé (thus bringing the audience more reason to have him follow Adriana, and his decision not to be much more painful)?It feels like one draft away of a perfect movie - and it feels much of the original emotional punches and the character arcs were left in the cutting room floor. Pity. It is very good, but could have been MUCH better.",8,0,0,1 March 2012
The Matrix Revolutions," Why? What happened?
","I enjoyed the first Matrix movie. It had a few characters, the plot was not all that complicated, and it was based on a very cool concept (humans traped into a virtual reality program). It was an action movie that made you think about life and its meaning.On Matrix Reloaded, it got complicated. A lot of characters. Zion. Meetings between characters I didn't know the name. Programs and more programs (Keymaker, Merovingian). Smith got loose, somehow. Complicated and obscure plot. The Architect (what the...). BUT... it was a great action movie. For me, the amazing action scenes compensated the confusing, obscure plot.I saw Matrix Revolutions yesterday. Well, how can I say it... It sucked. The plot is even more obscure. Every questions from Reloaded kept unanswered (like Persephone's kiss). The action sequences were clichéd, and boring. Even the fight between Neo and Smith (which was supposed to be the final combat between good and evil, the most amazing fight in all 3 movies) wasn't so good at all, it felt like a bad, bad, bad DragonBall episode. All in all, it was... disappointing. Just disappointing. No genius plot twist. No amazing action sequence. The characters were flat, the dialog was terrible (sometimes I felt Keanu was reading from cue cards, and I felt like Fishburne appeared in about 10 minutes in the whole movie).Will the Wachowski brothers ever release any good (and by good, I mean profitable) movies ever? Will they ever recover from the Matrix? will they ever give an interview again? I belive not.",3,1,1,9 November 2003
Cast Away," Survivor movie
","Cast Away is, in fact, a good movie. A man all alone in an island trying to survive, there are quite few movies about that.The movie is slow, even when Hanks' character isn't on the island, and that's a real problem if there is almost no dialogue in most of the movie. But Tom Hanks did it very well, specially his 'insane' dialogue with Wilson.I think Cast Away is the perfect movie to watch on a DVD, but too slow to be seen in the big screen.6/10",6,0,1,25 January 2001
Captain America: Civil War," The idiocracy dictated by movie tickets
","This latest chapter in the never-ending 'Disney Secure IP Investment' saga has the usual cartoon characters (such as Captain Return of Investment, Iron Rehab Man and Sony-Deal-Man) quickly moving and jumping through the screen to amuse millennials who are bored with their current smart phone for 150 minutes. This 'film' adds up a new lineup of heartbreaking sell outs such as Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and William Hurt, all whose their threshold between dignity and bank account have finally been crossed, joining previous familiar sell outs such as Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson and, inexplicably, Don Cheadle.The nonsensical, incomprehensible plot follows Formula 1 pilot Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, reprising his role from 'Rush') arranging an elaborate, over-the-top revenge scheme against the cartoon characters, forcing them to fight for our enjoyment, like a 21st century Mandingo fight for children, a plan only vaguely possible due to uncontrollable and unforseable events such as the United Nations resolution. Under a man-child prism of the world's politics, the script takes the cartoon characters to move between exposition scenes and action storyboards, all in the very awkward dichotomy of juvenile writing and over-expensive 'film making'.Any little enjoyment that can come from this movie requires accepting the dooming idiocracy that controls our world, economy, politics and fate; embrace your inner idiot and laugh at a giant cartoon character holding a small, tin-man character.How many insightful, meaningful and intelligent films we could have produced, under the realms of real talents, with this 'film's' budget? How many excellent pieces of cinema, inspiring and motivating, touching and thought-provoking, could have been made if the masses preferred content over shiny objects? Ten? Twenty? Fifty? We may never know; we may only cry for the lost art that will never be.Watch it in the unnecessary headache-inducing half-assed-converted 3D.",3,95,194,3 May 2016
Toy Story 4," Sequel-hungry Disney once again forces Pixar to produce mediocrity
","Unnecessary. Forced. Repetitive. Redundant. Mediocre. All words I could easily use to describe Toy Story 4, without fear of being unfair. While not as bad as other previous Pixar misfires, this sequel sadly does a disservice to a perfectly crafted trilogy that had its sunset... but now is reborn out of necessity and not quite as well-shaped as its predecessors.I had to see Toy Story 4 because I believed the producers would not allow their prized movie series to be tainted by Disney's requests for cash-grab sequels. Surely they had something in mind that could surpass the third installment. What could it be? I had to see it. Sadly, it was nothing worth it.The movie repeats the previous movie's general plot (lost toy tries to go back to it's kid), but not as cleverly. It's tiring and repetitive, with the same rescue scenes again and again, making the whole thing seem tiresome and badly paced. There was nothing new that was brought by this film that wasn't already covered or portrait in previous films, but they just had to do it. It sticks out as a bad outlier, as an anticlimactic finale.While not necessarily bad, it pales in comparison, suffers from pace issues, has a terribly unmemorable antagonist and taints the third film's ending and purpose.Like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I say, stick with the trilogy and forget about this one.",6,8,15,30 June 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Warning: This is not Jackie Chan nor Jet Li!
","When I went to see 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' I was expecting some sort of Jackie Chan kind of movie. How wrong was I. This is a good movie, but here's a warning to those kung fu movies fan: this is NOT a Jackie Chan or Jet Li kind of movie!The movie is very beautiful, and very well directed. The fighting scenes are great, but not the best ever filmed. The problem is that sometimes this movie gets slow, and some other times it gets VERY slow. But hey, this is an art movie, not some mindless action movie like kung fu fans are used to see.I do recommend 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' for those who like a good martial arts sequence and like a good old slow paced drama. I think it is a good movie, but overrated...",6,0,0,18 February 2001
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Basically porn for stupid teenage girls
","I was pretty oblivious to the whole twilight fad when the first movie came out - and so was my girlfriend - so I escaped that one. I was made aware of those books about six months later, and did the math: this was a gimmicky book-film-serial that ALL girls had to see, for some reason, made with one reason in mind only: to make money.Folks, there's no art here. This is not a movie, and I mean an acted, well produced 3 act movie. This horrible mess of an audio-visual experiment is not a movie. The closest thing this can reach is porn. This is porn, down to the softcore kind of way.What do these characters want besides a life-less, utopic and vague 'romance'? Why is this character 'Bella' so absolutely interesting to all the other characters, but obviously not to the male audience? It is written (and BADLY written) and acted (BADLY acted) to be a teenage girl sensual fantasy, a world where they are the center of the universe, where everything is magical, romantic, and that all mysterious, beautiful men worship you. If something might make a stupid illiterate teenage girl masturbate, this is it. And yes, there are adult woman who enjoy this, and it is PATHETIC they do.I will refuse to see any other installments of this money-grabbing piece of crap, and so should you.",1,9,14,28 November 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal Sunhine of the... uh... what was it called again
","**** WARNING - SPOILERS ****** Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind IS the best movie in 2004. What could you expect when you have a movie written by Charlie Kaufman? OK I admit at first I wasn't so sure about it, being a movie written by C. Kaufman and not being directed by Spike Jonze, by now I'm glad he didn't, it wouldn't be the same I suppose...I won't go into details about the movie, I don't have to. I just have something to say for those who didn't like the movie: you're simply not intelligent people. Simple as that. I hate romantic comedies, I hate Kate and dislike Carrey, I avoid watching anything related to Elijah Wood, so this movie had everything to make me want to hate it. But I didn't, I loved it and it's my 4th favorite movie of all time now. And you know why? Because I like movies that make me think. I enjoy movies made for smart people, by people smarter than me. OK perhaps you guys prefer a more linear, straight forwarded, non-surprising 'american gladiators' kind of plot. Well good for you, as 95% of films is made for people like you. But if you didn't like this movie, please... try to think a little harder.PS: I really think the ending should feature our main characters in the car, talking (before she puts on the tape), and things start to disappear from the car and their faces disappear, and you know they eventually got together and did it again.",10,6,12,14 December 2004
Groundhog Day," Again, and again, and again...
","This movie is one of the best comedies ever! In my opinion this is Bill Murray's best acting in a movie, it's not easy to make the audience belive you're living the same day over and over again! A great movie directed by Harold Ramis, do not miss it, see it now.",9,0,0,2 May 2001
Inception," An excellent and effective movie, but not absolutely perfect
","Inception is a movie based on an Excellent idea that, if put on the wrong hands - that is, anyone but Nolan and maybe Pixar - would be ruined. This is not the case here: a brilliant, well constructed thriller that, although being quite simple, is of a VERY complex nature. Nolan could have spent more time explaining the structure of this universe, but he leaves the story to explain it - only using a couple of scenes between DiCaprio and Ellen Page to explain what could not be explained outside the movie's plot. Truly a movie that will be kept in your mind for a long time, and praised as one of the best ever conceived - a mix between the intelligence of Memento, the tension of men-on-the-job thrillers like Ronin or Munich, and the dreamlike environment of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.This movie, however, it's not without flaws. Ellen Page, as ever, 'sinks' the movie with her sub par acting and her 'teenage' acting stance, in a role that should require something better or more mature. (Di Caprio is competent enough, Cotillard plays it safe, Cillian Murphy was brilliantly cast, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt FINALLY delivers something good enough to take him serious as an adult and serious actor).Also, some of the mechanics and rules of the whole dream world gets lost with the fast pace of the movie. Filming dreams is always a problem due to the nature of dreams, they are too abstract for movies - and unless you pull a Felinni and do one hell of a misce en scene, you are bound to fail, as people won't buy it. I couldn't quite buy the whole thing, but Nolan keeps the whole suspension of disbelief going on pretty well so the movie isn't ruined, or not even scratched.But... while far from perfect, it was possibly along with Toy Story 3 the best movie this year, and one of Nolan's best effort, up there with Memento and The Dark Knight. Surely a movie you SHOULD NOT miss. It has its critics - just see the user reviews on IMDb - but that is the final stroke of genius on this film: you gotta be intelligent to appreciate it. Sheep-like-minded limited individuals will HATE it. And all I can do is smile as I see confused faces come out of the movie theater - poor, poor minds...",9,2,8,6 August 2010
Signs," What if God wrote Sci-Fi books (SPOILERS)
","-- WARNING SPOILERS --I've just seen 'Signs', and while I was watching it, I knew it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, I have seen his last 3 movies, and I loved every one of them. 'Signs' is a very hard movie to understand. Its seems to be sci-fi, but with a little bit of horror/suspense on it. It's like 'Close Encounters' meets 'Sixth Sense'.My favorite scene in the movie is the basement one. It was shot almost entirely in the dark, and we can only see fragments of sounds and images. And, amazingly, just like 'Blair Witch Project', it works. Why? Well, because the whole suspense is in the audiences minds.I think you might find that interesting: as I was watching the movie, I kept trying to solve the movie's puzzle, the final surprise. I mean it's there, in every M. Night movie. And I thought that those were not aliens, but DEMONS or DEVILS or something. And what would make the demons go away would him getting back to his faith. I mean, watch the scene where he refuses to pray with his children when he is about to eat... And you'll see that my point of view could be right. What made the 'demons' go away the first time? Mel Gibson's character, 'praying' silently when his son is fighting to breath. And what made the 'demons' go away the second time? Water. Why? I dunno, maybe because they live in hell or something, and just like fire would burn us, they get hurt by water...Anyway... I can only think of two persons who could try to film such a movie, Hitchcock and Kubrick. Hitchcock would probably not use some camera elements (as the 'in the ground' shots), and would not use SFX as it is needed to create the mood, so it wouldn't work. Kubrick would probably use his 'parallel to the wall' shots, and his face close-ups, and would NOT end the movie like that... So... maybe it wouldn't work. Maybe. Kubrick would surprise us in some other creepy way.Only M. Night could direct this movie. So... Let's just wait for his next one.",8,2,4,25 September 2002
The Matrix," There is no spoon
","This movie is very confusing. It looks like a bit 'Twelve Monkeys' with a bit of 'The Truman Show' and another bit of '2001'. If you are a fan of sci-fi confusing movies, try this one!",7,0,0,24 May 1999
The Simpsons Movie," Good Stuff
","Since I heard about the movie being released, I knew it would be pure gold. The writers can still deliver good material, even though the quality has decreased since season 11 or so, and the series is know almost vitually unwatchable.This is season 9 material here, folks, I kid you not. It had that good feeling and comedy we get from the best episodes. Albert Brooks as a main character is a treat, he's the best voice guest and deserves to be there.The animation is top notch, but gets a bit distracting some times (CGI cell shading scenes a la Futurama).Sure, there are a few problems: the movie feels a bit too short, few characters get screen time (Ralph got way too many scenes, and a lot of beloved characters did not even appear), and some subplots feel rushed and go nowhere (kinda like the TV series I guess). The DVD will have LOTS of cut material, so that might get fixed on a subsequent viewing.If you are a fan of the Simpsons, specially the 8-10 seasons, THIS is the movie to see this year.",8,2,6,23 August 2007
