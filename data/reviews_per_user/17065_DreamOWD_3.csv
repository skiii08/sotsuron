It," I can't believe I have to say this about this movie but
","The truth about this movie is that it's not scary. All of the content concerning the clown is pretty good but it's another one of those things where you're like 'I wish he was in a different movie.' Because they went way overboard with the comedy in this. In fact, the reason this is even rated R is not because of anything gruesome or scary. No, not at all. This is rated R because of the language. The movie is littered with d*** jokes and s*** jokes all throughout the entire movie from start to finish.While the movie is well shot, good soundtrack and great cinematography, the scares that we came for do not deliver! They use every last predictable Hollywood horror clich√© in the book for every scare that's not the clown.And the finale. Okay, so the clown gets clowned. They literally end this clown to the point where the clown is scared of the kids and the kids aren't scared of the clown at all. None of them die by the way. There are no stakes. And yet the movie still tries to setup a sequel. Can you believe that?Many of these characters I didn't even like. With the main character kinda being an a****** dragging their friends into danger chasing down what they already know is not real. The female character being poorly treated and the psychopathic bully who gets discarded from the film like he was never there in the first place.No, this movie does not deserve a sequel and I hope it doesn't get one! Stop right where you are!I may have to stop going to the movies. I really thought this was going to be a good one.",5,47,95,7 September 2017
Arrival," Gobbledygook
","Let me start off by saying I did walk out on this movie during the final act. Where they start saying how the alien language allowed her to see time backwards. I went into this thinking some of this would actually make sense but none of it did. Even when it came down to the main premise. These aliens are from far into the future. You know, it's not even worth really discussing. I came to see an alien movie not some pseudo philosophical gobbledygook.",1,9,16,5 August 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman? When? Where? I fell asleep and took two restroom breaks.
","When it finally got to where Batman and Superman are in the same frame, I already had lost all interest. They took us far deep down in a rabbit hole. Only in a rabbit hole in Wonderland could you make heads or tails of what was happening in this movie!The audience was completely quiet and confused for the first hour, after that, it didn't matter anymore the movie just keeps unloading subplot after subplot after subplot not once grounding itself, or settling on a cohesive idea.Let's put Batman in it! And superman! And a lizard! And Wonder Woman! And a mackerel! And the flash! And doomsday! And nightmare sequences! And antichrist imagery! And a public debate of good vs evil!And Wonder Woman checking her email. They have Wonder Woman spending most of her time checking her email. And then all of the sudden, she pops up on the scene hopping out from behind a rock like she knows what's going on. Like she has a handle on the situation.Superman dies in the movie. right in front of Batman and Wonder woman's face. And yet you really don't have anything to say about it because these 3 superheroes act as if they others don't exist. Wonder Woman doesn't have anything to say. She thought she was in her own movie.Batman was in his own world. They all thought they were in their own separate movies.Lex Luther apparently hates superman for some reason. Batman and superman fight after only having met one time. Batman says its going to be a fight to the death but stops dead in his tracks at the mention of his mother's name.I saw a poster for this movie that said 'Who Will Win?' When you watch the movie, that premise doesn't present itself. First you are going to watch this eccentric billionaire. You're going to watch this political discussion on the topic of superman. You're going to watch psycho babble about a magic rock. You're going to watch some people debate at church. You're going to watch a scene with somebody spray painting a superman logo. You're going to be taken to see a night party with the discussion about a stolen sword that has nothing to do with the matter at hand. You're going to watch all of Batman's nightmares that crop up periodically and never come to a head. You're going to keep going back to that office for one more conversation about what's in the newspaper. But a batman and superman face off? The movie says *beep* that. That was thrown right out the window. Why does Lex Luther want to take down Superman? Are we ever given any explanation of what he's mumbling about? And this chaos is a preview of what's to come in this shared DC universe? This movie does not work. This movie is not working. The plot is stupid. The characters are not connected. This isn't just one of those movies with multiple plots. This is a movie that is in uncontained. I heard they started doing reshoot of suicide squad because this movie apparently was too dark that people didn't laugh. You couldn't laugh. You couldn't cry. You could have any emotion to this film because it's too far gone. They're trying to tell a whole bunch of different stories at once and once it's pieced together it doesn't tell a real story at all.",1,13,26,4 April 2016
