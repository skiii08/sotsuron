10 Cloverfield Lane," Great for 80% of the Film
","Warning: Potential Spoilers!When I first saw the trailer for 10 Cloverfield lane, I can't say I was hugely excited after the rather disappointing Cloverfield (2008). This film had been described as not a sequel but simply a 'blood relative' of the previous Cloverfield film. Firstly, this film does not adopt the shaky 'found footage' camera style as the previous one which was certainly a relief. It also does not show the creature from the other Cloverfield film which was meant to be similar to Godzilla in terms of its origin story. This was also a relief. I would have given this film a higher rating had it not been for the ending. I don't want this summary to be super-spoilery so I'll stop short of just telling you what happens but we go from being in a semi- realistic situation that involves three people trying to survive together in a bunker to just complete ridiculousness. The actual reveal at the end isn't in itself awful, it actually could have been rather interesting. However, the way events unfold in the last 15-20 minutes of the film were just moronic and nothing more than a film trying to add some action when it wasn't needed.I found the suspense and mystery during the majority of the film to be compelling and intriguing but rather than sticking to that style with the ending, I think this film was ruined by an attempt to add excitement and an excuse to use special effects.",6,0,2,6 May 2016
Captain Marvel," Major Letdown Prior to Endgame
","Listen, Captain Marvel isn't the worst movie to ever be made. It has many redeeming qualities that make the first-watch semi-enjoyable. If this had beena stand-alone movie with zero ties to the MCU, I think it would have been OK.Many people are blaming Brie Larson for the quality of this movie, but I actually enjoyed her performance. The reason the movie sucks is the writing. Characters are majorly underdeveloped while some are overdeveloped, the story itself just spends the 2 hour duration screaming for attention within the MCU, and the power-level of Captain Marvel is just ridiculous. We've seen characters within the MCU who are 'Gods' or hold Infinity Stones are were still nowhere near as powerful as her.It's not really surprising that this movie has to let you know at every turn that it takes place within the MCU. Honestly, the whole way through it I barely felt like I was watching a Marvel movie (apart from the fact that Captain Marvel feels the need to shove that fact down your throat constantly, as I've already mentioned).",3,19,34,11 March 2019
Spotlight," Excellent Film! Terrifying...But Excellent
","*Potential Spoilers*There is a lot to be said about a film such as Spotlight. There is no action, no murders, no special effects, no explosions, no knife- wielding psychopaths...and yet this film manages to reach down deep inside your mind and grip it tightly throughout the entire film. I found it rather odd having to mention that there could be spoilers in this film as it isn't really a film with a traditional sort of twist to it. Watching Spotlight, I found myself feeling many emotions towards the characters in the film as well as towards the institutions in real life: you can't help but feel empathy towards the victims within this story, while feeling anger, disgust, contempt towards the 'villains'. The biggest issue, the biggest fear-causing moment in this films is at the end. After watching any other film, the credits would roll and you would tell yourself 'It was just a film'...but with Spotlight, your brain keeps thinking about how awful and real this story is. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone but I would especially recommend it to anyone who follows faith blindly. Anyone who believes that they are doing Gods will by abandoning any moral principle because a fellow believer explains that it is what God wants. 6%...",9,0,0,10 March 2016
Suicide Squad," Possibly the Most Average Film EVER!
","With films such as this, there is often the risk of expectations being too high before the film is even released, ultimately resulting in the film being disappointing when it doesn't live up to all the hype that was generated. Luckily, this film had Man of Steel and Batman V Superman to kill everybody's hopes for it being any better than these. As more trailers were released, we got to see the characters and ultimately the 'Suicide Squad' were painted as this group of villains who would be blackmailed into doing some good at threat of having their heads blown off. In an attempt to keep this review spoiler free (something I tend not to bother doing with other reviews) all I will say in relation to the storyline is that we're not dealing with villains and despite the constant misuse of the term 'sociopath' which gets thrown around like a hot potato, these 'villains' unfortunately fall victim to the biggest threat of all: Hollywood clich√©s. This film works if you're half asleep, don't need any real storyline or interesting character development, or really anything that makes sense in any way. If you're looking for an original film (especially a comic book film) then I'd advise searching elsewhere because it's not this film. Much like Deadpool, despite everyone claiming on the run up to release that this film would break the boundaries of what we consider the 'superhero franchise', it (much like Deadpool) ends up being EXACTLY like your basic, most typical comic book film ever! Back when The Dark Knight Trilogy was fresh on our minds I always considered the Marvel vs DC debate to be fairly balanced, maybe even tipped more towards DC but certainly in terms of films, Marvel is now so far ahead that even The Flash would have a hard time catching up. DC are seriously going to have to rethink their approach to films if they want to stay relevant.",4,2,3,9 October 2016
The Revenant," Entertaining but Nothing Special
","*Doesn't contain any huge spoilers: just one scene*After literally just getting back from seeing The Revenant, I decided to share my opinion of it prior to the Oscars before it becomes even more hyped up. While Leonardo DiCaprio does deliver an incredible performance, making the audience feel his pain and helplessness in certain situations, I found myself often comparing his facial expressions and noises to the scene in The Wolf of Wall Street where his character consumes some surprisingly powerful quaaludes ultimately dropping him directly into the 'cerebral palsy phase'. I found it somewhat difficult to contain my laughter after making this comparison during the film. Putting that aside, his portrayal of a character determined to have his revenge was impressive.That being said, even within the opening scenes of the film I found myself focusing more on Tom Hardy's performance. Whether it was his character or his acting that caught my attention, I couldn't tell you. Following the 'evil' character in the film added a sense of dramatic flare that we don't always see. Watching as he deals with each and every consequence as it unfolds, watching how little effect this has on his conscience. Short of putting any real spoilers in here, Tom Hardy in my opinion played an essential role in the success of this film. Overall, I would certainly recommend this film to people because it is a great watch but I also won't be rushing to purchase the DVD upon its release. The story tends to drag in points and many aspects of the story that would have been interesting to see are left unexplored. Perhaps this was to add a degree of mystery to the film but I think it would have helped flesh out the story a little more.",6,1,2,28 February 2016
The Conjuring 2," Not Bad as Far as Horrors Go!
","*May Contain Spoilers*Over the years we've been victim to the regurgitation of horror classics as well as sequel after sequel (to be fair, this is an aspect that has always existed within the horror genre) and to be honest, I haven't seen a horror for a long time that has made me feel even slightly creeped out, never mind scared! That being said, The Conjuring 2 certainly starts off well with some very chilling moments and plenty of tension building. Luckily it doesn't fall into the trap of relying solely on jump scares which have recently become the norm. I did find myself during the occasional scene actually holding my breath in anticipation to see what would happen. The issue arises later in the film where we get a very boring ending and a whole 'prophecy' aspect that is ignored (perhaps it will be addressed in a later film). Not to mention that the ending had a somewhat rushed feel to it that deviated from the earlier pace of the film. So I've given this film a 7, not because I think out of any film would would deserve a 7/10 but because taking the last decade or two of horrors I think it certainly did a better job than most. So my 7/10 is solely as a comparison to other horrors rather than a representation of earlier films.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," As You'd Expect!
","Contains Spoilers!So there isn't a great deal that can be said here that you wouldn't have guessed simply from the direction the last film took the series in. Basically: money-hungry bosses decided to squeeze another film out of an already dead film series. Dead Men Tell No tales? More like Dead Franchises Tell No Tales! The storyline at a base level could have been pretty interesting: The backstory of Jack was certainly an entertaining moment but the poor writing just opened far too many cans of worms and ultimately couldn't pull it off. I mean the emphasis on the compass at the start implied that it had something to do with the dead being imprisoned yet that was never explained. I mean maybe I just missed something but to me, the compass was the same compass we'd seen throughout the films already. The story of Barbossa felt forced and the scenes with him and his daughter were revoltingly cringe-worthy. Another thing that the film seemed to skip over is why a woman who doesn't believe in ghosts or anything supernatural is searching for a magical trident that controls the sea? Speaking of which: how did the red coats know that they were racing for the trident since nobody had got that far through the clues other than the girl? Don't even get me started on Jack. Anyone planning on watching this film for the same entertaining Jack from the previous ones better give it a miss. Instead, we are forced to watch this bumbling idiot who quite honestly was more like a pirate version of the mad-hatter than Jack Sparrow. He wasn't witty, he was barely funny...it was sad actually. I can only pray that they end it at this one! How long before Davy Jones is brought back on some revenge mission? Maybe we'll see another previous advisory being raised from the depths of hell. Also the Will and Elizabeth scenes added nothing to this film. I'd actually have preferred if they hadn't been in the film at all. I mean isn't the Dutchman meant to ferry the dead across to 'the next place'. So why wasn't there some involvement in the story of this film? The Dutchman could have intervened at any moment and made everything a whole lot easier. Basically this film is a plothole riddled with plot holes where all your favourite characters have gone to die!",5,7,10,10 September 2017
Logan," Good film (as far as X-Men films go)
","The X-Men films are always difficult to review because the universe, the characters and usually the special effects in the films are all incredible and for the most part it is the storyline that fails to pack a punch. The Wolverine films have been part of this same flaw and while Origins was somewhat interesting, it was also incredibly underwhelming. Don't even get me started on how boring the second Wolverine film was...so here we are after a whole series of average films with what people view as the best so far. I have to say I probably agree with them. Within the whole series, Days of Future Past is probably my favourite film but this would be a close second. For those of you who have stuck with the films over the years, you know going into this film that they're not at their best: the trailer alone shows both Charles and Logan having aged and it's always quite an emotional time when characters such as these begin to show their mortality. I do however, have to disagree with many of the reviews on this site: first of all, as far as films go this is not 'the best film ever' nor is it the best Marvel-based film either (obviously I mean from Marvel comments as we all know that the Marvel universe is somewhat divided due to legal issues). For me, almost all the MCU films trump the X-Men films by a long shot and this film is no exception. I've still rated this film pretty highly (7) because it is definitely a good film. I just think all those aboard the hype train perhaps need to slow down a little, catch a breath, and come back to the reality where X-Men films are average or slightly above and will probably never succeed beyond that (with the exception of Deadpool).",7,1,5,14 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fun to watch but still very disappointing
","***Spoilers***As many people have pointed out, the issue with his film is largely down to the lack of creativity. I remember when it was first announced that we would be getting a new trilogy and opinions were largely varied. I couldn't help but feel like it was being forced, that they wouldn't put enough time into coming up with an original idea. The first two trailers confirmed this pretty well. When the final trailer was released, I became optimistic: the music, the visuals, the voice-over, the characters; everything just looked interesting and that anticipation stayed with me up until I saw it on the second day of release.The lack of originality is unbearably obvious. I mean this film pretty much runs the exact same way as A New Hope. I could go into the similarities but if you've seen it, you know what I mean and if you haven't seen it then just picture A New Hope and you're 75% of the way there. I would like to remain hopeful that the next two in the trilogy manage to make up for it but considering that we'll be getting a ton of spin- offs between each episode, i'm not optimistic. I also have no clue where they can go with the storyline, I mean the biggest weapon ever created as just been blown up with what I can only assume was the majority of the First Order on board. The villain just got his ass kicked and the villains master didn't actually appear on screen in person. I have a horrible feeling that when we reach the end of this trilogy, not only will we have another failure to put alongside the prequels but we will probably have a cliffhanger of sorts so that they can make it seem like another trilogy is justified. I've already heard rumors of an Obi-Wan Kenobi trilogy which in itself is ridiculous. That being said, I won't deny that there are certainly aspects to the film that were very enjoyable. The X-Wings flying across the water and watching Star Killer Base destroy several planets at a time was visually exciting...but this just doesn't make up for A) Having another freakin' death star in the first place and B) Having it be destroyed as easily as the other two. I mean when are villains in the Star Wars films going to learn?",5,23,29,9 January 2016
Life," Exactly what you expect...but not in a bad way!
","Contains Minor SpoilersSo I hadn't really heard or seen anything about the film Life other than it was pretty good and was a sci-fi film. So I was pretty open minded going into it which is hard to do considering the rate at which they are pumping out sci-fi movies these days...just when you thought the superhero genre was being milked dry...Anyway, as my summary states: Life is exactly what you expect it to be but not in a bad way. This isn't the first film and it won't be the last to adopt the idea of a space crew who find something that then tries to kill them. Even the 'twists' in this film are about as predicable as the phases of the moon's cycle! That being said, the acting in this film (with a couple of exceptions) is pretty spot on! The special effects are very good and while the storyline itself is wildly overplayed, the excitement and tension still manage to be raised to a pretty high standard. I found one thing that this film did very well was make me feel uncomfortable. Whenever you watch a film with bugs and you get that feeling of something crawling on you. Imagine that but rather than a bug it's an alien species. The death scenes are brutal and add to the sense of discomfort I felt by watching this film (in comparison I can watch the Saw films while eating food and not remotely feel put off). I'd say if you've come looking for the next Interstellar then you should keep looking...but if you enjoyed Alien (or the millions of sequels/prequels) or Sunshine or any of these sort of films then you should definitely give this one a go.",8,2,8,1 June 2017
Spectre," Hugely Disappointing
","*Spoilers Ahead*For me, this James Bond installment was a huge let down. Upon hearing that Christoph Waltz would be taking the role of a Bond villain, I was full of excitement and anticipation. Anyone who has seen Inglorious Basterds is no doubt aware of just how well he is suited to being a bad guy. The trailers came out and the anticipation kept building and building. Sadly however, it proved to fall short of expectations. The story feels forced and the audience learns a lot of what feels like unnecessary information. Where to begin...One of the first things we learn is that an organisation known as Spectre is essentially responsible for the events that took place in the previous Daniel Craig films. I'm surely not the only one who saw this as ridiculous? Fair enough if in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall we had seen hints or clues towards a connection but from what I can recall this was not the case. I mean wasn't Skyfall essentially a revenge plot? We are led to believe that the previous villains were part of this organisation which just doesn't fit what we see in the other films. The next thing is Christoph Waltz's character taking responsibility for killing Bond's love interest as well as the previous M. Which again seems to be the writers grasping at straws in order to improve the storyline. We are also given in insight into Bond's past. About how he was temporarily under the care of some guy who happened to be the villain's father leading to this idea of jealousy and 'brotherly quarreling'. Which again felt like completely unnecessary information that was simply thrown in to try and make the story seem more interesting. A poor attempt to add a twist to a basic action film. My biggest complaint other than the completely uncalled for information, is that lack of any sort of real threat. I mean the only threat is a villain having access to the world's surveillance. Where are the huge lasers or bombs? No nuclear missiles being primed for launch? I mean we live in a world where our governments are regularly being brought forward to be held accountable for spying on us. We don't need a Bond film to see such events. Christoph Waltz did not get enough screen time or enough freedom to really display the Bond villain we all wanted to see. This Bond film tried too hard to add twists and turns and it failed miserably. While the action scenes were pretty incredible. I think in the future if they are going to build a villain up like that, he needs to actually do some crazy acts otherwise it just seems pointless.",5,5,21,3 November 2015
