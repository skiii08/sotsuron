United 93," An unbelievably brilliant piece of film-making.
","By the time I actually saw 'United 93', I had read quite a few reviews of the film, almost all very positive. And of course, I knew the details of the real life event. But none of these prepared me for the raw intensity and power of Greengrass' script and direction. By choosing to make it in the semi-documentary style using unknown actors, he took a big risk but the end product is beyond reproach. I sat clutching a cushion throughout the film, palms sweating and heart pounding. The carefully edited depiction of the reactions both in the air and on the ground as the tragedy unfolds is a masterpiece of film-making. The last 10 minutes are positively gut-wrenching and are going to remain with me for the rest of my days. I am sure that only minimal artistic licence had to used in guessing the events on board the plane and even that must be very close to actually what happened. If this film does not win Oscars for Best Picture, Direction & Screenplay & Editing, the awards will cease to have any meaning for me.",10,1,3,20 October 2006
The Killing Fields," A shatteringly superb film
","It was hard for me to understand my own emotions after watching The Killing Fields. It was more like watching a documentary with actual events and people than a feature film. I was not able to say or even think anything straight, such was the impact that the film made. Hiang N'gor as Dith Pran lives rather than acts the role; I have never seen any on-screen or on-stage performance to match where the actor put his/her heart and soul into the role that he/she was playing. Before watching the film for the first time over 20 years ago, I had only a disjointed view of the horrors perpetuated by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. But since then, I have visited the country, spoken to the people and can form a far better picture of what happened to it during those terrible years. The film depicts the atmosphere with stunning clarity, complemented by superbly imaginative camera-work and sound effects. Anyone with a but of conscience is going to remember this film for life.",10,8,9,19 September 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Grossly underestimated and typically Kubrikian masterpiece
","Just after we watched 'Eyes Wide Shut' a few years ago, I told my wife that it was very much a 'man's movie'. This is not intended to be a sexist comment, but I believe that in order to appreciate the several typically Kubrikian nuances in the film, one has to watch it through Tom Cruise's eyes and one can only do this effectively if one is a man....like Cruise. With Kubrick, the sum of the parts does not always make an effective whole, but it somehow does so in this film. The direction is very much 'in the face' as it always is with Kubrick and the various supporting characters - like the shopowner's nubile Lolita-like daughter - somehow convey a hidden message that is for receptive ears only. But to my mind, the best scene in the film is the early morning street sequence after the party where Cruise realises that he is being followed by the bald man. There is a hidden menace in the air that can only be appreciated if you put yourself in Cruise's shoes. For this and several other sequences, this is a very unusual film that needs to be seen and enjoyed in the right mood, preferably on one's own.",9,9,17,4 October 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Over-hyped, dull, very boring and completely pointless
","Seldom has a movie so eagerly awaited has disappointed so much. I knew that Dan Brown's book was over-hyped and artificially 'best sold' by the various protests, but I was hoping that at least the movie might be interesting. Instead, all we got was a flat & uninspiring script, dull direction and wooden acting. Tom Hanks and Jean Reno looked as though they were late for a funeral and the supporting cast were not far behind. The 'twists' are preposterous and defy common sense and the special effects look as though they have been borrowed from other films. To add to the fiasco, the music and cinematography are also very ordinary, completing a deadbeat film.",3,0,2,25 May 2006
Titanic," My biggest movie disappointment in over 35 years
","First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.",1,85,298,27 January 2001
Thirteen Days," Brilliantly done cold war drama
","'Thirteen Days' is certainly the best film that I have seen in the last 5 years and one of the best ever. Script, direction, acting, photography and sound are all top notch. Steven Culp is absolutely outstanding as Bobby Kennedy and surely deserved an Oscar. Bruce Greenwood as JFK is not far behind and almost all the smaller roles are played to perfection. Strangely, the only mediocre performance comes from Kevin Costner, who looks rather wooden most of the time. But the movie is a triumph of what I call 'straightforward storytelling' which seems to be sadly lacking in these days of Tarantinos and Soderberghs. For me, the crux of the whole situation was the sequence where the President asks the destroyer commander, 'Captain, can you force that Russian sub to the surface without damaging it and without damage to yourself?' In retrospect, it is a wonder that the world came through this unscathed.",10,0,0,6 April 2001
