The Blair Witch Project," If only the General Public weren't so brainwashed
","I loved this movie. Mainly because it is so totaly different from any film I've ever seen. I wanted so badly to strangle the kids in front of me who were snickering at the scenes that were completely black. They were like 'where's the picture?'. The general sheeplike public has been so brainwashed by hollywoods idea of a blockbuster film, that when they see something that is actualy good, and fresh, and groundbreaking, they brush it off and scoff it for not having wide screen special effects, and unrecognisable actors who don't churn out cliched on liners. They get temporary A.D.D. when there is no score to tell them when to be scared, and when to yell at Drew Barrymore, 'Don't go outside!' The joke is on them, cause 20 years from now, this movie will be seen as a cinematic milestone, and they will be pretending that they loved it when they first saw it.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
