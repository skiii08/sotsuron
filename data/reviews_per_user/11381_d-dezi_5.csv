The Avengers," Not a a true 1 but NOT A 8.3!!!!
","The Avengers is a fun movie, it looks great visually and has a classic comic book plot. The issue is there is nothing original or inspiring about it! It lacks drama and the ability to get you lost in the plot; it is terribly predictable and never once has the viewer worried or wondering what will happen next. Yes it's a fun and awesome comic book movie, but I would say it's much more of a novelty than a great work of art. The Dark Knight series were all base off comic books yet had an edge added to them to make the viewer connect to the characters and actually worry because they need knew what would happen next, like most great movies. The Avengers fails to do this throughout the film. There is nothing innovative about the plot there is no true tension in the film. I would normally rate this film as a 5/6 out of 10 but I can't since there are so many high ratings. Simply said The Avengers is a fun simple movie with great visual effects that can bring you back to childhood, it is not a horrible film but it is not a work of cinematic art by any means and I do not feel like it deserves a rating as high as some of the most classics and original films we have to offer rate.",1,17,47,9 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," BORING, the Swedish was far more captivating and Noomi was a FAR better Lisbeth
","I wanted to like this movie I truly did but it just can not compare with the Swedish film. Everyone has their own opinion but to me this film was lacking and I could not stay focused as opposed to its Swedish  counter part which I couldn't take my eyes off of. 1st is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander she gave an OK performance I believe that they were many other actress that could have done a better job.  Noomi Rapace (the original Lisbeth) owned the role one of the most captivating performances I have ever seen! People say this version is closer to the book and in some aspects it is! But it's a boring movie. I'm an American I love American cinema, I don't mind read subtitles but I'd rather not have to. Believe me when I say the Swedish version has a better dialog, a way better cast and is overall a much better story. I'm sorry for the fans of this film but there was truly no need to remake this story after the Swedish people did an excellent job transform a book from their nation into film. Two thumbs down for me",7,9,16,19 March 2012
Now You See Me," Fun, Entertaining and overall enjoyable
","There are a lot of negative reviews concerning this film especially about character development, or lack there of and unintelligent writing, But those reviewers are missing the point of movie. I will go as far as to say as any person complaining about character development and a lacking script are not only extremely pretentious, but also completely out of place! Yes there is a lack of character development and there is very simple dialogue that is because this is a very stylized, fantasy type of movie and relies on that only to entertain the viewer. In that aspect the film does very well! Now You See Me is fun and you will be glad you watched it. No it will not make you ponder, no you will not fell a deep emotional connection with any of the characters, yes you may discover the twists before they are revealed and yes there are plot holes, but none of this matters! Because in the the entire time you are just waiting for the next cool trick or stunt to happen and in this aspect the movie doesn't fail!",8,0,2,8 September 2013
Les Misérables," Wonderful movie, please don't listen to the pretentious reviewers writing negative reviews.
",1st I would like to say preference is completely subjective and a person has every right to dislike this movie. I have a problem with the negative reviews which are completely pretentious and try to make a person feel of lesser intelligence if they enjoyed this movie and haven't seen it on stage. I also have a problem with the reviewer that obviously do not understand the core message of Les Mis. The central message of the story is about Mercy and grace and how people accept mercy and grace. I have seen the show I Broadway and both movie versions and I enjoyed them all because I loved and related to the core message. You don't have to love or even like this movie but please do not force your opinions on others and try to make them feel inferior because they enjoyed a musical you found unentertaining. Especially if you don't understand what they film is truly trying to convey.,10,1,5,31 March 2013
Black Panther," An Amazing Marvel Film, But Overall Just Good
","Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of Marvel movies. Most times to me they are hit or miss, they can be well made and entertaining (Guardians of The Galaxy/Iron Man) or completely shallow and boring with a terrible plot and poor dialogue (The Avengers). When comparing Black Panther to other Marvel Films it is an amazing movie and easily in my top 5 for Marvel, but when judging it as a stand alone film I'd say it's a good, but not great movie. The plot was engaging, the visuals were pleasing and it was well acted (over all). I would say it was about 20 min too long and felt like some scenes dragged on forever. My final take away would be that it is a well made, entertaining film that was slightly too long... it was one of the 1st if not 1st Major Blockbuster with a majority Black cast and crew which will make it a historic film. Whether or not it will be a classic film only time will tell, but like most Marvel films I'm guessing it will not.",7,0,4,4 May 2018
