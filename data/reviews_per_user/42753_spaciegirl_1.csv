Insidious: Chapter 2," Picks up where the first one left off and doesn't let you have a moments reprieve from tension.
","I hate going to the movies. HATE. It is overpriced and I don't like crowds and my boyfriend is usually making me watch some superhero crap I have no interest in. That being said, horror is my bag and I think Insidious (1) is the best horror movie that has been made in recent years, so I had been eagerly awaiting Chapter 2 for months. We went on opening night and it was sold out. Went to a second theater and it was sold out. Went the next day and a group of annoying teenagers ruined the entire opening and would not shut up, so we left and the theater gave us some free passes. Finally,yesterday, the 4th time we attempted this movie, we watched it in a nearly empty theater. OH MY GOD!! Worth the wait and worth the 3 failed attempts and annoyance. I will not say that it was better than the first one, but it is just as good and I found it to be scarier. SPOILER: The red face guy is not in it. That was my only disappointment. Everything else made up for that though. I loved how it tied into the last one and I am AMPED about the next one. (I don't know if that's confirmed to be happening, but it certainly seems like they are intending to continue. Fingers crossed for red guy.)I am so impressed by these two movies. It has everything a genre nerd would love: references to a long list of other titles like Poltergeist, The Shining, Amityville etc, a little humor thrown in, a conscious omitting of tropes and stereotypes while still using some familiar, much loved themes...I could go on forever. The use of red as light and color alone could inspire a college thesis if I were still in art school. I loved it. I went to the movies 4 times to see it for the love of god! That is unheard of for me. AMAZING",10,1,4,16 September 2013
