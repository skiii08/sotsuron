Requiem for a Dream," powerful
",i just watched this movie and it is so true to life as much as we would like to think that is not the case i was blown away by just the reality of this movie how real it is how your life can be lost it was like one thing after another the diet pills the drugs the jail the sex for money in order to get the drugs four lives destroyed like so many other lives each and everyday at times i felt as though i was watching what people i knew went threw the pain and guilt the need to escape from reality and then the need to escape again and again and again an endless cycle is what we go through and i think this movie shows this cycle for many of us,Null,0,0,20 July 2002
The Ring," 'WOW'
",I can only say 'WOW'!.This movie is sensational.It has been a long time sense I have seen a movie this scary.At one point I screamed which is not an easy thing for a movie to make me do.The story is intriguing the acting is wonderful and the effects are brilliantly done.This movie takes you on a ride of a lifetime.I highly recommend seeing this movie if your looking for something truly frightening.,10,1,1,17 March 2003
