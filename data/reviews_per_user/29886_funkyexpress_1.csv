Scarface," WHAT..U FU**ING KIDDIN' ME MAN
","Trust me, believe this right now. Scarface is THE movie of the millenium, bar none. O.k, Goodfellas and the Godfather are pretty damn good but this is just buff. Tony Montana is the modern day Othello and the movie charts his rise..and fall, through his own imperfections(hence the scar on his face). His cockiness, eagerness, greed, and rogue aspects make him a truly aspirational character and some of the lines can be used to instigates untold intimidation. Some black humour lies beneath the excellent plot and although people criticise the legnth of the movie, such a time span is essential to get to know all the characters and feel for them. This was the director at his peak, whilst the music is just wicked (can u buy it anywhere? - I've made it my voicemail). As a comparison, watch this and then Carlito's Way to get the complete spectrum perspective. Heavy, heavy, heavier, take it easy.....but make sure you see this.",Null,0,0,6 February 2001
