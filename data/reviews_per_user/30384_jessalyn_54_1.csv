The New World," 2nd Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen
","This movie (I'm told) was supposed to be the live action version of the Disney movie Pocahontas. In no way whatsoever did I see any relation to the cartoon, just the story of Pocahontas. Our lead character (Colin Farrell) had a total of 10 lines in the whole movie. All I saw in this movie was lots of intense staring. Nobody talks. Ever. The scenery was beautiful, I will give them that. But after 2 hours of sitting through this I had to shut it off I was so bored. There was no end in sight. When I finally forced myself to turn it back on and finish it, I was so angry with the ending I actually started screaming. That's a first. I also dislike the fact that they cast just any Native American for these parts. I recognize many of the actors in this movie and some are Mohawk, some are Sioux, and so on. That's like grabbing anyone who looks Asian and saying they are Japanese. Actually they did do that in Memoirs of a Geisha since neither of the main female characters are Japanese. All in all I hated this movie and demanded a refund.",1,0,3,2 August 2006
