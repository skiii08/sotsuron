The Ring," The same feeling leaving the cinema as the Blair Witch
","It was a strange feeling as I left the cinema, almost the same as when the Blair Witch project was around, just generally freeked by the filmA fantastic twist at the end, boy i didnt see that coming, I thought it was all over when Samara was buried.. Very good although very similar to the Others & Sixth Sense and using the little kid all the time as the almost 'evil' one is sort of growing out now... But a good film none the less..",8,0,0,26 November 2002
