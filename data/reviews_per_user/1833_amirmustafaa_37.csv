Ford v Ferrari," An Exhilarating and Old School Crowd Pleaser
","Ford V Ferrari is the type of movie that we just don't get anymore. It's thrilling, straightforward, and crowd pleasing. A lot of movies these days are so cynical, which is why its refreshing to see an old school, inspirational sports movie. This movie also has great performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Also, the racing scenes are absolutely fun to watch. I'm sad that I didn't watch this in IMAX.",8,1,1,15 February 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Better Than the First Movie
","This movie matches the first Blade Runner's beautiful score, cinematography, and special effects. What makes this movie better than the first one is the fact that it has a better plot and more fleshed out characters.This movie takes the incredible world the first movie created and manages to tell an incredible story within that world. Ryan Gosling also gives an incredible performance as a man struggling with his feelings and humanity. He is the main character that I wanted Deckard to be in the first movie. In conclusion, this is a science fiction epic that has the distinction of being one of the rare sequels that build upon its predecessor, and that's why it's incredibly sad that this movie isn't doing well at the box office. Hopefully, this finds the audience it deserves and develops a cult following like the first movie.",9,1,6,7 October 2017
First Man," One of the Most Tense and Realistic Space Movies Ever Made
","First Man manages to do something incredible. We know Neil Armstrong landed on the moon safely and came back, but this movie still manages to be incredibly tense, and it keeps the audience fearful of if it's actually going to work even though we know it is. This big reason this movie has this effect is because it strives for realism in every scene. The way the camera shakes, and the way the sound in this movie portrays being in a rocket makes the audience feel as if they're actually traveling to space as well, hoping not to crash or burn up. This movie also has a brilliant performance from Ryan Gosling, and i also liked the way it was shot. Most of the movie has a retro and gritty look to it as if was actually filmed in the 60's, and the scenes on the moon take full advantage of IMAX, giving us some truly breathtaking shots.I must caution people people that this is NOT a crowd-pleaser. This is not some epic and fast paced crowd-pleasing movie about some cool guy going to space. This is a serious and ultra realistic film about a serious and stoic guy risking his life to go to the moon while also dealing with a lot of personal trauma. If that doesn't sound like something you would like, then this movie is not for you.",10,1,4,15 October 2018
Detroit," A True Horror Film
","This is one of the most intense and terrifying movies I've ever seen. How the characters are treated are hard to stomach, but this movie is an essential watch. It also has a great cast full of incredible performances. Detroit proves that Kathryn Bigelow is one of the best directors in Hollywood.",8,1,3,13 June 2018
Rocketman," Taron Egerton is Incredible...The Movie is Just Okay
","It was an interesting choice to actually make a musical biopic, but the choice doesn't really pay off. As a musical, it somewhat lacks energy and it doesn't use John's catalog to full effect. As a biopic, its unfocused and lacks depth. We get no indication of what time the scenes take place in, some parts feel rushed, and Elton John's personal struggles don't have the emotional effect it should've had. To put it simply this movie wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be a fantasy musical and a expansive biopic but it doesn't really work as either.With that being said, Taron Egerton is incredible in this movie. He's electric and he really holds this whole thing together. All and all, this was a okay movie with a incredible performance at the center of it.",6,0,1,1 September 2019
Darkest Hour," A Good Movie Carried by a Great Performance
","There's no doubt that the weight of this movie is on Gary Oldman's shoulders, and I'm glad to say that Oldman delivers. His performance was so brilliant that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie and thought I was watching Churchill himself. Other than Oldman's performance, the movie is well made not anything spectacular but well made. This is a great movie to watch if you want to learn a little bit of history and watch a brilliant performance.",7,0,3,6 January 2018
Knives Out," Another Smart and Engaging Rian Johnson Film
","Rian Johnson is one of the best writer/directors in Hollywood and this movie proves it. The plot of this movie is brilliantly crafted, tense, and engaging. It always stays one step ahead even if you think you know whats about to happen. It was also funny with great performances from Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig. I'm glad this movie was successful because I can't wait to see another story in this world.",8,4,8,7 March 2020
The Irishman," A Meditative and Well Made Goodbye to the Gangster Genre
","First of all, this is not Goodfellas or Casino. While those movies were fast and exciting takes on the gangster genre, The Irishman is a slower and meditative take on the gangster genre. Those movies are about excess, but this movie is about regret and the emptiness of the gangster lifestyle. We've seen this type of meditative gangster movie before with The Godfather Part 3 and Once Upon a Time in America, but The Irishman is head and shoulders above those movies because of the history between the actors.The best thing about this movie are the performances. i got a little emotional seeing all of these incredible actors and knowing that this might be the last time they're all on the same screen together, and there is one scene where Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Harvey Kartel are all in the same room, and it might be the best scene of the year. Joe Pesci gives a quiet performance that will shock people who's expecting him to give another Casino type performance, Al Pacino gives an energetic and memorable performance, but this is Robert De Niro's movie and he's absolutely brilliant definitely in the last few scenes when he's grappling with his sins.Overall, this is a very well made and well acted goodbye to the genre that made nearly everybody involved with this movie who they are. Also, the last hour of this movie is some of the best filmmaking of Scorsese's career. Yes this movie is slow and yes it's long, but if you give this movie all of your attention, you will find that there's something powerful about it.",Null,1,3,28 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," This Movie is Fun. What Else can I Say?
","This is another enjoyable movie from marvel. What is there to say at this point? Marvel has its formula perfected. This movie is exactly what you thought it was going to be, a fun yet predictable marvel movie. With that being said, this an above average marvel film. The characters are enjoyable, the score is great, and it looks visually better than most movies marvel has released. At this point, Marvel knows what they're doing. Their formula is fail proof, and this movie is no exception.",7,1,4,3 November 2017
Ready Player One," An Undeniably Fun Movie
","There's not a lot to say about this movie other than the fact that's it's fun. This is definitely Spielberg's most entertaining movie in YEARS. It has cool visuals, entertaining action sequences, and a surprising amount of heart. I didn't read the book, and I honestly don't care to at this point now that I've seen the movie, so I can't attest to how accurate or faithful the movie is to the book, but from what I saw on the screen, this is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.",7,2,4,9 September 2018
BlacKkKlansman," A Very Good Movie but Not Spike Lee's Return to Greatness
","I really liked most of this movie. John David Washington and Adam Driver's performances were great, the soundtrack was good, and the last 40 minutes of this movie were brilliantly crafted and powerful. Where this movie slips up is just how heavy handed it is. Spike Lee tries so hard to make this THE movie of 2018; the movie that tackles Trump and tackles racism more head on than any movie recently, but instead of Spike Lee's attempts coming off as relevant and 'important', it mostly comes off as annoying. Don't get me wrong, I agree with what Spike Lee was trying to say, but did he have to beat me over the head with the obvious themes of the film and then scream them into my face. Spike Lee needs to learn what subtly is. Also, this movie tries to be funny in many places, but mostly all the jokes just don't land.Like I said, I liked this move but it's not the best movie of the year like a lot of critics are making it out to be. This is not Spike Lee's return to being a great filmmaker, and it's nowhere near the quality of Lee's earlier movies like Malcolm X.",7,1,2,11 November 2018
Shutter Island," An Incredible Thriller from Martin Scorsese
","I've seen most of Scorsese's films, but for some reason I never got around to watching this one, but I'm glad I finally watched it. It's not one of his best films, but this is definitely one of his most thrilling and well shot films. This movie is full of incredible visuals, and is also full of shocking moments that kept me engrossed. The best part of this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He gives such a layered performance as someone slowly losing his sanity(or gaining it back). Overall, a very well made movie from Scorsese.",8,0,0,3 July 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," It Was Okay??
","Three Billboards was a well made quirky dark comedy, but it is a little forgettable. I thought the performances were fine and it was mostly well made, but am I missing something? The story was meandering and mostly uninteresting. Also, this movie didn't have any emotional impact. What am I missing? Why is this the best movie of 2017 for a lot of people.",5,3,5,4 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," J.J No...
","I really can't say anything about this film other than the fact that it's the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Nearly every choice that J.J Abrams made fell completely flat, and some choices were downright disgusting. Beyond the story choices, it's just not a well made film. I would like to apologize to George Lucas; he didn't always make the best choices but whatever he planned for what happened after Return of the Jedi would have been much better than this.",3,13,22,20 December 2019
Oblivion," Cool Visuals and Ideas but Mediocre Plot
","This movie has some incredibly beautiful visuals. The cinematography and special effects are without a doubt the best thing about this movie. It also has some cool sci-fi ideas taken straight from other sci-fi movies like Moon and 2001 A Space Odyssey, but with that being said, the plot is just mediocre and not very well executed. The characters are flat, the movie takes a while to actually get going, and the cool ideas are not fully explored.This movie has a resistance plot with a character played by Morgan Freeman, but his character and the resistance plot isn't fully explored. It tries to build a romantic relationship but the two characters have no chemistry, and their relationship isn't fully explored. It also involves cloning, but that part of the movie isn't explored either. This movie incorporates so many cool ideas, but the filmmakers seemed too lazy to fully explore them . Instead, we're left with a mostly uninteresting plot that involves Tom Cruise wandering about, stumbling on new revelations about the plot. Also, it tries to have some huge emotional and epic ending, but I didn't care enough about the characters and plot to feel any emotion towards the movie. With the visuals and the amount of cool ideas, this would've be a masterpiece if it was in the hands of a better director and writer like Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland.",6,1,4,22 October 2018
Justice League," DC Hasn't Learned from their Mistakes
","I wanted to love this movie, but it suffers from the same mistakes as Batman v. Superman. The plot is jumpy and incoherent, the motivation for the characters are sloppy, and the CGI is lackluster at best. Plus, Henry Cavil's face looked off in this move; you can tell they did a bad job removing his mustache. This movie wasn't all bad though. I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the best thing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terrible script and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring that even Marvel would be jealous. I think Warner Bros. need to make big changes to the DCEU or it's doomed to fail.",4,220,394,17 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," An Emotional, Ambitious, and Flawed Ending to a Glorious Group of Movies.
","Overall, I'm very satisfied with this movie. It was incredibly ambitious, taking risks that I didn't think it could possibly take. It was also obviously emotional being that this is a goodbye to some characters and a huge story line that has been set up since 2008. This movie also has the most epic final battle that I've seen in any movie, and anybody who sits through that wont be disappointed.With that being said, this movie definitely has some pacing problems. There were some moments that kind of lagged. And while this movie takes some risks, not all of them pay off. To be honest, some of the risks this movie took with the plot kind of left me a little confused., but the good out ways the bad and we've gotten a very satisfying conclusion to an incredible group of movies.",7,1,3,27 April 2019
The Favourite," Easy to Admire but difficult to Love
","The best thing this movie has going for it are its performances. Olivia Coleman and Rachel Weisz knock it out of the park, but the real standout here is Emma Stone. She is one of the best actors in Hollywood, and this movie further cements that fact. Also, the costumes and setting make this movie great to look at even though it has a unnecessarily awkward visual style(Yorgos Lanthimos is no Tom Hooper).With that being said, the thing that keeps me from loving this film is the plot. It has some interesting conflict, definitely towards the end but for the most part it drags. This was an interesting movie to watch, but I don't see myself revisiting it.",6,3,5,10 March 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," A True Epic
","I watched Lawrence of Arabia for the first time, and I thought it was incredible. This movie is the definition of epic, and it's the type of movie we just don't get anymore. It has incredible cinematography, jaw dropping locations, and a very interesting historical story. With the movie's incredible locations and cinematography, Arabia almost feels like a different planet. While I was watching this movie it felt like I was transported to another place.Moving beyond the visuals, The main thing I liked about this movie was the performances and the characters. Lawrence has to be one of the more intriguing historical figures I've seen on film, and I think Peter O'Toole does a great job portraying him. I also like the chemistry and the dynamic between Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif's characters in this movie. The way their relationship changes and develops throughout this movie was extremely compelling.The transfer of this movie was also incredible. This movie came out nearly 60 years ago, yet a lot of this movie feels like it could've be shot today. The technology we have to scan and restore films makes a lot of these older movies look more breathtaking than anything that comes out today.",Null,1,2,28 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Another Great Movie from Marvel
","This movie was funny, exciting, epic, and emotional. Marvel rewards the fans who have been watching every marvel movie for the past decade with an epic superhero movie that will never be duplicated. By far the best aspect of this film is the interactions between the characters, which were brilliantly written and well acted. Is this movie perfect? No. Of course this movie has some trouble combining all the characters together while attempting to move the plot forward, but everything comes together perfectly with the most emotional and gut wrenching ending to any superhero movie I've every seen.",8,0,0,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood - Revisited
","When I first watched this movie, my biggest problem with it was that the plot was meandering, but watching it a second time with the plot structure in mind, I had a lot more fun with it. The main thing I like about this movie is the atmosphere. Tarantino truly transports you back to 1960's Hollywood and its a world that I couldn't get enough of while watching it. Also, Dicaprio and Pitt put on great performances and their chemistry with each other is breathtaking. It took me a re-watch, but I really like this movie.",8,1,3,11 December 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," I'm Glad I Gave It a Second Look
","I watched this movie years ago, and I didn't like it. I think the reason I didn't like it was because I was maybe a little too cynical back then, so I decided to re-watch this 5 years later and I was completely charmed by this movie all the way through. Ben Stiller gives a very good performance, I loved the chemistry between him and Kristen Wiig, and the cinematography and locations were absolutely gorgeous.I also liked the message of this movie. It's about living in the moment and seeing the beauty of the world if you're brave enough to open your eyes to it. Movies like this teach me that its okay to like and open your heart to something that's sentimental. Overall, this is a very underrated movie",8,3,5,10 November 2018
1917," A True Cinematic Achievement
","1917 is one of the most immersive movies that I've ever watched. I felt like I was with the lead character every step of the the way, and it's all due to the incredible amount of effort from everybody involved in this film. The direction, cinematography, score, script, lead actors, extras, visual effects, locations, stunts, ect. are all perfect. Also, this movie isn't just a technical achievement; it has surprising amount of emotion and heart injected into it as well. 1917 is the type of film that we just don't get that often, and it's a cinematic achievement.",10,1,3,27 March 2020
Silence," An Interesting but Drawn Out and One-sided Film
","I think this movie has a lot of good things about it. The cinematography was incredible and the performances were good as well. The locations were also great to look at. You can tell Scorsese was extremely passionate about this film, and you can also tell that he tried to tell this story as raw as he possibly could. With that being said, my problem with the film is that it seems too one-sided. The Japanese are treated as one-dimensional villains, and the movie doesn't go into enough detail about why the Japanese didn't want the missionaries in their country or why the missionaries may be wrong. Another problem I had with this movie is that it is too long and a little cold. The movie was drawn out definitely by the end, and I really didn't feel any emotion by the end. This movie took Scorsese over 20 years to bring to the screen, but honestly, it's one of the weaker films in his filmography.",6,1,2,3 December 2017
Midsommar," Florence Pugh Gives a Truly Incredible Peformance
","I haven't seen Hereditary yet, but judging from Ari Aster's short films, I knew I was in for something weird and weird is what i got. Midsommar is a strange and twisted film about grief, the hardships of being in a relationship, and how cults prey on the vulnerable. This movie has incredible cinematography, and the way it builds up and goes absolutely bonkers at the end was fun to watch, but the main standout of this film is Florence Pugh. She gives a very raw performance and perfectly portrays the grief of her character.",8,6,8,11 October 2019
The King," This is an Incredible Historical Epic!
","This movie hasn't been on my radar, and I wasn't really excited to watch it, but I decided to give it a chance and after watching it, all I can say is wow. I didn't expect this movie to be so epic and brilliantly crafted. This movie is a powerful and brutal look into the consequences of power, and it has brilliant performances from Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, and Robert Pattinson. It also has breathtaking cinematography that incorporates natural lighting and strikingly epic shots. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year!",8,5,9,9 November 2019
American Made," A Fast and Energetic Spin on a Familiar Story
","American Made is a fast and energetic rise to power/fall from grace movie made in the same vein as Wolf of Wall Street and War Dogs. What sets this movie apart from those is an extremely charming performance from Tom Cruise. He gives his best performance in years, portraying a morally ambiguous yet charming character. Doug Limon's direction is also good. He crafted an energetic movie that manages to balance his kinetic style with an interesting story. If you've seen Wolf of Wall Street, War Dogs, or Goodfellas, you will probably know almost every beat of this story, but Tom Cruise's performance helps this movie stand on its own.",8,2,7,29 September 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," A Mostly Well Made and Tense Thriller With One Huge Flaw
","This was a well made thriller from Katheryn Bigelow who is one of the best directors in Hollywood. For some reason, this movie slipped through the cracks, and I totally forgot to watch it, but I finally put it on and I mostly enjoyed it. It was very tense, and the last 20 minutes were thrilling and brilliantly directed.With that being said, my main problem with this movie is how it frames the plot. The real life story of the hunting and killing of Laden is a huge story with a lot of moving pieces, but this movie decides to put the entire weight of the story on one character call Maya. Framing the plot this way wouldn't be a problem if Maya wasn't such an empty character. Where is she from? Does she has any family? What motivates her? What emotional effect does these events have on her? What's the stakes for her? None of these questions are answered, which makes her an extremely uninteresting main character. Katheryn Bigelow centers this entire movie around one character, but she absolutely fails to explore that character anywhere beyond a surface level. This movie is good for what it is, but it just doesn't have the impact it was going for.",7,4,6,4 November 2018
Mudbound," A Step in the Right Direction for Netflix
","I admit that I'm extremely tough on Netflix when it comes to film. They release brilliant television, but their film output is definitely lacking as far as quality, but I'm glad to say that Mudbound is a great drama. It was well directed, well shot, and it had a pretty good score to go along with it. This movie also has an ensemble cast filled with great performances especially from Jason Mitchell. My only problem with this movie is that it takes a little too long to take off and become interesting, but the movie makes it up by ending on a powerful note. This is definitely the best movie Netflix has released since Beasts of no Nation.",7,6,15,18 November 2017
Joker," Hate it or Love It, This Movie is an Instant Classic
","The best part of this movie is Juaquin Pheonix's performance. He was born to play this role and he absolutely delivers by giving one of the most disturbing and unsettling performances of all time. This movie also has brilliant cinematography, and it looked absolutely gorgeous in IMAX. Todd Phillips managed to give us a new Taxi Driver for our time. It's disturbing, violent, offensive, and shocking, but it forces you to open your eyes and consume every second of it just like Taxi Driver made us do in 1976.",10,4,8,4 October 2019
Marriage Story," An Emotional Film About Complicated People
","First, the performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are absolutely brilliant. They perfectly capture how people feel when they're going through a divorce, which is one of toughest things anyone could go through. You can see the pain in Driver and Johansson's eyes, and when that pain comes to the surface, their performances take your breath away.Second, Noah Baumbach did a brilliant job directing this. What makes the direction so brilliant is how restrained it is. There's a lot of scenes where the characters are just talking and expressing their emotions, and this movie allows them to do that in the most natural way possible.Third, the main thing I liked about this movie is that it doesn't shy away from how complicated the characters are. This movie doesn't take sides and it shows the strengths and flaws with both characters. It's a story about how relationships can bring out the best in us but also the worst as well.",9,1,3,8 December 2019
Mother!," Not for Everybody
","Mother! is a well-made movie, but it will upset a lot of people. Personally, I didn't have much of problem with this movie, but I still don't know what I really think about it. There's a lot to like about this movie from its cinematography to Jennifer Lawrence's great performance, but this movie is still hard to digest. It's a weird movie that mixes horror and tension with weird humor and shock value. This is definitely a movie I have to watch again.",8,3,10,15 September 2017
Creed II," A Surprising, Emotional, and Powerful Sequal
","Going into this movie, I was scared because I thought the first Creed was a nice ending to the series, and I was scared that this movie would ruin it. With that being said, I'm happy to say that this is a very good squeal that matches and even surpasses its predecessor in some ways.The main thing that I liked about this movie were the personal scenes. The fight scenes and the training montages are good, but the standout moments are the ones between Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson, and the moments where we further explore each and every character. When it comes to the fight scenes and overall excitement, the first Creed has this movie beat, but when it comes to the personal moments and the emotional impact, this movie is the champion.",8,2,7,22 November 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Extremely Well Made and Surprisingly Emotional
","Jojo Rabbit is a very well made movie with incredible performances from Scarlett Johansson and Roman Griffin Davis. It also have great cinematography and an enthralling story. The biggest criticism that people have with this movie is its tone, and while I agree that the movie can be annoyingly quirky at times, it's also emotional and heartfelt. Overall, this is a great movie.",8,0,0,22 February 2020
The Thin Red Line," One Word...Stunning
","On a purely visual level,without accounting for characters or plot, this is one of the best movies I've seen. This movie's cinematography forces the viewer to view humanity's destructive behavior against the backdrop of the stunning beauty of nature. I can't stress enough how much the cinematography in this movie affected me.Beyond the cinematography, I don't know what to make of this film. It's unlike any war movie I've ever seen. This movie has a good amount of action and tense scenes, but mixed with those scenes are characters giving poetic voice overs. To put it simply, this is a very disorienting film filled with many characters giving poetic and philosophical monologues, and it is probably the first war movie I've seen that is more concerned with the intellectual and philosophical side of war instead of the brutal spectacle. I'm not going to give this movie a score because I need to re watch it to better understand how I feel about it.",Null,3,6,17 October 2018
Annihilation," A Weird and Beautiful Sci-Fi Film
","I don't know what to make of this movie other than the fact that it's beautiful, weird, and creepy. This movie has some downright horrifying scenes, and it also has moments that will leave you scratching your head. With that being said, this movie has an incredible beauty to it from its visuals to its memorizing ending. I don't know what else to say about this film other than the fact that I need to re watch it to fully get an opinion about it.",8,0,3,8 September 2018
Braveheart," An Epic and Emotional Film
","I watched Outlaw King yesterday, and my main problem with it was that it lacked scale and it wasn't emotional enough, so I decided to watch Braveheart and it definitely delivered. Mel Gibson gives a very good performance playing a character that's impossible for the audience not to root for. The ending of the movie is incredibly emotional, and the cinematography was also very good. Where this movie shows its brilliance though is with the battle scenes. The battles in this movie are immense, brutal, exciting, and gut-wrenching. The large scale battles are definitely where Mel Gibson shows his brilliance as a director.",Null,2,5,19 November 2018
