Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing
","When I read the review of The Phantom Menace in TIME Magazine, and how it was a letdown, I didn't take it seriously.  But here I am, saying the same thing, The Phantom Menace was a letdown.  Let me say the good part.  The special effects, sound effects, and art direction was wonderful.  Many scenes were awe-inspiring, and breathtaking.  Plus, they were years ahead of anything ever done before.  I'm a sucker for visuals.  Give me great visuals & I'll like the film.  But they can't alone make me love it.  The story and characters have to be original and interesting, and that's where The Phantom Menace falls flat. Jar Jar Binks is a immensely annoying character, made merely for the kids to enjoy.  The characters aren't interesting at all.  I didn't really care for them, or what happened to them.  The story is weak too.  While the beginning and end of the movie are entertaining, the 30 minutes in between are incredibly boring.  It's 30 minutes of talking and talking and talking, saying basically the same thing over and over and over.  The acting isn't superb either.  Liam Nesson does the best job of all the actors, and his job is only a little on the good side. But the film, when there was action, performed it with class. That's what I enjoyed about it.  It was fun during those parts. Don't get me wrong: It was a GOOD film.  NOT GREAT.  NOT SPECIAL.  The expectations for The Phantom Menace were too high, and Lucas didn't deliver.  Hopefully, he will deliver next time with Episode 2.",7,0,1,15 May 1999
