Raiders of the Lost Ark," Always feel like Jones
","Who can ask for anything more? A pure joy, movie magic at his best, a wonderful feeling of romance and adventure... The superb music score by Maestro John Williams, the epic scope of the search for the Ark of the Covenant, the James-Bondesque twists of the plot, the iconic fedora & whip stuff... Absolute perfection to me! I know it's no a perfect movie at all. I know it has his holes. But, anyway, Raiders has all I can ask for a movie: suspension of belief, magic, a travel to another era, unbelievable but inevitable! I've watched this movie so many times from 1981 (and I can't say the number) that I think I can speak the lines... But can't stop re-viewing it again and again... Maybe one or two times per year. And it is always a delightful experience. Makes me feel happily exhausted! Now, I am the proud father of 4 children and it's my pleasure to share the adventures of Doctor Jones with my family... Last year I was able to bring them to the movie theater for the first day of Indy IV... Oh, boy, what a moment... When my sons looked the shadow of Indiana Jones and the seven first notes of his music sounded... Everybody cheered! Adventure begins again! We got chills, goose bumps!What a moving experience for me to be back to 1981 and feeling this AGAIN with my sons! Thank you, Mr Spielberg and Mr. Lucas, for all this stuff of dreams... And thank you for make me feel always like Indiana Jones...Well... Also as Henry Jones Sr... Why? Because outside of the theater, I told to my eldest son: 'Beware, Junior: we are pilgrims in an unholy land!'",10,0,1,22 March 2009
