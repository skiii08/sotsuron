Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fun movie but jar jar binks is a annoying flaw
","Face it once the hype died down, I finally saw the phantom menace as what it meant to be a fun popcorn science fiction fantasy blockbuster but the bad news is the character of jar jar binks is a serious mistAke to being the comic relief. He's like a 5 year old kid who wants candy. Even little anakin is wise and maturing. The phantom menace gets going at the pod race scene and when darth maul comes into play. Phantom menace may not have the best acting like the original Star Wars trilogy but it is a fun trip into the distant past.",8,1,2,7 April 2020
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Toontown
","Who framed Roger rabbit is Robert zemeckis's third best feature. His first is back to the future. His second is Forrest Gump but his third blends comedy, cartoon animation and live action and 3D morphs into a wild, wacky, looney and highly entertaining motion picture and the title character is a Rufus white and red striped rabbit named roger who do anything to get into mischief. Who framed Roger rabbit really is an enthusiastic look at looney tunes characters and Disney cartoon characters and even some new ones. Zemeckis has really pushed the technology of special effects in this film.",9,0,0,13 April 2020

As Good as It Gets," Jack Nicholson's best role
","I love the character of Melvin. He's an author, a piano player, has obsessive compulsive disorder, meets a waitresss, loves music and is a man to just have a good time with. He's a little crazy and mad at first, but he realizes that there's more to life than just sitting in his apartment. Romance and love is as good as it gets. This movie was funny, abstract and just the right adult movie. It's perfect.",10,1,1,28 March 2020

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Nicely done, and highly expressive acting from Will Farrell, Rachel mcadams, graham norton.
",Eurovision Song Contest: the story of fire saga is a stylish competition song contest movie. We have not seen a movie where Will Farrell and Rachel mcadams go to Iceland and actually perform there highlight of there livedand win the contest at a fair fiesta. This movie frame by frame is absolutely your big ticket movie for the weekend of June 26th-June 28th. A lot of actors and actresses are playing themselves in this movie. The expressionism on the actors and actresses faces are happy and that's all that matters. This is the first great comedy of the 2020s. It finds justice for all and equality disabled or not. Will Farrell never gives up as Lars erickberg. This movie is Gloria for club dancing,10,1,7,27 June 2020
Batman Returns," An eventful film for the month of june

This movie maybe have a divided fan base but it's also multi-layered comic book popcorn movie, well acted and well made by the famous Tim burton. Batman returns once again like the first is an eventual, episodic blockbuster",10,1,1,23 June 2020
The Aviator," Interesting biopic
","The aviator is an exciting period drama on the early years of Howard Hughes. Yes this movie lost the Oscar to million dollar baby but this is Martin Scorsese's triumph return after a misfire film gangs of New York. DiCaprio is entertaining as the billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes. Cate blanchett is Oscar worthy as the beloved actress Katherine Hepburn. Alan Alda is good as the senator. Alec Baldwin is escapist as Juan Tripp. Kate backinsale is gorgeously handsome as Eva gardener. The scenes between Katherine Hepburn and Howard Hughes provide good chemistry but there's so much more to Hughes life this movie could've gone on for another hour. The aviator is determined about Howard's ambition to the aviation industry and the film industry which includes his relationship with Hepburn and his contribution war and sexism films like hells angels, Scarface and the outlaw. It also shows some of his obsessive behaviors with women and airplanes and his personal endeavors. The supporting cast is fun and Howard shores score is a blending epic. Aviator works as a entertaining biopic that goes on for a soaring three hours",8,0,0,6 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A cult classic of high fantasy. in fact the highest fantasy around best movie ever
","Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the Ring is easily the best movie and best adaption I've ever seen for a first run movie. This movie got me hooked into fantasy epics. Tolkien's work is bold. The truth of it is this movie has style, friendship, courage, beauty, rich in detail, combines old-fashioned style of filmmaking. It's an amateur film that sets the bar. There's love, action, battle scenes, the music by howard shore is great. I could watch this one and suspend my disbelief. The quest begins in this movie. The perilious journey continues and the cinematography by Andrew lesnie captures the dark side and the bright side of Arda. It's always treat to go back to Middle Earth and feel the presence of Aragorn, Legolas, Denethor, Galdariel, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, King Theodon, Gimli and Aragorn. It's the best movie of the 21st century. I'm re-reading the book now snd I do believe and I think that lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring id amazing and incredible.",10,0,0,4 October 2016
Event Horizon," Holy Smokers
","Event Horizon is one of the most underrated sci-fi flicks. It's scary, fast paced, futuristic and horrific. Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors, and here he plays Dr. Weir and Lawrence Fishbourne is perfectly cast here-pre-Matrix. The movie takes place in the year 2047 on a space station where the characters where magnetic boots, use high tech space technology. At an 1 hour and 36 minutes, this was a surprise summer of 1997 flick. It's short, interesting for sci-fi fans and totally mind blowing.",10,7,8,29 March 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Make them laugh

Avatar," Effects are good, story is nonsense
","Avatar has really good special effects and music but the characters and story is kind of like a puppet show of fern gully, the last rainforest or dances with wolves for science fiction. This is where James Cameron has gone haywire with his screenplay. I wanted this movie to be good but compared to titanic, the abyss, the terminator movies and true lies this is movie eye candy compared to movie magic.",5,1,2,15 April 2020
La La Land," La la as well good
","Ryan gosling and Emma stone worked together on crazy, stupid, love but that was five six years ago. Here they dazzle the silver screen with energy and charisma as Mia and Sebastian in the new film musical la la land. This movie from stArt to finish is one of the most entertaining escapist films of 2016. The actress Mia and the jazz pianist Sebastian are characters thAt we could try to love. One of my favorite scenes is when Mia and Sebastian dive into dancing through the halls of the Griffith observatory. Sebastian wants to get a jazz club going. Mia wants to quit the coffee shop and write plays. The ending is a dream sequence that's very well connected with the way they feel about each other. La la land is a homage to all great movie musicals of hollywoods past but Damien chazelle chooses jazz as his theme. I give la land A 10 out of 10",10,4,10,19 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the prequel trilogy
","Revenge of the sith is one of the best movies of all time period. Where episode I and episode Ii had set up story, romance and silly stuff, episode 3 feels like a Star Wars film and a damn good one.",10,0,0,9 April 2020
The Lion King," The lion king-animated version roars
","The lion king represented a slew of blockbusters for Disney studios back in the 1990s. A lot people like this beloved 2d animated classic. The songs are so strong that they even have a sing along for this movie. I miss Alan manken and Howard ashman. They were good songwriters. The story is about a lion cub named simba played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas (young simba) and Matthew Broderick(grown up simba) who one day will rule his lands but in order to do he must respect, obey and be responsible to his father Mufasa. His uncle scar voiced by Jeremy irons is a wrongful and evilly valiant lion. Pumba and tamone are the perfect comic relief for a Disney film. There come up with two words Hakuna Matata which means no worries. Simba gets introduced to them when he runs away from home and his father dies after a wild animal stampede. Simbas love interest is nala. Nala is a young female lion. This movie has some intense scenes that are sometimes scary for the little ones. The movie appeals to the boys and girls that are ages 8 and up. All in all the lion king is superbly entertaining film and is brilliantly filled with breathtaking animation",10,0,0,13 April 2020
Speed," Pop Quiz Hotshot!
","I have not revisited Speed since the late 90's probably when I graduated high school at 18. Back then ultra action movies were in. Con-Air, Executive Decision, Die Hard 3, Daylight, to name a few but Speed was one for the film books. It is a cat and mouse chase about a Los Angeles cop named Jack Traven and a former LAPD cop turned una-bomber named Howard Payne. Then, there's Sandra Bullock in her first big screen role in an action film previous to playing a cop of the future in Demolition Man playing Annie. Howard Payne puts a bomb inside a watch on the bottom of a public bus going northbound into Metro L.A. He scares all the local people going on a bus to work. Jack Traven jumps the bus to inform the passengers that the he's going to disabled the bomb.Speed is ultimate action movie of the 1990s. Just like Bullitt was in the 60's and the French Connection was in the 70's. It's a high speed octane action thriller filled with smart action sequences, high speed thrills, suspenseful novelty movie cliches. The supporting actors Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels are good. The music by Mark Macina and the direction by Jan De Bont is thrilling, white knuckle roller coaster ride.If Jurassic Park was the movie of the summer of 1993, than Speed was the special effects picture of 1994. It's a great movie and I never want it to end",9,0,0,28 March 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A rare third chapter
","It is rare to find good sequels these days except for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and this. Back in 1989 and after the temple of Doom you'd think Indiana Jones would weaken the audience but his adventure this time in search of the Holy Grail, his dad and being captured by the Nazis. Harrison Ford once again plays the famed archaeologist. The unpredecent Sean Connery plays Henry Jones and the lovely Allison Doody plays Dr. Elsa Schiender The chases, and setpieces are enormously on a large scale, the action kicks in right from the start to finish. It is stunning to watch this movie franchise go and it is very memorable to people who grew up watching the series in the 1980s I can't wait for the fourth part. Indiana Jones blew me away",10,0,0,28 March 2020
The Simpsons Movie," Highly popular, overrated film but something about the Simpsons makes me want to be in restraints
","This movie is rip roaring, hateful, apologetic, second rate, barbarically humorous, entertaining, childlike, brainless, genius, highly popular, dysfunctional, commercially demented, seriously goofy, lampooning, and most of all over the top. Simpson's is overrated but fun",7,0,0,25 June 2020
