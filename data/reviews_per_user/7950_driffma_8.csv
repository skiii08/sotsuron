The Ring," At least I saw it at the cheap second run place.
","Movie Review for The Ring By MaxDRoger Ebert said of the movie Pearl Harbor, that is was 'a two hour movie crammed into three.' I mention that only because Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, performs a trick of time manipulation similar in scope and power. He manages to make two hours seem like four. Essentially he has crafted a test of human mental endurance: How long can a mind be subjected to the insanely boring?The Ring tells the tail of a cursed videotape that kills who ever watches it precisely seven days post viewing. Whoever watches the tape gets a phone call right after the tape ends. A whispery voice, says 'Seven days.' (It is interesting that every one who gets this call knows that it means they have only seven days to live. No one ever thinks to ask, 'Seven Days what? Who is this?). Our heroes are a divorced single-mother of a withdrawnchild-professional-journalist-torn between her career and motherhood-type, a withdrawn child who draws weird pictures and is mildly psychic, and the slacker-video expert ex-husband. The journalist is put on the case by a grieving sister confused by the mysterious circumstances of her daughter's death. 'You ask questions its what you do.' Says the grieving sister to the journalist. Great. From there on we know that at the very least the journalist and the withdrawn boy-who draws eerie premonitory pictures will see the tape. That much does not shock us. What is shocking is the fact that no one takes the news, 'seven days', too hard. We might expect this from the journalist, she is used to working with deadlines, but what about the kid? Or how about the slacker ex-husband? In fact no one really gets too worked up about it at all.The Ring begins much the same way Scream, a superior movie to be sure, did, with one minor variation. Instead of one young teenage girl alone in a big house out in the middle of nowhere, there are two. Actually there are other variations in this scene. For instance, Verbinski opted to substitute snappy dialogue with the utterly banal. He also managed to remove any tension or malice from the opening scene or any scene. We, the audience, are never scared, we are never made to jump, and we never, ever care.What is on the cursed tape? It is supposed be like someone's nightmare. However it is full of images that are not as menacing, disturbing or scary as they could be. I will not bore you with the details I wish the film had not bored me with them. Actually I will bore you with one detail. Embedded in the images are the all clues an enterprising journalist with a mildly psychic son, and a video expert ex-husband need to unravel the motives, and origin of the malevolent force behind the tape. The son however is no help at all. While he is obviously in contact with the malevolent force, and could provide some valuable information to the other heroes, he is a cliché.He is the disturbed boy who voices his deeper revelations through cryptic drawings. This means that to the rest of the cast he will only speak in sentence fragments, nods and grunts while trying hard to look mysterious and somewhat beyond.The mistake Gore Verbinski makes, well the most important one anyway, was to think he had a film more important than he really did. At the heart of this film is a Friday night teen horror flick. He misses this and instead tries to make a film that is deeper, and more mysterious. He cannot do this because he is, after all, working the script he was given. The result is a ponderous film, that tries to beat into you, with clichéd shot after clichéd shot (the film uses every cinematic convention in the horror filmmaker's arsenal), that it is a film with depth and originality. On top of that he steals from truly engaging suspense/horror films: Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Scream, The Sixth Sense. I am sure I am missing others, but I hope you will not fault me their omission. After all, about 20 minutes before the film was to roll the blessed credits, I had pulled out my cell phone and began playing brick attack.",1,3,9,16 February 2003
We Were Soldiers," A really good, but not quite great film about the vietnam conflict
","We were soldiers once....and young.  That is the title of the book from which this well made film was adapted. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot are excellent, as is the whole cast, and the battle is intense, horrifying and appropriately unpleasant (war after all isn't fun).  I can not however give it a 10. The handling, or maybe mishandling of the women at home makes me hesitant.  There seems a falsness to their scenes for the most part.  Not all of it, but most of the women and their interactions with one another all seem forced. It is no fault of the actresses, who seem to take the material they have been given just about as far as it can go.  Like I said though, not all of the women's scenes feel strained (watch closely the second letter delivery which is nicely acted and remarkably touching).The movie does not let one view the action at too great a distance. This is no John Wayne war movie, all heroics and patriotism without much reflection on the conflict being portrayed.  This movie isn't about flagwaving, which is shocking considering Randall Wallace, the films writer and director, also wrote the worthless and pathetic Pearl Harbor. There is however alot to be said for good direction.  And Wallace here demonstrates some more discretion with cheesy manipulative tactics than the director of Pearl Harbor demonstrated. It is there, mostly in some questionable shot composition, but still present. Note to all future film-makers making war pictures, placing key actors in scenes with conspicuously placed U.S. flaggs almost always seems contrived. What is really interesting about this vietnam war film is that it almost completely sidesteps politics.  We see that politics are going to play a role in landing Lt. Col. Moore (the Gibson character)and his men in a really tight spot. Moore knows this is going to cost lives, maybe even his own but he is a soldier, he will do his best to achieve his objective and reduce the loss of life of his men.  Also in leaving the politics out of it and also showing both sides of fight we realize, as we watch, that both sides really aren't that different, that ultimately the men on either side are fighting for the same reason. The viewer also notices that all of the combatants, except for Gibson and Elliot, are young, barely one over thirty.  And I think for americans that is such a key difference from WWII and the Vietnam conflict.  Young, young men went to fight in Vietnam.  It is a fact that even the main character, Moore, finds hard to get over.  'I look at the men and all I see are my boys.' The film can't dwell on the disillusionment that grew as the conflict lengthened, however it shows how the seeds were planted. The movie's thesis is that a soldier doesn't fight for country, for ideas, for abstracts, but that the soldier fights for the man next to them, for thier platoon, their family. It is the same message as that in Black Hawk Down, and I think the same message that you might find the film Platoon.  I don't know if that is completely true but movies like Black Hawk and We were soldiers certainly make one understand why that motivation is so integral to the soldier.",9,1,1,2 March 2002
Predator," Good Work Mac!
","'You know bro' whoever did this to you is gonna' comeback, and when he does I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him. I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him.'If you find yourself struggling to find a good sci-fi action pick this weekend on your weekly trip to Dave's Video or wherever the hell it is you rent your movies from, allow me to make a suggestion. Why don't you try renting an Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 classic, Predator. I mean you cannot go wrong with that.This is a movie I watch maybe once or twice a year. It has a few signature '80s action movie touches. There are the one-liners, all pretty good and every body seems to shoot from the hip. Also there seems to be a lot posing oil handy, which is a good thing I suppose as our team of skilled commandos just can't seem to keep their shirts on. Director John McTiernan wanted us to know, to have absolutely no doubt, that our heroes were absolutely, 100% badass. Well trust you me, we get the bloody picture. The films '80isms are not excessive though, and on the whole a little bit charming.Predator is a sci-fi flick that starts out as if it were going to be nothing more than a standard action film. (I must admit there is a neat little scene in the beginning that lets you know that it won't be) It begins with the arrival of a crack rescue team at a tropical U.S. military installation in dark bodied Hueys. The team is lead by a man we will know only as Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenenegger). The arrival of the rescue team is truly great film-making. The scene essentially establishes the intrinsic toughness of our heroes and their cohesiveness as a team of shooters. They arrive on the island and man they walk like the own it. They don't talk. They move like a highly coordinated unit, speech is unnecessary for men such as these, they know what they are supposed to do, they almost know each others thoughts. These guys have been together for years. And we the viewer understand all of this from just few quite scenes and remarkably good acting. It's all in the blocking of the shots and the carriage of the actors and it is all perfect.The teams mission: save three U.S. diplomats whose chopper has been shot down. Dutch thinks to ask why this Cabinet Minister's chopper was traveling on the wrong side of the border. 'They got off course.' Says Gen Phillips. The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers). He is an old friend of Dutch's but our hero is a bit uneasy about having his authority pulled out from under him. Dutch even delivers the most famous of 80's action hero lines, well a variation of it anyway. The line typically goes something like this, 'I always work alone.' In Predator the line is, 'My team works alone.'This is all standard action movie stuff. Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before. What is great about this stuff though is how well done it is. The movie was filmed some where in South America, and it looks like they are moving through a real jungle. This is jungle with a capital J. They are not on a soundstage and that adds a lot to the movie. It is also during this material that we see that there may be more in store for them than just guerrillas. I won't say what they find, but it is unsettling. The other thing that is established during this material is the way the team is really one unit. Everyone is important. During the rescue operation for instance, while we see them dismantling their opposition the camera doesn't just follow Arnold around, but it kind of keeps a running tab on all members of the team. My only real problem with these scenes is the way everyone is always shooting from their hips all the time. I mean it is okay for Blain (Jesse Ventura) he is carrying a big gatling gun, but everyone else? Come on! Just a minor complaint.The rescue doesn't go as planned, and instead of affecting the rescue (the 'diplomats' are dead), they pick up a prisoner, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), and have to hike twelve miles to their extraction point. It is at this point that things begin to go terribly wrong for our heroes. The team's skill at killing has attracted the attention of different kind of hunter. And one by one he begins to pick them off, until finally there is just the Predator, and Dutch. Moreover it is a Dutch with out many of his modern weapons. He has his knife, a couple of rounds from is grenade launcher, but no launcher, and his wits. This is classic stuff.The showdown between the Predator and Dutch is quite a pay off. It is a tense game of cat and mouse, with the roles of hunter and hunted changing more than once. Predator is maybe not a great action-sci-fi movie, but it certainly is one of the most fun. Rent it and enjoy.",9,0,0,28 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor the music video by Michael Bay
","It is fashionable to say, when critiqueing this movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor is great, but the rest of the movie is just awful.  I want to state plainly and for what ever record there maybe that it is not the case. In fact it is all awful, every excruciatingly painful minute. I will briefly only comment on the attack as other awful aspects have been covered by other reviewers (Roger Ebert's wonderful line, 'Pearl Harbor is a two hour movie crammed into three.' should give one an idea about the rest of the film). In fact I will talk only about one scene in the battle.  It is designed (this ugly scene) to drive us to tears, but all it should do is offend, offend and offend!  The scene depicts several sailors treading water (we are looking at them from under wonderfully tinted soft sea green), the sailors are fighting valiantly to stay afloat. Behind them under the water, is an American flagg.  And underneath the entire scene is one of the most annoying soundtracks ever created. In less than 5 seconds director Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckhimer have taken one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and turned it into a music video.  And a boring, predictible, and unispired one at that.",1,1,2,7 January 2002
I Am Legend," Falls apart in the final act
","I am Legend Review By MaxDThere are only two types of movie reviews that lend themselves to being easily written. Those types are either the very good, or the very bad. I'm not sure if that is an axiomatic but it really ought to be. Writers or readers of movie reviews will either already know this or have deeply suspected it. Harder to write are films that exist somewhere in the middle of that distribution of quality, the almost good or the almost bad. Quite unmysteriously the worse the film the easier the review. I am Legend is closer to good than bad. In fact until an unfortunate, unexpected, and sadly unjustified turn of narrative in the final act I had been about to add it to my list of good science fiction movies of which there has always been a paucity. I am Legend differs markedly from other screen versions of Richard Matheson's story but manages to be just as flawed as those other treatments (Vincent Price's equally passable Last man on Earth and Charlton Heston's dreck Omega Man). That the film has succeeded is more a testament to what is good about it rather than what is not. And its first two acts are engaging. In fact the first two thirds are a testament to the great actor that is the heart of the film. The dog that pals around with him is quite a capable thespian too. It is these two leads that make the film watchable, emotionally moving, and tense. It is the film's final act which turns the once magnificent edifice into a shaky façade that crumbles under the weight of questions any thoughtful viewer will inevitably be forced to ask. Before that terrible turn the film is worth watching for everything that it does right. I am Legend tells the story of the end of the world from the perspective of Lt Col. Dr. Robert Neville, military virologist who even after the end has come and gone continues to work on the cure for what ails it. A disease, the unintentional by product of a miracle drug, has decimated humanity. The pathology of the disease is some strange cross between zombiesm and vampirism. Affected humans seem much less bright and have a zombie's inelegant fashion sense (one may wonder that any clothing would last three years with the kind of wear these creatures put on it) but they like to eat more than brains and become positively beastly at the smell of blood. They also sunburn easily. This is all fine and good. It is a monster movie after all, and done quite well. Where the film really succeeds though is in its vision of a world without us. What would happen if humanity were to suddenly vanish? It is a question the film answers in its stark vistas of an empty Manhattan. Empty streets dominate a city that is rather rapidly being reclaimed by forests and marshes (the island was itself home to numerous rivers and that history still bedevils the city that now stands on the island). White-tail deer roam the car choked streets, birds other than House Sparrow's and Rock Doves flit and sing. It isn't a wasteland unless you are the only human survivor left in the city, and, gregarious primate that you are, crave human contact and interaction. This is all terribly compelling. It is an exercise in good choices. Will Smith's portrayal of one human's descent into the madness of loneliness is wonderful. Neville's experience is hard to describe as miserable, but it seems deeply unfulfilling at the same time. Were it not for the dog and Neville's deer hunts it would be a decidedly joyless exercise in survival. Neville talks to mannequins at a video store that he has obviously arranged, and he seems genuinely to have forgotten this fact. Were they people he once knew? It is a question that is never answered, nor is any answer needed. (Some morons in front of me in theater thought this was the comic relief and not an utterly sad statement on the man's mental state.) There are scenes in which Smith essays terror better than any actor I've seen in years, perhaps ever. His frustration at being unable to find a cure is seen clearly as an extension of his loneliness. Underneath all this is the important work of composer James Newton Howard who is fast becoming my favorite screen composer. A lesser composer would have scored everything. Howard wisely held back. Most of the film lacks a score. It was an excellent choice. It adds to the stark experience of Neville's life. Music is often used to heighten a viewer's emotion. What is often forgotten is that music also consists of the silence between the notes. Someone, I can't remember who, has said this silence it the most important part of all great music. Howard has learned this lesson well. The film doesn't begin to fall apart until its similarity to a better film, Signs becomes utterly apparent. It is the final act and involves two other people. It isn't that is poorly acted. It isn't that the action is un-engaging. On both counts it's really quite good. But there is, I think, an unjustified turn in the narrative. I won't reveal what that is. I'm no spoiler. I will ask a couple of questions though. Why does the author of the universe tend to speak in such obscure language? Why all the codes and easily missed clues? Why do so many people have to die for the completion of said being's designs and games? It seems inelegant and inefficient not to mention capricious, perhaps malicious and certainly stupid. Why didn't the writer of this script pay more attention to Neville's math in the key argument?",7,1,2,15 January 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Jesus Christ! What total crap.
","I must say the sequel to the Matrix is one of the worst movies I have seen this year.  The first film left this series absolutely no where to go. The first film ends with Neo discovering his Superman-like abilities.  So unless the writing is very creative and villians as badass as the hero, you will have a boring ass movie.  There is no tension in any action scene involving Neo.  He is indestructable, unphaseable and over all emotionally uninteresting.  Why do any of the Matrix programs even bother to fight him? The uninteresting little dramas involving Neo aside, the film is still crap because there is nothing interesting to say or do. The movie tries to disguise the fact that it has nothing to do with a lot of action. I mean a lot of action.  Did I mention there is a lot of action in this movie.  Well there is so much action in M2 that it makes the film boring.  Can you imagine that?  Much of the action is pointless as are many of the f/x shots.  It is really quite shocking that the Wachoski bros, who did so well in the first matrix, missed the boat so badly.  They have forgotten if they ever knew, that fight scenes and special effects are only important if they move the story along, if they actually add to the story. In M2 they just act as filler, disguising the fact there is really nothing at all to the Matrix.  What a disappointment.",4,0,0,22 May 2003
Identity," It lost me in the last act
","Identity begins with the stranding of ten people at an out of the way motel on a dark and stormy night.  The phones at the motel are out and the roads are washed out. The guests at this motel are, a family on vacation, a limo driver and his famous actress charge, a prostitute leaving Las Vegas, a couple just married, a federal marshal with a convicted serial killer in tow, and the clerk at the desk.  Did I mention that it is a dark and stormy night.  Well Constant Reader, you probably already realize that this is a sure prescription for disaster.  Soon after the guests are settled in, they start getting killed off, one, by one. 	The first hour of this movie follows the formula adopted by many a slasher/mystery.  We suspect along with the characters that one of the stranded guests is committing the murders.  We have two investigators on this case, the limo driver Ed (John Cusack) and the Federal Marshall Rhodes (Ray Liotta).  Considerable tension mounts among the guests as they all begin to suspect each other.  And while it is all stuff we have seen before it is entirely compelling because it is so well done.  The fodder in most thrillers is typically uninteresting and when the killer does visit them we care not a whit.  In this film though all of the characters are extremely well drawn.  This is essential as this film basically starts out as an exercise in genre filmmaking.  These characters are intelligently written, they don't seem typical, in any way of the mystery/thriller genre.  We get a sense of the lives they have lived before they all come together in an out of the way motel in a driving storm.   While we don't see or hear much about those lives we get a hint of what they have been like before the moment we meet them in the film.	I liked everything about this first hour and twenty minutes or so. No let me make a stronger statement.  I loved the first hour and twenty minutes of this movie.  I especially liked the limo driver Ed.  John Cusack's limo driver is something out of a 1940's hard-boiled crime drama, not Sam Spade, but closer to Philip Marlow.  He is a nice guy, who has seen much, and most of what he has seen has not been good.  He is a limo driver, but he hasn't always been one.  I think you will guess what he did before the chauffer gig long before it gets revealed, and if you don't you will say oh, of course. And what is neat is every one is good in this film, every part is good. There isn't a throw away role in the film. For me that is the damnable misery of it.	In this day and age you cannot make an eerie mystery without a major twist or two.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  I like surprises, I bet you do too, and there is a big surprise in Identity.  I can't tell you what it is of course.  I can tell you that I absolutely hated it.  That the twist is well done is not in dispute.  Is it interesting?  That is something you will have to decide for yourself.  For me it ruined everything I had come to think about the characters.  The climax becomes just a matter of tying up loose ends.  I no longer cared how it ended, who lived or who died, with the big twist all that stuff just ceased to matter.  	I walked out disappointed.  But I can't say the movie is bad at all.  It is well crafted, and engaging.  And it may be engaging to you Constant Reader, even after the twist.  In a genre that is typically filled with mindless trash, Identity makes an effort to be an engaging thriller, it doesn't do it with cheap thrills or lots of special effects.  It depends instead on thoughtful direction, engaging script, and excellent acting and a lot of rain. I give the movie a 9",9,0,0,28 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatness soured......
","I have just seen the Two Towers, so I thought I should come and give this movie a ten while it is still in me to give it one.  Star Wars, A new hope, was once great.  It should still be a great movie.  But it is not.  As I watch and read the Lord of the Rings, I realize that George Lucas has been a lucky hack.  He has borrowed (I am being nice here) from other great works (RIngs being only the most obvious example), Dune, Kurosawa's works and on and on.  The original release of Star Wars was absolutely perfect.  Everything that hit the cutting room floor needed to be there.   Han should have shot first.  Not Greedo.  Tatooine does not need giant dinosaurian creatures that no desert ecosystem could support.  It does not need goofy little robots flying to and fro for absolutely no other reason than the fact that Lucas owns ILM. Special effects that do not further the story simply distract.George Lucas proves that he does not know what was good about his films by the fact that he thought he needed to 'fix' them. The things that he contributed to the movies was the basic story shell.  Better writers than he are responsible for making hi stories utterly enjoyable.  And better directors than he are responsible for making 'Lucas' films watchable  (as his new films aptly demonstrate). What I find most annoying about this is that I can not now go and purchase the original theatrical release of Star Wars, Empire or Jedi.  Now I am stuck with the version's Lucas deems worthy.Worse yet, the beautiful mythology that so inspired me as a kid is now being stamped out by the silly thoughtless prequels.  The idea of them was awesome.  The story of Anakin's rise and fall.  It is the execution that has failed fans.  We knew enough about the story ourselves and that, I think, was the magic.  We knew enough, the rest was, appropriately, shrouded in mystery.  Anakin was tragic because he was good, and kind and Obi Wan' s dear friend.The Anakin presented in Clones is whiney, selfish brat, utterly unlikable, and un-approachable.  This Anakin can go nowhere but to the dark side.  At any rate, these were once great movies.",10,0,0,23 December 2002
