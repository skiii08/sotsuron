Men in Black 3," Better than the second one!
","Well I gotta admit I went to the cinema with low expectations because of the second one, but I was very surprised of how good of a movie it was. Mainly Josh Brolin who gave an excellent performance as young K, which was, without a doubt the highlight of the movie. Overall the Plot is flawed but I nevertheless gave it a ten out of ten. !!!!SPOILERS HERE'S A BIG SECRET!!!! The ending where its revealed that the general was J's father was one of the more powerful scenes in the Film, yet it was unnecessary, as it ruined kind of the first Film, where K recruited J because of his abilities not because he was emotionally attached to him. Nevertheless one of the better Films of 2012",10,1,4,14 July 2013
Alien vs. Predator," A worse 'continuation' of the Alien and Predator Franchises!
","First of all, I am rating the Unrated Edition of the film, which in my opinion is exactly the same as the theatrical one, albeit with some deleted scenes and few scenes containing more 'blood'.This film suffers not only from poor direction but also from editing point of view and acting aside, the script simply sucks. From disregarding the continuation of the previous movies, like in some instances the honor code of the Predators and the skills of the predators but more importantly the lame excuse to put these two creatures is a far more baffling choice: SPOILER!!!!!!!!Every 100 years the predators return to the temple, which btw was built by the ancient people of the Aztec's and two other cultures for the predators as they worshipped them as gods, to hunt for the aliens which they achieve by hooking the queen to a machine so she lives again and lays eggs and some willing people sacrifice themselves to the facehuggers so a breed of xenomorphs is born.Suspension of disbelief helps you if you are not an avid fan of both of the series, otherwise you simply can't enjoy this. Biased people also won't enjoy this as their favourite creatures don't display their real abilities, instead a dumbed down version of the aforementioned creatures.Nevertheless it gets some bonus points, for me personally, for it's fighting scenes between the two title characters, but it is also cut short and edited so fast you can't almost see anything, but the joy of seeing these two fight it out is kinda like a fan boy dream of mine.So for those who are avid followers, I wouldn't recommend it as it is just a rubbish excuse for some quick cash on both properties, and you won't be pleased with the acting either except maybe for the leading girl, who earns the respect and a spear from the king predator as she singlehandedly defeated an alien and was marked by the predator, with the acidic blood of the alien, that fought alongside her.(This is quite reminiscent of the final scene in Predator 2, where Danny Glover's character earns the respect of the Predators.) Otherwise this film is filled with a few nods to the previous entries of the two film series. For the casual film goers, or the ones that want to explore the film world of these creatures don't start with this one.",5,0,0,9 November 2014
Gangs of New York," A very good flick.
","Not the best Scorsese flick. Starting with The Departed I became very interested/obsessed with Scorsese's films. It wasn't until The Wolf of Wall Street that I decided to start a Scorsese marathon. Now I haven't watched all of his films, but for me this has to be the one that seems to be the longest, even though Casino was longer I enjoyed it even more than Goodfellas. Some scenes tend to get boring, I place it primarily on Cameron Diaz and some parts to Leo's acting. Every scene in which Day Lewis is in is pure awesomeness. Liam Neeson also provides a great performance, even though he SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!! dies in the first 15 minutes or so. I would recommend this film for Scorsese fans exclusively,not that other people wouldn't enjoy it, but it doesn't seem to be his best film. This film also marks Scorsese's first collaboration with Leo, which in the ensuing collaborations seems better suited than this film. For everyone interested in Marty's films start with Goodfellas or the classic Taxi Driver and move your way up or down as you like, because Scorsese's filmography has a wide range of variety, from gangster flicks to children's movies.",7,0,0,6 July 2014
