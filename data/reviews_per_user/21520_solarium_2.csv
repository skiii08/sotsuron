Minority Report," One Of The Best Science Fiction Movies
","Again, Steven Spielberg proves that he is one of the most important directors that work these days. This time he enters, again, to the futuristic field of the science fiction. In this film, he deals with the problematic subject of invading and terminating a person's life, based only on the prophecy of 3 pre-cogs (as they are called in the film) who, ironically named after 3 famous writers of detective stories. These pre-cogs can see a murder before it is commited. So that means, based on probability. But the main story of this film is the guilt that motivates and tears apart the hero, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) commander of the special pre-crime unit, that lost his only boy when they were spending time at the swimming pool. This desperation motivates him, when one day the prophecy shows that he himself is going to commit a murder.The film is rich with amazing special effects, that make you wish you are John Anderton, controlling the image film with the movements of your hands only.I love the work of Steven Spielberg. And once again, i wasn't disappointed. One our and 45 minutes, and i did not notice how time passed by.",9,0,0,5 September 2002
Insomnia," The Astonishing View of Alaska as A murder Scene
","The astonishing view of Alaska serves as a contradicting murder scene that Al Pacino and his partner come to solve from the so different city of L.A. Robin Williams gives a non type casting performance of a cold blooded murderer, and the story evolves around the personal fight between the investigator, Pacino, and the murderer, who blackmails him after he saw him accidentally shooting his partner.Al Pacino gives an impressing performance as the old police investigator who have seen it all and looses the ability to tell right from wrong. His character can not survive, but gets its salvation at the end by trying to teach a young investigator who admires him.A non typical suspense movie recommended for Al Pacino and for the breathtaking view of Alaska.",8,0,0,7 October 2002
