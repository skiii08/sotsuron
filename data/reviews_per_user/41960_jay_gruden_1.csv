Deja Vu," A favorite SCI-FI time travel movie
","I've watched this movie nearly two dozen times and have a theory on what many call 'holes' in the timeline. Doug Carlin has had to have gone back to the past at least two times. In the opening scene after the ferry explodes Doug heard his phone ring on the dick but the ringing is coming from a body bag. That bag holds the dead body (and cell phone) of the first Agent Carlin....so when the movie opens we are actually seeing the 2nd timeline....where Doug went back to save Claire (who was originally killed at the bait shop and dumped in the river). He saves her from bait shop, goes back to her house to clean up...leaving his blood, fingerprints and 'U can save her' note on the fridge. He leaves Claire at the house to keep her 'safe' and goes to the ferry alone but fails to stop the explosion and is killed along with the other 542 passengers....Carrol O. Would have had to have gone back to Claire's house after Doug leaves, cuts her fingers off to get rid of his DNA evidence, burns her and dumps her in the river. After Carrol O. drives the bomb/vehicle on the ferry he doesn't see Agent Carlin board the ferry in this timeline....so he he rides motorcycle and stops on the bridge to watch.
This is the only explanation for why Doug Carlin #2 (which is the one who we meet when the movie begins) has left his blood, prints, fridge message in Claire's house. It also explains how Claire called the ATF to confirm he was an agent and her asking beth if her call 'was a joke' that we hear on the phone messages.
When Doug #2 goes back in time he follows the same events but this time he realizes that he's changed nothing when he sees Claire wearing the same dress she was killed in and realized that the house looks the same as when he found it on his initial investigation. He changes one thing...he decides to take Claire with him to the ferry. This time Carrol O. sees the bronco and re-boards the ferry resulting in his death. Doug #2 still dies but bcz Claire is with him they are able to stop the ferry explosion by driving the bronco off the deck.
The ending scene where Claire is sitting on the dock we meet Doug #3 (the two Doug's who went back in time were both killed in the explosion.
This is a very abbreviated version of how this works and there may still be some loose ends but Doug would have had to go back in time at least twice to explain everything that we see in the timeline we are presented.",9,0,0,26 May 2020
