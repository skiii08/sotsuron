Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Racial stereotypes? Come on, people!
","I managed to keep myself almost completely ignorant about this movie before going to see it nine days after it was released. I had only seen one trailer and heard that Jake Lloyd's acting was terrible.  Well, now that I've seen it, I have to say that the trailer didn't even give a hint of the magnificence of this film, and Jake Lloyd's acting was more than adequate.One quibble I have with it is the amount of screen time given to Jar Jar Binks.  And no, not because he's supposedly a stereotype of a Caribbean and whatever else people have labeled him. There seemed to be too much comic relief in this movie, more so than the other three movies when it was just up to C3PO and R2D2 to provide laughs.This movie has been slammed for perpetuating racial stereotypes and I have to disagree with a lot of self-righteous people who are making a big deal out of nothing.  I am college-educated and graduated with high honors, so I think I am intelligent enough to see a racial stereotype when I see one.  And I will say right now that when I was watching PHANTOM MENACE, the only thing that was running through my head when I saw Jar Jar was, 'Boy, he's a lot like Roger Rabbit.'  I even checked the credits to see if the man who did the voice for Roger Rabbit did the voice for Jar Jar.  The other character in the film who has been singled out for criticism is Watto.  Supposedly he is a stereotype of a Jew, because of his accent and his big nose.  His accent has also been described as Turkish.  I thought the accent was vaguely Italian and as for his nose...why didn't people go out gunning for Gonzo when Muppets first aired?  Come on, let's dig up Jim Henson and throw the mud at him right now!  When I saw Watto, I thought he was supposed to be a kind of bug, like a dragonfly or mosquito with the long beak, because I saw the wings.",Null,0,0,1 June 1999
Memento," Easy to watch, hard to explain
","Just like The Matrix, as I watched the movie, it made perfect sense.  Then when I tried to explain it to someone who hadn't seen it, I confused them and myself as well!  But that doesn't make the movie bad.  It's rare to find a movie that you can't sum up in 50 words (sometimes 10) or less and make perfect sense.  I really enjoyed the fact that you had to have your memory fine-tuned while watching it and even then, things slipped by that will require a second viewing, or a third...or a fourth...or a...  I was riveted, and not only by Guy Pearce's edgy yet charming hero.  All the performances were cohesive and a perfect complement to Pearce's obsessed Shelby. 10/10 and great arty-without-being-stiflingly-pretentious cinema (well worth the $7)",10,0,1,23 April 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Worse than I expected
","I'd heard this was a great movie but I still rented it with reservation. The plot lost me, not being a cloning geek, and seemed to drift around aimlessly.  The movie appeared to hang more on the spooky behavior of Sigourney Weaver Dr. Doolittling with the aliens.  Winona Ryder was out of place, Brad Dourif was his usual creepy self (not a bad thing, but he still couldn't salvage it), and I don't know what was going on with Ron Perlman and his 'extreme' moments of yelling.  It was pretty shoddy all around.  The only standouts for me were the scene with Ripley and the basketball and Michael Wincott's all-too-brief role.  He of the magnificent voice should have been given more to do.  It seemed a lot longer than the 108 minutes listed on the box.  Aliens seems shorter than that.  I'm not a shoot-em-up type of movie watcher, but I do like the stories to have a point and engaging characters.  The Marines of Aliens are pretty eye-grabbing whereas the space trash in Alien 4 had no charisma (except Michael 'The Voice' Wincott of course).4/10",4,0,1,17 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I was amazed
","I did not expect to be as blown away by this movie as I was, considering the source material.  It was a surprise to see this goofball adventure yarn become quite extraordinary cinema.  There are some healthy doses of Errol Flynn-Basil Rathbone derring-do (Bloom and Depp buckling swash in the smithy shop) along with great comedic moments and memorable characters -- I need not mention that being Depp's manic and hilarious Jack Sparrow.  A manlier, gayer pirate has never lived.  He would have walked away with the movie completely if Orlando Bloom had not been well nigh perfect as the earnest love interest, looking pretty damn good in those nice-fitting duds and delivering his lines seriously to counterbalance Depp's utter insanity. Geoffrey Rush looked like he was having a fun time snarling 'arrr! me buckos!' around the deck and the whole ride was worth my money.  The only negative is Keira Knightly's bizarre way of holding her lips.  Must be an affectation, because I have seen the same maneuver on Renee Zellweger and Michelle Pfeiffer (in years past).  Irritating little mannerism, that.Anyway, can't wait for the DVD!10/10",10,0,1,21 July 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," It's South Park...of course it's great!
","There's not much else to add to this movie, just that it's one of the funniest things to ever hit the screens.  Naturally it's offensive and abuses the human ears, but that's the South Park charm.  Highlights include Cartman's song about Kyle's mum and Mr. Mackey's song about cuss word alternatives.  And you'll never think about Satan and Saddam Hussein in the same way again -- guaranteed.",10,5,5,7 October 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's best to date!
","I've seen several Tim Burton films, but this one is by far my favorite. It's a good old ghost story with ample doses of comedy and thrills -- and a wonderful performance by Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow to prove that the supernatural goings on have a basis in scientific fact.  Depp is marvelous, as he is in all of the films he's done with Burton.  The two of them bring out the best in each other and create cinema magic.  The sets are eerie and atmospheric, filled with fog and mists that build tension and a feel for the late 18th century countryside.  I really can't say enough about the set direction.  I tip my hat to whoever did it. Christina Ricci provides more than adequate love interest and she looks lovely in her costumes.  Christopher Walken looks like he had a marvelous time with his fake teeth, snarling at everyone like a maniac.  All in all, the move is deliciously over-the-top, straight from the Puritanical rants of hellfire and brimstone, witchcraft and boogeymen that would drag good Christians down to their doom.  A must see!",10,0,1,8 October 2001
We Were Soldiers," Compounded cliches and rampant cheesiness = boredom
","I gave this a 3 because it was OK if I turned a blind eye to the flaws (Braveheart got a 2 from me for the same reasons).  However, I had to keep my blind eye turned most of the time.  The violence was interesting (the napalm injuries almost made me hurl), but the script...ye gods!  Actually, it read like Braveheart in so many ways in that you can almost utter the lines before the actor does because each situation which can provide a stock, boring and predictable piece of dialogue DOES.  Randall Wallace is a one-note screenwriter, and it's a very flat note at that.  I mean, 'Tell my wife I love her?' and 'How can I forgive myself that my boys died and I didn't?'  Haven't we heard these lines scads of times before?  They're simplistic and truthful, but they have been done over and over and it's a cop out to hear actors say them anymore.The weepy scenes with Madeleine Stowe tried the patience as well because they were also so damn familiar that I knew what was coming up and could even predict the expressions on her face and the montages.  Speaking of montages, the one with the journalist snapping the pictures was out and out cheesy.  That's a word that sums up this movie: cheesy.I felt no attachment to the characters at all.  It was just bullets and blood and dead bodies.  Another movie that has this same receipe is Black Hawk Down, but BHD was an excellent movie with an amazing central peformance by Josh Hartnett and solid supporting performances that made the movie memorable in every respect.  This movie, because it was basically a Mel Gibson vehicle, gave him the only meat to work with and short-shrifted the others.  But since the script stunk to high heaven, it doesn't make a bit of difference.  I'd recommend BHD over this one anyday.",3,0,3,25 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Jesus Tapdancing Christ...where to begin?
","When you watch a movie and the only thoughts running through your mind are 'Am I really seeing this?' and 'Did I really hear that?' you have a stinker. From the oh-so-full-of-convenient-coincidences of the car race through the city to the horrendously clunky dialogue between two actors deserving of the Golden Raspberry (Christiansen and Portman -- ye gods!), this movie was a groanfest from start to finish.  No one looked comfortable or sounded at ease having to mouth such inanities.  There was MAYBE 25 minutes of actual coherent plot that was necessary to the story.  Other than that, it was just whiplash from one end of the galaxy to the other with people doing things for no real reason.  Why was Jango Feet introduced at all?  Just to give motive for Bobba's personality later on?  I dunno.  It was a screwed-up mess and by the time the first hour was over, I really didn't care.  I just watched it to the end hoping that Christopher Lee could salvage it from total mediocrity and he did to a small degree.  Although fighting a pinwheeling muppet (OK, CGI he may be, but I liked the old Yoda better) isn't exactly a diginifed use of celluloid, or for a veteran actor like Lee for that matter.  Peter Jackson used Lee's talents to greater distinction as Saruman.This movie still has my brain scrambled so I can't think straight.  It made my eyes bleed and my mind reject all that I heard and saw.  In short, I can't believe that this ever made it to the theaters.  It's not even a passable action movie, let alone an entry into the Star Wars series. Phantom Menace was lame, but this one is a crime again humanity.  I wish someone would pry the writer's pen out of George's hands and shoo him out of the picture.  Tell him to continue to harrass fanfic sites or something. But atrocities like this have to stop or else the luster of the Star Wars legacy will fade and go out with a resounding splat.  I certainly am in no rush to watch the third one.  I'll stick with the REAL Star Wars -- the Kasdan Star Wars, not this Lucas-scripted dreck.  Even so, the best Star Wars pales in comparison to the rich texture of Lord of the Rings.This movie has replaced Titanic as my pet hate movie of all time. Congrats, George! -10/10",Null,1,2,26 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I preferred it to the book!
","Perhaps I'm not in a position to pass judgment on this movie and say that it is better than the book because I have only read it once.  And I sped-read it at that!  But I wanted to have at least a bit of an idea of what was going on before I saw the movie.  It was a bit of a struggle to get through it.  I found Tolkein's language quite dry and exhaustive.  But the movie takes that language and gives it color and dynamic zing.  I preferred it to the book, no question.  And I find no problem with the alterations that Peter Jackson made to Tolkein's story such as enlarging the role of Arwen and dropping Tom Bombadil completely.  I think that Arwen's strong character, bravery and courage in the scene outrunning the Black Riders would only illustrate why Arathorn loves her so much.  Her willingness to endanger herself to help the forces of right echo his own principles. I went into this movie with an open mind because I didn't have any expectations and that served me well.  I was receptive to whatever Peter Jackson wanted to tell and, yes, I was suckered right into it.  I haven't ever seen such a movie that captured my imagination and wouldn't let me go for 3 solid hours.  I wanted to go right back into the theater and see it again (but, alas, it was sold out!)  All the actors appeared to be channeling the roles.  They were completely and utterly believable.  The standouts in the cast were Ian McKellan and Elijah Wood, but in truth everyone did a phenomenal job.  Cate Blanchett's voice, haunting and aristocratic, sends shivers up and down my spine.  And Orlando Bloom's archery work was quite notable.  That such an epic film should sit on everyone's shoulders so well and so naturally speaks volumes about their dedication and Jackson's ability to hold it all together. Although I'll read the other 2 volumes in time before the other movies are released, it is just to have an idea of what is going on.  But reading them will be made easier by having in my mind the breathtaking visuals, scenery, sounds, and crackling performances already supplied by Jackson in this first movie.  The DVD can't get here fast enough!!!!  And neither can the next 2 Christmases!",10,0,0,6 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Didn't really engage my attention
","After seeing this movie, I thought, 'This guy directed Erin Brockovich?!? What HAPPENED??!!??'  With a cast like this, I thought that it would have to be good, but I came out of the theater with a greater liking for the original Rat Pack version.  I thought that this version just never seemed to get off the ground, or maybe I just didn't care if these people pulled off the job or not.  I did like Andy Garcia's performance, but it required not much more than looking dark and threatening.  Matt Damon was a big blah and the Cockney guy drove me nuts.  Who the heck is he?  He reminds me of the balloon pilot in The Mummy Returns and he drove me nuts too.  I was impressed by Brad Pitt, however.  I can't stand the guy in every movie I've seen him in, but in this he wasn't the brooding or smirking jerk that he usually is.  And for this George Clooney fan, I was disappointed that he didn't really make me get involved in the movie.  Oh, well.  At least I have O Brother Where Art Thou to watch!5/10 (I like some slick, empty-headed movies, but this just wasn't one of them)",5,1,2,6 January 2002
JFK," Powerful film of emotions, not facts
","This movie has been trashed by so many people that I wonder whether they hold the opinion that historical dramas have to be rigidly accurate.  I know little about the assassination and this movie has given me the desire to read about it.  To me that is the measure of an excellent movie: that it is told in such a fascinating way that the viewer wants to discover more about it.Oliver Stone is an inspired filmmaker, no doubt.  And I have to agree with Roger Ebert's conclusions about this film.  It is not history, but a powerful movie about the emotions of the time, which is just as important as the actual fact that JFK was killed.  Garrison's character is the collective 1960s American who was optimistic about the direction in which the country was being led and when JFK died, that vision vanished as well.  The sense of loss and frustration is what Stone captured to perfection.I was pleasantly surprised at Costner's performance.  Given his latest streak of bombs, it's nice to see his brilliant earlier performances.  Gary Oldman was believable as Oswald and with every film I see of his, I like him more and more.",9,4,15,4 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Stunning, gorgeous, and impossible to look away from -- and I'm not just talking about Viggo Mortensen
","There is nothing I can add that hasn't been said by many others, but I'll just say that this movie blew me away like the first one did, yet in a different way.  The first movie introduced the sweeping scenery, the grandeur and majesty that will be the tone of the entire trilogy, but this movie introduced the brutal and desperate fight to save Middle Earth -- the raw emotions of the players to defend what is theirs and insure their survival.  I can only imagine what the final movie is going to be like as the tension is only going to get greater as Mount Doom gets closer and the final battle for Middle Earth takes place.  Wow.  It takes the breath away.I was most awestruck by Gollum and the realism of this little creature, as well as the way in which he wrapped you up with his struggle to split away from his evil side.  The whole Smeagol/Gollum scene made me cry like a baby even though I was trying to block out the laughs of the ignoramuses around me who thought he was some kind of comedic spastic muppet.  However, *I* had *my* laugh when the oodles of fangirls gasped and squealed over Orlando's (face it, Legolas doesn't enter into it at all) two shining moments of derring-do.  Which were cool, I won't deny, but there's more to the movies than a butt like granite, however delectable it might be.Viggo Mortensen was amazing as Aragorn and his character is unfolding more and more.  I loved the scene where he screamed in frustration at the pile of burnt orcs.  I imagine he was wondering what type of king he would be if he couldn't even save 2 hobbits.  And the subsequent intercutting between Merry and Pip's escape and him tracing their steps was very thrilling.I was pleased that Arwen wasn't in it more than she was.  There was just enough, but not too much.  The scenes with her and Elrond was very poignant and I'm glad that they were put in rather than just have her pop in and out to suck face with Aragorn.I've heard complaints about the abundance of Gimli humor, but I didn't think it demeaning in the least.  It was great and the banter between Legolas and Gimli was great.  I was so psyched to see their number competition at Helm's Deep retained.  The Elf-Dwarf friendship is one of the most beautiful things in the books.Finally, I was really taken with Brad Dourif's performance as Grima. I've only seen him in a Babylon 5 episode (where he was awesome) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, so this was completely different from anything else I'd seen and I was amazed that he imbued so many facets in a character that we sadly saw so little of.  I've read an interview with him saying that Grima won't be in the third movie and I hope that is wrong!  It would be a bummer to not have my second favorite character make his rightful appearance at the end!10/10 and the rating for the extended DVD will go through the roof",10,0,0,23 December 2002
Schindler's List," Gross manipulation and a trial to watch
","I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic.  Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch.It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it.  Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions.  Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.Liam Neeson did give a good performance.  His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes.  Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character.  Still, I rooted for him until the end.If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel.  Jaws, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg touch, doing what he does best.3/10",3,24,63,31 October 2002
The Insider," Engrossing plot, dialogue and characters make it zip by
","I was kind of wary about watching this movie because I have seen a few of Michael Mann's other films and found them nonsensical (Mohicans) or just plain boring (Heat, except for the robbery scene).  But this one really caught me up in the story and character development.  Pacino gives yet another charismatic performance as Lowell Bergman as he fights to get his story aired on 60 Minutes.  And what can possibly be said about Russell Crowe?  The man defies being pigeonholed as an actor and his Jeffrey Wigand was a superb characterization, going from persecuted employee to defiant rebel who wonders if it was all worth it after he loses everything.  He played a middle-aged man so well that he makes a paunch and white hair exceedingly attractive! :P  The almost 3 hour running time just flies by and you see some of the best performances on film along the way!",10,0,0,14 August 2001
From Hell," Fine, up until the end
","I much prefer the TV movie with Michael Caine.  That one was more based in fact.  This film just went winging off into the ozone near the finale with messianic Freemasons and a convoluted 'solution' that had me shaking my head and wishing for a more straightforward mystery, which is what The Ripper is. The Hughes Brothers were in love with the freaky dream sequences and imagery (which were interesting visually), but left the plot hanging.  The gore was a bit overdone and almost became a fetish, in fact a bit comical in places.  Having the Ripper speak was a bad move because anyone with half an ear would know who it was.The best thing about this movie was the ultra-real atmosphere of Victorian skid rows and Johnny Depp.",6,0,2,29 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Horrid sequel
","It took me two viewings to appreciate The Matrix, but that was because the first time I saw it, I was confused as to what the story was.  The first time (and only, as far as I'm concerned) I saw this sequel, I was bored, amused and disgusted by turns.What was an interesting kernel of an idea in the first film has been extended way beyond what it should be in Reloaded.  Drawing the story out (what there is of it) over 3 films is only making apparent just how slim the plot is - lots of poofery around a good idea and meandering around, taking its own sweet time to conclude.  Even though the story lines are very different, I can't help but compare it to Lord of the Rings.  LOTR is taut with an objective in mind, whereas Neo just keeps kicking (and now flying *snort*) his way around with new story threads coming up all the time to explain this or that, or just to muddy the comprehension waters for the hell of it.  From what I understood, he's really the sum total of program anomalies that has a cyclical life.  If I cared, I would go to the theater is a few weeks to see how it is all wrapped up, but Reloaded had me rolling my eyes so much that I doubt I'll even part with the $5.25 matinee fee. If there is even a scintilla of repeats of the Zion bongo fest and the interminable and repetitive fight choreography, I'll never watch it.As a fanfic writer (in the LOTR fandom), I am so tempted to send a Mary Sue Litmus Test to the Wachowski Brothers, asking them to run Neo through it. It'd be interesting to see what score they come up with. (I got a 37, with 35+ being a hopeless Sue).  Odd that I didn't notice Neo's Sue-ish qualities in the first movie, but after seeing Reloaded, they are so apparent. Bringing Trinity to life (with the 'ole heart squeeze trick *snicker*), flying, having all those other uber-superpowers, being 'the One' in a prophecy, etc. etc. etc ad nauseum.  So perfect and powerful it's ridiculous.  He's an embodiment of what people wish they could be.  I.E., a perfect Mary Sue.In all fairness, however, I did give it a 3 - but only for Hugo Weaving. But even you couldn't save it, Hugo baby.",3,0,0,22 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A 6/10, missing alot even as a film
","This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY.  Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded.  It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby.  Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen 'to leave or not to leave' flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor).  Horrible, horrible.  Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance.  It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT.  A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR.On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin.  They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once.  Their performances were true and heartfelt, though Faramir sadly dropped out of the picture because PJ unwisely cut the Houses of Healing sequence.It's not worth the hype and I didn't think this once in a lifetime film event would end so sadly.",7,5,10,6 January 2004
The Matrix," What's the big deal?
","I honestly don't know why this movie is touted so much as being the ultimate scifi flick or whatever other tags it's gotten over the past 3 years.  The story was hard to wrap my mind around, but that's perhaps because the explanation for The Matrix itself was done in the middle of the film in the cheesiest manner possible: sitting the hero down and explaining it to him. My mind just blanked it out.  Not only is this device as old as time, but it doesn't involve the audience at all.  It's like we're just listening in.  It would have been better for Neo to actually experience it firsthand and find out exactly what the reality is around him and how it came to be.  I found the FX to be pretty cheesy as well.  I felt like I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a movie.  The whole concept of the story may be 'deep' for the latest generation (I'm one step ahead of you folks), but it sounded like contrived dreck to me. 2/10 cuz Keanu's pretty cute, but cuteness does not a good movie make.",2,3,7,14 January 2002
Braveheart," Overblown and overrated
","I finally watched this movie after hearing about it for years and I really wish I'd spent my time watching something else.  Braveheart ranks right up there with Titanic and Pearl Harbor as prime examples of what's wrong with Hollywood historical epics.  They take a rich and complex history or event and dumb it down for the viewing public into a shallow tale of revenge, love and death.  Emotions are over-the-top and characters are either good or bad. Strangely enough, considering its reputation among some people as being mindless entertainment drivel, I feel Gladiator is a much better film, despite all the sneers that Gladiator aped Braveheart.  Gladiator took the elements that floundered in Braveheart and made it much more satisfying, visually and dramatically.  Compare Maximus's quiet death, as he finally reaches his family on the other side, with Wallace's leatherlung scream of 'FREEDOM!' delivered on the soaring wave of a pulse-pounding, throat-catching orchestral surge that you would find only in a Hollywood epic.  I look at Braveheart as a supreme egotrip by a moderately talented actor.  Mel Gibson needs a good director to keep him in line so he doesn't grandstand, and Emmerich succeeded to some degree in The Patriot.  Throw in the shameful historical inaccuracies and the blatant gay-bashing (Mel has a few personal agendas) and you have a long film that bores and exasperates.Still, I gave it 2/10 for the cinematography.  The scenery is beautiful. Oh, and the gut-wrenching bellylaugh I got from Wallace's final word made the rest of the movie much more enjoyable.  Too bad it didn't come earlier in the film.If you want to see Braveheart summed up in about 5 minutes, watch the 'Starvin' Marvin' episode of South Park.  It's infinitely more satisfying.",2,5,9,16 October 2001
Gladiator," Great epic not dwarfed by the effects
","I went into this movie expecting it to be nothing but guts and gore and lots of screaming.  Boy, was I wrong!  Yes, there was some of all those things, but what also came off the screen was an absorbing story of a man's determination to bring his life full circle -- make it complete by avenging those who had wronged him.  The computer generated effects were far above those of TITANIC and the work done in the battle scenes was simply awe-inspiring.  I had a few quibbles: the relationship between Drucilla and Maximus prior to the opening of the movie was not explained and the speed of the opening battle varied from slow to fast and it was hard to keep an eye on any one person.  Very minor things!  I spent $4.75 to see the movie and it was WELL WORTH IT!  I think I've recovered from the belly flop that was TITANIC.  I can now go to a theatre and spend my money with confidence.  There ARE good movies out there!",10,0,0,17 June 2000
