Blade Runner 2049," It's a good movie. But there's a masterpiece dying to get out.
","It is visually beautiful. The sound design is great. The characters are interesting. Production design is great. It has a brain teasing plot and leaves you asking questions. But it is way too long. The shot pacing could have been sped up at times, and the B Story was too long for a B Story. In my opinion, just like the original, it needs a re-edit, but for different reasons.",7,0,4,8 October 2017
