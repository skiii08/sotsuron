Iron Man 3," From a Hardcore Comic Book Fan!
","If theirs one thing i love its movies, even more Super Hero Movies. Iron Man is easily one of the greatest comic book super heroes of all time. When the first one came out i was a little hesitant but after watching it? I thanked Jesus he gave humanity such a pleasant gift. Honest to god this movie is not what comic book people love! The only people who love this movie are the 'Fake' nerds that saw The Avengers with their friends and think its cool and sensitive to claim to be a nerd. All of us real nerds know those people and if your a real true to life nerd..... You wont love this. There are so many desecration of classic Comic icons its crazy! Every other scene i saw myself saying 'Why?!'...... Iron Man 1? Great! Spider-Man 1? Great! Avengers? Great! Iron Man 3???....... What The F*ck?!?! I wish that they gave a real hardcore nerd the script and let them grade it. To be optimistic its not that bad with visual effects, and the ending is a nice little basket of eater eggs for old Iron Man Fans.",4,1,4,21 August 2013
