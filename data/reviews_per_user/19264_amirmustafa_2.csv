10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE was definitely a suspenseful experience that I probably wouldn't want to encounter again.
","Although CLOVERFIELD as a whole was an okay movie, it quickly and surely accumulated a large diverse fan base. For a significant number of people, CLOVERFIELD is considered the pinnacle of 'FOUND FOOTAGE' movies. However, throw in some sci-fi and you have CLOVERFIELD. This is for a different review.After watching the original CLOVERFIELD and being thoroughly disappointed, I had very much similar expectations for the second movie in the franchise. I can tell you with certainty if this movie did not have the words CLOVERFIELD in the title, you would not believe that it is part of the same franchise. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE takes a more default approach of movie making as opposed to the FOUND FOOTAGE cluster that the first movie happened to be. To sum it up into one paragraph, 10 CLOVERFIELD LAND was actually a surprisingly suspenseful enjoyable adventure. The cinematography was on point and really contributed to the overall feeling of suspense throughout the whole film. The acting was not overdone and felt necessarily realistic. The characters are somewhat interesting, especially the 'antagonist'. However, there are faults involved.((POSSIBLE (somewhat nonexistent) SPOILERS)) A major con is the ENDING. Without spoiling much, an element of the movie was abruptly introduced within the last 15 minutes of the movie. Essentially, you have a suspense-thriller movie that was actually executed decently until the last 15 minutes. Seriously, what were they thinking? The ending was so far-fetched and annoyingly rushed. I'm okay with the extraterrestrial plot point. However, if it is thrown in for the heck of making it an alien movie, then I'm sorry bud. It didn't work. It was a failed ending.Another (small) gripe I had with this movie was negligible pacing issues. Some scenes were drawn out or plainly necessary. Others were in fact boring. To add, some of the 'creative ideas' of problem solving were a tad bit far fetched, but I dismiss all disbelief for the sake of enjoyment.I wouldn't really call this an IMPROVEMENT over the first movie considering they were executed much differently from each other. But is this one better than the first in general terms? Yeah, it is.+ well-done acting+ cinematography+ filled with suspense (hopefully what it strives for)<ul><li>ending </li></ul><ul><li>pacing problems</li></ul><ul><li>a tad bit far fetched</li></ul>10 CLOVERFIELD LANE - decent - if you're looking for a good watch, give this a shot - 7/10",7,1,1,18 July 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an obvious must see.
","If you are a casual movie watcher, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie that has most definitely been splattered smugly all over your computer screen. If one were to quickly google 'Top 100 Movies of All Time', I can guarantee this movie will be on that list. However, is this movie worth the recognition and critical acclaim? The short answer is: yes. Of course. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes the qualities of a standard film and ups the game drastically. Loving characters? Check. Well-shot iconic scenes? Yep, it also has that. An unforgettable quirky narrative? You betcha. Now, given my rating of a 9, I obviously did not find this movie to be a somewhat modern masterpiece. (This calls for a re-watch so I can reform or reinforce my views) However, is it irrational to call this the best movie of the 90s? No, it's actually completely understandable. Is it irrational to call this the best movie of all time? Again, nope - it is completely understandable and logical that someone would view the movie in that light. + classic narrative + lovable characters + emotional / thought-provoking in some sense-noneTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION - classic - 9/10 (subject to change)",9,0,0,18 July 2016
