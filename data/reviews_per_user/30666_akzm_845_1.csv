Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Awful!!!
","Borat Sagdiyev is a fictional character representing 'Kazakhstani' with no culture and boundaries. He represents his own lack of culture and a Bathroom humor and his jokes insult not only people he intends to insult, but first of all his own stinky self. Kazakhstan as the real country and his 'Kazakhstan' have nothing to do with each other. As long as people realize that, they are OK. However people who take it for real have serious problems with their mental health and education!!! As for viewers, too bad that Americans don't know anything about other countries other than their own, so they make their opinions from stupid rumors, made by hate groups and from stereotypes.",1,14,31,8 November 2006
