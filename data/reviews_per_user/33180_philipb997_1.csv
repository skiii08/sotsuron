Skyfall," Over-hyped and disappointing.
","After enjoying Casino Royale then enduring Quantum of Solice, I hoped this would be at least on par with the former but ended up, in my opinion, taking too many liberties.It had already created a paradox in casting Dame Judi Dench in Casino Royale after she already starred with Pierce Brosnan from Goldeneye on wards when he was Bond and this takes it all the way too far with an all too unbelievable prequel revelation. The pace and action style of the first third to a half of the running time is enjoyable but then changes style and tempo and includes a Home Alone style (if Macaulay Culkin was playing a more homicidal youngster) montage in preparation of the final battle. Throw in a super intelligent villain with an over-complicated plan to achieve such a comparatively far simpler end game, a gorgeous Bond girl that wasn't given enough chance to shine in Berenice Marlohe, a ridiculous origin for the Bond and Miss Moneypenny relationship and you have an average, by the numbers action thriller that disappoints and further disillusions a life-long bond fan.",6,9,20,28 October 2012
