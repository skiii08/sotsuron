Requiem for a Dream," Bar raiser
","Its when I see movies like this that I know I need to work harder on my script.A fantastic movie.A shocking movie.A (if you can agree after seeing it)wonderful movie. Not for the squeamish but a movie buffs movie. Its a movie that you cant miss a frame or talk to your friends while watching it. I'm a tough guy but I was slightly afraid of a nightmare afterwords.Thats what movies are supposed to do, compel emotion.It moved so fast I had a bit of trouble picking a favorite character.The long opening scene of the TVs journey to the hockshop let me know this director was good.The ending was not what I expected but never the less it was perfect. There were a lot of messages in this movie. The filming was stellar. Jared Letos acting was again on time. Wayans can retire after this performance. He nearly had me in tears.Mr.Aronofsky make a sequel!",9,0,1,2 October 2005
