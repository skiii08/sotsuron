Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very Funny indeed
","First of all I can't understand people who actually take this movie serious and call it offensive, racist etc. Hey it's is a movie which is meant to be the way it is, cruel with tons of toilet humor in it. People who can't see movies like this and then crying because it is offensive should take a look at the rating... Which movie with an R rating isn't offensive in a way or another? I personally loved this movie... Ever in a long time have i laughed so hard until i saw this wonderful little movie, Borat is totally amazing and i give it a well earned 8 out of ten rating but of course if you are a sensitive little coward and can't take this kind of humor stay with movies like the 'Wizard of Oz' or something.",8,1,3,11 April 2008
