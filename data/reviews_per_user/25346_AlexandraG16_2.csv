10 Cloverfield Lane," Cool and surprising
","I was super curious to see this movie as I am a huge fan of the movie Cloverfield. By mistake I thought that this would be a sequel - and I had already heard all kinds of rumors about what 'Cloverfield 2' might be about.What I got was different - but still pretty cool. The beginning pulls you right in, everything is just very intense and confusing - just as it would be if you were in the protagonist's shoes.Speaking of the protagonists: I was extremely impressed by the understated way Mary Elizabeth Winstead carried the movie, andI have to admit that though I'm not a John Goodman fan by any stretch of the imagination, he worked out great as prepper Howard, probably better than anybody else could, because his more than solid physique makes him appear as a broken man as well as intimidating at the same time.The tension in this movie never lets up, not for a minute, and without wanting to spoil anything: The teasers are very adequate in preparing you for what this movie has in store - and then some!",8,0,0,22 December 2016
Paranormal Activity," Sleepless nights
","I almost feel guilty about giving a 10 especially for a low-budget movie, but the world knows by now: This movie delivered all there is to be delivered in the horror genre.Or actually: like most horror movies there's a big divide here in the audience - it always seems to be even bigger when it comes to the so called found footage movies.I can hardly believe that a 6,3 is all this movie got on IMDb. But I guess that's just it: A lot of viewers don't get anything at all out of a movie that was cheaply produced and doesn't have a lot of special effects, gore or monsters.Then there are the others like me: In the back of my head I seem to believe in demons, because this movie left me with the deep conviction that I'm not safe in my own house and in my own bed anymore. I didn't sleep well for a number of nights after having seen it. That's all I have to say because most of the rest there is to be said about this film is common knowledge. Don't trust anybody who says it was boring: See and decide for yourself.",10,1,1,9 December 2016
