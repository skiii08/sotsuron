Skyfall," Bond for the die hard fans
","Just seen Skyfall and have to say that it is a great film. I've been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember and have enjoyed each film in the series. Craig is a great Bond and has really bought Bond up to date. The story for Skyfall shows Bond as you have never seen him before. It brings out the inner workings of what makes Bond tick and why he has the attitude that gets him into trouble.The other great thing about Skyfall is that it has bought back the old characters and again updated them. The producers have done themselves and the Bond legacy proud. Without giving to much away its a great film for the die hard Bond fan. Its has all the things you would expect in a Bond film and a lot that you wouldn't . The last thing to say is don't and do go with the thought of expecting the usual style that Bond films bring, but be ready for the twists that the story line will bring. Its a great transition.",10,6,21,26 October 2012
Man of Steel," Not Super but still good
","OK i have just watched this film. I had hoped that WB had done the right thing. The last outing of Superman was the worst film I had seen in ages. So my hopes were up when I found out that they were going to try again. So my initial thought after watching Man Of Steel was good. I enjoyed how they had changed the story. The cast was outstanding and the visual effects were superb, but the film lacked something. I still really cant put my finger on it even now. It seems that they wanted to show the back story of Superman and his arrival to earth, and they did this well. The first hour or so of the film was great. Seeing Clark being alienated and struggling with how to grow up in a world that has enough pressures for its human children was brilliant. Then it came to the action sequences and this is where the story line seems to fade. Though the fight scenes/cgi is good it seemed to much at once. I have the feeling that WB are trying their hardest to catch up with Disney/Marvel Avengers and have fallen short. Its a shame really as they have lots of potential for Superman. Lets only hope they do a sequel. In all a good film but not as Super as it could have been",7,0,2,5 July 2013
