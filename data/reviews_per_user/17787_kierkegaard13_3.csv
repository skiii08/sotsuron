The Ring," Could be worse
","Movie is terrible.  It's not scary.  The plot is overwhelming.  I wanted to take the nap in the middle of the movie.  First, some people say how it's scary, because you can relate to it.  How? It's totally impossible.  How was the little girl controlling the tape?  The movie doens't even give you sufficient explanation about the supernatural.
Second, the should've ended it after Rachel was saved.  Noah's death was just too much.  It was it better than most of the current horror movies, including the other ones in this class of newly revived thriller-horrors, but skip it.  I give it 3/10.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Rarely do we see sequal succeed the first installment...
","...which exactly is the case with this movie.  It's more mature and far more interesting.  Of course, as an eager fan of Harry Potter, it wasn't all the original excitment I felt before seeing the first movie, but rather a routine, as 'Oh well, second part is here'. Acting was superb.  Kenneth Branagh was far the best, which is undeniable since every movie he's been in, he's thrown other actors in his shadow.  I could not imagine Lockhart being anybody else but him, after he's left the mark.  Alan Rickman was not as good in the first movie and didn't get as nearly as much screen time.  In the first scene we see him, after Ron says: 'But honestly Professor, I think it has done more damage to us', Professor shouts 'Silence'.  That was poorely done and badly cut. 
Fiona Shaw was not as nearly as good as in the first movie, where I think she did her part best of all.  Maggie Smith and Richard Harris were traditionally good.  Jason Isaacs surely did give Lucius a person touch, but I felt that his voice was far too silky and auditious in some parts, such as when he is in Hagrid's hut.  Robbie Coltrane wasn't as nearly as funny as in the first movie, but equally excellent.  Children actors were again in the shadow of the older and more experienced actors, and despite their attempts to act, they looked funny and immature comparing to the icons of the British film.  Daniel was all right, but he lacks zealousness as Harry Potter, being too timid.  Rupert Grint, despite being very funny, was very bad.  Emma Watson wasn't as nearly as annoying as in the first movie, but just trying too hard.  Tom Felton overdid Draco, so Draco did not seem like a real person anymore. Overall, movie is great and very fun.  A definite classic.",10,0,0,5 May 2003
Trainspotting," The skag experience
","This is my favourite movie ever.  I've seen it over dozens of times, and yet I regret it for not having it on DVD nor VHS.First time I saw it was when I was fourteen.  For some strange reason, I had problems with keeping up with Scottish slang.  Second time I saw it was a year ago.  I fell in love with it.  Ewan McGregor does a great job acting as a heroin junkie.  I also loved Johnny Lee Miller, for doing deceitful yet charming Sick Boy.The movie gave me a new vision on the drugs and Scotland, yet I can't help thinking that the movie wasn't harsh enough in its portrayal of heroin.  I guess it shows the 'up-side' if there is such a thing in drug usage.
However, if you like European movies, have not problem with Scots, and want to see something new, this is the right movie for you.  It's very bleak with the imagery, yet I can't stop laughing at all the jokes.  Just one thing, it's almost nothing like the book.",10,0,0,1 February 2003
