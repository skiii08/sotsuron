Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Unanswered questions
","Warning: very serious spoilers Well, now I've seen both halves, and as I suspected we wouldn't, we are given no answer to how the baby is retrieved from the Bride's supposedly dead body, without any trace of this being apparently visible to the law officers. This also brings up a major continuity error: she flees as soon as she is pregnant, Bill traces her three months later, yet she is evidently near term when the massacre takes place - where did half a year go? And there are more questions: how did Bill know she was coming, when the last he'd heard, from Elle Driver, was that she was buried? Are we to suppose that Elle Driver, even in her agony, warned him? (And what happened to Elle anyway? She was blinded, but not not killed) And were Elle and the other assassins so blindly obedient to Bill that they were ready to beat up and kill her and some perfectly innocent people - and why did he want them to, when he could have had the Bride taken out by other assassin methods)? And why did they disperse afterwards, one to become an ordinary mother, one the boss of the yakuza, and one (Elle) who knows what? So, though the acting is good (Uma Thurman's is great), this is even less satisfactory than Vol. 1, in my opinion. The fighting scenes are much more scrappy, less 'artful' than in 1, and the most interest is generated by how the Bride gets out of her bonds and her coffin - which is actually reasonably plausible, if one accepts that her body was not searched.",6,0,1,29 January 2007
Walk the Line," This is the one
","I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash, and as far as I'm concerned Joaquin Phoenix *is* Johnny Cash. The voice is uncannily similar, so that you forget you are seeing an actor portray Cash; it seems like the man himself. I never heard anything much by June Carter, but I am prepared to bet Reese Witherspoon's impersonation of her is equally good; it felt authentic, and the whole performance is a fine demonstration of her range as a very good actress, fully deserving an Oscar. They give tremendous performances of the songs and (in Reese Witherspoon's case) the playful onstage banter. Whether it is fair to June Carter to imply that Cash got even more into pills and drugs out of thwarted love for her, I do not know, but Phoenix does a great job of suggesting Cash's mental turmoil, and when she finally accepts his proposal, on stage ... wow! It was good to see fair renditions of Jerry Lee Lewis and a (very) young Elvis Presley as well. In fact, the performances were uniformly good. It may have oversimplified the facts, and Cash's first wife fades out of the picture without it becoming clear when and how they broke up, but overall this was a great picture.",10,1,2,23 May 2006
Monster," Extraordinary performances.
","I watched this on video and was completely blown away. I thought Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen was extraordinary, not simply in the scenes with the men (especially the 'last john', when she has to shut herself off from the humanity of the man she is about to kill) and in generally suggesting an increasingly out of control personality, but in the scenes with Shelby (Christina Ricci), right up to her near-breakdown when she is putting Shelby on the bus. Despite adverse comments from other reviewers, I consider Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulativeness very well. They dominate the film between them, but the supporting performances are fine also. I gave this 10 out of 10.",10,144,176,20 October 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Doesn't hang together
","There are good things in this: the acting is good, with obvious chemistry between the stars, and there are good scenes, especially (as other reviewers have noticed) the scene where Ben takes Andie to meet his family. But right there is one of the problems. Having been turning herself into an increasingly girlfriend-from-hell character, suddenly Andie blends right in, does not show herself irritating in any way, and proves sharp as a pin in playing the family card game, beating Ben. Doesn't Ben notice the inconsistency? Another that has been noted, that she claims to be a vegetarian after having eaten lobster, is explicable, maybe, in that not all vegetarians avoid fish and seafood, but might at least give him pause for thought. Can't remember what she is shown eating at the family occasion.And then there are the hackneyed features, especially the chase at the end to catch her before she leaves for ever. And for them each to have two 'best friends' might fit reality but seemed a wearisomely familiar plot device.So, I have to say, I have seen rom-coms that hung together better and that I therefore remember with greater pleasure.",6,0,1,9 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Not a great film, but a great performance
","This is, as every comment has surely noted, a tremendous performance by Meryl Streep. She creates a character who is, basically, monstrous, even though at one point she shows vulnerability, just for a while before the armour goes back on. Whether the real life models for Miranda Priestly are quite this tyrannical and demanding I do not know. If there is a flaw, it is that she comes across as almost too beastly: there is no real suggestion that she has the charisma to inspire the (often fearful)loyalty that she gets. Nor do we really get an insight into her motivation, except perhaps the implicit suggestion that she *has* to behave like this to maintain her position, maybe that she fears if she does not, she will be dethroned. The film is subtle in suggesting her limitations - she cannot conceive of anyone not wanting a position like hers - and in giving her the comeuppance she deserves by having Andrea walk away, to give her 'her biggest disappointment'.The film really centres on her much more than on Andrea and the rather moralistic story of her temporary seduction by and final rejection of the world of fashion. In general, I found the characters wholly caught up in this world (Emily and Nigel) much better realised than Andrea's 'normal' friends. Her boyfriend, in particular, is hard to get a handle on, and he is given one of the more questionable lines. In my view, Andrea did *not* do the job just for the clothes and shoes and bags, and it is unfair and narrow-minded to suggest that she did; surely she did it to 'show them' - that she was competent, that she could handle anything Miranda could throw at her (even if she needed help once or twice). It could be said that, in giving him this line, the film is offering too simplistic a choice between workers in the fashion industry who starve themselves to get unrealistic, dangerously thin figures and so are 'bad', and 'normal' near-slobs (we never see the boyfriend in anything approaching a stylish getup, that I can recall) who are 'good'.But for all its imperfections this is worth seeing, and maybe a little more realistic than Ugly Betty.",7,0,0,10 February 2007
Wanted," So ridiculous I had to laugh
","Stated to be based on a graphic novel in another review, and it shows. Secret societies and superhuman powers come right out of the SF/modern fantasy milieu, and so, as at least one other review points out, does 'I am your father'. The frantic action of the chase at the beginning and the final shootout produced many moments where I just had to laugh at the absurdity of all the impossible things being shown. I can't imagine that the likes of Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie needed the money, so I suppose they just did it for fun. I felt they did their best with what the script offered, and James MacAvoy acted his character well - but what a comedown from The Last King of Scotland! Don't expect it to have much connection with reality, and you may enjoy it.",5,2,4,12 September 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Why can't people write like Ed Murrow any more?
","As my title indicates, I was extremely impressed by everything Ed Murrow is presented as saying, which presumably represents what he actually did say. Maybe I'm being unfair to modern-day broadcasters (and being British I don't see American news programmes anyway), but I do not get the impression that anyone working now has that kind of authority.Just hearing the man speak was enough to make this film very worthwhile. I felt that the use of documentary footage was just a little excessive, especially when we got parts repeated, and one did ned to pay close attention to be clear what was going on. It was not always entirely clear who people were, and, no doubt deliberately, the hubbub of comment made catching what any individual was saying difficult at times. But it all felt authentic - and, omigawd, the *smoking*! (None of the women smoked, that I noticed - a tribute to the days when it was felt rather fast, if not a sign of a dissolute or dangerous woman as in film noir?).I hope that everyone who saw this took away some lessons. The use of smear tactics, guilt by association, etc. and the demonising of groups perceived as alien or hostile has not diminished, and is practised all over the world (cf. the President of Iran on Jews); the reluctance of powerful organisations to have their actions questioned and be required to justify them publicly has not diminished.Given that the media played a major role in turning the US against the Vietnam War, some of Ed Murrow's gloom about the future of TV, as expressed in 1958, might be thought excessive. But the points he made are still valid today - and it was very interesting to hear him indicate doubts about American policy in the Middle East, in 1958.",9,3,5,4 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Even to fantasy there must be some limit
","Warning: really serious spoilers.Curiosity led me to tape this off TV, and watch it. I have no fault to find with the acting: Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu, in particular, are excellent, and it is for that, and the undeniably impressive action scenes, that I give a mark of 7. But ...I am not enough of a film buff to recognise all references, influences, etc., but for me the strongest influence is the comic book, and especially what I have seen from my son's collection of anime. This, of course, is fitting, since much of the action of Part 1 takes place in Japan. But it is most like the comic book in its focus on the central characters, who often seem to be moving in a world where the outside world barely exists and certainly does not interfere with their actions to any notable extent (no police pursuit of The Bride after the killing we see first, for instance; no attempts to find her when she's left the hospital). The central character, The Bride, is effectively a superhero; she survives what ought to be mortal wounds (even a shot in the head!); manages to dispose of two men and get herself into a wheelchair, and from that into a car, when just recovered from a bedridden coma lasting 4 years, apparently; fights and disposes of multiple opponents with only a samurai sword, displaying more than Xena-like agility and stamina and taking only minor damage until her climactic duel with Lucy Liu's character. How the child she was carrying is supposed to have survived is not at all clear(cut out of her after she was shot?); but we only learn this at the very end, in a pretty outrageous piece of manipulation. Maybe it is explained in Part 2(not seen yet).This presentation of a character without any explanation of her abilities is not confined to The Bride. Lucy Liu's character becomes an expert assassin - fine; but she then becomes the 'boss of bosses' of all the yakuza in Tokyo. We are not given any hint of how she achieves this amazing feat, simply that she has. By this time, she has acquired an entourage of extremely lethal henchmen (and an equally lethal schoolgirl bodyguard), but The Bride disposes of them all (none of them takes a shot at her, even with a bow - they only use swords and other weapons of similar vintage), while their boss waits to fight the final duel, again with a sword only. Why? There is a good deal of extremely gory slicing off of hands, feet, limbs etc., but all those affected survive - they don't bleed to death, as they surely would without prompt application of tourniquets - especially the lawyer whose arm is cut off at the shoulder. But she must survive, to have information that The Bride wants tortured out of her.Such total disregard for reality grates after a while. Comparisons with LOTR are inappropriate: in that characters cannot overcome great odds absolutely single-handed, they die (or appear to, in Gandalf's case), take wounds, feel fatigue etc. They still achieve their quest, very much against the odds (but they do have some magical help at crucial moments), but they seem much more plausibly human.Ultimately, this film is a series of spectacles, which one is meant to admire without questioning any details of their presentation. I cannot suspend disbelief to that extent; but I will watch Part 2 just to find out how the end happens (I know from reviews the barest outline of what happens in it).",7,1,2,27 January 2007
The Untouchables," Enjoyable hogwash
","It's some time since I read truthful accounts of what happened in Chicago at the time, but I think I would be prepared to bet that virtually nothing in this movie actually happened the way it is presented, if at all. I don't think Elliott Ness killed a single man, for instance - certainly not someone as well known as Frank Nitti! Nor, I think, did Capone have any cops or Treasury officials killed, let alone witnesses in custody (it caused enough trouble when he had a journalist killed).So, watch this for what it is, a sort of modern western with about the same relationship to the facts as most westerns about historical characters. It has lots of enjoyable action, tremendous shootouts, some humour (I liked the accountant going wild and blowing gangsters away right and left), moral dilemmas, etc. and great performances by DeNiro and Drago. But Kostner's character (Elliott Ness) never really came alive for me, and Sean Connery certainly didn't sound American-Irish!",6,7,19,4 December 2004
Love Actually," Funnier than I expected
","I watched this because there was a special offer at the video shop, so it only cost me £1. It was far funnier in places than I expected, and quite subtle in its balancing of love affairs that do take off, generally in unusual circumstances, against failures and other kinds of love, all in pursuit of the theme that 'love is all around'. I have to say, some of the developments are wildly implausible, and Hugh Grant does not convince as a bachelor Prime Minister, who must, to judge from a remark by his sister in the story, be a lot older than he looks (and would either party actually have a leader in his forties who was not merely a bachelor but without any kind of female partner at all? I doubt it). But many of the performances are engaging, especially Bill Nighy as a clapped-out old rock star, and overall it was good fun.",7,0,2,28 October 2006
Gangs of New York," Great spectacle, but ...
","I have read only the first few comments on this film, so may be repeating what someone else has said. So far I have not noticed anyone comment on the relationship between Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam, which is one of the core pieces of the plot. Not knowing who he is, Bill comes to see him as the son he never had, especially after Amsterdam saves his life - later he thinks this is only because he wants to take it himself, but I think Di Caprio gives the suggestion that he is, unwillingly, drawn to Bill as a father figure, nd pleased that he respected Amsterdam's own father, whom he killed (and who had previously beaten Bill but spared his life). The theme of a man taking in his enemy's son, who later is driven by the inexorable laws of feuding to kill him, appears in at least one of the Icelandic sagas, and this is an indication of the primeval nature of the plot - it is an epic or saga.Of course Day-Lewis gives a marvellous performance as Bill the Butcher; but Di Caprio's does not really get us so close to what he is really thinking - what I have written above is very much my own impression. Day-Lewis's accent was not the only one that was all over the place; a lot of the time, Diaz seemed to be sounding Irish - but why would she, if brought up by a 'native'? Bill's hostility to the Irish is, of course, because he is a (bigoted) Protestant and they are Catholics.I was pleased to learn from a review that some details of the Draft Riots as shown were the 'artistic licence' of the writer and director. But I agree with those who think that the presentation of the New York of the day was marvellous, creating a believable if rather alarming world. The battle scene at the beginning, if not wholly realistic or true to the actual nature of gang fights, was absolutely tremendous. But the whole thing dragged rather in the second half - and Di Caprio recovers *remarkably* quickly from a knife wound in the stomach!",7,0,0,26 March 2006
Rock Star," Be careful what you wish for - you may get it.
","Have just finished watching this on video, and looked at various comments. It wasn't bad; it wasn't all that good. There were some nice moments - Timothy Spall good, as always, and I liked the bit when the original lead singer Bobby not only admitted he was gay but took off his wig. I think it showed the difference between leading a tribute band and getting to have a fairly ordinary life otherwise, with a loving girlfriend, and living the rock star life for real, constantly on the move, can't go out and just hang around because you'll be mobbed, your girlfriend bored out of her skull because there's nothing for her to do except what she doesn't want to do (be a vacuous stoned rock chick), women constantly hitting on you just to score with a rock star. And in this case, when finally you start wanting to do your own thing, you can't, you have to sing what other people write, just go on doing the same old thing. So Chris Cole grows up a bit and decides what he *really* wants. Okay, so it's a cliché, and I agreed with a reviewer who said he wanted more characterisation, especially on Chris and Emily and their backstory. But it was quite well acted, I thought; good chemistry between Wahlberg and Aniston (let's be honest, she's the reason I watched the film). In many ways, the first part of the film was the best. So, 5/10.",7,1,3,23 November 2004
