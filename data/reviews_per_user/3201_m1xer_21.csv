Scarface," Al Pacinos Acting Shines more then the Film does.
","The movie is about a 7 out of 10.Al Pacino the Cuban man with a hot head, headed to the top and will stop at nothing to get there is inspiring, cool, and puts the film at 9.Maybe his best performance ever. Even right on par with Michael Corleone in the Godfather and as the Good Cop in Heat. Serpico, A scent of a woman and of course Dog Day Afternoon are some of Als other great performances but his role as Tony Montana is an inspiration to so many excuse me for saying thugs. Thugs I know in town, thugs in the media, thugs in the main-stream like rappers.They all look up to Tony, a fearless man that says all he has in this life are his balls and his word, and he do not break them for anybody.One of the greatest lines in the film is THE WORLD IS YOURS.A neat little message, my favourite scene in the film is right before Tony takes Michelle Pfieffer and about to start his life as the boss half-way through the movie he looks at that blimp flight from American Airlines and the words..THE WORLD IS YOUR flash across the blimp and he takes a drag on his smoke all wounded thinking, I finally made it.This is my time.It also shows what happens when greed, power and coke get to your head. He double-crosses the guys he promises not too...When it is all said and done this 7 out of 10 movie, is pushed to a 9 for Als Performance as the Cuban Tony Montana.A great film and one of the most historic movie characters in the history of Cinema.Pacino shines...the World is Yours!",9,1,3,11 March 2013
The Hangover," A Classic yet a tad overrated IMO....
","Do not shoot.I still gave it 8 out of 10.The second one was ridiculous since it was so similar (even if that was the point) and the fact they are making a third is beyond ludicrous. Just trying to suck in the sheep to make a quick buck, the script will probably suck but I wont judge till I see it.Back to this one, I saw it opening night with little expectations, I only really knew of Bradley Cooper from Hes not that into you, the dick from Wedding Crashers and a cult horror film, Yes Man Midnight Meat Train.This was clearly Coopers time to shine, after this he went on to do thinks like date Anniston, appear in Limitless and Oscar nominated movie which was great Silver Linings Playbook. (Two movies with my favorite actor De Niro to boot)Ya know this was my sisters favorite comedy at the time right after she saw it, claiming it was the funniest movie ever. It did not end there...my brother saw it 6 times in the theater, he never DOES THAT AT ALL so he must of liked it obviously. It really helps me and my friends just stayed at Caesers Palace the year before I saw this and I am from Canada and do not travel a lot. What was also cool was I went to Vegas a month after opening night of this film once again and stayed at MGM and every time I passed by Palace I thought of the film.I do no think this is as funny as Superbad, Knocked Up, Horrible Bosses or even 40 Year Old Virgin, and of course my favourite comedy the Big Lebowski by the legendary Coen Brothers. If you enjoyed the movies I just named, perhaps you will agree that this movie is arguably close but not better then what I named. Well maybe it is right on Par with bosses. I like to class this movie in the likes of classic comedies like There is Something About Mary, or Meet the Parents.Great Fun just not the funniest movie of the decade like some claim!",8,0,2,10 March 2013
The Big Lebowski," Want to get lost in a great movie?
","Unbelievable.I have seen this movie at least 100 times (pretty sure anyway) and I'm not kidding. If your having a bad day, week, year or say you just feel plain angry one day, just simply pop this film in and all your problems are gone for at least 2 hours if not more, in the same sense where you feel good post sex, or post working out. This is also an enjoyable ride thst surely could give you an after-glow so to speak...You notice something new with each viewing, you learn to love the characters and everything their about and you are amazed at how one movie can have so many elements to it (and a comedy at that.) Some people don't understand this movie or they might think it's 'SLOW' if their new to it...but if you have an open mind and you watch this a couple of times it will quickly become a favorite, it's pretty impossible for it not to be.Check it out..you WILL not regret it...man...",10,1,2,27 May 2007
Fight Club," The Best Film of all Time-Life Changing......
","How could a movie entitled, FIGHT CLUB be so deep, so complex, so witty, so flawless....I do not know but I have fallen in love with this movie almost a decade ago and make a point to watching it every couple of months.It is my all time favorite movie, a ten out of ten in every way.The twist is amazing, re-watches make a lot more sense each time and the acting by Pitt, Norton and even Carter put David Finchers Fight Club to a whole new level.My favourite film just ahead of Sixth Sense from 1999, and obviously it is as I just said it is my favourite ever.SO Quotable and so ground-breaking. How deep this movie is breaks all kind of boundaries.PLEASE see this with an open-mind and realize it is not all about fighting, although the CLUB is a major aspect of the film, hence the title.If I could of named it, I probably would of named it Tyler Dudren since it is about Pitts character quite a bit.Like I said I thought I would say something about my favourite film which is a 10-10 but I do not want to give anything away.ENJOY!",10,0,0,10 March 2013
Knocked Up," Realistic Humor, One of the best Comedies Ever Made IMO
","When I went to Knocked up oh, about six years ago in the theatre I was expecting a decent comedy at BEST. Maybe it was because of these low- expectations that it blew me away the way it did. I was not familiar with Apatow at the time although I have seen his other films now that I look back at his credits. I just thought to myself, here is the guy that was funny from 40 year old Virgin (Rogen) and he is getting his own movie, alright well see how this is. The trailer was not very good but I just wanted to be entertained, bottom line.Not only was I more then entertained, but this is actually a good all around film. Could of used without all the Spider Man 3 plugs but it is hilarious, almost every scene. I could totally relate to Rogen and his friends and with how realistic the dialogue was. It is vulgar but then again so is Dumb and Dumber and Something About Mary and are not they comedy classics...surely this is as well.Knocked Up is one of my favourite comedies and I think it is Rogens best film ever and he has had many good ones, in fact this is my favourite Apatow movie also.I re-watch at least a few times a year, Rudd is great as well but Rogen steals the show. This is his finest hour, I love so many of his lines in the flick!Check it out! Awesome movie.",9,0,3,7 March 2013
Horrible Bosses," The three Bosses were more entertaining then the three leads...
","What a great comedy this one was. One of the best of the last few years. I was laughing all the way through this one.But what really stole the show, was the three evil bosses. Jen Anniston FINALLY plays somebody other then Rachel, well I guess she was different in the film Derailed, but she is COMPLETELY original (for her) here.Kevin Spacey is awesome as always as the guy you just want to punch, or KILL I guess would be appropriate here.Colin Farrell is the most surprising one as the cokehead.The three leads had their moments but the bosses were the strength of this one. Very good indeed.A solid 8-10.",8,0,1,8 March 2013
Shutter Island," Awesome Film, Awesome Twist, Awesome Acting
","A film like this is appreciated with repeated viewings, much like the Machinist, The Prestige, Fight Club, Memento, The Uusual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, Psycho, Saw, Identity, basically anything with a real good twist.Not a lot of Scorcese movies have big twist outside the Departed but that was just because of what happens to the characters rather then a plot twist.The twist here makes so much sense. I have seen this film four times now and have liked it more each time.The whole movie you just want to know what is going on. You want to know why is everything so mysterious, why does Leo have these headaches, why are people being sketchy outside of it being a hospital for the criminally insane.A lot of visually striking, eerie shots in this film. Scorcese does a wonderful job as always, and Leo is Leo. Top notch acting, one of his very best performances.This movie is in my collection now and very high on my list. You will not regret seeing this movie, it is not for everybody but you cant help but respect it.A great, great story!9 out of 10",9,0,2,11 March 2013
Forrest Gump," Absolutely amazing in every Way. A top 10 film ever
","Okay, Tom Hanks literally is Forrest Gump and I could write for hours about how good his performance is but instead of doing that why not just briefly write about how perfect this movie is.A mentally challenged (although not fully retarded) man in Forrest who is slow on learning lives the American Dream all meanwhile meeting and being apart of some of the biggest American Moments of the last half century. Ebert was very right when talking about how good the editing in this film was, but not only was it the editing, it was the themes, the amazing soundtrack full of pure nostalgia, it all fit perfect.The Dialogue, quotes, script, acting, direction, music, cinematography were all AMAZING. This film is perfect.It is a REAL movie.It is a tear jerker.You need to put the past behind you in order to move on.I have worn lots of Shoes...It is funny how you can remember some things and some things you cant..Sometimes there just is not enough rocks...This film is incredible. Those above were just some of my favorite quotes.His running scene is a top 10 scene ever. This is a top 10 film ever. And a top 10 performance ever.This film won best picture over Pulp Fiction and Shawshank in 94. Enough Said.10-10.",10,1,1,10 March 2013
Burn After Reading," If you like the Big Lebowski from the Coens or Clooney, Pitt or Mcdormand
","You will like this.Also did I mention John Malkovich who is absolutey hysterical as the fired guy with a drinking problem who freaks out on everyone.What makes the Coens brothers films so successful in comedies is how irrelevant everything is.In the Big Lebowski it was the Dude (Jeff Bridges) having his carpet soiled, and a kidnapping plot with a lot of ins and a lot of outs, while his bowling buddies Buscemi and Goodman help him out.In this movie it is about Malkovich losing his job and then writing a book or a memoir about his life which Brad Pitt and Francis McDormand (both hysterical in their respective roles) steal and believe it is high, top notch CIA material they call Sh**. Malkovich informs them both their in over their heads but the stuff that takes place is just all too hysterical.The Coens have hit comedy gold again, them and Scorcese have to be my favourite directos out there. Nolan and Fincher I enjoy as well.Awesome Comedy here. Not for everybody but that is just how the Coens are. You appreciate it more when you realize the script is supposed to be irrelevant, there-in lies the comedy gold!",9,2,3,10 March 2013
American Beauty," Uh yeah, it is depressing but it is a PERFECT MOVIE and one of the most PUN:INTENDED- Beautiful movies ever!
","Kevin Spacey knocks his role out of the park.Anette B does very well also.The guy who plays Ricky Fits and Colonel Fits are both superb as well.It is a very depressing movie because it is all about people having a difficult time.But its only after disaster that one can come back to life better then ever.Once Spacey has nothing to lose you feel so good and he changes his entire life around. A motivation to us all.His closing sequence at the end is one of the most beautiful scenes in Film History, arguably the greatest ending to any movie ever.This movie is nearly perfect.It proves that no matter how bad your life is going, it is never to LATE to get it all back.One of the most important quotes we can all live by.",9,0,2,10 March 2013
The Machinist," Re-watchable for the fact every line in the Script pretty much foreshadows the twist
","I wont spoil the twist, but this is one of the most fascinating scripts ever. Forget Bale and his amazing performance (even better then his in the Fighter or American Psycho, which were both absolutely amazing) and forget the weight he drops, he is just all around paranoid because he cant sleep for apparently a year. He must of meant a full sleep because you would die if you did not get any sleep for a year.Hallucinations, confusion, paranoia, all of this seems to cost him his friendship and job, making him a loner by nature.The twist to this film makes the movie.The film is dark and its compelling, very slow but not too slow. The movie makes so much more sense once you know why all the weird things in the flick are happening. Once you see the end I highly suggest you watch it a few more times and think hard about every line. This like the Sixth Sense leave you in awe on re-watches making you think, how did I not catch that.Amazing and one of my favourite films. Bales best performance",9,0,0,10 March 2013
American History X," Norton was robbed of best Oscar, should of won Best Picture, Best Racism Film ever
","10 out of 10.Better racism movie then Crash by a lot.Norton is superb, Furlong is good as is Beverly and a lot of the cast.Norton shines though as the neo-nazi skin-head who is pure racist for half of the movie and then a guy who changes his out-look and gets his life back together after a prison sentence in the second half.I really liked how all the flashback scenes were in black and white, yet all the current scenes were in color.Hate is Baggage is one of the central themes of the film, unfortunately it takes tragedy in the movie (Without spoiling anything) and really puts something that has bothered the world for the entire duration of life, racism into perspective.Amazing dialogue, memorable quotes and top notch acting put American History X into my top 5 movies ever and one of the few I have given the distinction of 10 out of 10.Wstch it as soon as possible and be prepared to be blown away.",10,1,5,10 March 2013
The Departed," Amazing, but not Martins best film
","He finally wins best director but that was because he deserved it for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and most definitely Goodfellas. One of the Academys biggest brain farts was robbing Marty of Goodfellas so they give it to him for one of his best films in a decade the Departed.An all star cast of Whalberg, Sheen, Baldwin, Damon, Nicholson and DiCaprio lead the way through this movie of good and evil.A mole, or rat in both the police force and mafia, (Damon and DiCaprio) Leo is the good guy who is paranoid and has to resort to pain killers like Oxy to level his head out and Valium to settle down his anxiety.Damon is a smart kid but grows up in Costello (Nicholsons) mob and becomes a cop, a leader actually who tried to track down the RAT in his unit, who is in fact him so that helps him protect his identity until later in the movie and it backfires.I could of done without a lot of the ending scenes and the murders and all that but the dialogue, story and acting were all compelling. Good shipping up to boston theme, good story, and I was entertained throughout.Well deserving of Best Picture.9 out of 10.Probably my 4th favourite Scorcese Movie.",9,0,0,11 March 2013
Psycho," We all go a little MAD SOMETIMES
","I had this at nine out of ten for the longest time but after a few re- watches and becoming the Hitchcock fan I now am, I must give it a ten.I wont give anything away in this review but it is groundbreaking in so many ways, this film.It has horror, suspense (like most Hitchcock films), drama, mystery, just about everything you need. The surprises are amazing, some of the most memorable scenes in Cinema take place here. The score if fantastic and compelling.The performances are top notch, it is very original and groundbreaking for its time. Shocking at the end and shocking in the middle.This is a true nail biter in every sense that term means. I could see why it is ranked so high. One of the best ever for a lot of reasons.Psycho is a pure 10. Not sure if I have given many movies ten, this deserves it.See it now! Do not waste time with the re-make the original is boss.",10,0,0,10 March 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," The Greatest Revenge Story of All Time
","Well, not only that but perhaps the greatest film of all time as well.Tim Robbins and more-so Morgan Freeman give their best performances ever.It is perhaps a crime this did not win best picture but at least it was nominated and I cant really get to mad as Forrest Gump is a top 10 movie ever.This is 3 hours but it just flies by.The characterization is perfect.One of the most unique dynamics of the film is we all root on Andy Dufresne (Robbins) without knowing for sure if he is actually the murderer or not.We also feel compassion and empathy for Red (Morgan Freeman) even though HE DID commit murder.You get to like these characters a great deal learning about their personality inside the Shawshank Prison.The Wardon and the guards abuse their power making Andys escape one of the most feel good endings of all time.You cant help but smile.A movie everyone should see, numerous times and have in their collection.Get busy living..or get busy dying...",10,0,0,11 March 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Oh Wow, AMAZING in every way. One of the best films ever,best thriller ever IMO
","The Sixth Sense is close.I never really appreciated this movie in the 90s when I was still a teenage but now grown up having viewed it about 20 times I am blown away by Hopkins, Foster, the quotes, the suspense, Buffalo Bill and just ALL the elements and dialogue in-between.Absolutely unreal. So compelling, so interesting and so scary. This movie is my all time favorite horror movie, up there with Psycho and the Shining but in my opinion more enjoyable then both. Psycho has the best twist and is revolutionary and The Shining is more scary but the Silence of the Lambs was rightfully deserving of Best Picture in 1990 and the Academy got it right.What is perhaps most amazing is that Anthony Hopkins is so scary, evil yet he is a character you feel some empathy for and you really do not understand why. His performance sticks with you even though he was not in the film a terrible deal.The villain, serial killer Buffalo Bill is insanely creepy and does a marvelous job acting here. One of the best climaxes I have ever seen. The Score, The Direction, the Acting, and the Script are all amazing here.This is a 10 out of 10 and deserves all the Oscars it got. Lambs is one of my all time favorites.",10,1,1,10 March 2013
Flight," Know what to expect and you will enjoy it, especially if you can RELATE!
","If your one of those people who nitpicks every little thing (Ex- Oh that is not REALISTIC..etc) or what have you, you may be annoyed at some aspects of the film.All in all this is a good look at a situation that can happen, and probably happens more often then not...(Minus the crash)Alcohol and Narcotics play a large role in our lives and sometimes people are addicts and we do not even know to the extent because people like to keep it a secret.Denzel steps out of his norm (Minus Training Day) as the good, clever, sharp and brave guy into a lonely, vulnerable drug addict that we feel sympathy for despite all of his wrong-doings, because the film exploits the fact nobody is perfect.A feel good ending to a pretty compelling story. I have heard many people call this film boring because they were expecting another CON AIR or Red Eye....but this is much deeper then that with good performances.A very solid 8-10 in my book.",8,0,3,4 March 2013
Casino," Sharon Stone is over the top but it is still A CLASSIC
","You will want to strangle Sharon Stone in all likely-hood after watching this flick, my friend and brother both did.However De Niro is BOSS in this movie.Pesci brings his bad apple character from Goodfellas and even ups it in this one as Nicky.De Niro steals the show though, this is his MOVIE to shine and does a great job.Scorcese did not win best director for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Goodfellas which is mind-boggling so surely he will win for Casino. Right.. Riiiight.Nope.He was robbed, yet again so finally he won for Departed in 07. Thank god.This flick is probably not as good as Goodfellas but I liked it more when I first watched both. Now Goodfellas ranks higher but this is still a masterpiece.9 out of 10.Quite simply, awesome in every way. Very cool.",9,1,2,11 March 2013
Heat," DeNiro meet Pacino...Viewer meet Acting HEAVEN!
","The two greatest actors of all time or this generation anyway finally face off. Yes they were in Godfather 2 but at different parts.In this three hour Michael Mann LA Crime Saga that flows very smooth and is very dynamic, the two do not go face to face until the half-way mark.Their scene in the LA Diner where they actually call the table they sit at NOW (THE TABLE) where many fans ask to sit to this day is top notch. One of the best acted scenes ever.It is good cop (Pacino) against top heist man De Niro and both characters do not have a perfect like but hey feel compassion and empathy for one another SAYING they wont like having to gun the other man down, yet they will if they have to because their morals are too high. Both men believe to the core in what they are doing so their acting is very believable. Judd, Kilmer, Voight, among other recognizable names appear in the movie and only make it better.The LA bank robbery half-way through the movie is an amazing shoot-out scene. Very intense, suspenseful.The quotes in this movie are amazing and really stick with you.I say what I mean and I do what I say -Pacino Life is Short the only time we got is luck -De NiroPlus Pacino has a lot of comic relief.There is a great message the movie sends. Everything makes sense and at times you miss things so a repeated viewing is pretty necessary for s film like this, it helps you appreciate it more.There is a subplot about family, divorce, suicide, depression, monogamy, morals and what-not, this is an extremely well-balanced film with action, acting, story line, messages, quotes, one of the best crime movies ever.In fact, one of the best all around films of all time as far as I an concerned.9.9 out of 10.Do not only watch, add it to your collection.",10,1,4,10 March 2013
Goodfellas," Wanted more De Niro but it still a perfect 10.
","The greatest MOB film ever, just ahead of Godfather 1 and 2 IMO.De Niro, Pesci and especially Liota shine.This film contains perhaps my favourite scene ever where Robert De Niro does not say one word in the entire scene, he smokes and smiles and glares at a guy he is plotting to kill and the smile takes place when he looks at Pescii. That is acting he does not have to say one word.Scorcese is amazing with his direction. That scene Liotta takes his date Karen to the restaurant and they follow them from the back to the table is directing perfection.This film is based on the real story of Henry Hill.The Dialogue is again top notch.One of the best scripts ever.Some of the coolest characters to ever hit the screen.A great film all around, a masterpiece. Not many better.A top 5 movie ever in my honest opinion.",10,0,0,11 March 2013
The Godfather," A movie you cant refuse
","This is a trilogy that has Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in each one but in this film he goes from the nice, innocent boy in love who has a great respect for his father (Marlon Brando) to the leader of the family. THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.I do not.I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything. The morals, the messages, the family values, the acting, the story, the action, the characters, everything in this film is flawless.This movie is one you need to be in the mood to watch due to the length and its time, but you feel slick after watching so many performances.This what film-making is all about.This is Cinema.One of the greatest movies ever made and it will be like that for years to come.A movie that will never be forgotten.A movie....you just cant refuse!10.",10,1,1,11 March 2013
