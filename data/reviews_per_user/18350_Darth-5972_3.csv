Catch Me If You Can," OK... You got me!
","This is a strange kind of 'feel good' film in a 'not too feel good' World. But you do leave the cinema uplifted! For me, Hanks can do no wrong... he was superb as usual. Hot on the trail of Gangs of New York, DiCaprio was very good... Can he now finally be forgiven for The Beach?! Perhaps these two should team up more often! I am definitely NOT the type to want the bad guy to escape, but found myself willing DiCaprio on! If only more 'bad guys' could put their talents to better use.",8,1,2,4 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breathtaking!
","As a keen fan of the book, I was anxious that the film 'did not let me down' as so many films of the book often do. The 'Fellowship of the Ring' was... TRULY AMAZING! The scenery, photography, characters were so 'breathtaking'... Thank you!",10,1,1,13 January 2003
Gangs of New York," What's the point?
","Having read all the reviews, both good and bad, I saw this film with an 'open mind'. Unfortunately, I left the cinema with the same 'open mind'! This film did nothing to 'fill in the blanks'!Some of the scenes were excellent and much of the photography was brilliant but... who were these 'vacuous' characters?! I was expecting much more and was sorely disappointed.",4,4,10,13 January 2003
