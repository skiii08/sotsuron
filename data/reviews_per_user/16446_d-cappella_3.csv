Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A movie about monsters, perhaps more real than you might think
","This is an enjoyable alternate history movie which seems to me, more than anything else, to be a movie that you can walk away having learned something about fighting bloodthirsty monsters. The acting is done quite well, with Benjamin Walker playing a somber and surprisingly believable young president. I especially liked how Lincoln was portrayed as having an unstoppable work ethic and astonishingly strong convictions (both in terms of fighting vampires and more social evils such as slavery).Watching the movie, I was struck by the sheer will and tenacity displayed in Lincoln to defeat what must have seemed to him to be an inexorable force that was bent on not only claiming his own identity for the worse (changing him to a vampire) but also society at large. I also thought that there was sufficient attention brought to the fact that vampires were not all irredeemably cruel, but that they could also display nobility. In a lot of ways this parallels each of our own struggles with the darkness within ourselves, our pride and selfishness. But ultimately this movie teaches that through faith and love and an indomitable courage and camaraderie, we can overcome. Perhaps, like Lincoln, we have a battle to fight, and the outcome will determine the nature of our very soul.",8,3,7,22 June 2012
Avatar," Good visual effects overshadowed by unoriginal artistry and ideas
","I don't claim to be a professional film critic, but I did want to through my two cents out about the new movie 'Avatar,' which everyone is raving about. Yes, the special effects are amazing; yes, it costs lots of money to do. But when I watch a movie I like to see creative genius at work, and honestly I don't think Avatar really delivered in that department. People go on about how great a world 'Pandora' is, except they overlook the fact that almost all the animals in it are loosely based off exaggerated versions of earth beasts. Even the na'vi people seem to be based on a sort of half-man, half-cat mentality. Throw the marines in and it seems to be nothing more than a movie based off of Halo.The plot is predictable to the point of annoyance, the marine general goes down in a classic 'Custer's last stand' sort of scenario. In fact the resemblance of the na'vi to native Americans (from their pantheistic spiritualism to their dress) is almost ridiculous. And at the end when the na'vi simply kick the humans out, there remains a glaring question: what happens when the humans strike back? It didn't seem to me that the humans had thrown all they had at the na'vi; the movie didn't resolve the conflict at all between the two races. Rather, I would expect the na'vi had awaken a sleeping giant with their courageous, however naive, stand against the technology and supposedly large population of the 'sky people.' I mean lets be real here.Yes its a great movie from a cinematographic standpoint, but artistically speaking it pales in comparison to other great films. And of course it doesn't stimulate any serious thought beyond its simplistic environmental message. The only other redeeming feature I could think of was its appeal to a certain morality - the idea that the corrupt businessmen were evil, and that the 'peopleness' of the na'vi was something that gave them a certain intrinsic value on equal footing with humans (although at the end it almost seemed like humans were the ones that had lost their humanity over the na'vi).Maybe I've missed something big about this movie, but from my standpoint its like this: Good movie? Yes. Great movie? Maybe. Groundbreaking movie? Hardly.Thanks for letting me give my two cents, have a nice day.",6,1,4,14 January 2010
Groundhog Day," Surprisingly good film which gets one thinking
","I have never seen a film that so encapsulates the value of our inner self given that time no longer matters. As Bill Murray lives the same day over and over, we learn that given eternity, the only factor that will change is the person experiencing eternity. We see this through him learning French, the piano, ice sculpting. But I think more intriguing than that is the way Phil learns about the people in the small town. I was incredibly impressed by the scene in which he points out several townspeople and tells their stories. Eternity isn't just about one person, but about finding out about everyone else too.I was also intrigued by the small comparison that was made to God. Obviously Phil was nowhere near divinity, but in one aspect I think the movie approached it - the idea of God outside time. Since Phil could just live the same day over and over, he could really get to know every single person in the town, he could figure out what they needed most at certain times and provide help in the best way he could. In a way, this is an incredible insight into the nature of God, and for Christians it is rather exciting since we believe that every day for God is like Phil's day - lasting for an eternity and in that eternity God can give each of us his own personal treatment and help us out when we most need it. Sorry if that sounds a little overly religious, but it really is what attracted me the most to the film.Finally, the film leaves us with the perfect blueprint of how to live life - as if it were to last for an eternity (and for Christians this is true). This means getting to know people and also changing ourselves for the better over time - not superficially like the weather.",10,0,2,30 January 2010
