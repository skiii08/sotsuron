Blade Runner 2049," Bladerunner? More like blade crawler at such a slow pace I can't deal with it
","Without a doubt the most boring, slow moving movie I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through in my entire life. Only got through the whole thing because my flatmate was watching it and I hadn't nothing else to do. 
Absolutely nothing made sense, nothing pieces together, everything was messy and it was so. Damn. Slow. That I nearly dozed off several times. 
Boring is too good of a word for this movie. 
I would not recommend to anyone, ever.",1,4,8,24 June 2018
