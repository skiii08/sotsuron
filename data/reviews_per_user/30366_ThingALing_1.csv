Blade Runner 2049," Brilliant, beautiful, philosophical flick.
","Direction, cinematography, and plot points, and the technological / man+machine and general human themes explored were all excellent in my opinion. The score was outstanding too.A lot of these reviews seem to be drawing too many comparisons to the original, in my opinion, which is really needless. It's a different movie. Of course there are some things in the first that won't be done again (nor should). It has a more minimalist tone in some ways than the original, while being wide and expansive. It's 'philosophical explorations' were not 'in your face'. I normally love at least a couple of laughs in my movies, and while there was not a single laugh in this, it didn't need one. Honestly, I don't know what some reviewers expect in a movie -- I assume utter perfection by their standards. It's an excellent movie. There are things I would do differently, but really, it's amazing that I can see something like this. I'm sad to see it did not have a good opening weekend.",10,1,9,7 October 2017
