The New World," terrible, awful, couldn't have been worse
","Although my tag line pretty much sums it up, I guess I'll have to elaborate here. Saw this detritus at the dollar theater and walked out. One of those movies that stinks from the get go, but you hang in thinking to yourself, 'surely this must get better at some point.' Well, it doesn't. The acting was awful, there was basically little to no dialog, and the directing was so heavy handed, it bordered on oppressive. The only redeeming thiing about this movie was that the costumes and set appeared to be very period correct. And I had to think long and hard to come up with something redeeming about the movie. Ugh. Spare yourself the agony and rent Braveheart.",1,2,9,12 February 2006
