Casablanca," A Little Something for Everyone
","At one point or another, every film lover has heard someone utter one of the many infamous quotes from 'Casablanca'. Lines like 'Here's looking at you, kid', or 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', have entered American culture and become part of the language. The reason the film is so popular, even among modern audiences, is because of how personal the subject matter was to audiences - and the cast, too - at the time the film was released. It truly is a film for everyone. The cast features Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles, and is supported by an array of incredible character actors including Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, and Dooley Wilson. These actors don't just put on a spectacle for the viewer to watch; they create an organic, multi-faceted, and culturally diverse community. Rick's nightclub is home to this community where secrets are kept hidden – or discovered – and people are forced to decide where there loyalties lie. 'Casablanca' deserves a point all its own on the timeline of American film history. It's romance and it's drama; it is an uplifting comedy and a geopolitical thriller. No matter how you describe it, it is a piece of history.",10,2,3,11 March 2013
Chinatown," Chinatown
","Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' is one of the greatest films of the 1970s for a couple of reasons:Firstly, it stars two of New Hollywood's biggest actors, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, in the leading roles. Dunaway played Bonnie Parker, the infamous bank robber, in Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde', a film that hearkened back to the gangster films of the thirties. Nicholson starred in 'Easy Rider' (1969) and 'Five Easy Pieces' (1970), two central films in the counterculture movement of the sixties that also cemented his status as a A-list star. These two actors have perfect chemistry on screen. Secondly, in the same way 'Bonnie and Clyde' was molded after classic gangster films, 'Chinatown' is modeled after film noirs of the forties and fifties. Nicholson plays Private Investigator Jack Gittes, a man whose job it is to spy on other peoples' social lives. This theme of voyeurism is consistent throughout the film, from the opening scene where one of Gittes' customers looks at photos that Gittes has taken of his wife with another man, to later shots of Gittes spying on a man from faraway through binoculars. The lens of the binoculars forms the frame. In scenes such as this, Polanski uses depth within the frame much the same as film noir utilized lighting. In many scenes throughout the film, the camera is placed far back from the characters and the action to create a feeling of suspense. This is what the old film noirs would have looked like in color.Nicholson's character in 'Chinatown' is an embodiment of the troubled male hero in countless film noirs. Something that happened in his past as a cop working in Chinatown haunts him day and night; he isn't comfortable talking about it. Chinatown itself is an enigmatic place that represents Gittes past, and it back to Chinatown where the story ultimately takes him. All of this aside, the film's story is an ingenious mystery that will have anyone holding their breath until the very last moments.",10,2,4,24 April 2013
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","'Annie Hall' is like a how-to book on the dos and don'ts of relationships. Well, not all relationships so much as Woody Allen's relationship with Diane Keaton, both of whom star in the film. This film is the most well known of Allen's 'Woody Allen plays himself' films. The fact that the film was such a hit with American audiences in 1977 - and remains just as beloved today - is a testament to the film's legacy. That 'Star Wars' performed so poorly is perhaps a bolder statement, though it is hardly the 'better' film.The editing and cinematography by Gordon Willis define 'Annie Hall'. Many shots in the film consist of long takes wherein the camera sweeps through the room, following Allen and Keaton as they have long conversations about every topic imaginable. Allen consistently breaks the fourth wall by either addressing the camera directly or by literally walking in to scenes from his past. The split-screen photography during some of these scenes is remarkable.Both Allen and Keaton's personalities are so ingrained in their characters that it's a wonder why Allen didn't simply keep their first names the same while writing the script. I suppose it is all just a part of his sense of humor. This sense of humor pervades the film. Much of the jokes are more gags than jokes, centered on Allen's lofty soliloquies about the nature of death and the beauty of New York, as well as his frustration with people less intelligent than him, which seems to be everyone. For someone who enjoys this type of humor, 'Annie Hall' will no doubt entertain. The fact is, though, this story (the story of love and loss) has been done before, many times, and with more subtlety and grace. Still, it is worth a watch.",6,0,0,24 April 2013
Singin' in the Rain," 'Make 'Em Laugh!'
","'Singin' in the Rain' is part musical, part comedy, and part romance, but it is always all of these things at the same time. The story follows Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a famous silent movie star, and his friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) as they brace for Hollywood's transition into the Age of Sound. This period in film history serves only as a backdrop for one of the most lavish films ever made. In addition to the comedy, what makes 'Singin' in the Rain' so memorable is the dance numbers. Watching O'Connor flail around during 'Make 'Em Laugh' is hilarious and nerve-wracking at the same time, and Gene Kelly's infamous 'Singin' in the Rain' epitomizes the film's spirit.The 'Broadway Melody' sequence that Gene Kelly pitches to producers toward the end of the film is often cited as a flaw for slowing the film's pace. This is just wrong. If the sequence had been omitted or cut in any way, the film would be less brilliant for it. Every aspect of this scene is a work of technical genius. Watching Kelly and dancer Cyd Charisse move across the pastel pink background, Charisse's sash blowing around her with amazing flourish, is one of the most incredible experiences I've had watching a movie. 'Singin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of that kind of great film that unites its audience through pure, unfettered entertainment. It's loud, it's colorful, and it's funny as all hell. The film isn't just about love or the importance of doing the right thing, though it's characters are very much concerned with those things. The film itself - every song, every dance, every screaming fan chasing after Don Lockwood in his car - is about how movies can be magical experiences that remove us from our lives and force us to have fun for a little while. Even if we don't need it.",10,0,2,24 April 2013
