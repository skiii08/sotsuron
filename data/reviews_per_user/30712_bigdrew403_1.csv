Scarface," Unforgettable
","Scarface is one of the most unforgettable movies of all times. Pacino gives an awesome performance as a Cuban drug lord who rises and falls. Even though the movie has extensive violence and language it only shows the life these people have to go through and shows the intensity of their lives. I think the movie has a good concept in it saying that doing this isn't the best life to live. Oliver Stone shows what a great writer he is mixing the old version into the new in very subtle ways. Although there are some instances in which you can see the old version in some ways, I personally do not think of this movie as a remake of any kind. This movie if anything is all its own.",10,0,0,4 May 2001
