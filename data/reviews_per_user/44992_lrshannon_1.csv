Walk the Line," A must see movie
","Walk the line was an excellent movie.Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar for his performance as Johnny Cash.His voice sounded just like Johnny's.Reese Witherspoon was also excellent as June Carter Cash.I hope they will make a sequel to this movie,in Johnny and June's later years with Joaquin and Reese as the stars.I really believe Johnny and June were made for each other.When you see them perform,you could see their love for each other.Love like that only comes once in a lifetime.Joaquin had Johnny's moves perfect,and Reese had Juns's perfect.They worked perfectly together.I grew up listening to The Carter Family,and lived very close to where they lived and grew up.Johnny and June will be forever missed.",10,0,0,9 March 2006
