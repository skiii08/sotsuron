The Blair Witch Project," A Complete Mess
","I was looking forward to a great horror film when I rented The Blair Witch Project, not all the stupid slasher stuff like whats in most horror films today but some really creepy and truly scary stuff without all the blood and guts like in The Others and such, but all I got was an hour of boredom and a very scary couple minutes at the end. Unfortunetely this is not anywhere near enough to have a good film, the majority of it has to be good not just the last five minutes. The way they filmed it was very interesting, they didn't tell the actors what to say or what would happen, the actors also did almost all the camera work making it bouncy and confusing which could and has made some films even scarier but in this case just gets annoying. The performances are horrible especially the girl, she is just horrible, and deserved her Razzie and should get a lifetime acheavment award from them because she has been just as bad in all her other stuff. The story and direction are the only things that work at all. The last five minutes are terrifying but everything else just stinks.",4,0,2,1 December 2005
Walk the Line," Better Than Ray!
","Ray was a very good movie and on my top ten of 2004, but only at number ten. It had a powerful performance by Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. He had it all down. The walk, the talk, the piano playing. The only things that hurt him was near mediocre direction and the fact they wouldn't let him actually do the singing. Walk the Line is on the other hand a wonderful movie. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years. Not the best of the year because 2005 was extremely strong but surly number two to only Brokeback Mountain. Walk the Line has two great performances to Rays one, both of which are much better than Foxx's as well. Joaquin Pheonix, an actor we have all known has great talent after his turns in such films as Gladiator and Signs has finally gotten a great roll. He gives what is easily his best performance as Johnny Cash. He knows the character better than probably anybody but June ever did. He gets the voice right, and all the mannerisms. It is not just an impersonation. Anyone can do some sort of a Johnny Cash impersonation while Pheonix creates a full and amazing character. Reese Witherspoon is a less proved actor in my opinion with a wonderful turn in the underrated Pleasantville to help her. I have now finally decided that she can actually really act and that it was no fluke. Her performance as June Carter is on the same shelf as Joaquin Pheonix's. She gets the tone and who knew she could sing? The supporting performances are also very good but are unfortunately overshadowed by the two leads. Dallas Roberts is though particularly good as the man who gets Cash started. The direction is a little by the book but since when has that really hurt? Doing something risky is the way to making a masterpiece but who says that by the book hurts a movie? The movie made me listen to Cashs songs and I really loved them. It made me feel great. It is some of the most fun I have had at the movies in years. It also just grows on you each time you see it.",9,3,6,5 March 2006
3:10 to Yuma," One of the Few Remakes to Be as Good as the Original
","This is one of the few remakes that is just as good as the original. I only had one qualm. It was that Wade was less menacing this time, due to the fact that he kept trying to escape. In the original it's more chilling because he never once try's to run. He just waits. The ending is also not as good as the original, but it worked. Before this film I never thought much of Mangold as a director. Walk the Line was pretty good, but the direction was the worst part of the picture. Here it is the best. He carry's the film, makes it wonderful. It's him that makes it as good as it is, the other great things just help. He points the camera directly where it should be, and with the right angle. He creates a nerve wracking mood. He has no chance at Oscar attention, but he deserves it. The performances are fantastic as well. The two leads are Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Crowe is fine as a semi psychopath. He is chilling, and it's his best work since the beginning of the decade. Bale is better though in Van Heflins roll. He is the most likable character in the film, and the best drawn. This helps Bale, but the character wouldn't have worked if played as it should have. Bale changes the character that's on the page, into something else. By the end he is less likable, and more relatable than I would have guessed. The supporting performances are also fine. Ben Foster in particular was brilliant. He was truly scary, and completely believable. I also really liked Peter Fonda as the aging hit-man who was a sort of psychopath himself. The cinematography was also very impressive, as was the score. Both are Oscar worthy in my opinion. The script was great, and much more realistic and heartfelt than I expected. All in all this is a very underrated film, and one of the best of the year. A masterpiece in everyway. I really enjoyed it as entertainment, and it also managed to be a work of art.",9,3,7,8 January 2008
The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard
","The Longest Yard is a flat and pointless exercise in Adam Sandler's homophobic and sexist jokes, Chris Rocks racist jokes that hang on bad language, and Burt Reynolds's stupid smile and for him to act young once again. The story is horrible, it was horrible in the original but the rest of the movie was good enough to almost cover it up. The screenplay is crap, the dialogue is their but really sucks, the characters are'nt even there. The acting is horrible, Adam Sandler has given so many bad performances, more than any other actor has, but has also given two amazing one's in Punch Drunk Love, and Splanglish. The direction is horrible, this director has done similar things with all his films, all of which really suck. The visual effects are fair, but look fake very often.",4,3,5,23 October 2005
Casablanca," Wonderful
",Casablanca is a flawless film that is both sad and hilarious. It is a wonderful melodrama that keeps you hooked and although it is not in my top ten films it is a great film. The plot is wonderful and always makes perfect sense. It is a little melodramatic yes but how could they keep our attention with something more like real life. The screenplay is just as amazing with flawless and quotable dialogue and amazing twists and characters. The performances are the best part of the movie. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances and is amazing but it is Ingrid Bergman who is the standout. She gives one of the best performances in movie history. The direction was also flawless and deserved the Oscar for sure. The visual effects are very good but not as flawless as the rest of the movie. They sometimes look fake but always work fine the way they are. Casablanca is a classic that should be seen by everyone. Particularly teenagers. That may sound weird but its true. We really connect with it.,10,1,2,4 January 2006
Friday Night Lights," Ruined By Camera
","Friday Night Lights looked like it was going to be a great football film, but it falls apart for several reasons which I'm about to explain. The story is genius, its a great true story and deserved a better script. The script is not altogether bad, it has good dialogue and some of the players are fairly well put together, as is one of the fathers, they are good characters but the screenplay fails to develop its lead played by Billy Bob Thornton at all, we really know nothing about this guy, and we never really do, plus we really want to. The acting is generally really good, Billy Bob Thornton gives a great performance but he still can't get over the lack of a character. The direction is what really ruins the movie, its simply mediocre, but its biggest problem is the choice to film it with a bouncy hand-held camera that flashes around so you can barely see anything. The visuals are fair, but not great. Because of the camera the film may not be worth watching.",5,1,2,17 November 2005
I'm Not There," An Apt Film About The Great Character of Bob Dylan
","Quite an interesting film. I'm a huge fan of experimental cinema, and this was the first real big film like this I've seen in a while. Everything didn't work, but it mostly did. More worked well then failed. I found Blanchett's and Ledger's parts to the be the best, and the worst to probably be Franklin's or Bale's. Performance wise I was most impressed with Blanchett, just like everyone else. She was perfect. Ledger and Whishaw were both also great, and there wasn't a bad member of the cast. I was very impressed with Haynes control over the film. This was one of the best directed films of the year. He knew what was happened all the time, and made a sort of controlled chaos. It's the most you can ask for in a direction. The film is very well made, but not for everyone. It never quite reaches greatness, but that hardly ever happens in films. This was a fine film, and an apt story of the character of Bob Dylan.",8,0,0,6 May 2008
Fight Club," Amazing, and Life Changing
","Fight Club is an amazing film, it is also a very disturbing film. Fight Club is also one of the few movies that can change your life, or at least how you look at it. The story is extremely good, and as a warning it's very, very disturbing, and very hard to explain much about it without giving the hole movie away. The screenplay should have won an Oscar, the dialogue is amazing, the characters amazing, and just how they put everything together is amazing. The acting is amazing, some of the best ever filmed, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are all completely amazing. The direction is a little weaker, but not by any means bad. Fincher has a way of putting his characters, and audience through hell, and making the audience love it. The visual effects are also amazing, and always look very real, and very disturbing. I love this movie, I love every little thing about it.",10,1,3,11 October 2005
Citizen Kane," A True Classic
","Citizen Kane is a classic, a truly great movie, one of the best movies ever, it is completely great. Rosebud is such a great line, I loved this movie. The story is amazing, everything is amazing, it truly won an worthy Oscar. The screenplay is also truly great, the dialogue and characters and everything are great. The acting is great, Orson Welles is amazing in the lead, great. The direction is great, Orson Welles again is a very talented filmmaker in every way, he's a great actor, great writer, great director, and this is his best film. The visual effects are great, amazing. Its great for now, much less 1941, how did they get so great visual effects than, they didn't exist. Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever put on film, every one should see it.",10,21,35,16 November 2005
Two for the Money," Pacino Deserved Better
","Al Pacino is one of those few actors who you willing to by an admission ticket to watch just sit in one place for two hours. He can be in a horrible movie and make it worth watching. He has done this before in Gigli and The Godfather part 3, and he does it again in Two For the Money. The rest of the film around Pacino is horrible, the other performances particularly in Rene Russo as his wife are just cringe inducing. The script is heavy handed with completely flat characters and dialogue, and completely pointless scenes and characters. The direction is also heavy handed. Every scene is marked, scared with this young directors steal hand. Even with all the wreckage mentioned above Pacino almost saves it. He gives his character life even if the one's around him are lacking there of. He makes the movie almost worth watching. See it for free if you can.",5,1,2,19 May 2006
Lords of Dogtown," Extremely and Surprisingly Fun
","Lords of Dogtown is a extremely fun picture, a pure blast of energy, every second is worth watching. And after saying all this I have to say I hate skateboarding with a passion. The film could have focused simply on the skateboarding, and would have been a cult classic for skateboarders between the ages of 12 and 15, but would be hated by anyone else. Instead it focuses on the characters making it interesting to everyone, and a great movie. The story is very good, it is about the guys who redefined skateboarding, making it more of a sport than a way to get from place to place, more like surfing. The screenplay has very good dialogue and characters, and is put together almost perfectly. The acting is genius, Emile Hirsch and Heath Ledger both should get Oscar nominations, everyone else is also good, but not as good. The direction is great, she has decided to shoot it all with a hand-held camera, and that was a perfect idea. The visual effects are very good, almost every part is good. A good film for everyone even adults.",8,0,12,22 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Much Better Than I Expected
","Well I'll start by saying that I really liked it, not quite the first one but still the best film I've seen so far this year. The special effects are brilliant, as is the entire technical aspect of the film. Many people people are complaining that it doesn't have enough plot, I plea the opposite, in fact it has too much plot and is occasionally confusing. And now to the performances. Johnny Depp is in my opinion several steps behind his performance in the original(Which I consider to be one of the best ever) He is still quite good though. Keira Knightley has proved that she is a very good actress with two Oscar worthy performances in Bend it Like Beckham and Pride and Prejudice. Here she seems lost, and gives one of the films worst performances. Orlando Bloom surprised me with his best performance since his underrated turn in Black Hawk Down(Something he has failed to get even close to living up to) He actually gives a performance that could be considered decent. Bill Nighy should get Oscar consideration(If eligible) for his brilliant portrayal of Davy Jones. He is rather perfect. Tom Hollinder is extremely disappointing in the other villain roll, he was so good in both Pride and Prejudice and Gosford Park, and here is simply embarrassing. In all a extremely good adventure film.",6,2,6,14 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Brilliant Special Effects
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great fantasy/family/action film, it is very flawed, mostly through the direction and performances of the four central children, the timing was also a little off. We already had several good fantasy action and even family films out this year such as, Batman Begins, Robots, War of the Worlds, King Kong, Star Wars 3, Harry Potter 4. That is simply too many of this kind of film in one year to fully appreciate them all. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is second rate to most of these films, the effects to King Kong, and War of the Worlds, and all around to King Kong, and Batman Begins. Tilda Swintons performance is amazing and more than makes up for the others. She catches ever moment perfectly. She should have gotten an Oscar nomination. You should see Narnia because it is a very good film, but there are better one's out there.",8,1,2,18 May 2006
Madagascar," Kids Will Love It
","Kids under thirteen will love it, but everybody over thirteen will hate it, loath it. Madagascar is a film that tries to live off of its stars, but even the stars just don't work. Ben Stiller and Chris Rock who are usually reliable comic performers, but they really suck, in other words don't work at all. The story is horrible, its kinda original but there's a reason for that and that is because it is so bad, horrible. Thats why it hasn't been used before. The screenplay is almost as bad, the dialogue is extremely cheesy, and the characters don't exist. The acting is horrible as I said earlier. The direction is horrible, its not very good at all. The visual effects are great, the only good thing in it. Let kids watch it.",3,0,4,16 November 2005
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Best Animated Film of All TIme
","South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is the feature length version of the TV show South Park. It is longer; more fully developed, and better animated then the brilliant show. It is also more vile and offensive; generally it's more in most ways, whether good or bad. The first three seasons of South Park were created purely with construction paper, after that they began to have more and more computer's involved and now they have images in a data base on the computer that they can move around with the mouse. The movie was the first thing they did with more computers than drawings and cutouts. This was a big step and now the episodes look much better, but have unfortunately lost some of the original look they had. The general plot of the movie is that four eight year old kids from South Park Colorado go to see an R-Rated Canadian movie and learn swear words from it. They begin using these words and are eventually sent to therapy, meanwhile their parents wage war on Canada for stealing the innocence of youth. It basically gets weirder from there on when characters such as Satan, Saddam Hussein, and the kids teacher Mr. Garrison show up. The plot is surprisingly tight and well written for being so difficult to explain; in fact the screenplay is the strongest aspect of the movie. It weaves through the odd world of South Park and makes it believable enough to be hilarious. It also has some of the most quotable lines in movies of late. The animation here was the beginning of using computer animation for the series and while not entirely computer animated most of it was. It works so well though because often it still looks like cardboard even when it isn't. It's 2D and looks incredibly simple, but of course isn't. South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one of the funniest movies out there and it's not just because of the crude jokes. It's because of the political commentary, most of which is spot as well as hilarious, and the fact that it's simply so well done. It's a perfect example of the power of animation because it's not just hilarious but for once you actually feel for the South Park characters.",10,0,0,10 October 2007
Alexander," A Complete Mess
","I could not wait to see Alexander, even with all its bad reviews. Unfortunitely it lives up to these reviews rather well. Oliver Stone maybe my favorite director, he at least was before Alexander. Watching some of my favorite actors such as Anthony Hopkins make fools of themselves didn't really feel good as well. Oliver Stones direction is more awful than imaginable, one of the worst jobs of direction ever, by one of the best directors. The screenplay is awful as well, the dialogue wooden, and everything else simply confusing. The visual effects are sometimes great, but usually they look so fake. The costumes are the only truly great thing in this picture. Do not watch if you value your sanity!!!!! If you like Alexander you might also like the much better, actually watchable Troy.",2,4,6,6 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," The Best of the Year
","Brokeback Mountain has been called many things that include 'The Gay Cowboy Movie' and 'Racist' The film is far from being either, on the other hand it is pretty much the opposite of racist and calling it 'The Gay Cowboy Movie' Is a huge mistake. First of all about the gay cowboy thing they are presumably bi-sexual, not homosexual, and they may even not be that because particularly Ennis doesn't seem to be interested in any other men besides Jack. Brokeback Mountain is also in my opinion and instant classic, and a film everyone should see at one point or another. The plot: Two men in their early twenties try out for a summer job of caring for and herding several hundred sheep on Brokeback Mountain together. They are Ennis Del Mar a soft-spoken disturbed man who has a woman (Alma) waiting to marry him when he returns. And Jack who is the elder of the two is more outspoken and used to and easier life. He is also the first to give in to the desire he feels for Ennis. They learn that one has too sleep illegally up on the peak of the mountain with the sheep to take care of them and that the other will stay at the main camp cook and such. One day they shoot an elk and have a party. They get drunk and it gets dark and they decide Ennis should just stay there for the night. He at first sleeps outside he tent but after getting really cold moves in with Jack. After some awkward situations they make love. The next day they are both scared and disturbed and say to each other that it was a one-time thing but they both know they want more. After several days they fall into bed again, and again and slowly fall in love. Jack and Ennis part at the end of the summer, both marry Ennis to Alma and Jack to a rodeo cowgirl named Laureen in Texas. They both have children and don't meet again for four years. This chain of events leads to a twenty yearlong secret love affair on Brokeback Mountain. Brokeback Mountain is one of the hardest films to watch since Raging Bull, and possibly one of the best since than too. The performances in particular are wonderful. Jake Gyllenhaal is in my opinion the stand out as Jack, he gives the best male supporting performance since Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys, and I will venture to say one of the best ever. Heath Ledger would probably come in second as Ennis. He gives a performance that reminds us of a young Marlon Brando. Ledger is completely unrecognizable in his roll, he has been for a long time a teen heart throb playing in movies like A Nights Tale and Ten Things I Hate About You, but this year he has really come into his own giving two wonderful performances in Lords of Dogtown and Brokeback Mountain. Michelle Williams plays Alma and although she can't top the men she still gives a wonderful performance. She has some wonderful scenes in which she grieves over finding out about Ennis's affair but still can't help loving him. Anne Hathaway shows surprising depth as Laureen Jacks wife. Her performance is easily the most underrated of the year and surpasses that of Michelle Williams who is headed towards Oscar gold. Her accent never breaks and she has so much emotion hidden just under the surface. The screenplay is also wonderfully written by the master who gave us The Last Picture Show. He crafts his characters so perfectly, and between the wonderful acting and the writing we don't really need his wonderful dialogue to get everything. Ang Lee has given us some wonderful films before such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Sense and Sensibility, and The Ice Storm. They are always different from anything done before, and this Brokeback Mountain is probably his best. Brokeback will certainly have a good run at the Oscars this year with locks for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, and Supporting Actress, and is expected to win many of them including Best Picture and it is one of the few films in years that actually deserves it. I suggest that you see this masterpiece whether you wait for the DVD or not, it is simply a must see.",10,12,14,15 January 2006
The Terminator," Best Sci-Fi
","The Terminator is one of the greatest sci-fi films out there, it and The Matrix. The Terminator is also one of the few films that truly changed cinema, it was the first of it's kind of sci-fi film. The story is is genius, every single part of it is genius. It is a warning against the future as well as a brilliantly fun story. The screenplay is great, the dialogue is great, the characters are great, and the scenes are greatly put together. The acting is fair, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not very good, but he doesn't really have to be, so he works fine. Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn are both good, but not great. The direction is outstanding, James Cameron does even better than he did with Titanic, although he won't top the film it self. The visual effects are not so good, and often look very fake, the eye scene was the worst, but some parts with the metal Terminator looked bad too. The Terminator is one of the best sci-fi films ever, watch it.",10,1,2,17 October 2005
Crash," Outstanding
","Crash is an amazing picture, the best of the year. Crash is also the hardest movie to watch in years. Racism is a very hard thing to talk about, because it is so wrong, and yet exists in almost every one of us. The story is centered around all this, and in a very uncomfortable way. The acting is completely convincing by the hole cast, although Sandra Bullock is the worst, and Matt Dillion the best. The direction is fantastic, its completely together, without any real problems. The visual effects are really nice, and the music amazing, very moving. I loved this film, the way every character changes in the picture, for good or bad, amazing.",7,0,4,18 December 2005
MASH," A Mashterpiece
","M.A.S.H. is one of the cinemas best comedies and without question a masterpiece. It is one of the funniest movies ever with it's famous Suicide is painless scene being the highlight. M.A.S.H. spawned one of the best and most known TV shows ever. The TV show has more comedy and less dramatic scenes and has the wonderful Alan Alda but it doesn't have the power of the film and the wonderfully hilarious performance of Donald Sutherland, as well as one of the best directors ever in Robert Altman directing one of his best films. The screenplay is also wonderful with some of the best and funniest dialogue ever put on screen. The characters are also very well penned, particularly for a war comedy which is a genre that has previously had mostly horrible messes of films. One of cinemas best comedies and for sure a must see.",10,2,7,23 January 2006
The Polar Express," Amazing
","The Polar Express is truly amazing, you have never seen anything like it and I'm not just talking about the animation. The way it is put together is just so original and so perfect I think I can easily say this is the third best Christmas film ever right behind It's a Wonderful Life and The Bishops Wife. The Polar Express book was my favorite as a kid and after seeing the movie I read it again and still liked it, thats pretty darn amazing because I usually don't like that kind of thing. They extended the story from the book a lot, but they had to to make a full length film. The story from the book is magical and wonderful but the one from the movie is even better fleshing it out more and making it seem more real. The story is also really helped by some great dialogue and character development. The only flaw I can really come up with is the acting which is a little cheesy and should have been more grounded some cheese is great for this film but not quite that much. But it is greatly directed by the same man who brought us Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, he is a great director. The visual effects/animation are some of the best ever filmed, they are just perfect even the way the clothes move in the wind looks real. The cinematography is perfect but a little jumpy so be warned it feels like a roller coaster even on your TV at home. You will love it I am almost sure of that, I loved it more than I have of a film in a long time. Everyone should see this magical film on and around Christmas day. It is sure to become a Christmas classic and will last years from now, my grandkids will likely see and love this movie if I'm not mistaken. Okay I rambled a bit I'll shut up now, just watch the movie.",9,1,4,17 December 2005
Taxi Driver," Maybe Best Film Ever
","Taxi Driver is one of the greatest and most powerful films ever made. It has several famous shots including one where the camera pulls away from Travis being dumped by his girlfriend and looks into a hall, but my favorite is when he pretends to shoot himself in the head with his hand. Taxi Driver also has one of the greatest lines in movie history. 'Are you talking to me. Well I'm the only one here.' That line is often miss quoted as simply. 'Are you talking to me.' That is very wrong. Taxi Driver also has one of the greatest characters ever put on film in Travis Bickle. The story is genius, I love how they show Travis as a loner, not a psychopath, or more precisely a loner in the beginning. The screenplay is great, the dialogue is amazing, but the true miracle is the character of Travis Bickle. The acting is amazing, Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances of all time, while Jodie Foster and others are all great. The direction is great, it is the best direction Martin Scorsese has done, and he is the second best director alive right behind Steven Spielberg. The visual effects are great, everything looks real. Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever, watch it.",10,1,2,16 November 2005
Capote," One of the Best of the Year
","Capote is a brilliant piece of cinema and not just one of the best films of the year but one of the best films ever made. It is a truly brilliant piece of cinema. The plot is near flawless, as is the screenplay. It is not scared to move at a slow pace. It is not scared to portray it's lead character as a flawed person. It is honest and nearly perfect, if not perfect. It is in fact the best biopic since Patton. The performances are flawless. Particularly those of Philip Seymore Hoffman and Clifton Collins Jr. Catherine Keener and Chris Cooper are also amazing though. Philip Seymore Hoffman manages to get every little mannerism of Truman Capote correct. He gives a perfect impersonation, but the performance is so much more than just a impersonation. It is one of the best performances ever. The direction is just brilliant. It is probably the best directorial debut ever. Or at least since Joe Wright in Pride and Prejudice. The cinematography, art direction, costume design, and makeup are all also completely brilliant. Capote is a masterpiece in one of the best years for movies ever. It deserved all it's acclaim and more. It is an amazing piece of cinema, with one of the best performances ever by Philip Seymore Hoffman. See it.",9,0,0,24 March 2006
Corpse Bride," Beautiful
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was a film I was really looking forward to seeing, I thought it would be amazing. But o boy was I wrong. It was decent but nothing else at all, and maybe not even that. The story was not that original and not that good. It had been done plenty times before to success and I guess they thought they could do it one more time. Why couldn't they have just come up with something original for a change. The performances are very good but also nothing special or original in the voice industry.Johnny Depp and Albert Finney are both some of the greatest actors ever to live and this is a big disappointment for them. Emily Watson and Helena Bonham Carter are both also very good actors but pretty much fail here. The direction too is unoriginal and not great, in fact it is even worse than the story and the acting. Tim Burton is a good director and I fail to understand how he got this done. The visual effects I guess you would call them are amazing, the stop-motion animation is flawless. It could bee worth seeing just because of the animation if nothing else because it really lacks anything else good. Rent The Nightmare Before Christmas.",8,0,1,3 February 2006
Romeo + Juliet," The Best Story Ever
","The chemistry of Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes, is one of the best for years. They seem made to act together, I hope they will do something more. I have to say if it had not all been in Shakespearian, it would have made it make more sense, half the time you had trouble understanding what there saying, except for Dicaprio, he has a knack for Shakespeare, his performance also shows what he feels and you almost don't have to get his dialogue strait, you can just look at his bodie language. Its Claire Danes best performance since The Rainmaker with Matt Damon. The rest of the actings not so great, but because of Dicaprio and Danes, its definitely worth your two hours of time. So rent it, even if your a Leo hater. I have always thought it annoying that some people will not like an actor, like, Leonardo Dicaprio, or Orlando Bloom, just because there the ones all the girls have a crush on. It's no reason to hate them just because there better looking then you. Great Movie.",8,1,4,22 December 2005
The Godfather: Part II," A Masterpiece
","The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless.",10,164,240,15 October 2005
American Psycho," A Horror Classic
","American Psycho is in my opinion the best horror film out there, there have been many good horror films such as The Shining and Sleepy Hollow but American Psycho is the only one I could consider a great movie. American Psycho is such a scary and disturbing film in many ways. It is one of those films that just ignores the Hollywood idea of having a nice rounded out ending that leaves no room for thought. American Psycho is just nothing like that, you will think one heck of a lot. Christen Bales performance is just amazing, he gives one of the best performances in years, he is just phenomenal. The other performances by actors like William Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon are also fine. The film is also admirably directed and written with great dialogue and characters. The visual effects are also great, everything looks real and is just amazing. I loved American Psycho and think anyone who will not have major trouble with some of the gore and sex scenes, and just generally how disturbing and scary it is will love it too.",9,1,2,9 December 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Much Better Than I Expected
","I am a fan of the original Terminator film, and enjoyed the second in the franchise, yet unfortunately Terminator 2: Judgment Day lacked in humor and life and seemed dumbed down for us stupid Americans who just like watching things blow up. This third installment Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one heck of a lot smarter than the second film and maybe just as smart as the first, it is much funnier and the acting is better than I thought was possible with Arnold Swchartzenegger(Or how ever you spell it) in a lead roll. It may not by quite as fun as the original but it passes up the second. The screenplay has much wittier dialogue than the films before and the characters are better developed. The direction isn't James Cameron but is still quite good. The visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen, they are fantastic. A lot better than I could have hoped for, watch it. Now I kinda even hope that he'll be back again.",8,2,3,15 December 2005
American Beauty," An American Beauty
","A true American Beauty. This film is one of the best films I have ever seen and mixes genres so well it reminds me of nothing I have ever seen before. American Beauty is a Beauty of a film that seems so real, in fact more real than any other before of so far after it. The story is really great, it feels so real and never pulls any punches even if it might break your nose in the proses. The screenplay is amazing I would give it a similar explanation as the story though. The acting is some of the strongest ever filmed. Kevin Spacey gives a performance that will live in history as one of the best, Annette Bening is also amazing but not quite Kevin Spacey. The other performances by actors such as Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley are all also Oscar worthy. The direction is truly perfect, Sam Mendes is an amazing director and this is by far his best film, he fits every single part together so well. He is the perfect director of our time and this is his perfect film. The visual effects are great, but not quite the level of the rest of the perfect film. Possibly the best film ever, I love it how the characters are one way in the beginning but than contradict that in the end. Every one should see this hilarious and disturbing masterpiece.",10,0,2,25 November 2005
The Alamo," You Will Fail To Remember The Film
","The Alamo was truly filled with great people, and this film is their story. The story of American hero's and the Mexicans who slaughtered them. This is a great story, but the film is far from great, in fact it only has one thing keeping it from being horrible, that is Billy Bob Thornton. The story is one of the most inspiring ever to be filmed, to bad they had to ruin it. The screenplay is horrible, it is filled with wooden dialogue, and character clinches. In fact the only character development anyone gets is the sight of their child, or them saying they love them in a letter. The acting is wooden all around except for Billy Bob Thorntons amazing and touching performance as David Crocket, he almost makes the film worth watching. The direction is amazingly bad, everything is labored and shot all wrong, in fact I would advise for any would be film director to watch this for what not to do. The visual effects work, but are not awe inspiring. A labored and generally boring picture. Watch only for Thorntons performance.",5,2,3,26 October 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Slightly Disappointing
","I loved the original Terminator and putt it up there with the best films ever, and although its not number one it comes in close and is number one in best action films. Terminator 2 Judgment Day is not half the movie in almost all ways the only place it even comes close to the original is the visual effects, and it surpasses it. Terminator 2 Judgment Day has a lot more action and a lot less story, the plot is very flawed and it is made even worse by the wooden dialogue and the bad characters. The acting is just horrible, Arnold Schwarzenegger or however you spell it is just horrible. as is Linda Hamilton. The kid is okay but can't save the film. The direction is very good, but Cameron has done much better before with Titanic and the original Terminator. The visual effects are amazing for the time and good for today although at moments it is very easy to tell when somethings fake. Just watch the original and than if you like it this may be worth looking into.",8,1,2,8 December 2005
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A Brilliant Satire
","Personally I loved it. It worked as hilarious satire, and as a narrative. By the end I actually cared about Cox, something I have never really done before in a pure satire not directed by Christopher Guest. Most of this can be attributed to the great performance by John C. Reilly. It's his best acting ever, or at least since Magnolia. He embody's Cox. The performance is similar to those in This is Spinal Tap. It's both over the top, and filled with subtle naunces. Jenna Fisher is also surprisingly impressive as the love of his life. Her performance is even better than that of Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, for which she won an Oscar. The rolls are very similar, and Fisher's works better. This is one of the only satires I have seen that is actually better than the films it is spoofing, and I love musical biopics. It is far more entertaining, and in a way more touching. The cameo's are even more numerous than I expected. The best are of course in The Beatles scene. Paul Rudd in particular is perfect as John Lennon. All in all this is brilliant satire. It works in every way, and is one of the most entertaining and funny films of the year.",9,3,6,1 January 2008
Being John Malkovich," Completely Bizarre
","Being John Malkovich is easily the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is completely bizarre. The story is more original I think than anything since the beginning of cinema when well everything was original. Charlie Kaufman has written three near classics called Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Being John Malkovich. And this Being John Malkovich is the best by far. And although it doesn't have the best performance of the three which is held by Nicolas Cage for Adaptation it has the second best in that of John Malkovich, who plays himself and a bunch of other himselfs. The script is one of the best ever made into a film. It is flawless with great characters and dialogue, not to mention the plot. The direction is also wonderful as are the visual effects. The one big thing I didn't like about Being John Malkovich is John Cusack who although much better than usual still can't give a good performance.",7,0,1,8 January 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Hilarious
","The 40 Year-Old Virgin is one of the crudest things ever to hit the big screen, and one of the funnyest of the year. The 40 Year-Old Virgin also has a very sweet ending, very, very sweet. That seems more than a little uneven and a little disappointing, in fact it might have worked better to have an ending that was similar to the rest of the film. Or they could have done the ideal thing and made the whole film have moments of sweetness. The film is none the less well written and the performances by Steve Carell and Catherine Keener are exultant, and I haven't laughed so much in a long time. The film also has a slight problem of using one joke many, many times. It may have some other good jokes but the one about him being a 40 Year-Old Virgin is use way to many times. All in all a hilarious film but an uneven one to and not one to race to see.",9,0,1,18 January 2006
Jarhead," Welcome to the Suck
","I was a little comprehensive about Jarhead getting made into a film. I loved the book and just couldn't see it made into a movie. It truly seemed impossible because of the way the book was written. It really just didn't seem like it would work at all. Anthoney Swofford is a very touching 'character' and of course a very real one. The plot is great. Many things have been changed from the book but they still work very well, surprisingly well. The acting is very good all around. Jake Gyllenhaal is very, very good but he is better in Brokeback Mountain. Jamie Foxx is even better than Gyllenhaal giving one of his best performances to date. Chris Cooper is also very good in an almost cameo performance. Peter Sarsgaard is though the standout performance. He is amazing and may even top his brilliant performance in Garden State. He is a brilliant Troy. Sam Mendes is one of the best directors working today. He deserved Oscars for both American Beauty and Road to Perdition and he is just as good here. Even if Jarhead came out in a stronger year so he doesn't do the best direction of the year, but he is of course very close. The cinematography is amazing and maybe the best of the year. The art direction, costume design and such are also amazing. A surprisingly brilliant war film that is one of the must see films of the year.",8,0,1,22 March 2006
The Usual Suspects," A True Masterpiece
","There have been very few movies made since 1995 that can be considered great and The Usual Suspects is one of them. Some others are American Beauty and Punch Drunk Love. The Usual Suspects is just a perfect film in almost every respect. It has an ending that is nearly impossible to guess before hand, that is something of a rarity Fight Club and the Sixth Sense are the only other movies with surprise endings that have blown by me before this. The screenplay is perfectly written, there is nothing to give away the ending until you see it for a second time than you catch all kinds of things. The dialogue and characters are also just perfect. The acting is truly phenomenal you are not likely to find anything better than this. The direction is great. The visual effects are amazing. A must watch classic film.",10,1,3,8 December 2005
Batman Begins," Perfect
","There have been many tries to make a great Batman film, but they have failed every single time before this. The original Batman was the worst, it was horrible, Batman Returns sucked, as did Batman and Robin, and than they made Batman Forever which was at least good, and the first watchable Batman film. Batman Begins changes this majorly. The story is great, it is much darker and grittier than anything else before about Batman, and it works very well. The screenplay is amazing, all the characters are well developed, and the dialogue is great. The direction is amazing, but well it's from the Guy who made Insomnia. The visual effects are also great, will probably get Oscar nominations. Flawless action film, one of the best.",9,1,1,10 November 2005
Man on the Moon," Milos Formans Best
","Milos Forman has made a lot of great films such as Hair, and some more than decent ones such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, and this Man on the Moon is probably his best. It beats One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest in pure entertainment value, one of the only things that prevented One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest from being a great film. And it beats out Hair with the fact that it has a story and is not just a bunch of songs that will stick in your head and try to make you forget its aberrant lack. Man on the Moons is chop full of energy, it zooms along like a very entertaining bullet, it is truly vibrant as is Jim Carreys, well not performance more embodiment of Andy Kaufman, he proves that the academy is truly dumb for not even nominating him once he has deserved it four times for Eternal Sunchine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, The Truman Show, and most of all for his best performance in Man on the Moon. Paul Giamati also deserved a nomination as did the script and the director and the entire film. Man on the Moon is a vibrant and hilarious film homage to the great Andy Kaufman.",9,1,2,30 November 2005
The Elephant Man," Brilliant
","The Elephant Man is one great movie. It has several brilliant performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, great art direction/editing/costume design and such, but there are three things that stand even farther out. The direction is just perfect. David Lynch manages to disturb us without making us stop caring for his characters. The screenplay is one of the greatest ever. It helps a lot in the area mentioned before disturbing us while making us care deeply about the characters. The original musical score is however the strongest point of the film. It is just absolutely brilliant. Maybe the best ever. All around a fantastic movie that everybody who can handle the general disturbing nature should watch.",10,2,2,27 May 2006
Amadeus," Simply Great
","Amadeus is in my opinion the second best film of all time, next to Casablanca. It is truly flawless. The story centers around Antonio Salieri. A composer who has basically worshiped Mozart since they were both children. He is the court composer and Mozart will come and play for the king. Salieri finally has a chance to meet him. When he does he learns the truth about Mozart. That he is a bumbling sex obsessed twenty year old teenager, who is far more talented that Salieri. He of course doesn't like this very much and plots to kill Mozart, while never wanting to stop listening to his music. The performances are completely brilliant. F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce play the two lead rolls perfectly. The direction and the technical aspects are also just flawless. The Cinematography is the best ever filmed. This movie is flawless.",10,1,3,19 May 2006
Hero," Really Good
",I am not a big fan of martial arts films. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is really the only one I liked before Hero. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2000. It had a great story and was very powerful. It was also one of the most beautiful films ever made. The Cinamotogaphy is just stunning. Hero is while not anywhere near as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but is just as beautiful if not even more. The cinematography is is some of the best ever. The art direction and costume design are also similar. The performances are mostly fairly wooden but Ziyi Zhang is wonderful in a small roll as a great warriors maid. What a beautiful film. Hero is wonderful and one of the greatest martial arts films ever just behind Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.,8,1,2,7 March 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Touching if Very Flawed
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a beautiful, touching, and very flawed film. The plot is touching, and the performances all affective, and the film is generally well done, but it is flawed, mostly I believe to the screenplay. Like many of Roths previous films there is an overabundance of sub-plots. The film is to long, but that isn't only it. Large chunks of the film seem disjointed from the rest of the picture, and as far as I'm concerned the most dramatic of these are the many scenes where Ormond reads the story to a dieing Blanchett. Still Benjamin Button is a very good film, mostly due to what the actors did, Pitt and Blanchett are great in their respective lead rolls, and Taraji P. Henson more then steals the film as Pitts mother. Also much of the film is very touching, I just wish Roth had written a better screenplay.",7,1,3,4 January 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Flawless
","Good Night and Good Luck is one of those rare pieces of cinema that is both immensely important and immensely entertaining. It is one of the years best films and would be easily the best in almost any other year. 2005 was a brilliant year for movies with four masterpieces(And there are still more really good looking movies I have too see!) Good Night and Good Luck, Brokeback Mountain, Crash, and A History of Violence. Although Good Night and Good Luck is not the best of these films it is still simply breath taking. I considered George Clooney a very good actor before seeing Good Night and Good Luck, now I think he is a brilliant actor, director, and screenwriter. The performances are very strong with Clooney's supporting turn as Fred Friendly being the best. David Straithairn is also perfect as Edward R. Murrow while Jeff Daniels and Patricia Clarkson are also amazing in fairly small rolls. Clooney is a brilliant director and really needs to make more movies. Good Night and Good Luck is easily his best work to date as an actor or director and may end up being his crowning film.",10,1,2,17 March 2006
Caddyshack," I Was Surprised
","I had been expecting a hilarious, as well as well made film from all the reviews, and the amazing cast. The story is extremely bad, and fails to work at all, in the slightest. The screenplay sucks, the dialogue is horrible, and than theirs the fact that nothing makes sense at all. The acting is horrible considering it has some amazing actors in it, Bill Murray is the only one anywhere nere good as a psychotic green keeper, and Rodney Dangerfield is the worst as a idiot, basically, one who's very bad at golf. The direction is bad even for Harold Ramis, and he is a very good writer, but can't direct at all. The visual effects are horrible, the Gopher looks so fake, as do the explosions. Extremely overrated.",4,6,17,12 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Flawed but Still Worth Watching
","The film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory finally has the right title, but the film is not half as good as the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory which had a great performance by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, his performance has vibe and is constantly hilarious, while Johnny Depp is extremely annoying and only occasionally funny. Depp is usually one of my favorite actors, but he is just wrong for Wonka and doesn't work in the least. The other performances are good though, as is the direction. The story has been majorly changed so it fits Tim Burtons usual plot about the bad guys or at least the unhappy ones having bad relationships with their parents, fathers in particular. The visual effects and art direction are dazzling but a little distracting. They are the real star of this new film. Although not entirely bad Charlie and the Chocolate Factory disappoints and although worth watching may not be one to rush to see.",5,0,1,22 November 2005
World Trade Center," Powerful
","World Trade Center is not just the best film of the year so far, but its the best film to hit cinemas in about five years. It is pretty much cinematic perfection, but it is not how it is made that makes it so great. Sure that helps but its the shear power behind the film that makes it truly great. Oliver Stone is a fantastic filmmaker, one of the best in the business and this is one of his best works, if not his best. The performances are totally convincing and nothing less than extraordinary. Michael Pena and Maggie Gyllenhaal in particular. Cage, Bello, and many others are also amazing and deserving of Oscar attention. The music and cinematography as well as the technical aspects are all genius as is the rest of the movie.",8,5,12,16 August 2006
Pride & Prejudice," I Love This Movie!
","I am a guy and I just love this movie! It is completely amazing. I somehow really connected with Elizabeth Bennett. It took me a while to figure out why but I think it might be the fact that we are both from huge families and really act interestingly a like. The plot is classic and amazing. It is one of the few stories that has connected with everybody and really staid alive through about two-hundred years. The acting is amazing. Keira Knightley has given some decent performances before but is now amazing and should have taken Reese Witherspoon out for the Oscar. Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, and everybody else are also amazing and Oscar worthy. The direction is also fine and Oscar worthy. He gets everything done correctly. The cinematography, art direction, and costume design are also amazing. They are some of the best of the year. I loved this movie.",10,1,3,22 March 2006
A Clockwork Orange," McDowell Gives One of the Best Performances Ever
","A Clockwork Orange is a very well made film, but has some extremely large problems, for instance it admires it's sadistic rapist lead with a passion. Also it is not original in the slightest. The story is not original in the slightest. The story steals from many classics of the same nature, that is of a controlling future, and has so much of 1984 in it that I'm surprised it was made in the first place, it's almost a remake. The screenplay is good, the dialogue is sometimes clunky, but the way the scenes are put together is very good. The acting is amazing, Malcolm McDowell and others are fantastic. The direction is good, Kubricks worst direction but not that bad. The visual effects are fair, so much of it looks fake by todays standards, but is so great by the standards of the early seventies. Overrated, but has some great moments, and McDowell gives one of the best performances in film history.",9,0,2,15 October 2005
The Fly," A Disturbing and Beautiful Sci-Fi Tragedy
","The Fly is the story about a nerdy, reclusive scientist who invents a teleportation machine, and his reporter girlfriend who is writing a book on the discovery. Everything is going well until the scientist, drunk and jealous attempts to use the machine to teleport himself prematurely, and ends up fusing himself with a fly. The film quickly turns from sci-fi romance, to sci-fi Shakespearian tragedy. The film is a semi remake of an old Vincent Pryce campy horror film. It is semi in that it was the same title, and a similar premise, but very few of the same plot details, and a very different feel. While the original was a campy 3D style film, this one is truly disturbing. That is not surprising being from director David Lynch best known for such films as Videodrome, Naked Lunch, Crash, and A History of Violence. He is known for violent, disturbing, brilliant, and emotionally brutal films. The Fly is probably one of his strongest. It features a great performance by Jeff Goldblum as the scientist. He is sensitive, sad, and generally just deeply poignant. The film also features some of the best makeup ever put on screen. The film was made in the mid eighties before most computer effects were available, and all the effects are thanks to the make up. Turning a man slowly into a fly must have been difficult, and it is actually perfectly pulled off. So in the end The Fly is a strongly constructed, and entertaining sci-fi horror film of sorts, and will be enjoyed by even people who aren't sci-fi fans. It will have the effect of staying with you for a while after seeing it, and not only for the horrific effects created by the makeup.",9,0,1,19 November 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Way Overrated
","I love Quentin Tarantinos movies, Pulp Fiction is one of my all time best and the Kill Bill films are both also great, but I must say I really had problems with Reservoir dogs which was his first major film. Reservoir Dogs is a wonderfully made film with some great performances, that was expected the thing that I still fail to see how happened is how Quentin Tarantinos script was so bad. The dialogue is still amazing as it is in all Tarantino films but the story is horrible, it is filled with clichÃ©s and hardly makes any sense. Tarantinos usual thing about not having the film in the order of how it happened like most films just makes this film more confusing and pointless. The saving points are that it does have several very good scenes. 'Spoilers' 1. The naming. 2. When Mr. Orange is talking to his cop friend. 3. The ending. 'End of Spoilers' But even with its moments and a flawless performance by Tim Roth as Mr. Orange the film never really takes off and in the end is a sure failure, but I guess worth renting once just for those things.",9,1,4,18 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Best Yet
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not the best of the Harry Potter books, in fact its about in the middle, but in the case of the movie it is by far the best of the movies in fact it is almost a great movie and possibly better than great films such as On the Waterfront and Saving Private Ryan. The cutting out of lead characters from the original films seemed like a major mistake when I first read it, but ends up being one of the best things about the new Potter film. The lack of the dreaded Dursleys and of Mrs. Weasly only help put us in th mind of Harry Potter as he becomes more of a teenager and less of a child. The only character missing that would help is that of Sirius Black who is you hear narrate a letter and see a computer generated face but is barley in the movie. The acting and direction are both really great the standout performances are by Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody, and there's a major surprise in a great performance by Emma Watson as Hermione who has seemed slightly lost in all the other films and never really worked before. The visual effects are some of the best ever put on film, the only ones that could match it at all are those in The Return of the King, War of the Worlds, and Revenge of the Sith. This is one of the best films of the year, and the best of the gradually great series.",7,1,1,21 November 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Why the Heck Did They Even Make This?
","Why did they even make this? It completely ruined what was before the best film series ever, Robert Duvall was right to have gotten out of this film as was Winona Rider, I still can't believe Al Pacino didn't join them. Not to mention Francis Ford Coppola who should have also known better than the make this. I must say this may not be one of the worst movies I have ever seen but it is for sure one of the most disappointing films ever, and also the biggest drop from one film to it's sequel, there usually big but from the second best film ever to this piece of crap? Not usually that big. The story and script are heavy handed and filled with clichés and bad dialogue. The performances are good by Talia Shire and Diane Keaton, and great by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia, but Soffia Coppola is amazingly horrible, she should have gone straight to directing. The direction is horrible what was Francis Ford Coppola asleep? Or did he just let the actors direct themselves? The visual effects are crap and just don't work, they are even worse than the other films made twenty years before. A heavy handed and lumbering sequel that wallows in cliché and should be tossed to the dogs.",3,15,21,27 November 2005
Mystic River," Outstanding
","Three Boys, Jimmy Sean and David. Play Hockey on the street they all live on in in city New York. The Puch is hit into a gutter and they go over and try to get it. Than notice some wet cement above it and start to write their names. Than a man pulls up flashes a badge and tells them off for the names, asking David to get in his car. He than drives off leaving the other boys bewildered. The man holds David in a cellar for four days before he escapes scared for life. Years later the three boys live on the same street they lived on before, not still friends really just nabors. When Jimmy's 19 year old daughter is brutally murdered bringing them all back together. That is the general plot to this amazing Clint Eastwood drama. The film is held together by a perfectly crafted screenplay and some amazing direction. The performances are though the strongest point. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon are the standouts, but the rest including Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, and Emmy Rossum. Clint Eastwood has had the occasional movie like Mystic River that is truly powerful and amazing such as the highly underrated The Perfect World, but has also had the occasional horrible mess like his most recent film Million Dollar Baby. Mystic River is the best film to come out so far in the 2000's and may be beaten but I woulden't bet on it. I loved this film and think you will to.",9,0,2,5 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Shaky
","I loved the first hour of Mr. and Mrs. Smith but after that the jokes got a little old and it ran about twenty minutes too long. The screenplay is more than a little clunky with horrible dialogue, no characters what so ever, and the fact that the little plot it actually has is a huge cliché. It is a giant mess that needed to be turned down by all the Hollywood people who choose what gets made. The performances are also mostly horrible. Brad Pitt is not so bad but everyone else is horrible, Angelina Jolie in particular. The direction is also very, very bad. Which is a surprise from the director of such films as The Bourne Identity but he just did a horrible job on this. The visual effects are quite good actually. They really work very well. In all a fair film at best because of it's great first half in which it is hilarious. But the second half works in no way and makes the film veer from being good.",4,0,3,8 January 2006
The Departed," A Quick Review
","I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch. I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed, and that was completely fine. No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese's comeback. The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas, and is a complete masterpiece. The performances are top notch. If Dicaprio isn't at least nominated I will be extremely mad. Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score. Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time. The Departed is Scorsese's best in years, and truthfully one of his best ever.",10,4,7,11 October 2006
Psycho," A Classic
","Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history. The visual effects are excellent for the time and would stand up fairly well for today. This is one of Hotchcocks best films and is one to watch over and over and over again.",10,5,6,27 December 2005
War of the Worlds," Flawless
","War of the Worlds is one of my all time favorite books, and here it is made into one of my all time favorite movies. I love everything about this film version, it is so much better than the 1953 version in almost every way. The story is amazing, not quite the one they have in the book, but still genius. The screenplay is great, I love the dialogue and the characters, and just how everything is written. The acting is slightly weaker. Tom Cruise does very well, but is slightly miss cast. The real performances are from the kids, Dakota Fanning is amazing. The direction is fantastic, Steven Spielberg is one of our best directors, take that back our best director around, and he does great. The visual effects are amazing, some of the best ever. This will really have to battle Star Wars 3 for the Visual Effects Oscar. Amazing film, must see.",10,0,7,10 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," Dumb
","When I popped Wedding Crashers into my DVD player I was expecting it to be a hilarious laugh a minute bawdy comedy. I was very, very wrong in my expectations of this film. It was instead a dumb and rarely funny comedy that recycled ideas many other movies had used before and made them worse than they originally were. The plot is a cliché, really. The idea sounds kinda cool and original but what actually happens is a complete cliché. The performances are varied. Christopher Walken is very bad. Owen Wilson is horrible, amazingly horrible. He just sucked. On the other hand Rachel Mcadams and Vince Vaughn are both very good and pretty hilarious. The direction is just bad, plain and simple. The visual effects are also very bad. A mess of a comedy that is rarely funny and very uneven.",4,0,1,19 January 2006
American Gangster," American Gangster
","It was a well crafted, interesting film, with some fine performances, but almost no one went the extra mile. Almost everything in the film works, but hardly anything is great. I thought Josh Brolin basically stole every scene he was in, and Washington also gave a fine performance. Ruby Dee gave a warm, fine performance. She is good, but nothing better than she had to be. I had real problems with Crowes performance, and particularly with the direction of the film. The first hour was amazing, as was the last fifteen minutes of so. The rest was just mediocre. The editing was probably the saving grace is much of the movie. It pieced together the many parts that didn't work, and made them better. Because of the editing, it worked. Because of the editing it was entertaining. It, and Brolins performance were the only great things about the movie. The rest of it is an oddly flawed epic, that works more than it should.",7,0,3,19 February 2008
Lord of War," Fun and Funny
","Lord of War is a fun, often hilarious, and uncompromising look at the life of a gun runner named Yuri Urlsov. He narrates his tale from his late teens to late forties. He starts out a amateur gunrunner who just sells to the punks and the mob in his area of Brooklyn. It takes him several years but before long he is selling bigger guns to bigger people, and by the late eighties he is on a first name basis with all the major warlords(Or Lords of War) in the world. He doesn't take sides and will not just sell weapons to two people who are killing each other but will sell them to people planning to attack his own country. He has Interpol agent who knows he is doing something wrong but can't prove it so follows him attempting to catch him red-handed. His name is Jack Valentine and is played wonderfully by Ethan Hawke. Speaking of performances Nicolas Cage is wonderful. He manages to make you believe he is all the age's he goes through in the film without a pile of make up to make him really look it. Jared Lito on the other hand is horrible and it is impossible for you to believe he is one of the age's much less all of them. The direction is very good as is the screenplay and visual effects. A very good film that is both hilarious and disturbing.",8,1,2,10 February 2006
Raging Bull," A Raging Film
","Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director and although he has had the occasional bad film such as Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore or Gangs of New York but has also had many amazing films such as this Ragin Bull which may actually be his best slightly above such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and Casino. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances as Jake La Motta. He is phenomenal and deserved his Best Actor Oscar, although he has been better in both Taxi Driver and The Godfather Part 2. But the best performances are in the supporting categories by Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, Moriarty in particular is wonderful. She gives one of the best performances in film history and blows everyone else out of the water. The screenplay is also wonderfully written with flawless dialogue and some of the best character development since Casablanca. The boxing scenes are wonderfully shot and are possibly the best boxing scenes ever shot. Raging Bull is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. You must see it!",9,2,2,10 January 2006
La Vie En Rose," A Terribly Done Biopic with a Brilliant Central Performance
","This was a pretty terribly done film, it is somewhat saved by Marion Cotillards brilliant performance though. The editing and script were particularly bad. The weird time line was one of the worst ideas for a movie in a long time. The direction was okay. I liked the subtlety of it, but sometimes it was to much so, and it didn't click with the over the top screenplay, and editing. The technical values were fantastic, but not awards worthy. Cotillard was the only awards worthy thing in the film. She was pretty great in the central roll. Her nuances were wonderful. My number two in Best Actress so far this year, and she will most likely remain in the top five. 5/10 but only because of Cotillard.",5,6,10,17 November 2007
Before Sunrise," The Dialogue is Perfect
","Before Sunsrise is a film of dialogue. Nothing much else to say about it. Well maybe that it is very romantic. It has very little real plot. The little plot it has revolves around two people who meet on a train going through Europe. They are Jesse and Celine. Jesse is an American who is not completely sure why he is traveling through Austria and plans to get of in Venice. Celine is a french woman who is on her way back to Paris for her college term. They talk for maybe an hour before they get to the stop at Venice and Jesse has to get off. He of course convinces her to come with them and because neither have very much money they just wander around talking until sunrise when they must part for ever. They of course fall in love, have sex, and plan to meet again but deep down know they won't. It is the usual cliché of a romance but somehow it works well. Mostly because of the wonderful dialogue and the performance by Ethan Hawke. The direction is also better than usual. Somehow it works very well, much better than it probably sounds. It is also very funny.",9,1,4,25 February 2006
Casino," Usual Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese is one of our finest directors and Casino may not be one of his best films such as Taxi Driver or the very similar Goodfellas, or his worst such as the horrible mess called Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and instead comes about at the level of The Aviator and maybe Age of Innocence. Scorsese has a fascination with the mafia and there is a lot you could say about the mafia, unfortunately most of it wouldn't work for a Hollywood film so he keeps telling practically the same story over and over again which is unfortunate. So once again we see this cool mob man played by Robert De Niro in a superb performance who is well standing in the community, and than we have his boy-hood friend the psychotic played by Joe Pesci who once again deserves and Oscar, and well we go from there. The film is masterfully written, acted and directed with very nice visual effects but is to familiar and long to be very engaging.",8,0,2,3 December 2005
300," Great
","While I hate comic books as a whole, and particularly 300 I have to say the movie is absolutely brilliant. It has much more depth than I expected, and than the book had. David Wenham also gives a fantastic performance. But what is amazing is of course the technical aspect. The cinematography is brilliantly lit and shot, the editing is brilliant, the costume/art/ and makeup are all fantastic, and the visual effects and particularly sound very well may be the finest of all time. They are simply flawless. The decapitated heads are particularly well designed. The script great. It brings depth to an otherwise flat story. The direction is good, but could have been a lot better. Still a great movie and probably one of my favourites. Look forward to the DVD.",9,1,5,24 March 2007
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Scary
","'Let me kiss it better.'I am not one who generally likes Vampire films in fact the only one before Interview With the Vampire was the original Dracula film with Bela Lugosi. And yet I just really loved Interview With the Vampire it was extremely well written as was the book and well directed and acted Kirsten Dunst in particular is amazing as Claudia the young Vampire. The plot goes generally like this. A Vampire named Louis is interviewed by a young reporter and he tells his life story a two hundred year long life story. His story starts in the late Seventeen Houndreds in Saint Louis Missouri. He is a depressed man who just lost his wife and child. Than he is bitten by Lestat a Vampire from Paris. Louis refuses to feed on humans and lives off rats and such. Lestat finds this hilarious and taunts him constantly. After moving to Louisiana, Louis can't help himself and attacks a young girl, but Lestat finds him and laughs. Louis runs in self loathing but Lestat finds him and brings him to the dying child. Lestat than makes the child a Vampire and their daughter named Claudia. She is even more bloodthirsty than Lestat and teaches Louis to love again as well to eat human blood. That is the plot that sends Interview With a Vampire into much more stuff and makes it wonderful.",9,2,3,31 December 2005
Hustle & Flow," And I Usually Hate Rap Movies
","I am a avid hater of rap and everything that has to do with it. I only watched Hustle and Flow because it got a best actor Oscar nomination. I was needless to say not looking forward to it. Boy o boy was I surprised. It was hilarious and made perfect sense. The rap songs didn't make me want to throw the TV out the window and the performances were wonderful. But the thing that surprised me the most was how wonderful the film itself was. It was one of the best films of the year. I sat in my seat with a huge smile on my face watching a guy singing a song called 'Its Hard Out Here for a Pimp' and actually really enjoyed it, even the song. This may be because of several reasons, but the one I think helped the most is the screenplay. the screenplay is just wonderfully written. The author really knows his stuff, not just about his subject but about people and how they talk and act. He makes the wonderful movie all the more powerful.",9,0,1,17 February 2006
The Birds," Wonderful and Terrifying
","Alfred Hitchcock is arguably the best director ever to make a film. And The Birds is in my opinion his best work, it does something I thought was nearly impossible and beat out Psycho and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The Birds is a magical film adventure that tells the story of a woman named Melanie Danielles who after being on the wrong side of a practical joke goes after the man who did it to play one on him. On her way back from the house she is attacked by a seagull. The man helps her and invites her to dinner. She goes and later they invite her to the mans kid sisters birthday party. At the party the children are attacked by more birds. Later on they are attacked again while at school. Soon The Birds are attacking often and this time are killing as well, and soon they start to take over. This is the fairly simple plot of the Hitchcock masterpiece The Birds. The film does many great things, one is that it never really explains why or how the birds are attacking, that makes it even more scary. The screenplay is also great with amazing dialogue and characters. The acting is also very good, Tippy Hedren in particular is amazing. The direction is flawless, it is perfect. Hitchcock has something he always does. You can have the film on mute and still get the entire story, it is amazing. The visual effects are also surprisingly good for the sixties. Some of them are even very good for today. The Birds is a masterpiece that everyone should see, it is terrifying and bone chilling but most of all just wonderful.",10,1,2,29 December 2005
Cinderella Man," One of the Best of the Year
","Cinderella Man is a amazing story that is made into an amazing movie, it is pretty much perfect, everything is great, the acting is amazing, the direction perfect and the screenplay great. I loved pretty much everything about this film is fits real life together very, very well and makes it fit onto the TV screen. The performances are all Oscar worthy and all perfect. Russell Crowe is the best, he is perfectly cast as James J. Bradock, he needs to win an other Oscar, I doubt he will win this year but he really deserves it. Renee Zellweger is about as good and it is easily her best performance. Paul Giamatti is the one I think really may have a chance at the Oscar, it is about time he wins, and he hasn't even been nominated. Stupid academy. The screenplay is great it has amazing dialogue and perfect characters, the scenes are perfectly put together. I loved this film and it may be the best of the year.",10,0,1,18 December 2005
High Fidelity," Really Disappointing
","I love the book High Fidelity, in fact it may be my favorite book of all time and would for sure be one my top five. Unfortunitely the film is so much worse and lacks in the books narrative which may have been one of the best things about the book, it also simply cuts out everything in the middle of the book and simply goes for the stuff in the first five chapters and the last five. They also make it into more of a romantic comedy than the book was. The casting is pitch perfect, John Cusack is the person I thought of when I read the book, Jack Black and is amazing as Barry as is Catherine Zeta Jones but unfortunately Joan Cusack lacks life, and John Cusack is an actor who needs a great director to really work well and although greatly cast lacks the great director, and so he just really doesn't work. As I said this is a really badly directed movie, and that is part of what ruined it. The visual effects are pretty good but not that good. In all I would advise you to read the novel and to forget about the film.",7,0,1,28 November 2005
From Here to Eternity," Very Good Movie
","From Here To Eternity may not be one of my all time favorite movies, but it is surly a great one. A masterpiece of sorts. The plot is classic and brilliant, and it is helmed with an even better screenplay. The screenplay is pretty much flawless with a lot of character development, good dialogue and no scenes that are just there for no particular reason. The performances are also very good. Frank Sinatra in particular is brilliant while everyone else is still very good. The direction is also very good. The director knows where he wants to go and how to get there, thats really all you need to be a good director, plus he ads more to it making it better. The effects are fantastic for the time and almost stand up now. A Fantastic movie that you should probably see.",9,0,0,3 June 2006
The Island," Fun and Fairly Smart
","The Island is hardly one of the best films ever made, it is hardly one of the best of the year. It is a hugely flawed mess, basically. But it also has moments of true thoughtfulness, and is very, very entertaining, if a little long. The performances are just horrible, particularly Scarlett Johansson who has shown such talent in such films as Lost in Translation, Girl With a Pearl Earring, and Match Point. Ewan Mecgreger, Sean Bean, Michael Clark Duncan, and Djimon Hounso are all just as horrible. Steve Buscemi gives the only decent performance, it was a horrible moment for the film when he died. The plot is fairly complex and good for the first half of the film, and then it goes all blow em up on us and the only real dialogue is 'Run' or other things that mean about the same thing. Both parts of the film are good, just uneven. All in all a decent thriller/action film, very entertaining with little substance, and including some of the best fight sequences ever put on film.",7,0,0,16 May 2006
