The Avengers," Mediocre
","This movie is rated as an 8.8 at the time of my writing this and I fully expect that to come down considerably now that all the fanboys (and girls) are finished pumping it up. The characters could spend 2 hrs napping and the fanboys would still give this movie a 9 or 10. It's like that with any movie franchise - those most predisposed to loving it are the first ones to see it and rave about it, as well as overlook the obvious faults.Now that the rest of us are going to see it (and review it) that rating will reflect what the movie really is: A CGI fest that's really kind of mediocre. If it weren't for the very funny moments that punctuate the film, this movie would flat-out stink. It's riddled with cheesy clich√©s and seems more geared towards 10-13 yr-olds than to adults.I really like 'Iron Man', loved IM2, enjoyed 'Thor', and was indifferent towards 'Cpt. America'. This movie was definitely the weakest.",5,6,18,8 May 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Too Long....Too Talkative
","I like most of Tarantno's movies so I don't write this review as a QT hater by any means. That being said, this movie is just too self-absorbed for its own good. Way too much dialog that just rambles on and on...seemingly without end in some places. It's a 2.5 hour movie that could have easily 2 hours if not a little less. Couldn't QT bring himself to cut anything from this movie?? It's filled with scenes that are pointless and add nothing to the plot, and many of the scenes that DO add to the movie are simply too long and glib for their own good. Sometimes I think Tarentino is addicted to the sound of his own dialog and as a result has his actors just prattle along without end. 'Death Proof' had the same problem.Overall it was a solid flick but it could have been far better.",6,0,0,30 January 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Huge Disappointment
","The acting was first-rate. The adaptation was horrible. There are so many holes in the plot I felt as though I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie......you know, the part where we're supposed to see the birth of the story line and some character development. Anyone who wasn't already familiar with the book would be completely lost. It's like I was watching part 2 of a two-part miniseries without having seen part 1. It was beyond disjointed. Did Cirian Hinds even have any lines in the movie?? He was in scene after scene but I don't remember him saying anything.In any case, I was hugely disappointed in this film. The BBC miniseries with Alec Guiness is vastly superior.",4,49,74,21 April 2012
Avatar," Over-hyped & Overrated
","Where do I start......How 'bout with the plot. Anybody here ever see 'Dances With Wolves'?? If you answered 'yes' (as I'm sure most of you did) then you must be aware that Avatar's plot was lifted....no, COPIED...almost entirely from 'Dances'. Wounded soldier goes to a far-flung outpost to make contact with 'aliens' so-to-speak and ends up assimilating with them and ultimately siding with them blah blah blah.......I half expected to see a blue Kevin Costner running around yelling 'Totanka! Totanka!' The SFX?? At no time during this movie did I think I WASN'T watching a cartoon. Visually beautiful but the avatars all looked very, very CGI. The movie didn't stink but overall is was a very big disappointment.",6,3,7,10 January 2012
Rear Window," 8.7?? Are You Kidding Me?
","Really?? 8.7? I don't know what everybody else watched but I saw 'Rear Window' for the first time recently and came away completely disappointed. I like Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly so I'm certainly not predisposed to dislike any of their movies.Exactly where was the mystery?? There were no twists, no turns, no shockers, and no surprises at all in this movie. The plot was so utterly simplistic that I thought for sure one of the other main characters was going to be involved and would be revealed in the last 10 minutes of the film. Nope. Nothing. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended. My reaction was 'You've got to be kidding me!' And this movie has repeatedly been called one of the greatest ever?? Give me a break. Go watch 'Rope' or 'Dial M for Murder' instead.",5,4,9,20 June 2012
