Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Oh Borat your awful but i like you.
","Of all the movies I have laid my eyes on I would no doubt rate this the most pathetic comedy I have seen. Although there were parts in the movie that made me laugh, this was probably due to the the fact of how low the character stooped to generate humour. The quality of the film was not cinematic, it so much reminded me of your Joe citizen taking film of his holiday trip overseas, unscripted and unrehearsed. How this movie won Tony awards baffles me or approaching it more optimistically it gives us all hope that producing such mediocrity can be rewarded as the way it has. Maybe I am missing something, like a novice looking at some well renowned artist impressionist painting failing to see the comic genius of the the man. I like to think I am not missing anything, I call it for the way I see it, utter rubbish.",1,7,14,12 February 2007
