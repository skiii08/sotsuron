Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Expect dissapointment
","Let's face it. Star Wars- Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the mostly eargly awaited film in recent memory, if not of all time. Fox and Lucasfilm knew they could spend Titanic-style dough and still have one of the biggest hits of all time. But they made a mistake: they contributed to the hype themselves. They inflated the movie so much that people paid for Meet Joe Black just to see the trailer that ran in front of the feature. Hollywood had never seen hype of these proportions. Now, answer me this:How could anything, save the second coming of Christ as a Jedi, live up to the hype of The Phantom Menace and satisfy audiences?The story takes place before those of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (it is the first of a 'prequel trilogy'). The small planet of Naboo is engulfed in a power struggle with the vicious Trade Federation. The Federation wants to gain control over trade going in and out of Naboo, and take a cut of the profits. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) refuses, so they blockade the planet's trade until they will sign the agreement. When Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his student Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) arrive to negotiate with the Federation, they uncover a sinister plot, lead from the shadows by the film's title character. Soon, they are racing across the galaxy with the Queen, evading the Federation, pleading their case for the Galactic Senate, and attempting to stop the lethal Sith assasin Darth Maul (Ray Park) from murder. Along the way, they meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who unknowingly holds the power to change the universe forever.....Many people have said that the film's problem was that the audience already knew what was going to happen: Anakin Skywalker grows up to be Darth Vader, he is Luke's father, etc. But the details of how this came to be are interesting and not what holds the movie back. The problem is the hype.People, manipulated by the media circus surrounding the picture, expected to get the same rush as when they saw Star Wars for the first time; to feel like a kid again. What they got was a movie that has changed with the times: the action set pieces feel like levels of a video game, which is one of the more ambitious of the licensed merchandise attached to The Phantom Menace. Nothing seems to lead to another; you keep watching to see if your characters will make it to the next level, to fight the tougher bosses that you got short glimeses of in the earlier levels. When you see a fancy gun or spaceship, you know that in the theatre lobby, they are selling the exact same thing, ready for you to take home and fight with.Sure, but the original trilogy had the same thing. Whats the difference you ask?The difference is that nothing ispires you: only little kids will walk out of the theatre wanting to be Anakin, piloting a pod racer and 20 million miles per hour. You wont laugh in this movie, unless strange alien fart jokes and a totally digital Stooge with a stupid accent is your cup of tea. Everyone is a noble figure, fighting for the 'right thing' with no disillusions along the way. Where is Han Solo, who is only after the money until he must admit to himself that Luke is his friend and dash off to help him. Where is Lando Calrissian, who makes a deal with Vader that will seal the dark fate of his best friend, just because he needs the money for his business, and then realizes that he must correct his mistake. In Star Wars, even the all-knowing Obi-Wan makes a painful mistake by lying to his student to cover the past. But these new characters never lose sight of what they must do, which makes them quite boring.When I first saw the movie, I tried to blame it on the actors. Jake Lloyd sucked, he was terrible. The Jar-Jar Binks character ruined the movie. Even C-3PO and R-2D2 managed to stink the place up. But as much as I wanted to blame them, in the end I couldn't. As much as I wanted to deny it, the fault laid with George Lucas. The script is simply bad. Lloyd dilvered his lines fine, but his lines were terrible. He played his character as well as could be, but the character was annoying, as was Jar-Jar. Lucas created and wrote the characters, whom we cared nothing about. My favorite character was Darth Maul, simply beacuse the last lightsaber duel was so brilliant. I liked Obi-Wan only because I liked Ewan McGregor in other movies. The script is bad, the direction is bad. George Lucas is the one who made this movie bad.*Spoiler*For example, in the last part, Lucas balances the aforementioned saber duel, Anakin's assault against the Trade Federation mothership (why is he leading the force? BECAUSE HE IS A POD RACER), Amidala's infiltration of her palace (which consits of moving up levels through windows and ducking and shooting) and the Gungans's (Jar-Jar's pathetic race) fight against Trade Federation droids (my heroes). Why would these scenes be intercut if we only care about one? Why do they exist if they have no meaning? WHY DON'T WE CARE ABOUT THESE SCENES?*End Spoiler*Jar-Jar is a weak character because every clumsy thing he does ends up doing good. Anakin sucks because he is incredibly annoying. The movie is sometimes painful to watch. It's hard to see one of your favorite franchises get sucked down to sequel (or prequel) hell.But again, it all comes down to the hype. Half of this movie was ruined with the hype. The other half was by Lucas.",Null,0,1,4 August 2000
Rocky V," FOR YOUR INFORMATION
","*****SPOILER******For all of you complaining about how Rocky V ended with Rocky Balboa winning the street fight against Tommy Gunn, you should no that this was not the original ending. Director John G. Avildsen has been quoted as saying that the original ending Sylvester Stallone wrote for the film was to have Rocky die in an ambulance, in Adrian's arms, on the way to the hospital. Adrian then comes out in front of the hospital the next day and address the press, telling them that Rocky has died, but his spirit will live on.Stallone did not choose to change the ending, he was forced to be studio executives who got cold feet about putting a permanant end to one of the most profitable film series' in history, even though Rocky V was intended as the last installment. That is the reason why the ending was changed, and why both Stallone and Avildsen speak ill of the flim.If you are looking for someone to blame, its MGM.",Null,1,1,9 December 2000
Rocky IV," Absolutley Horrible
","After two decent films, Rocky III was released and was a resounding failure. But although the films lost quality with each sequel, they continued to get more and more popular at the box-office. After Rocky III raked in over $120 million, there would be no doubt that Stallone would churn out another installment of the Philadelphia pugilist. Using his huge success with Rambo: First Blood Part II the same year as a spring board, he gives us Rocky IV, undoubtedly one of the worst films of the 1980s (right down there with the Rambo series).After Rocky defeats Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and regains the heavyweight title, a new boxer arrives. He is Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a cold, steel-like man who has been trained to perfection by the Soviet sports machine. Rocky's cocky friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) thinks he can take Drago in an exhibition match but the Russian's power goes on full display when Creed dies in the ring. Fueled by hate and the need for revenge, Rocky agrees to fight the unbeatable Drago in Moscow, where the world awaits a climatic showdown of east-versus-west.If the Cold War ever turned hot, Russian POWs would be herded into theatres to see Rocky IV ten times a day. The movie is so blantantly stupid and hyper-patriotic, stone-cold Drago seems like the only sane one. Of course, while Rocky pulls logs and climbs mountains, Drago is being trained in high-tech gyms and being pumped up with steroids. His wife Ludmilla (Brigette Nielsen) seems nice and caring to the outside world, but inside she craves destruction just like her husband. Drago's trainer screams about how corrupt and backwards the culture of the United States is. He is right: corrupt, stupid, and offensive enough to release Rocky IV.Stallone has no right to comment on situations he obviously knows nothing about. Making Communists the enemy is simply a way to lock a high-profit for the film. Rambo had the same pathetic political outlook: that America is the great country fighting against the 'evil empire' that Ronal Reagan envisioned. Stallone is just as stupid as Reagan and takes pride in scenes where Rocky, the uneducated but lovable boxer from Philadelphia, wraps himself in the American flag and then gives a speech to the Moscow crowd, who cheer him on!If you can put all this behind you, you can still see that the intangibles of the movie are pretty bad. Adrian and Paulie's characters become more and more useless as the films continue: this time Adrian only covers her face when Rocky is losing and Paulie simply talks with a life-size robot he gets for his birthday (!). Stallone himself has obviously overtaken his Rocky persona and is throughly stupid. As usual, Carl Weathers is the only bright spot in the production.When it does come time for Rocky to face Drago in the ring, we don't see the underdog that just barely managed to stay up to win in Rocky II or the guy who went the distance with the heavyweight champ in Rocky. Now, Balboa is a huge, ripped machine who has no strategy but to pummell his enemy to death with non-stop hits. The fight is so cartoonish, completly with Drago giving Rocky the 'death-stare,' it feels like video game propaganda.Rocky IV is completly unlike anything seen in the first movie. How much our hero has changed! At first, he was a tough boxer with a will to win against all odds. Now, he is an oversize poster boy for the US, preaching against the Soviet EVIL. The champ was knocked out in Rocky III. This time listen to your corner, Rock, and stay down.",Null,1,4,26 November 2000
Aliens," James Cameron's best action film
","James Cameron had become famous for his box-office smash action films like 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' and 'True Lies,' but I regard 'Aliens' as his best. The story involves Ellen Ripley, the only survivor of the cargo ship Nostromo's battle with the vicious 'alien', returning to Earth. There, she is asked to join up with a crew of ultra high-tech marines to investigate the dissapearance of colonists on planet LV-426. She joins up and the adventure begins.The characters of 'Aliens' are surprisingly multi-demensional. Ripley is just supposed to be an observer, while the rough marines are supposed to be in charge. However, she quickly becomes the leader when her emotional maturity under pressure becomes a greater quality than being good with a gun. And even when she does become a female Rambo, it is not because she is tough. Its because something of great value has been taken from her (the young girl Newt, the only surviving colonist) and it is worth risking her life to get it back. The other supporting players are less interesting, but all figure in to the plot with some relevance. Paul Reiser is notable as the double-crossing Burke (shades of Cameron's script for 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' show up here).The action is relentless and extremly exciting, without being 'joyous'. The atmosphere that Cameron creates is so dark, uncomfortable, and scary, that Ripley and the colonists fighting for their lives is also hellish. The director never lets you feel safe, and does a great job increasing the impending doom as the movie continues. Even on the mothership, when Ripley is recounting her tale of the alien to skeptical marines, you can feel that these soldiers have absolutley no idea of what there coming up against.With an above-average action script, good performances, and excellent direction and cinematography, 'Aliens' comes out a winner above Cameron's other solid workThe original 'Alien' offers a better script and better performances. But 'Aliens' is a very decent sequel.",Null,0,0,2 January 2001
Die Hard 2," Great sequel to an action classic
","Die Hard launched the career of John McTiernan and Bruce Willis as MAJOR Hollywood stars. It also made $137 million worldwide. So whats in store? A sequel that must live up to the original (not an easy job, especially for young director Renny Harlin). But for once, they did it right.Die Hard 2: Die Harder takes place 1 year after the events in the original film. Detective John McClane (Willis) has moved to Los Angeles and joined the LAPD so he can be with his wife, since they got back together at the conclusion of Die Hard. He is waiting, again at Christmas, for his wife's plane to land at Dulles International Airport. But then lightning strikes again. A sophisticated team of mercenaries led by the sinister ex-Army Col. Stuart (William Sadler) have hijacked the airport's control systems and have power over the airplanes, which are forced to circle over the airport while their fuel runs out. His demands: allow the deposed dictator (and druglord) of a Central American country's plane to land and instead of being taken by Government officials, he will board a fully fueled 747 along with Col. Stuart and his crew to be taken anywhere. Refuse, and planes start crashing. Once again, McClane is forced to be the unlikely hero.The story in the picture is solid and there are plot twists that keep it interesting as McClane does anything and everything to stop Col. Stuart. This includes a shootout with mercenaries at an unfinished skywalk, a snowmobile chase and fighting with Col. Stuart on the wing of a disembarking jet. The action in the film is really fantastic, and so is the direction. Again, a great cast has been assembled with some returning characters (Holly McClane, the reporter, Sgt. Al Powell) and some slick new villans (sharp eyes can catch Robert Patrick as a mercenary, the guy who would later become the T-1000 in Terminator 2).The only real problem in the picture is the script. It tries to much to be like the original movie. The reporter from Die Hard returns in a nothing role. There are more thickheaded cops for McClane to argue with. And there is even the discovery of the walkie talkie that the mercenaries use.Even so, don't let that discourage you from seeing Die Hard 2. It's a pulse-pounding rollercoaster of unpredictability and fun that lives up to the original.",Null,1,2,16 June 2000
Schindler's List," An Incredible Experience
","Schindler's List is as incredible a film as we are likely to come upon in American cinema. The story of the opportunistic Oskar Schindler's metamorphosis from greed to generosity is truly as powerful as it gets. Taking Polish Jews into his metal working factory as cheap labor, he initialy takes advantage of the people. The opening of the film is laced with wit and Schindler's magnetism. In a crucial turning point, he witnesses the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto and the movement of the people to a forced labor camp run by the vicious and puzzling German commandant Amon Goeth. From this point on, Schindler is forever changed and does whatever he can to help the Jews.Schindler's List has an incredible script, full of wit and humor at certain points, then sadness and humanity at the next. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are exceptional in their roles as Schindler and Goeth respectivly, but the standout is Ben Kingsley as Schindler's quiet Jewish accountant Izshak Stern. His growing subtle passion and strength make the last scene with him simply beautiful. John Williams, better known for his booming musical companions to Spielberg adventures, delivers a score of beauty equal to the film. The cinematography is brilliant beyond description, it must be seen to be believed. Steven Spielberg should have won two Best Director awards for this film.The movie urges the audience to never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and the reality of its destruction. Despite the tragic situation of the Jews and Schindler, the film is also uplifiting. Schindler's achievement outweighs the merciless killings by Goeth despite the lopsided statistics. Somewhere around 1400 Jews escaped death thanks to Schindler, and the lives he saved will always triumph over the Nazis. As Stern proclaims in the heartwrenching finale, whoever saves one man, saves the world entire.",Null,9,14,29 August 2001
Ghostbusters," Terrific Entertainment
","If anybody hasn't seen this movie, go out and buy it right now. The DVD version is terrific, but any form of this flick is a must-have. I wholeheartedly say that this movie is one of my all time favorites. Watch it over and over agin and you'll see: the jokes never bore, the laughter is always flowing. Ghostbusters is a Hollywood Smash.The story in Ghostbusters is about 3 scientists at Columbia University: Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). They are the crack team in the parapsychology department but soon find that their antics push them out of the University and onto the street. With new technology, they open up their own business: they investigate and eliminate ghosts in New York. At first, Dana Barett (Sigourney Weaver) is their only customer. She has had some ghostly apparitions in her apartment and needs help, and Venkman especially wants to help her. But soon, all of New York City is engulfed in spooks and Dana, along with her eccentric neighbor Louis (Rick Moranis), become the focus of summoning Gozer, a vicious evil that could easily destroy the world. With a new recruit, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), the Ghostbusters set out to save the world.This movie is an excellent comedy, thanks to a great script by co-stars Aykroyd and Ramis. They setup the characters wonderfully, so that each adds something unique to the wacky group. Murray and Moranis are given the best material of their careers and Aykroyd, Ramis and Annie Potts have a collection of zingers. The story is made believable, in spite of the obstacles, and the visual gags plus the sharp dialogue make for an unforgettable comedy classic.The visual effects are also very good. They help deliver a couple of nice scares in the movie like when Dana gets captured by the Terror Dog or when, as Zuul, a minion of Gozer, she telepathically destroys her own apartment. Richard Edlund and company has done a fine job.All these things, along with the great title theme, make for a film that lived up to and exceeded the hype. Everything about this movie clicks; nothing seems to be out of balance. I really loved this movie and I think that everyone else would too. Go out and pick up a copy of Ghostbusters today.",10,0,0,25 July 2000
Back to the Future Part III," The perfect conclusion
","I don't understand why Back to the Future Part III go so knocked out by everybody when they saw it and just say that they liked everyone but this. Maybe because it doesn't have the fast-pace of Part II but it more than makes up for it in humor. Plus, it leaves you satisfied, knowing that there probably won't be any more Back to the Future movies. Not as easy thing to do. The story picks up right where Part II's cliffhanger ended: Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is stuck in 1955 when the DeLorean time machine piloted by his friend Doc (Christopher Lloyd), from 1985, is struck be lightning and sent back to 1885. When Marty discovers that Doc is shot a few days after his postmarks a letter to Marty, McFly decides to disobey Doc's wishes, go back in time, and save Doc from his fate. It is much easier to explain if you see Part II (all the movies, actually). I was kind of letdown by Part II's lack of humor but I am glad to see that it has been restored in III. Doc and Marty have some great lines and the overall tone of the Wild West in 1885 is light and fun (Marty's alias is Clint Eastwood). Both Chistopher Lloyd and Fox are fine is roles they have become quite familiar with. The only problem is Mary Steenburgen, who plays Clara, the love interest of Doc and one of the deciding factors on wether or not he should leave. She has an annoying quality and it's tough to root for the romance, although Doc is very likeable. The special effects are quite good in Back to the Future Part III, a signature of any film that Steven Spielberg is involved with. Alan Silvestri's score is also as good as it has been in the previous films. The movie really wrapped up the trilogy with humor and charm, plus great performances. As much as I like Back to the Future, I can't imagine another sequel, just because this movie ended it so well. See the whole trilogy because they are the best movies in the cast and crew's careers.",10,1,1,5 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Woo turns Hunt into Bond
","With all the hype about Mission: Impossible II and all the action and adventure, does anyone really remember that this was originally the most sophisticated spy-tv show around in the 1960's? Do they remember that it was about unfolding plots and secret espionage and real characters?No, I think not.Mission: Impossible II bares little resemblance to it's predecessor, which I found a guilty pleasure and intriguing, despite it's convoluted plot. This time around, John Woo takes over the reigns as director from Brian De Palma and turns it into a visual rollercoaster of action and stunts that will surely win over audiences (partly because they can't remember how good the original series was).The story involves a deadly virus called Chymera (spelling?) that was accidentaly created by a pair of Russian scientists that work for Australian pharmaceutical giant Biocyte. To avoid spoilers, I must skip certain elements of the story. Anyway, an evil ex-IMF agent called Sean Ambrose is out to steal the virus and the antidote, thus infecting people with the devastating disease and forcing them to pay for the cure. Meanwhile, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is given the task of stopping Ambrose with the help of Sean's ex-flame, and Hunt's now-flame, Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton). She is to 'infiltrate' Ambrose's scheme by restarting her relationship with him and feeding information to Hunt. Ethan also has the help of IMF agents Billy Baird (John Polson) and Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames, reorising his role from Mission: Impossible). Soon, Hunt and his team are racing against the clock to stop Ambrose and to save Nyah, who is in great peril.Now, its pretty useless that Cruise plays Ethan Hunt in this film: he resembles practically in no way the character from the first film. In Mission: Impossible, Hunt was a cold, edgy point man who was vaunerable but smart. He wasn't unstoppable, but he had guts and fury in his blood. In Mission: Impossible II, Hunt is basically James Bond: super slick, super cool, he immediatley gets the girl and has tons of explosive toys to use in dispatching Ambrose and his team. Not only that, but he has become a martial arts wizard who is basically a one man task force. When infiltrating a business deal with Ambrose and the Biocyte CEO, he goes through waves and waves of guards with acrobatic moves, hardly breaking a sweat. Hunt is an entertaining character but is nothing like the one we saw in the first film. Then why label this a sequel? Well, the first one made about $452 million and has a catchy theme song so why not take advantage?This film also has a confusing plot, although not nearly as much as the first one. It involves a lot more of the brief 'masking' that we saw in Mission: Impossible and it becomes very predictable and even rediculous. I won't spoil it, but in one scene where a mask change takes place, it is evident that Hunt would have had to brought a mask for himself and another character and a voice-changer for that character to an event in which he is not sure will happen or not! And the voice changers too! It is a little over-the-top rediculous that a microchip strip (like a piece of tape) across the vocal cords can manipulate your voice to that of anyone (like the voice-changer in Scream 3). If you remember the scene in Mission: Impossible where Hunt is disguised as Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, the bad guy), he does not say a word. How could he? He is still just Ethan Hunt wearing a mask!Also, this sequel feels just like a vehicle for Cruise to look cool and blow things up nicely. Sure, with a huge star like Cruise almost any film with him is a vehicle but remember Mission: Impossible's fine supporting players?: Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez (who actually works well), Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno and Ving Rhames (who had a much better role in the first one). I felt that Rhames was wasted as Stickwell, who offered very small comic relief and who's main purpose was to jump out of an exploding van, run all over Sydney searching for Nyah at Hunt's command or 'getting pissed' because 'someone put a hole in my Versaci.' The cast in the sequel is good: Thandie Newton stands around looking either bravely defiant or innocent and scared, which she does very well, and Dougray Scott is a pleasant surprise as the nasty villan. Anthony Hopkins is perhaps the best as he takes over the job as Hunt's IMF chief.But these multiple shortcomings are more than made up for woth the action. Oh, the action of John Woo. When Hunt executes his high-tech invasion of Biocyte, Woo turns the dogs loose in a blazing twin-barrelled fire fight that is absolutley thrilling. While I was kind of irked to see Cruise playing super cool through the rest of the movie, when the action came, I reveled in the magnificence. And how cool he is: kung-fuing his way through enemies, throwing grenades with ease and the end motorcycle chase. WOW. Hunt takes off on a motorcycle and two or three SUVs filled with Ambrose's nasties follow, along with Ambrose on a chopper of his own. The SUV drives across a small bridge, where it is met by Stickwell's gunfire. The SUV explodes and takes some of the bridge with it. And from the fire, we see Hunt, super cool, flying through the flames on the cycle. WOW.So, expect something quite different from the original film and in my opinion, something not as satisfying. But if you are looking for something to hold you over until the next 007 film, this is the ticket. Most of the film barely works, if at all, but Woo puts on quite a show. This film puts him up there with today's best American action artists: Spielberg, McTiernan, Cameron and Donner.",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Mission: Impossible," A fun high-tech thriller
","Yes, the stories are true. Mission: Impossible has a very complex and often confusing plot and may be, well, impossible, for some people to believe. But dispite that, I still found myself enjoying this picture a lot.I won't attempt to explain the plot but it does involve a lot of high-tech stuff. But lets talk about what Mission: Impossible is really about: globetrotting adventures, high-tech spy machines, international espoinage, double-crosses and shady characters. There are a lot of memorable scenes in this adventure like when Tom Cruise is breaking through super tight security in the CIA or when a helicopter is being towed by the Orient Express through a tunnel. This film is plenty of fun and has a great cast.You proboably won't understand the plot (it took me several viewings) but you will probably have fun with the movie none the less.",Null,0,0,15 June 2000
Die Hard," Action Masterpiece
","Nowadays, it seems that all the action pictures that are released are larger than life ('Godzilla') or ultra super-slick heroe vehicles (Mission: Impossible II). Last time I felt excited about an action film was when Lethal Weapon 4 was released or when Die Hard With A Vengeance came out in 1995. It makes me yearn for the days of great stunts, great humor, great villains and of course, real action. I am talking about Die Hard.The story is pretty simple. John McClane is a New York detective flying to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a party. She has taken a high-profile job with the Nakatomi Corporation and the party is being held at the unfinished new tower for the company. Things seem to be going alright when disaster strikes. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and a team of professional German terrorists have hijacked the building. All entrances are sealed, the tower is patroled by well-armed guards and they are planning to get away with millions of dollars in bonds stored in the building's high-security vault. They have complete control, except for one unforseen factor........John McClane.As the film progresses, McClane finds himself the unlikely hero (with no shoes on) who must single handedly overpower Hans' team with only his stealth, wits and a little bit of ingenuity. He is not a machine: he is just a cop who won't quit. And the movie is a thrill machine that won't quit.Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Alan Rickman and the entire cast are terrific. The screenplay gives plenty of humor to lighten up the proceedings too. The stunts and direction are superb. This movie is everything one would want in a summer flick.Trust me: if you haven't seen this movie, run out and rent it now. If you haven't seen it or it's two sequels, pick them up too. Die Hard is the ultimate action film: real people, real characters, real humor, real excitement and suspense and real fun.Now why dont they make movies like this anymore.........??",Null,0,0,15 June 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," One of the finest action films ever
","Die Hard With A Vengeance has a lot to live up to. The original film changed the way action pictures were made and made Bruce Willis and director John McTiernan in demand. The 1990 sequel was an example of exemplary craftsmanship by director Renny Harlin, and grossed $117 million in the US, adding to a total of $237 million worldwide. In this 1995 film, John McTiernan returns and so does John McClane, to his hometown of New York.In the morning of a hot day of a hot New York summer, a bomb explodes at a department store, throwing everyone into panic. The bomber, called Simon (Jeremy Irons), telephones the police and orders that the suspended McClane (Bruce Willis) complete a series of tasks or more bombs, which have been hidden around the city, will explode. While doing the first challenge in Harlem, McClane picks up shopkeeper Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) to help him. They continue to jump through hoops for Simon as the plot unravels, exhibiting a gold heist and some terrific chases.The action in this film is outstanding. At one point, Simon orders McClane and Zeus to get to a pay phone at the Wall Street subway station in 30 minutes (they are about 90 blocks away). Commandeering a taxi, they blaze through rush hour streets, cutting through Central Park (literally) and following behind an ambulance to cut traffic. This chase is absolutly exhilarating, because it uses the city as a major character instead of just a backdrop. The way it is filmed adds immensly to the thrills and the entire movie continues this way. It leaves you breathless.The acting is also very good, with Irons, Willis and Jackson rounding out the top spots and Grahame Greene and others doing nicely in supporting roles. And to keep the movie from becoming too unpleasant, the humor of the Die Hard films shines right through. While Willis can still pull the wisecracks, the best scenes are in his banter with Jackson, who is also very humerous.The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. Its the perfect summer movie: it gives you the feel of a day in the summer in the city, it is action packed, funny and just plain fun. Some people say that it strays too far away from the other 2 films but I disagree. Taking away the claustrophobia of the first 2 and switching it with a wide expanse boosts the originality of the series, along with the fact that it works very well.Note: Die Hard With A Vengeance was the highest-grossing movie worldwide of 1995 ($365 million). Hint, hint, Fox. Lets see Die Hard 4.",10,0,0,9 April 2000
Back to the Future Part II," A worthy sequel
","Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies so it's no surprise that I took an immediate liking to Back to the Future Part II. It's not as humorous as the first, but it is much more creative and is still a fun time.As shown at the end of Back to the Future, Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) has just returned from 1955, saving his parents lives, along with his own. Everything seems great, until Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) pulls up on the front driveway of Marty's house in the DeLorean time machine. He tells Marty that they must go to 2015 to save Marty's future life! He leaves with his girlfriend Jennifer into the future. After repairing the damage done by Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Biff Tannnen's grandson, Marty buys a sports almanac that disrupts the space time continuem. While Marty and Doc are somewhere else, Biff steals the almanac and the DeLorean, goes to 1955 and gives the book to a young version of himself, and returns. When Doc and Marty reappear in 1985, they find that it has become a corrupt criminal empire with Biff as the head. Now they must return to 1955 and stop Biff from getting the almanac, if they can get their first!The movie doesn't really introduce any new cast members but their are some nice twists. Fox plays four different parts: Marty McFly, Marty McFly from 2015, Marty McFly Jr. and his future daughter! It looks like he was having a great time playing multiple roles, as the tradition carried on into the next sequel. Jennifer has a bigger part in Part II, but I preferred Claudia Wells to Elisabeth Shue.The creativity in this film sparkels. I love the sequences in 2015, showing all the future inventions like video waiters, Hover Boards, and a little pizza that, when microwaved, can turn into a large size in 4 seconds. Plus flying cars, holographic dog kennels, the list goes on and on. It's really fun to watch. Plus the visual effects are even better than those from the original film.The only problem I had with this movie is the humor. It's just not as funny as the first movie. Marty is not as funny and Crispin Glover is sorely missed as Marty's dad. Also, Biff Tannen is a high-school bully. It's a little over the top that he would turn into a vicious murderer that 'owns the police' and turns Hill Valley into Hell. But nowadays, maybe it's a little more believable.All in all, this movie is really good. Anyone who saw the first should enjoy it a lot but I would reccomend seeing the first one and then the sequel if you have not seen either. A fun movie.",10,1,2,25 July 2000
Raging Bull," Superior Boxing Film
","'Raging Bull' is the story of middleweight champion Jake LaMotta's rise (to a title) and fall (to oblivion). The story is much more telling than just that of a boxer: it moves into territory of relationships and self-destruction out of ignorance. The cast is simply remarkable: Robert DeNiro is in his best role (he won an Academy Award for Best Actor), Joe Pesci is terrific, and Cathy Moriarity is better than she has ever been. The direction by Martin Scorcese is brilliant. Whether small domestic scenes or brutal action in the ring, every shot is totally captivating and engrossing. The script by Paul Schrader is also exceptional, with excellent character plotting and dialogue. The film's setting also looks great. Everything about the film is executed in an exceptional manner. 'Raging Bull' (1980, United Artists) comes highly reccomended.",Null,1,1,1 January 2001
Back to the Future," One of the best movies in Hollywood
","Back to the Future is a great ride. It's funny, it's touching and it's thrilling. I have watched this film over and over again and it never failed to impress me with it's charms. It started a trilogy that became one of the best loved and most succesful series' of all time. I really love this movie.Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is a typical teenager living in 1985 California. But he has got a couple of problems. He has a great band, but nobody gives him a chance. His parents are losers and his dad gets pushed around by hig-school bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is now his boss. Marty has ambition, but he doesn't want to turn out like his parents. But one night, he agrees to meet his friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a mall parking lot at 2 am. What could be so important? Well, Doc has just invented a time machine! But they are attacked by terrorists that have been ripped off by Doc and Marty inavertenly travels 30 years back in time! Now, in 1955, he meets his parents and disaster strikes! Marty's mom is in love with him and his dad is still a loser. With the help of the Doc from 1955, he must repair the time machine, get his parents to fall in love, and get back to the future, or he's history!This movie sparkles with charm from the performances of all the cast. Micheal J. Fox is absolutley perfect as Marty and Christopher Lloyd displays amazing comedic talent in his role and it amazes me how criminally unappreciated he is. I also have to mention that Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Wilson are terrific.Back to the Future is very, very funny. It has lots of in-jokes to other movies and Fox and Lloyd are given some great dialogue by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who wrote the script. I am astonished how much a laugh every time I see this movie, even for the ump-teenth time. With credit to the visual effects and a great score, I think everyone will find Back to the Future a pinnacle in the careers of Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg and love it for the unmistakeable movie magic that it holds. I know I do.",10,1,2,25 July 2000
