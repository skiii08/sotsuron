The Incredible Hulk," Take it for what it is worth.
","I just returned from seeing this movie and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was never a fan of the Hulk in comics or in television, but this movie managed to entertain me and present at least two interesting characters.I personally thought Norton nailed it as BB, as he was believable both as a super genius and a man frightened by himself. Props to him. Tim Roth also played his part very well, in what I honestly believe to be his best performance since RD.While the movie was not quite up to par with Iron Man or either of the first two Spider-man movies, I still found it to be a fun action packed ride. I will definitely be seeing any sequels with Norton at the helm, including the Avengers movie due out in 2011. Take it for what it is worth...this film won't be winning any Oscars, but if you want to go to the theater and enjoy a good action flick, look no further than The Incredible Hulk.",8,3,5,13 June 2008
