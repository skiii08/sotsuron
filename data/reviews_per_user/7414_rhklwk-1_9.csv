Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Intellectual and Moral Rot
","Do not be deceived: This movie is symptomatic of the intellectual and moral rot that masquerades today as entertainment. And sadly, America is buying it.As a movie, it suffers from the usual: Thin storyline, amateurish and wooden actors, choppy editing, and unintelligible dialog.But, the biggest problem is that the movie does not know the difference between satire and overkill. Sadly, I don't think the producer and director care, because they know that the American public has lost its ability to discriminate between what is clever and brilliant and what is disgusting and pathetic.Score one for the Philistines.",1,5,11,11 May 2007
The Revenant," Dull, Dark, and Dreary
","I am giving this movie a '5' because I recognize that some serious movie-making was involved, and I want to recognize it. However, I am also giving this movie a '5' because I did not like it.The opening scenes are exciting, but disjointed. Who are these people? Where are they? What are they doing there? Why do the Native Americans care? The bear attack is genuinely exciting and, for me, the highlight of the film. The problems is that there are two hours to go.The film is dark. The sun surely shines under the Wyoming/Montana/Dakota sky, but rarely in this film. A lot of 'squinting' is necessary.The dream sequences are unnecessary and poorly edited. There is some character development, but not much. Glass is obviously respected, but it isn't clear why. Fitzgerald's character seems to morph by the minute. The other characters simply pass through the scenes. And everyone looks like everyone else! It isn't clear why the Arikaras are so intent on capturing Glass. It isn't clear who, exactly, got back to Fort Kiowa. The intervention of the Pawnee who comes to Glass' aid strikes a positive note, but what does his brief involvement add to the film? And, who exactly were the Voyageurs and what were they doing there? And what did the sexual assault add to the movie? My biggest gripe is also my highest praise: The cinematography is magnificent but, oh so, languid! By the end of this long movie, I was numb. And bored.Leonardo won the Oscar for his portrayal of Glass, but he has been better in a number of other films. But, there is no denying that he got into his role.I bought the BluRay. I will watch it three or four more times, at full volume and with closed captions, to see if I can better understand it and appreciate it. I think, however, that it will take a 'director's cut' to bring clarity to this film, if that is even possible, and it will take the patience of Job to sit through it.",5,3,5,25 May 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Totally Incomprehensible Without the Pretense
","Most incomprehensible films are, at least, pretentious. You can't even say that about this rambling, never ending, cinematic waste of time.The characters are indistinguishable. Without the use of captions (thanks to home viewing), it would be impossible to know who was who, and even then, it's never quite clear. There is almost no character development, except in the case of Bob Ford. Why is Jessee tracking the members of his gang? Who knows? We know nothing about him.The last fifteen minutes are pretty good. Bob Ford is far more interesting than Jessee, and the end of the movie leaves you wishing the movie were about him, not Jesse.A total mess. One can only hope it won't kill Westerns (again). Forget it.",4,3,10,2 March 2008
2012," You Were Warned!
","You were warned that possibly the worst movie made since The Monolith Monsters (1957) had been unleashed on the public.Almost all of the actors are unappealing. John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, and Danny Glover are not compelling actors. Cusack, as usual, plays the weary sad sack. Harrelson's attempt to channel Dennis Hopper's maniacal character in 'Apocalypse Now' is embarrassing. And Danny Glover's role as the president of the United States is an insult. In his 'real' life, he despises America and praises Hugo Chavez, the thug that runs Venezuela and its drug cartels. Putting that aside, Glover's pulse can hardly be measured.Child actors. Oh, if only we didn't need them. They are almost invariably portrayed as rude, contrary, and sullen. And the parents put up with it. But, never fear, by the end of the film, they are cuddly little teddy bears that have brokered a reconciliation between their estranged parents.The adult characters in this movie are not believable. They are either cads, unlikely heroes, or holy men. Adults in authority almost always have bad motives. The chief bad guy is supposed to be the president's chief of staff, Anheuser, but in reality he is the only guy that knows what he's doing and is devoted to his duty. That doesn't count much, I guess, in the prevailing culture.The story begins with some excitement, but eventually devolves into an overlong, overwrought cartoon. It's 'Earthquake,' 'The Towering Inferno,' 'Krakatoa-East of Java,' 'The Poseidon Adventure,' 'The Bible,' and 'Airport '75' on steroids. Too many anguished characters, too many anti-heroes, too many noble savages, too many plots and subplots, no coherence, and virtual chaos.Such is what passes today for entertainment. Yes, this is a disaster movie alright, but probably not the kind of disaster the producers intended.",1,34,55,23 March 2010
The Graduate," No Longer 'Holding Up'
","More than fifty years after its release, I don't think this film is holding up. My main criticism, at this point, is Dustin Hoffman, who I feel was miscast, and his character, Ben, who does not seem genuine to me. Hoffman was too old (29 or 30) and too atypical in appearance, and he lacked the athletic form that a track star would have. Ben, the character Hoffman plays, for all of his academic and athletic prowess, is a complete loser. He can't even greet his parents' guests or engage in small talk. This makes no sense, in view of the cultured and socially motivated parents he has. Ben has no grace. The guests at the party, in fact almost all of the adults, are strictly stereotypes, although Murray Hamilton -- excellent as always -- has some good moments. But, even so, almost all of the adults are generally nice, and genuinely like Ben, although it is not clear why.Why Mrs. Robinson would get mixed up with Ben remains a mystery. Her husband (Murray Hamilton) and her alcoholism are the reasons, I guess, but there is no real character development to give us an insight into her behavior. The daughter, played by Katharine Ross, delivers a stiff, one-dimensional performance She went on to become a pretty good actress.The soundtrack is holding up fairly well, but to be honest, the songs largely deal with an individual's right to occupy the center of the universe. The music was very egocentric.All of this is just opinion, 20/20 hindsight, if you will, so no one has to get mad. It's an enjoyable flick, tedious and predictable at times, but worth seeing once or twice, but not repeatedly. As for Hoffman, he would very soon put in a timeless performance in 'Midnight Cowboy.'",5,2,4,3 March 2019
There Will Be Blood," Be Honest -- It's a Mess
","Now that the hysteria has died down, it's time to revisit this movie.First, Daniel Day-Lewis is playing the same role, movie after movie. I couldn't help but think of his performance in Gangs of New York (as Bill Cutting) as I watched this picture. He makes what he does appear so effortless that it is a pleasure to see him on screen, but giving him an Oscar for this picture is not too different from giving John Wayne an Oscar for True Grit.Second, there is no character development. We don't know why Day-Lewis is in the desert, what started him prospecting, what got him interested in oil, or what happens to him during the years the movie glosses over.There is no rational explanation for why he turns out the way he does. (Am trying to avoid spoilers.) The movie does not make sense. Sorry to disappoint you . . . .One good thing: It is not a Coen Brothers film, and lacks the pretense of their films.",3,1,3,7 August 2008
Saints and Soldiers," Needed To Avoid Modern Sayings and Expressions
","It's a very small story, but I disagree with those that say it was poorly acted.And, the artificial snow is fairly effective, better than 'Band of Brothers,' for example.My beef with many films, especially films written by relatively young writers, is that they use expressions not in use during the period of time covered by the film.For example, one of the characters says 'No problem' instead of 'thank you.' This 'no problem' thing did not start until the 80s. The same is true for 'Whatever.' I counted at least six, maybe eight, colloquialisms used in the film that no one was using in the 1945.The story is okay, and the directing is okay, too. Worth a look! 5 out of 10.",5,0,2,20 April 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," American Academy Declares Bankruptcy
","I can't say this movie is so much awful as it is unappetizing and uninteresting. Unattractive characters, contrived situations, uninspired direction, unintelligible dialog, it's all there.Truly, awarding this movie 'Best Picture' marks the end of the American Academy and any claims it had to intellectual or creative integrity. It shows that an institution as venerable as the Academy is completely capable of rotting from the inside, largely thanks to the younger members. How pathetic that millions of viewers have been scammed by this pretentious mess.",1,34,63,2 June 2009
Valkyrie," Critics be Damned!
","I agree with every word PRAGERS wrote, below.But what prompts me to add my additional comment is the absolute failure of the critics to rise above their dislike of Cruise and to recognize this film for the near-masterpiece that it is. As for Cruise, his performance is understated and nuanced. Only once was I reminded that he is, after all, an American, and never once was I reminded of his other work. This was a Cruise I had not seen before.The film is superb story-telling. Everything about the production is excellent.Here's is something I will always remember. The film was preceded by six (!!!) previews. Each preview was an assault on the nervous system: An explosion of color, motion, and sound -- and nothing else. When Valkyrie began to roll, suddenly my ears stopped ringing and my brain was engaged. Imagine! A film that depends on dialog! And why don't the critics get it? Because in their arrogant, insulated world,they don't have to. I have no respect for them or their craft.",10,5,9,1 January 2009
