The Blair Witch Project," Waste of film
","I'd select a negative number to rate this movie, if, I could !!! It wasn't frightening! It was a joke and should have been billed as a comedy. I had gone to the theater to see this movie, I recall leaving midway through the movie. I was bored to tears and stunned anybody would bother to waste their time even making a piece of trash like this. I only feel shame at being suckered into seeing this movie when it came out. A bunch of kids walking around in the woods, video taping each other, being scarred by a few noises. I guess their mommy wasn't there to tuck them in at night. The only redeeming thing I found to come out of this was a spoof done by the Cartoon Network. What I can't understand is how this movie didn't fall into the worst movie ever made category on IMDb.",1,4,8,30 April 2007
