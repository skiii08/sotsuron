Antz," A very, very fun movie!
","I don't usually go for animated movies, so I was a little weary to see this one. But I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it.  It's so cool to see great animation, and hear the voices of such great stars!  And the music was pretty good too!  This movie is for everyone. I can't imagine anyone having something bad to say about it, even people who don't like animated movies.",8,0,0,25 September 1998
The 13th Warrior," Just what I needed...
","This movie is exactly what I've been waiting for.  Well, I haven't been losing sleep hoping for a movie like this, but it definately hit the spot. I love movies like this, a medieval setting, complete with swords, horses, rolling landscapes, and of course, battle. This movie doesn't have much of a plot or story, but c'mon....when it gets down to it, any movie with lots of blood and action doesn't really (Starship Troopers).  Of course it helps (Braveheart, Die Hard III) but for purely entertaining purposes, this movie is excellent.",9,0,0,28 August 1999
For Love of the Game," Highly Enjoyable Movie...
","I saw a sneak preview of 'For Love of the Game,' tonight, and I must say, I was thoroughly entertained by it.  And not merely entertained in the respect of some 'purely-made-to-entertain' movies, but this movie inspired emotion, one thing I think really makes a movie. If a movie makes you feel a certain way, whether it's anger, or happiness, I think it shows something.  'For Love of the Game,' did that for me.  Costner's character, excellently portrayed in my opinion, loved baseball, and in turn, I loved his character. I loved the whole movie actually. It was funny at times, symbolic at others, and above all, it was  quite enjoyable.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 10.  Again, this is just my opinion, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",10,20,31,11 September 1999
Army of Darkness," One of the most entertaining movies ever!
","I really can't get enough of this movie!  The more I watch it, the more I want to keep watching it. The excellent dialogue, the wonderful gore, and the medieval setting all contribute to a very fun, and very entertaining movie.  You'll watch it, you'll love it, and then you'll want to watch it again.",10,1,1,24 September 1998
