The Blair Witch Project," They should've had a script..
","About 5 or 10 minutes of this film were excellent. I was seriously scared, even more so because I knew the fate of the three kids. The ending, in the house, and a couple of the nighttime scenes, however, were the only scene that worked for me, and that I actually enjoyed. The rest of the movie was stupid, boring, and a waste of time. -If- the students had bothered the right a script, and set up the characters better, -if- they had made the dialogue more interesting and varied, -if- they had worked on making the characters likeable, then I might've really enjoyed this movie. Instead, I was bored to tears.Yes, the concept was good, yes, they had some very scary scenes, and yeah, they did very well considering they were college students with no budget. But I watch movies to be entertained, and this movie did not entertain me for the majority of the time. Therefore, I give it *1/2 stars out of *****",Null,0,1,11 July 2000
