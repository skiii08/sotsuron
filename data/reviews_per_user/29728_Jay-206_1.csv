The Blair Witch Project," It's been a long time since scary movies were scary. The wait is over.
","5 out of 5 stars!!What can I say about this movie that hasn't so eloquently said?  Not much.  I too was lucky enough to see a screening of this film, and I can honostly say, it is the scariest, creepiest, most unsettling movie I've seen in years, if not ever.Having been a fan of Stephen King stories (although not necessarily the movies) for as long as I can remember, I have come to love the feeling of being afraid of the unknown, the unseen; letting your imagination run away with your sense of reality.  Mr. King has a way of painting a picture of things dark and demonic that makes your skin crawl.This movie goes WAY beyond that.  The movie in and of itself is nothing more than a terrifying glimpse into our own deep, dark minds, the place where our imaginations tell us there is something hiding in the closet when reality tells us there just isn't anything there.Don't expect flashy special effects, gory bloodbaths, or hideous monsters in the Blair Witch Project, the monsters in this movie are the fear of the unknown, the unseen.  Watching Heather, Josh, and Michael track the Blair Witch, you can't help but sympathize with them, empathize with them, fear for them.  The reality with which the movie is presented only makes your imagination work faster.Then, the hair on your body stands up from head to toe; and it won't go down for some time after leaving the theater.Don't miss this movie; and don't watch it alone.",Null,1,2,12 July 1999
