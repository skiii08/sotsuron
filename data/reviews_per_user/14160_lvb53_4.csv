Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat? The funniest movie ever? No thanks.
","Borat is a really really fun movie. I'd pretty recommend it BUT I've read that this is 'The funniest movie ever' which I DON'T agree on. 'Airplane' is a much funnier movie. Borat is very controversial and starts uproar in the press. Very disgusting.In difference with 'Airplane', almost everyone can watch it, in Borat, not everyone could see it. Of course, they could but as I said, very controversial and many people may find the contents offensive for ethnic groups.The beginning of the movie was hilarious but when it comes for them to sleep over at a Jewish family they walked very far across the line.Borat? No thanks. Airplane? Yes, please.",3,3,6,2 December 2006
Saw III," Great movie!
","This movie is as equal as good as the previous two Saw-movies! I loved this one! I just can't wait for it to be released on a DVD because I gotta see it again. This movie totally kicks @$$.Very thrilling and this movie is what I thought Saw II was about, now Jeff is walking through a maze and Jigsaw is so clever as he always have been. I went to the theater with low expectations because the newspaper reviewed it and they said it was a really really bad movie but when I came out I finally understood why they gave it so bad review. The main reason may be that they haven't seen the two first movies. Trust me, if you are going to see Saw III you have to watch the previous two Saw-movies, no exceptions. If you go watch Saw III without you've seen any else movies you are a completely idiot, you won't understand anything of it, I promise, nothing if you haven't seen any Saw-movies.As for those who already seen Saw and Saw II, go see this! You will be pleased! Not as disgusting as the previous movies. =)You could almost say that the Saw-trilogy is a thrilling episode of TV-series '24' or special-episodes of 'CSI'. =)",10,7,14,2 December 2006
I Am Legend," Crappy remake of '28 weeks later'.
","(before saying anything, my English can be pretty bad since English is not my primary language.)After seeing this movie, I was beginning to wondering how the producers were thinking while they did this movie. So I'm gonna start now, my own thoughts, from idea to production:Two producers was at home, watching '28 weeks later', then they realize: 'What a great movie! We should do something like this!'. They pull out their savings box and discovers they have 20 million bucks to use. And this is how their spent their budget:90% to Will Smith. 9% to closing Manhattan. 1% to the rest.And what is that one percent? That's the film editor who sat in his basement for 30 days, desperately trying to animate monsters during his 30 day trial period for the software he was using because the producers didn't have enough money to buy a full version. And they didn't even have enough money to hire extras as zombies.But then something happened, they managed to get a hold of some extra money, so what do they do? They hire another actress to support Will Smith and they hire a dog! Very clever!And then the movie opened and the movie got a profit for about 20 million dollars.And what happens next? The producers are watching 'Heroes', and then they say 'Let's make another one!', so they ask Will Smith to be in a new movie called 'Hancock', and what they are doing now, no one knows!Stay away from this movie.Go watch '28 weeks later' instead.",3,4,6,3 February 2008
The Godfather," Bad, really really bad!
","Okay, so I've seen this now and I began asking myself, how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at IMDb and how come everyone loves this movie? I've seen this and, it's horrible. I fell asleep after watching two hours of this. This and Pirates of the Caribbean is the only movies I've fallen asleep to, seriously, and yet it's so unrealistic, like when Don Corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives. You would die after two shots from those types of guns also.Go see Donnie Brasco if you like gangster movies. This is bad, really BAD!",1,11,62,24 April 2007
