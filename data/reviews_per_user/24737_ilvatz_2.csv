Casablanca," The Ultimate Romance
","This movie was by far one of the best romances that I have ever seen. It is generally not my favorite genre of movie but the raw emotion present throughout this masterpiece greatly moved me. The cinematography of this film is just absolutely beautiful. Every scene seems like it was shot less as a method of capturing a story, but more as if trying to paint a beautiful picture. The sets sometimes seem to frame characters at important moments in the plot and the heavy use of contrast to create very shadowy scenes sets the mood for a mysterious romance so perfectly that you can only call it a masterpiece. I found the acting to be masterful. The characters that the actors and actresses portrayed were done so flawlessly that i couldn't find a single character who i didn't think was portrayed beautifully. They captured the raw emotion of the characters and i almost believed that I was watching real events unfold before my eyes.",10,3,4,13 May 2012
The Graduate," Hilariously dark
","I found this movie to be amazing. Although at times the plot was rather unrealistic, the intense performance of the lead roles more than made up for it. The camera work in the film is beautifully done and you can tell that every little angle or tint or shot was shrewdly calculated and planned and placed there in such a way that the aesthetic experience of the movie was as amazing as possible. On top of the brilliant acting and beautiful unmatched cinematography the soundtrack was beautifully done. Simon and garfunkel provide the perfect peaceful backdrop to the turmoil of the story and all of the mezsed up details behind the characters personal relationships. My favorite use of sound was in the scene where his car us running out of gas and the music slows along with the car. I also found it brilliant that the characters did not make eye contact at the end. It goes to show that the hasty decisions of youth don't always end foe the best but the ride is always worth the toil.",10,0,0,13 May 2012
