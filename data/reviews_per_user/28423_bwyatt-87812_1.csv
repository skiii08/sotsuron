Hereditary," No
","I needed a little more hand-holding than the movie gives. I had to read afterwards to discover plot points that I somehow missed even though I was glued to the screen the whole time because the scenes are visually so great. It is such a slow movie, which I like a lot of times, but this one is painful. Plus, the little girl was the best part of the movie and then she dies halfway through. A huge bummer.I even liked the first two-thirds of the movie, but then it lost me with the seance. That's where Toni Collette, who I loved in Little Miss Sunshine, begins overacting and it's terrible. Queue the confusing plot points. She finds a headless corpse in the attic, which is super creepy and a great plot twist, but she assumes it's her dead mother. I thought the little girl was the one that was decapitated and I kept hoping she would come back somehow, but I was left wanting. Then she begs her husband at least 20 times to throw a book in the fire. It's like they were trying to make it funny through sheer repetition. The husband walks up to the fire and inexplicably decides not to do it. I do not understand his character it needs more background or something. Then she chucks it in the fire and, again inexplicably, he spontaneously combusts. I thought she was the one that was supposed to catch fire. Then off-screen I guess Collette gets possessed by someone or something because she traps her son in the attic, but it's never explained who is controller her. Then she saws off her own head, also super creepy, but I have no idea why the controlling spirit does this.I think I would have liked it if the first part of the movie had been scarier with a little more explaining. I also think I would have liked it if the last part of the movie was not scary and just a conflict-resolution drama of a grieving family. The first part of the film was a great setup for this. But the film didn't do either. I need to rate it 1/10 to offset all the glowing reviews. And nobody in my family liked this one.",1,1,4,13 February 2019
