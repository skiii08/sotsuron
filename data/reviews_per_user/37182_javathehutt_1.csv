The New World," More like watching a poem than a movie
","If you're looking for your typical Colin Farrell action movie, you'll definitely want to pass on this. If you like movies to be spoon-fed to you in bite-size plot points, you'll want to pass. Malicks New World is more like watching a poem than a movie.The New World traces the virgin paths of emotion and contemplation traveled by these characters inwardly as they encounter cultures and peoples of which they could not have conceived until now. I found a bittersweet melancholy in the way the inner journeys of Pocohantas (Q'Orianka Kilcher), Smith (Colin Farrell), and Rolfe (Christian Bale) reflect the outward struggle between the Europeans and this new world they have encountered.The movie was filmed to capture emotion and spirit, thus leaving the audience dizzy with the amour and confusion the characters experience together. The chemistry between the characters was gripping, and the romance elegantly and tastefully captured both visually and audibly in the ballet of prayers they whisper.I highly recommend The New World to anyone who enjoys artistic films. I only hope that we don't have to wait another eight years for another film from Malick.",10,7,15,30 January 2006
