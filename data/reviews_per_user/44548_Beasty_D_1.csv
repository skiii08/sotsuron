Scarface," Hmmm.
","This is the best gangsta' film out, i don't care i can watch this film as many times as i can and not get tired of it. I am sure there's a lot of people like this. Its way better then Godfather and Casino(which i don't class as a gangsta' film). You all say Scarface has only got a improving resurgence lately due to hip hop, (which is true, every time i watch MTV Cribs, all the rappers on there have got their copies of the film and always 'big it up', the only reason for that is because it was so influential, it shows a young man rising in ranks and eventually collapsing into misery and hatred and in the end his downfall, this can happen so much in the music game, just look at all the 1 hit wonders. Whats the problem with that, rappers saying its good, it makes more people go and rent it or buy it and if that didn't happen, less people would know about it.",10,0,1,12 August 2005
