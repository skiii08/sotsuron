Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A new movie with new adventures, new actors, but in all honestly, really just more of the same.
","For those of you who don't know, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in Disney's Pirates franchise has officially been released. A new movie with new adventures, new actors, but in all honestly, really just more of the same.The film started off well enough, with Johnny Depp, once again embodying the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, making his grand entrance while trying to save his first mate, Gibbs (played of course by Kevin McNally) from the gallows. Then on to a failed escape and yet another grand (or familiar) entrance by the great Geoffrey Rush as the infamous Barbossa. Captain Jack makes another terrific, and comical escape, leading to a chase producing one of the best filmed sequences in the movie. All right this is what I liked about the movie: That chase sequence, and some of the better choreographed fights, Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica, played by the gorgeous Oscar winner Penélope Cruz, and the fantastically underused, Ian McShane. Sparrow and Angelica's interactions were some of the best scenes in the film as well as the big mermaid sequence. Now for what I didn't like: the Spanish's pursuit of the Fountain of Youth, just felt useless. The romance between the religious boy and the mermaid, Astrid Berges-Frisbey and Sam Claflin, just was not that interesting. The fact that Blackbeard was so fantastically underwritten, and the loss of momentum starting after the first big chase.Other than the mermaid surprise, back before I even knew of their involvement in the film, I was down right shocked by the choice of Rob Marshall as this film's director. Marshall is a well known as a Tony Award nominated choreographer and director, and even more well known as the Academy Award winning director of the musical Chicago. All in all, I really only liked the film in bits and pieces, Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane as Angelica and Blackbeard, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, the idea of the story (even if the script itself left more to be desired). First time Pirates director, Robb Marshall did well enough, though not as good as we could have hopped. He directed the fight and chase sequences like grand musical numbers, giving the audience some fantastic moments, but in the end the film as a whole, fell flat to my expectations. We don't get good movies out of the bits and pieces of good moments do we? As for all you hard core Pirates and Jack Sparrow fans out there, I'm sure you will enjoy the film as the heart and soul of the franchise, Mr. Johnny Depp, was used in almost every scene. The film should have revamped the series, instead they played it safe with a glossy studio film, made seemingly only to keep interest in the series. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides gets an 8 for the good use of Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. A 4 for not bringing anything new to the series, pacing issues and the terribly small amount of screen time for Ian McShane. In the end the fourth Pirates movie left me a little unsatisfied, and after averaging it out Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, gets a 6 which stands for average.",6,2,5,21 May 2011
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games
","A tangible and powerful look at America's fascination with reality shows and violence on television, The Hunger Games is the only movie in 2012 that I saw twice in one day. It is also the only film in which I felt a strong connection to the main character. Maybe it's our age, or just that with the dark hair Jennifer Lawrence I look somewhat similar (which makes my girl crush all the more creepy), but I felt a kinship with Miss Katniss Everdeen. That being said the lovely Jennifer Lawrence just killed it. For lack of more appropriate adjectives, she acted the crap out of this role. I fell for her almost instantly which kept me rooting for her the whole way through, which is exactly what Suzanne Collins wanted. Although everyone else seemed to fall secondary, I think the film was excellently cast. I'd heard somewhere that Josh Hutcherson was miscast, but I thought he did a fine job, at the very least I didn't notice anything bad to comment on. The filmmakers did a good job at highlighting the differences between the higher Districts and the Capitol. In fact when I saw the Capital I nearly fell out of my seat! It was like a legion of crazy pop stars, it felt like you were literally walking through a Katy Perry or Nicki Minaj music video. Although the thing that surprised me the most about The Hunger Games was Elizabeth banks, who was completely unrecognizable in her role as Effie Trinket the District 12 escort. Though it is EARLY in the year and any real recognition is unlikely, I hope that the Academy will at least take notice of the costume design. I can't remember if Gary Ross has done a film like this before, and by that I mean something with this much action, fight scenes. Although there wasn't as much violence as one might expect, and a lot of the real bloody violence takes place at one particular moment. The fact that they were children brutally killing each other made it all the more difficult to swallow. Gary Ross used shaky camera work to mask some of the brutality of it all, and using Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones characters commentary to replace Katniss' narration was a brilliant compromise if you ask me. I think The Hunger Games would have done better as an R- rated feature. Not that the box office could be any better, but as a film about a televised fight to the death, it would have been interesting to have seen it taken to the next level. Although, that way so many of the the young fans would of had to miss out on the... fun? Overall I REALLY enjoyed The Hunger Games, and in fact, I cannot wait to own a copy of my very own. Hopefully with lots of Special Features!",7,1,8,5 April 2012
Tangled," Oh Disney, you've still got it
","All right, finally to the good stuff. Tangled, the latest Disney movie, or should I say the first decent Disney (animated) movie in years. Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? And yes, I mean Disney, not Pixar. All right, lets back up a minute here. Tangled is the first Disney Fairytale, in years. Originally Tangled was set to be something of an Enchanted-type flick, but the idea was scraped, when the producers realized, uh we're the Disney corporation, we kind of invented the animated fairytale. Which is really eloquent way of saying, that Tangled (bad name by the way, should have stayed Repunzel) is a wonderful throwback to the old days of Disney, the Snow White days, the Cinderella, the Swan Princess days. I felt completely entranced by the story, and excited to see the characters develop. Taking the original Grimm Brothers tale and giving it that classic Disney flavor, that gives the story that light, fluffy taste we all know and love. The fun, funny, free-spirit attitude is just what animation needed and in the end made me really happy, and really, what's a Disney movie without that little twinge of joy? Disney's first CGI Fairytale brought the warmth and sensitivity of their hand-drawn films to CGI was a complete success and a fun, entertaining evening the whole family can enjoy. (Do I actually say things like that?) The real flaw with Tangled, was the marketing campaign, from the commercials it seemed kind of stupid. They should have marketed it as a classic Disney movie, adding in the funny little scenes with Flynn and guitar playing Repunzel. I honestly didn't even know the movie was a musical until the first song. Maybe they were trying to get a wider audience, I don't know, but I'm glad I gave it the chance to surprise me. ++Who knew Zachary Levi could sing?",8,3,6,20 December 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott, if your life had a face, I would kiss it
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World got a lot of hype, luckily enough, it lived up to my expectations, and than some. Other then the fact that this movie is just plain cool, it is in fact genius, or should I say, the director Edgar Wright is a genius. He is also, the king of spoof. Wright is the only director out there today who seems to actually understand what a spoof movie is. In today's world of Scary Movie 4 and Meet the Spartans, it's nice to know that I'll have something to get out of bed for. It's a fun, funny, unique and an interesting look at love and how the past affects the future. Wright was able to capture the essence of all 6 books and turn it into the best cinematic adventure of the summer. Using the style of the modern musical, using the moment when the characters would usually break into song and dance and instead having them break into a fight. Edgar Wright's dizzying cinematic style, never misses a beat, dripping with deadpan humor and break out stars. Michael Cera, being surprisingly un-Michael Cera-y, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the perfect dream girl, with Ellen Wong, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson, and the list goes on and on. The person that I found particularly surprising however, Kieran Culkin. Kieran Culkin, as the cool gay roommate, a scene-stealer? Who knew? For those of you who didn't like this movie, you either A) didn't understand it or B) never actually saw it. So here it is, even if you didn't understand this movie, maybe you could at least appreciate its unique charm. You don't have to see Scott Pilgrim the way that I do, but I do, however, insist that you all give him a chance. I mean, he's Scott Pilgrim.",9,1,6,15 January 2011
The Hangover Part II," Sequel or Remake?
","So here's how it goes, three guys wake up in a hotel room with no recollection of the night before, with obvious signs of misdeeds, including a missing friend. Does any of this sound familiar to you genre fans? Well it should, because it is EXACTLY like the first Hangover movie. The same movie only in Bangkok/Thailand, and this time Stu is the one getting married, Doug's wife is pregnant and the bride-to-be's little brother is the one missing. This might sound like good news to some Hangover fans, but this fan was, once again, left unsatisfied.Whatever the reason is, I just did not like this movie. I wanted so badly to love this movie, but alas, I did not. None of the actors seemed to be on their a-game either, as Ed Helms, over does it with the squeamish, wimp routine and Bradley Cooper seems like he could careless. Zach Galifianakis, who got most of the good lines, pulls them off well enough, but the writers didn't stain any muscles trying to give him anything to work with. It's hard to say exactly what could have made this movie better. Quiet frankly I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was this lazy. The filmmakers even went as far as to recreate, almost to a tea, some of the scenes from the first one. Opening the movie with a phone call to Tracey. Running around on the roof looking for Teddy, mirroring running on the roof looking for Doug. The moment Stu realizes where the missing person is. . . blah blah blah – Oh and take a guess as to how the movie ends?Overall, The Hangover Part II, is not as memorable as the first one, there aren't as many quotable lines, and Bridesmaids was a much better film. The movie earned it's R rating, but it still managed to feel safe, lazy and tired. So in end the end, I will let this week's movie slide with a 4 for sometimes making me laugh.",4,1,2,31 May 2011
Unbroken," Inspirational Story
","The film is set mainly during WWII, based on the life of problem child, turned Olympian turned war hero Louis Zamperini. A real life figure who is portrayed by the relatively unknown (in America anyways) Jack O' Connell. The film starts off well enough, putting us right into the action of Zamperini's war days, with flashbacks to his time as a trouble making kid, and back to the war and back to his time as a track star... and back and forth until the two story lines catch up with each other. The trailers left me with the impression that the bulk of the story would be spent in the Japanese internment camps, it actually took close to an hour to get us there. Although at over a 2 hour running time, the argument could be made, that all that preceded the POW camp was back story, or build up. I do commend the filmmakers for trying to stay as close to real events and timeliness as possible. That being said, the film did feel a bit slow to me at times. Maybe after a second screening I won't feel as off by the pacing knowing when the parts of the story I saw in the trailer were coming. This film is only the second feature from superstar turned filmmaker, Angelina Jolie, with a screenplay by none other than the the famed writer/director siblings, Joel and Ethan Coen. I'm not sure if you've figured this out yet, but I am a big supporter of the female filmmaker. However I did find a few problems with Angelina's directing, that I feel the need to comment on. As I said earlier the pacing of the film seemed a little slow for my taste, but that's something I can get past. The physical scenes, like Zamperini getting beat up as a child, or disciplined by his father fell flat. Instead of utilizing close ups to show pain or emotion, these scenes were left mostly as wide shots, or what I call establishing shots, as if we were just watching what was happening and not experiencing it from Louis point of view. The same goes for the more brutal scenes in the camps. However, the argument could be made that this was done on purpose, to show a more human side to Zamperini's tormentors. Maybe I've become too desensitized by modern filmmaking, but I still feel there could have been a few more cuts to close ups and reaction shots to convey more of a sense of urgency or fear. I do appreciate the overall feel of the movie, Angelina Jolie seems to have a very romantic sense of filmmaking, not unlike Sofia Coppola. Which can be wonderful, but I've had the same pacing issue with some of Coppola's films as I had with this film. That being said the nominations that Unbroken was awarded were well deserved, cinematography and sound mixing and sound editing (though you'd be hard pressed to find a decent war movie that was not nominated for a sound achievement). I just hope that miss Jolie (or Mrs. Jolie-Pitt, whatever she goes by) is aware of the talent of her crew, and appreciates their contribution to the film. that being said, I do feel that Angelina Jolie has talent as a director. The cast was absolutely amazing, and their performances were top notch. It is very obvious that Jolie knows how to direct her actors.So, when all is said and done, if you go into Unbroken expecting an inspirational story over a war drama, you will not be disappointed. I am excited to see more of Angelina Jolie in this medium as well as the actors and crew.",7,0,1,25 April 2015
