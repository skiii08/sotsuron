E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An absolute classic
","Steven Spielberg is considered one of modern Hollywood's founding fathers. Possibly not by coincidence, some of his closest friends, Francis Ford Coppela, George Lucas and composer John Williams are also regarded as leading Hollywood from the brink of collapse, influencing modern filmmakers the world over.E.T. is one of cinema's most iconic characters and still today, over 25 years later, enchants audiences of all ages.E.T. is an alien from an undisclosed planet, visiting earth to gather agricultural matter for later study when his ship leaves for home without him. A stranger on a strange planet, E.T. seeks means to signal his family of his abandonment and in the process, befriends a young boy by the name of Elliot. Much humour and excitement ensues leading up to a tear jerking finale which is easily one of the most memorable of all time.The movie is adapted from a personal tale from Spielberg's own childhood. His parents going through a divorce and young Steven finding a way to cope with this, he created an imaginary friend. Years later once he had established himself as a filmmaker, he decided this was an excellent subject for a family movie and so enlisted the help of screenwriter friend Melissa Mathison. Unwilling at first to write the screenplay, Melissa eventually succumbed and made a decision which would change her life forever.One of the best decisions of Spielberg made was to enlist the help of another friend, John Williams, who had worked with him before on the equally memorable movies, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. Williams brought the story together with his epic soundtrack that when listened to independently of the movie, still is as captivating. The heart of the film is really held here and as any movie goer will tell you, is unmistakable.The one scene which really resonated with the audience has to be the classic and often parodied bicycle ride in the sky, the young actors silhouetted in the sun to John William's sweeping theme is always met with a cheer from the audience and is often the first thing recalled when asked 'What is your favourite scene from E.T.?'.The bond which develops between Elliot's family and the pug-faced little alien is one the audience truly is involved with and every emotion they feel is felt by the viewer. An experience which is crucial to any movie but sadly missed in most modern family tales. There is an X factor to it, but the genius of Steven Spielberg and John Williams is possibly why the movie was such a hit and judging by it's recent re-release in 2002, this hold true for a new generation of movie goers.E.T. is a picture which could be shown in another 25 years and still hold a massive audience. It is a yardstick to which hundreds of movies since have been measured and we have yet to see any that come close. An absolute classic.",10,1,2,13 August 2007
Taxi Driver," One of the most powerful movies of our time
","Every aspiring director, screenwriter and cinematographer has a movie they hold dear, that changed the way they look at cinema forever. Taxi Driver, for me, was that movie.Travis Bickle, unbalanced by events he witnessed in Vietnam while serving in the Marine Core, decides he must keep himself busy in a bid to save his sanity.Unable to sleep and disgusted by the world around him, he sees no good left in anyone and decides it's time to make a stand against the evil that surrounds him.What sets this movie apart from any other in my view is the internal conflict De Niro portrays on screen and how Scorsese presents this mental anguish to the audience. Very little dialogue is required, thus the audience is invited to interpret the movie how they wish.Not before nor since has an actor had such an impact on an audience as De Niro. His presence on screen keeps you captivated from start to finish, truly holding on to your seat. Before long while rooting for him to do the right thing, you soon find yourself empathising and giving him your blessing to carry out what is ultimately to be the most visually shocking showdown in movie history.It is incomprehensible that Scorsese did not receive an Oscar for this celluloid masterpiece. It has taken over 30 years for the academy to recognize his genius.The score, screenplay, photography, casting and direction made this the most unforgettable cinematic experience of its generation and still today holds as much intensity, over 30 years on, as it ever did.A sad thing, that art this powerful will possibly never be seen again.",10,0,1,3 March 2007
Ghostbusters," Everything a comedy should aspire to be
","Penned by and starring Dan Ayroyd and Harold Ramis, this supernatural comedy has it all.Coming from the heritage of the Second City troupe and National Lampoon, it's everything it should have been plus a little bit more and still today is loved and watched by fans all over the world.Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver have an on-screen chemistry that dazzles and supporting stars Rick Moranis, Anne Potts, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson fit their roles like a fine leather glove.The writing is tight and hilarious with one liner after one liner which was truly brought to life with Murray's dead pan persona literally glowing on screen.Bags of fun and great family viewing, though caution should be noted with younger viewers since there is some mild language and sexual reference in there, some of which you'll probably not remember!A classic, without doubt.",10,0,0,3 March 2007
