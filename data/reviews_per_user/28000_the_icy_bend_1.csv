Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why, Why, Why?!#
","Many years i waited for any kind of new star wars activity, my eyes crying with happiness at the news of a new star wars movie, i left the cinema also with eyes if tears, only this time, tears of sadness, disgust and a bitter sense of betrayal. It was terrible, sure the pod racing scene was revolutionary and other cgi effects but jar jar binks or whatever his name was completely destroyed the films chances of ever holding a clean slate, he was so childish and annoying. Did anyone want to take a hammer to his head or was that juts me. KILL JAR JAR BINKS!! Just another crumy way of getting cash without the flare or imaginative prospects of the original trilogy. Oh and why wont they let us buy the originals on DVD, i don't want the remastered versions with more extra scenes than buses in London! Give us the original not these new steaming piles of turd only fit for pre teens with no idea for cinema!!!!!",3,0,1,30 June 2004
