The Blair Witch Project," Great suspense!
",I am disappointed that most of the people who have seen this movie did not like it. You all seem to be brainwashed by the special effects and blood and gore that modern movies today have to offer. This is just showing how much the media is exploiting violence and how one by one we are becoming immune to the extent that is portrayed. Blair Witch is a refreshing change from all the bulls**t trash that we devour every year. A film doesn't necessarily have to have a $100 million+ budget and an arrangement of machine guns to be a masterpiece. Blair Witch plays with the mind psychologically. It isn't a case of when the 'scary' moments are ( I am referring to several comments that other people have posted) but what the it is and what it will do next. The beauty of it was how it was made and set out. I am a 15 year old female so my opinion probably is of no value to you but I can tell you I seem to have understood more of this film than most of you.,10,1,2,27 January 2000
The Matrix," Fantastic
","Once again I see that people have misinterpreted this movie. Most of are oooh ahhhing about what great special effects this has (and I guess most of you are the computer obsessed generation that are set off by anything that involves a micro-chip)but seem to be ignoring the philosophical point of the movie. Now don't get me wrong I thought the SFX, music, ect. part of the movie was great, but what really fascinated me was the concept of the plot.
The idea that something is controlling us (and no I am not referring to god) whilst we live our meek lives oblivious to it is something to think about.
This movie tackles ideas that in our everyday lives we wouldn't dream of. Ideas that only our eccentric producers /directors /writers dare to explore.
And then you have people who go and trash the whole idea, and compare it to the most shallow of movies, (eg. terminator 2, okay what is it with that?). This movie wasn't produced to blow you away with special effects, it was produced to shock you with the idea that not all is what it seems.
And yes I know that it was not an original idea, but it took the idea to a different dimension.Give the Wachowski bro's just a little credit for what they achieved because I sincerely doubt anyone could produce anything half as good.",Null,0,0,13 March 2000
Gladiator," A fantastic movie!
","I have read over some of the past comments and have seen many contradictory statements. Of course this is to be expected from the diverse viewers we have, so I think it may be hard to actually get an average review.I must say that I loved this movie. I have always been fascinated by historically based fantasies, especially medieval and roman. So of course I felt an obligation to see Hollywood's latest attempt. Of course this dedication I have is not a resented one, because many of the past works I have witnessed are very good indeed.So I embarked on my trip to the cinema with little more than a rough idea of what it was all about. I emerged with the feeling that I had in fact stepped back in time.I thought that the whole concept of the movie was excellent. I can never get enough of producer's manipulation of history. The costumes were enchanting, the computer animation for the Colosseum was perfected.The acting, though, was what really captivated me. My favourite being Joaquin Phoenix. Him being the brother of the mesmerizing late River Phoenix, I knew that I was to see some good acting. But of course I had my doubts. In th past many let's say, aspiring, actors have tried to stumble in their siblings success. They then deliver a so-so performance, wrecking whatever status they were on to begin with. This in mind, I believed that Joaquin would be good, but not that good. I was wrong. The way he brought his character's personality to life, was captivating. Every little detail was manipulated so as to bring Commodus' insanity to it's full extent. Though, he was evil, the vulnerability was always there, always seeping through.So to conclude I must give it a score of 9/10. I would give a full 10 but the gore did at some times exceed even my limits.If you enjoy being captivated I strongly recommend you see this movie.",Null,0,0,10 June 2000
