The Blair Witch Project," It looks and feels real....that's the scary thing about
","In Australia at midnight over 200 hundred people flocked the cinemas to be the first to see The Blair Witch. Alot of hype and anticipation was surrounding the movie and to me it lives up the hype!Never in my life have I seen a movie with such fear and unhappiness in someones eyes that it was enough to keep me awake all night.This movie was set around three student film makers who set out on a on - foot hike through the BLACK HILLS in Burketsville on a search for the Blair Witch formally known as Elli.It was a weekand journey planned out by director Heather Donahue , who was making a documentry about the Blair Witch. Little does she know she was filming her last days here on this Earth.Watching the movie without music or professional camera shots was a much more frightening way of watching three people being hunted by something unknown the camera. Every new shot something  different was saw or heard and as the nights dragged on, things became more scarier and more obvious.The ending was terrifying and left the audience speechless. The fact that these three students didn't know what to expect and weren't expecting anything that had happened to them for those five nights was the most real life encounting fear and angst that it felt incrediably real and terrifying to watch.I really really loved this movie and it is the best scary flick ever made. It's independent which amazes me more but it's a job well done. It was planned and organised very well. Thumbs up!It's about time a movie with a reality check was finally made!",10,3,7,3 December 1999
