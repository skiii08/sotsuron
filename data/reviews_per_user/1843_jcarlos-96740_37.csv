Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining but overrated
","The movie is good and I enjoyed, but I feel that if it wasn't for this great cast the people wouldn't care about it that much and it was them alongside with the great production that capitalized it, not the story itself. Still a great movie with cool scenes and a good
overall picture",7,1,3,5 March 2020
Casablanca," So overrated
","My expectations were higher about this movie due the high ratings and to the fact that to a lot people this is one of the best movies ever, but after watching I don't really now why. Before anything else let me clear that I'm not that stupid dude who can't watch nothing before 2000, Citizen Kane is one year older that this and I completely loved it and rated it 10/10 but this movie felt really... average.To me this is a romance that marked that time due the historical and political context and the subjects that the movie has in it but the story itself is just a lame and boring love story with a extreme level of predictability, it's so predictable that when I read the synopsis I already knew how this was going to end, I hoped that I was wrong but unfortunately I wasn't. Besides the predictability, the plot was boring, the acting was average, there is no character development so you don't get attached to any of them. I know this was a propaganda movie and this actually sell's well the ideia of patriotism and victory against Germany, but the fact that this was for propaganda purposes should say a lot about this, the movie was rushed and the expectations were low but by some miracle everyone came to think that this is a masterpiece.
To me this is an american (propaganda) popcorn movie and nothing more then that. It's also one of the most quoted movies but I found a lot of the dialogues to be boring and unnecessary to the story development.It was well made but it wasn't a cinematography masterpiece if you ask me, in the first minutes we have a scene where a guy gets shot and then there's no blood no bullet wound no nothing he just drops himself awfully on the floor and when the police go to him he has nothing but a little bit of blood in his mouth... now I know it was 1942 but they could've done it better. It's a well made movie but far to be a masterpiece. It",6,0,3,16 April 2020
Gravity," Wasted potencial

Se7en," Extremely overrated
","I don't really understand the hype over this movie, it has a good cast and it is a good movie but it's different to be good and to be one of the greatest and this movie has nothing that makes it one of the greatest. The only interesting thing here is that the killer uses the seven deadly sins but even this premise could've been better used, the plot twist is kinda shocking but isn't one of the best ones, ain't one of those jaw dropping ones, at least not for me. The actors did normal nothing especial here too. I love movies of this kind but I got bored watching this and is really nothing special about it, just a massive disappointment",6,1,1,5 March 2020

Citizen Kane," A cinematography masterpiece
","This is one of the few cases when a movie lived to his hype! I was only 3 minutes into this and I was already amazed about how could this movie be from 1941, the cinematography in this was way ahead of it's time. Orson Welles couldn't really have done nothing better when it comes to directing, the scenes were all, and I really mean all perfect! I won't even waste time talking about technical aspects because this is simply flawless! I thought that I'd seen beautiful movies in my life but this one is unmatchable! At the age of 25 he made his debut movie and not only directed but starred and gave us this beautiful piece of art.When it comes to the story I really liked the storytelling with a summary of everything that happened in Kane's life in the public eye with that beautiful 'News on the March' and then the movie proceeds to give us a closer look to who he really was by interviewing people close to him and giving us flashbacks about the past with the purpose to discover what his final word 'rosebud' meant. It is though important to mention that the perspectives that the people who were closer to him gave to us are simply that, perspectives which the stories could've been influenced by their relationships.The meaning of this word arises such a beautiful debate and reflection. The most common and direct understanding is that it refers to his childhood and times of innocence. The times when he was poor and had nothing were also the happiest of his life meaning that wealth can't buy happiness, we can have all the things in the world like Kane had and still feel empty and sad.
The second possible meaning has a much more interesting theory and is not so obvious. In the night that Kane met Susan he says that he was going to a warehouse to revisit some memories of his past and at this point is pretty obvious that the main thing that he wanted from there was the sleigh, so that sleight was the cause for him to be in that street that night and therefore meeting Susan. And what happens after he and Susan met? They start to have an affair. His political rival discovers the affair and uses that to expose him and then he loses the election and his wife also discovers and that causes their divorce. After the divorce his ex-wife and son died in a car accident and we only know this by the news on the beginning of the movie but Welles doesn't show us his reaction or anything to that. That changed everything because he was on the path to becoming governor and maybe one day president but now all he have is Susan and builts a million dollar opera house trying to prove that his wife is a special singer and that he made no mistake for being with her. And at the end when she leaves him he says 'rosebud' because he remembers that was the pursue of that sleigh that made him go out that night that changed his life forever, the ideia that one single decision can change your entire life. The meaning of rosebud is ambiguous, maybe it meant the only time when Kane was truly happy and that he misses the most or maybe it reminded him of the reason to go out on the night that changed his life forever, or maybe it has another meaning but one thing we can all agree and it is said by that journalist at the end of the movie: 'No word can explain a man's life'.For a 1941 movie was not boring at all and this is not coming from a old man, I don't seriously know how can someone find this boring. I really hope that no one attempts to remake this and ruin it because it can't get better than this even if it had colors. It's a movie that not only cinephiles but everyone should see at least one time in their life times!",10,1,2,14 April 2020
Memento," Immersive experience
","The plot of the movie is interesting and the way the movie is made makes you have to think in the exact same way that the main character, who suffers from short term memory loss, because the scenes are short and then the movie goes backwards which I found pretty clever and original. The final plot twist was pretty good too, the movie also has some interesting quotes about memories and the value of them amongst other things, the overall picture is great and those black and white scenes really create tension and awakes even more curiosity. Another exceptional work by Christopher Nolan",8,0,1,8 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," This is Tarantino
","The movie is very stylistic and the camera angles, shots and overall directing by Tarantino in this one are just brilliant. A very strong and well created plot that keeps the viewer intrigued of what's happening next without predictable parts or movie cliches. The amazing dialogues are also a positive point like in the first chapter where Landa talks about the similarities between a squirrel and a rat but yet we love one but hate other, simple dialogues but that make us think, typical of Tarantino. The division in chapters and the fact that the different stories get combined in only one at the end was a very smart idea and it did fitted the movie very well. We also know that this director loves violence which isn't missing in this movie but I think is the right and appropriate amount of violence , not just stupid and unnecessary violence.
It's impossible to talk about this movie without mentioning the remarkable performance by Christoph Waltz, what an actor.
This movie definitely defines well Tarantino style and it's one of my favorite ones!",10,2,3,23 March 2020
Us," Awful
","Before I watched this movie I thought by seeing the trailer that it had potential but turns out and it is hands down one of the worst terror movies I've ever seen, it's not even scary to begin with, no good old jump scares moments no nothing, just a illogical story, it's even cringe",3,2,5,5 March 2020

","Not everyone can sit and watch a Movie for 3 hours and I am one of those people but this one was worth the time and the movie really required that duration, its long but with content so no problem there. Great directing by Scorsese with amazing storytelling. The cast was incredible and they're a huge factor for the movies success. I don't usually like mafia movies but this one was good and was based on some veridic facts.",8,3,6,5 March 2020
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino at his best
","If you didn't liked this movie and yet you call yourself a Tarantino fan something is wrong with you because this movie sums up his entire style: outstanding writing with great storytelling, social critics and dialogues that make you think, great direction skills with beautiful plans and angles, and of course the classic Tarantino violent side.Not everyone has the ability of making an entire movie in just one place and still have you glued on the screen the entire time, this one really shows how an exceptional writer he is. Today I rewatched it and I noticed the mention to Red Apple Tobacco that is also mentioned in his latest movie, just showing how much effort he puts in his writing and that he wants to connect his movies by some way.If it bothers you the cursing, racism and violence in this movie maybe you should just go and watch Disney productions because without all of those aspects this wouldn't have portrayed the reality of that time as faithful as it did. Tarantino is never afraid of portraying reality as it is and that's why I said that this is not for everyone because a lot of people can't deal with reality. And let's not forget that all of those things and the purpose to make various social critics. This movie isn't underrated because it's bad but because of the sensibility of people.
Now the last chapter events surely aren't for the weakest ones but it's just classic Tarantino kicking in!",10,1,3,24 April 2020
Interstellar," The true definition of masterpiece
","I watched this movie in the cinema in the year that it came out and I absolutely loved it. Today, about 6 years later I've just finished rewatching this and I loved it even more, this movie feels like wine, the older the better. This was probably the only time that I cried in a sci-fi movie like I was watching some love drama, this is extremely touching and poetical! The Visual Effects Oscar was well deserved because the space scenes that this movie delivers are absolutely amazing, not only the ones in space even the shots on Earth were beautiful, but giving this only a Visual Effects Oscar is unfair, and this shows how great this movie is, the fact that even though it got an Oscar still wasn't enough, this deserved Best Picture and Best Director Oscars as well. The main theme soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is probably the best I've ever heard in my life and I think the Best Soundtrack Oscar should've been given to this movie as well, listening to that sound create so many different feelings, is really a masterpiece!
Nolan's work was flawless and you really can't ask more from a director, technically speaking this is perfect.
The narrative and that plot twist were also one of the most remarkable ones in the history of the cinema, and to me personally this is one of the greatest stories a movie ever told, this movie is about humanity, family, love, evolution, science, space, survival, perseverance, really this movie has it all and that fact alongside an unforgettable visual experience will forever make this one of my favorite movies of all time!",10,0,0,5 March 2020
Oblivion," Why is this low rated?

This is probably one of the most underrated sci-fi movies ever but yet one of my favorites!",9,0,0,22 April 2020
The Shining," The best horror movie
","I'm pretty sure this is the best horror movie I've ever seen in my entire life, this is a perfect masterpiece a classic that everybody should watch at least one time in their life times. This is timeless terror and also smart terror. The movie really mess with your mind, for example until this very day there are some parts that I'm not really sure if I did see it right or if it was just my imagination like that scene when the old man is laying in his bed and there are two pictures there of naked women and it seemed to me like they moved their eyes really quick in one part, little things like that make this movie unforgettable and I'm not even a terror movies fan. For what I've read the movie is different from the book in some parts but I don't really care if the Kubrick decided to change this or that in the book, could've been better if followed entirely the book or not I don't now I've never read it but doesn't matter because this movie is already a masterpiece so stop complaining and enjoy hit.
I also don't know how can people be saying that Jack Nicholson didn't had a great performance when he was clearly brilliant and this is his most iconic role!
The photography is also phenomenal with amazing shots and wide angles of this huge hotel that only by itself creates tension.
I enjoyed the whole movie and right when I thought it couldn't get better the movie surprised with a mind blowing final shot, that ending is incredible!",10,1,3,6 March 2020
American Beauty," How is this a masterpiece?
","My expectations were really high since all I ever heard about this movie were good things but now I don't really seem to understand the reason for that. Technically and visually yes Sam Mendes did a great job and this movie is beautiful to watch but like it happened in one of his other movie (1917) the visuals didn't matched the plot.The plot is really boring if you ask me and I think that people who are saying that this has a great message are just looking to close, even when a movie is about nothing there are always some 'smart' ones who claim that it had a deeper meaning like in this case. Everything about this movie is a complete cliche. The facade wedding, the cheating wife, the father that can't connect to his teenage daughter who has also the cliche temperament of a teenager, the weird kid next door who is going to fall in love with the weird teenager who has a father that is the most cliche character in this: a homophobic and rigid Colonel who wants discipline and structure in everything and beats his son. What is the deeper meaning here? This portrays a bunch of cliches and things that are not new to anyone.The acting was average overall. I don't really know how can anyone say that this was Spacey's best performance, was a good one but to me it looks like he was just kinda being himself in a lot of parts.A big hole in the plot to me is that we know how they are now but we don't know how they came to this, how did the father lost connection to his daughter if he says that they used to be friends? What did happen to they're marriage? Are you just assuming that every marriage gets like this for no reason or that every adolescent disconnects to they're parents? Because that's not true. The only character that who get a background story is the drug dealer kid. Not to mention that the daughter which's father wasn't violente and rigid and his only problem was to have a crush on her friend even said that wanted here father to die, kidding or not you don't say something like that just for saying, but the boy which's father beat him and controlled his life and even shipped him to a military college and interned him said that his father was a good men and didn't wished him wrong, how does this make any sense?This is a weak, cliched, non-sensed story disguised with beautiful visuals and a good storytelling and that is the truth about this movie, everyone who thinks this is a masterpiece is seeing things where they don't exist!",6,3,7,14 April 2020

Saving Private Ryan," The Best War Movie Ever
","The first thing I thought when the movie started was that the sound effects were marvelous and now I've just found out that it won Oscars for Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing amongst others including Best Picture which also suits well because this movie is phenomenal. Contrary to other war movies that I've seen in this one the camera doesn't stay still it is always swinging and shaking and moves really fast which creates a immersive experience and makes it look like you really are there. That inicial battle scene was by far the best war battle scene I've ever seen and the battle scene by itself is 10/10. Despite that, the storyline it's pretty basic but it is a war movie it's normal to not have a great story because like all of it's genre the main goal is to portray war, although it was basic was still entertaining. Spielberg did and excepcional job in portraying the ugliness of the war in such a beautiful way.",9,0,0,10 March 2020

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A tribute to Hollywood
","This movie has Hollywood in the title but not just because it's about the case Tate-LaBianca wich was passed in Hollywood, this has Hollywood in the title because this movie is all about Hollywood. Tarantino made a tribute to Hollywood and westerns and movie making and everything about that life and that's represented by Rick Dalton's character. All those western scenes and old movies/tv shows scenes were a tribute to the Hollywood old times. Although the movie is centered on the case Tate-LaBianca I don't really think you need to really know the case to enjoy the movie, if you know the things will obviously have a bigger meaning especially the ending but if you don't know this movie is also worth it and enjoyable. About people saying that this has no plot what I have to say is: you misunderstanding! In this one Tarantino did what he had done before in Inglorious Basterds, he decided to rewrite the history but this time was not about war and Hitler and nazis, this time was a more quiet and peaceful history so there's not so much action, because this movie is more about real life. Both Rick and Cliff are characters created by Tarantino with the purpose of rewriting that tragic event, until there he used them to tribute the history of Hollywood with beautiful scenes. It's more a nostalgic and beautiful trip than a typical violent and with a lot of story Tarantino movie, but we can see classic Tarantino by the last events of this movie. The movie has a lot of symbolism and even mention other real cases like that one about Cliff killing his wife was a mention to the Natalie Wood case. It's a movie that has a lot more than what you think at first sight. I think that this is more likely to be approved by true cinephiles with a real and deeper understanding of the movie and his context and not so much for the average movie viewer who just wants to have a good time.",10,11,15,3 April 2020
Gone Girl," David Finchers masterpiece
","When it comes to mistery movies this was a huge game changer to me, this is the one that got me loving this genre. The movie is 2h30 long but the narrative is so good and entertaining that it feels like it wasn't that loong. Finchers directing is brilliant and the visual experience is also great, this factor allied to this intense plot make this an unforgettable experience. First time I saw this was in the year that the movie was released and I just rewatched today and it feels like it got even better.
About the movie itself I loved that the inicial scene was also the final scene. I also learned that to a lot of people that ending may seem disappointing but I completely loved it and honestly think that was the most appropriate taking in consideration the whole story. I also think that the baby wasn't the only reason that made Nick stay, my interpretation is that they are both kinda obsessed with each other but in different ways being the Amy way more extreme due to her probably being a sociopath or psychopath. But Nick can't leave her and this was pretty clear when his sister said that he wanted to stay and he kept quiet. They have a different and toxic type of love but at the end I really believe that they do love and are obsessed with each other.
Forever one of my favorite movies!",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Mr. Nobody," Promising but disappointing
","The ideia of this movie and it's premisse is pretty good but all of the potential was lost in the way they did it.
Besides being too long and boring, the structure of the movie is very weak and unorganized which often leads to viewers confusion. If they made it more organized instead of random scenes mashup and if the script were better constructed and made more explanations this would've been better, but in this way it's just a great ideia executed poorly.",5,1,4,21 March 2020
Insidious," Decent terror movie
","Like the most of it's genre this has some non-sense and illogical parts but this one was actually decent when it comes to the terror plot itself. Directing wise the terror scenes were okay but the normal scenes were awful, that camera angles and the fact that the camera was always shaking was really annoying me. I like the fact that they actually moved out when they figured out when they're house was haunted, something that never happens in terror movies and really annoy me and I also liked that there was a terror scene during day time.",6,0,1,16 April 2020
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great cinematography not so great story
","When I read the synopsis I got intrigued and I was wondering how would they explain a man that is born old and grows to be younger as time passes, but well they didn't. In the whole movie nobody seem to be really surprised by a thing that should make everyone jaw drop, they didn't approached it in a medical nor scientific way they just pretty much ignored it and carried one, okay then I will let that one slide because they are looking to explore another thing here, at least that was what I thought to myself. Turns out this whole movie is basically what you see in the trailer and what you read in the synopsis, a man that grows younger and that's it, the story is really flat and I'm not sure if there's even a plot here, it just tells the story of he growing younger and dealing with the same things that everyone has to deal but backwards and obviously there is a girl, there's always a girl, so does that looks like a plot to you? I'm not sure. Fitzgerald wrote this a short story and maybe it should've stayed that way, because this is what happens when a short story turns into a 3 hour movie, not to mention that the movie story is not the same as the book's.In terms of acting Brad Pitt was really normal nothing Oscar worthy in my opinion, the best performance here was definitely Cate Blanchett's.Although the huge disappointment in terms of the story itself this is a David Fincher movie and it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Visually this is a 10/10 for sure, there's not one ugly shot or scene in this movie not to mention the colors that in some cases were intensified with an amazing result. This well deserved those 3 Oscars in those exact categories undoubtedly. Unfortunately, the story didn't match the greatness of the picture, what a waste.",6,0,1,8 April 2020
1917," Fun to see but overrated
","Technically it's amazing but overall I find it an overrated movie. It's not the first one shot movie and it's not also the best war movie. I know that it's a war movie and like the most of it's genre the objective is to portray war and visually it does it beautifully, but the little plot this have is ridiculous and non-sense in a lot of ways. So they're in war against Germany and they've been probably killing german in the battle field and when they see that a german soilder is going to die on a plain crash they proceed to help him? Really? A soldier that probably killed lots of them comrades and was just minutes ago in a battle with one of they're planes? And that causes one of them to die... Not to mention when in the beginning one of the soldiers got buried by a wall after a grenade explosion and yet he came out of that like it was nothing and only a few dust upon him but that trap in real life would've kill them both but no, dying after trying to help an enemy soldier is more realistic right... And that encounter with the lady with the baby? That really seem forced to me, not to mention that she was surviving with a baby without food and milk and guess what the soldier had? Milk from that stupid cow encounter scene. The scene when he was running and the german were close and shooting at him but yet he didn't got hit was just stupid. The problem of this was that they thought that just because the visuals were amazing they could give us any kind of non-sense plot and it would be cool, well, that doesn't work with me.",6,0,0,5 March 2020

The King," I wasn't going to make a review...
","...because may expectations were low and I thought it will just be an entertaining movie but without nothing to say about, I guess I was wrong. Timothée over exceed my expectations at playing young king Henry and made a remarkable job. There were two things that I completely loved about this movie, the first were the battle scenes, they are probably the most realistic battle scenes in this historic time I've ever seen in a movie, all the other shows battles with armors and horses like the knights and soldiers were ninjas with swords that moved very easily even though the weight of the armor and that controlled the sword and everything on the battlefield with perfection but this movie doesn't do that, this shows what the battles really looked like: a total mess! The other thing that I loved is that they didn't tried to romantize the Henry wedding with the French princess with some love at first sight thing like a lot of movies do about arranged weddings in this period.The direction was also pretty decent and that final plot twist was good and completely unexpected. Despite all of these good points the movie is historically inaccurate and also inaccurate in comparison with Shakespeare's plays that were the base for this movie. This can be a bad point if you care about history and facts but if you only want to have a good time watching a good movie this won't matter.
This is probably one of the best Netflix movies!",7,2,2,11 April 2020

Everyone needs to watch this at least one time in their life times!",10,1,2,19 March 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A great one shot movie
","I had to watch this movie because this won Oscar for Best Picture in the year that one of the greatest movies of the history of cinema was released: Interstellar! So I had to see why was this movie better than Interstellar that wasn't even nominated and guess what? It wasn't. I'm not trying to make this review about Interstellar but the Academy really got everything wrong that year, even American Sniper was nominated but Interstellar was not, like really? Although all of this I will no try to compare them and give my honest opinion about the movie.In terms of direction I must say that this was the best one shot movie I've ever seen with smart and beautiful transitions from one scene to another. The photography was also pretty good and overall this has some pretty good cinematography, is not one of those one shot movies that you get bored by the way it his made and for the fact that the camera is always following up, to be honest I even forgot it was one shot at some point. This movie has also a top-notch acting and perhaps some of the greatest acting of the last decade but of course I have to highlight Edward Norton and Michael Keaton!About the plot itself this is not one of the most brilliant and complex stories that you will see but it's pretty decent. The main character has an alter ego that speaks with him which adds something interesting in the story. The movie is all about broadway and everything about actors and theater and watching this movie really feels like watching a theater and they deserve recognition for that. This contains some interesting dialogues and ideas and I loved the scene when the critics were criticized and the dialogue in it. It also talks about trending nowadays and popularity and in a certain way criticize and satirize it. This also won Best Soundtrack and once again I think that the Academy got it wrong because the Soundtrack is pretty good but ain't even near of Interstellar's, sorry I know I said that I would not compare them but in this certain aspect I really have to.I don't want to give spoilers about the last movie events but the final scene was interesting and I really liked that! Worth seeing",8,0,2,10 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," A remarkable thriller
","This is without the doubt the one of the best thrillers that I've ever seen, the soundtrack and the camera angles especially when they are closing up on a character face really creates tension and the movie keeps you on the edge and intrigued of what's coming next the whole time. The direction is outstanding and really good. The acting is also top-notch especially Anthony Hopkins and Jodie foster, both well deserved Oscars! About the plot itself I consider that the visual experience is better than the plot and I personally figured out what the serial killer was intending to do before it was even revealed, that doesn't make the plot bad but I think the story wasn't as great as the visuals, it was a pretty interesting one but not worthy enough to be portrayed as masterpiece like many are doing. There are a lot of actions and scenes in this movie that set an example and where copied by a lot of recent movies so in a certain why this created a precedent.
It's definitely worth to be seen but I was expecting a deep story with great visuals, it got the second aspect but one the first one didn't pleased as much as I was expecting",8,0,1,14 April 2020
Sin City," A perfect cinematography achievement
","The first time I saw this movie's trailer I was just a kid and I thought that this would be just another stupid action movie and all this years I always thought that I would hate Sin City without have even watched it. The years passed by and I became a true cinephile and today I decided to give it a try after noticing the high rating and that Tarantino was a part of it and well, was one of the best decisions of my life! Cinematographically this is a masterpiece, a 10/10 on visuals with a perfect direction with amazing angles, shots, a beautiful photography, I loved the black and white tones and that only some things had real color, visually this is really perfect, it's like reading a comic book with your own eyes, they couldn't have done it better. Story wise I thought that I wouldn't like it due to the fact that I don't like action movies because most of them have awful plots with disproportionate action, but this has the right amount of everything. The right amount of action, the right amount of comedy and the 3 stories were pretty good and I loved every single one of them and the fact that they were 3 different actions and not only one. The movie keeps you one edge the old time and intrigued of what's coming next and it's hard to get bored watching this. The script is amazing and the narration of the characters thoughts in such a poetic way is just another huge factor for making this a true masterpiece.
Hands down one of the best movies I've ever watched and already one of my favorites!",10,1,1,24 March 2020
Donnie Darko," Overrated
","By no means this is a bad movie but is pretty overrated, a lot of reviews were portraying this as a masterpiece and after seeing the rating and reading some reviews I was expecting an amazing and brilliant movie and that didn't happened at all. I got bored at some times and the plot isn't as interesting as people are saying. It's a movie open to interpretation and I love that type of movies but this one didn't even intrigued me enough to try to solve this puzzle. Young Jack Gyllenhaal was already a pretty good actor! This has clearly some critics to US society such as the school scenes and all the political stuff. It's cool to watch but is no where near a masterpiece or a brilliant movie",6,0,0,6 April 2020
Goodfellas," A brilliant work by Scorsese
","The cinematography in this movie is incredible, the picture, the plans, the voice overs everything! In my personal experience I loved the beginning but then by the middle I started to get a little bit boring and it continues till the very ending. Not because of the direction but because of the story itself, I'm not a big fan of mob movies but Scorsese deserves the credit for this brilliant work",8,0,0,9 March 2020
The Godfather," Great movie but overrated
","Watching a 3 hour long movie it's not a easy task unless you really enjoy the story and every single moment of it, but I really had to give this a try to find by myself if it really lives up to his hype.
Needless to say, the acting is by far the best thing in this movie especially Marlon Brando in his unforgettable Don Corleone role. The cinematography is very good too and the only critics I have is some flaws in shooting scenes were the gun is fired but the body doesn't get marked and some fighting scenes were they were literally punching the air but I would let that slip because they didn't had much of the technology that we have nowadays.
My biggest problem regarding this movie is pacing, like I've said in the beginning it's hard to watch a 3 hour long movie unless everything works perfectly and in this movie there were a lot of scenes way to bigger than the necessary, things that could be summoned in a shorter way and still with good cinematography were too long, and there are some unnecessary shots. The movie also advance years and it could've been done better, in a scene you are in the present and in the next you are some years later without no mention to how many time passed or even that the time passed you only understand that by the action, which if you aren't really concentrated will become confusing and It's hard to see a 3 hour long movie with long boring shots and confusing timeline.
The acting is the only top-notch thing here, everything else is just good.",8,0,1,18 April 2020
