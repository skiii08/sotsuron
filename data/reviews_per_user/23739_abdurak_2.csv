Conquest 1453," The Conquest
",Comparing with other movies which was made in TURKEY it s tough enough to watch. Also it s useful to understand history of Ottoman and Konstantinopolis change as Istanbul. It can be watch by everyone even other religions. By the way movie contents some other characteristic things. Main character did not front during the movie. It s really good advantage to see this movie without boring matters. I can emphasize that movie is really continuously fluid so that it will be really not boring even you don't like action movies. Lets back some negative points: Aksemseddin who is teacher of Sultan mehmet is very funny character in the movie and he connected very late time as well. Normally he is the main character of Sultan Mehmed(Faith) life. As a TURK in South Korea I would like to see movie one more time.,10,15,45,27 February 2012
The Mountain II," Masterpiece
",It s been really hard to make this kind of action film in Turkish cinema industry. There was only one 'FETIH' which explains Ottoman history and Ä°stanbul conquer.. But DAG 2 will be the masterpiece. You can understand how Turkish military get the war with terrorists. Also it s a good example how Turkish military uses its power for the poor people.,10,17,52,8 March 2017
