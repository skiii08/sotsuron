First Man," Slow and bored
",It's a slow movie and a bored one. The action scenes are not so action too. Too many family scenes of little interest. A lost opportunity and probably a movie that could not even be made.,4,1,4,13 March 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Very slow and very boring.
","Bad screenplay, very slow and very boring. The only way to save this movie is to come back to the edit room and let on the floor not less of 20 minutes.",2,0,4,19 August 2018
Mission: Impossible II," Probably the worst in the series
",Poor story and poor script. Very slow in the first part and too much repetitive action in the second (the fight scenes of are extremely long and somewhat boring). Probably the worst movie in the series.,4,0,2,3 February 2019
Inception," It could have been perfect if it had been five minutes shorter.
",The movie is very good. It could have been perfect if it had been five minutes shorter. Some scenes at around 3/4 of the movie are redundant.,8,0,2,30 April 2019
