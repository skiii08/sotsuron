Gremlins," How 'bout a 3rd? (May contain spoilers)
","Like everyone in existance I love the Grimlin movies (I haven't read any other reviews so don't correct me if I'm wrong) The first is way creeper and more serious than the eqaully cool second. It starts with a man who is in China. He decided to shop for Christmas presents and steps into an ancient store to look for something interesting. He finds Mackguy, a furry little creature who is just to cute to pass up. The storesman refuses but his grandson sneeks it out and tells the guy to leave it put of bright light, away from water and NEVER FEED IT AT MIDNIGHT! The guy gives the freindly little thing to his son, it is very freindly with the dog even! But when some water spills on it, pods jump out of the little one's back and grow into decoys that are nowhere near as nice. So he gives them some food a quarter to midnight but they stall and slowly turn into vicous little lizard men that just go for trouble. The story is funny, dark, hilarious, serious, goofy and touching. Check out the 2nd as well. Both of these movies kick arse!",Null,0,1,10 November 2002
Batman Returns," Probably my fav. Of the Batman Flicks (may contain spoilers)
","The Batman Legacy is made up of four of my favorite movies. This is probably my favorite one. It's dark and fierce but also hilarious and charming. In this movie Batman (once again played by Mike Keaton) is up agasint Catwomen (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the Penguin (a gross but excellent Penguin) and a made up villain Max SHreck (sorry I keep forgetting his name) They totally change the origins of Catwomen and Penguin, thus making them more twisted and by far more insane than their comic book counterparts. Catwomen is my favorite character. All the best scenes have her in them. The fight scenes are awesome and the movie is well thought out and intelligent. All in all, this movie kicks 10/10",Null,0,1,4 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Next Star Wars and the best movie of 2001 period (spoilers)
","Right from the very beginning this was a great movie. It focuses right on the book. Only Bilbo is Frodo's uncle. In the book they were cousins. This movie was in every way spectacular. It showed Middle-Earth as a perfectly divided region. The acting was among the best I had ever seen. It focuses on a mythic race called hobbits, one of whom (Bilbo) found a magic ring (long story read THE HOBBIT) that makes the owner invisible. It belonged to a powerful dark lord who nearly took over Middle-Earth. This leads to an incredible chain of events that took place throughout the movie. One of teh reasons this film was so succesful was that it was loyal to the book, yet fresh with original material added in  The special effects, the characters, the settings, O MAN I could go on and on. Can't wait to see the next two10/10 SEE THIS MOVIE Also recommended. Merlin (the awesome TV flick with the dude from Jurassic Park), Clash of the Titans, Jason and the Argonauts",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
Princess Mononoke," Can't find the right comment
","I just got done watching this. It was spectacular, awesome, a masterpiece, well-done, intelligent and creative. I had decided to check this movie out because of the glowing praise and boy was I right to do so! The animation was nice and very descriptive. The characters were well developed and the voice acting was the best in any anime or most anything. The plot was intelligent and the action, don't get me started on the action and fight scenes. This maybe the best anime I have ever seen and maybe the best animated movie I have seen. An epic with a littl Inuyasha, a little Ferngulley and a little Jungle Book mixed in. Possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Have I prasied this enough? I guess and I didnt leave any spoilers. 10/10 and an A+",Null,0,1,25 January 2003
