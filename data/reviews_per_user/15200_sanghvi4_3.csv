Moneyball," Was expecting so much more from this movie
","After reading all the positive reviews I was looking forward to watching this movie. However, this movie was a disappointment. The biggest problem with the movie is that the characters are not properly developed and as a result the audience has no emotional attachment. Good sports movies create a strong connection with their audience, but this movie fails to do that. Brad Pitt wasn't that great in the movie. Jonah Hill did a good job. However, when it boils down to it this is just another typical sports movie. Nothing special or amazing. You don't get that feel good from other movies such as The Blind Side or We Are Marshall.",4,3,6,8 December 2011
Inception," A well directed, produced, acted, and written movie
","Christopher Nolan has done it again. He has created an amazing movie that is unique, brilliant, and mind blowing. The concept of the movie is really interesting and the story does not disappoint. The cast is outstanding and perfectly casted for their roles. Leo did an amazing job as the lead character and we really get to know his struggles and demons as the movie progresses. The special effects are very good too and don't overtake the story or characters. I could understand why everyone does not agree with the high rating this movie received since the movie is so original and unique, people might consider it just stupid. However, those who appreciate great filming will not be disappointed. I highly recommend seeing this movie.",9,0,6,4 February 2012
The Woman in Black," A slow and boring film that is not worth the time
","After reading the positive reviews, I decided to check this movie out. The movie moves at a snails pace with no suspense or nail biting moments. It is beyond me why this film received a 7.2 rating on this site. The entire movie could have been watched in 15 minutes. I felt the movie had a ton of un-needed filler which expanded the viewing time to 1hr 30 mins. This felt more like a TV show than a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone since it fails on all levels of entertainment. You are better off watching the Harry Potter movies again which are highly entertaining and have more suspense than this movie will ever deliver.",3,12,22,20 February 2012
