Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca is a classic film that is very well known. Even before I had seen it, I knew it was very famous and said to be one of the greatest films in Hollywood. It was created during WWII and the plot is based on the oppression of one side and the heroism of the other. I would have to say that one of this films many strengths is its cast. Humphrey Bogart is amazing, as well as the rest of the cast. This film is filled with drama, humor, and romance all rolled in to one. The photography for this film was amazing as well, from the lighting to the editing, it was all done very well. This is definitely one of the greatest films of all time.",Null,1,2,19 December 2012
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","For me, this film has great suspense. Right off the bat you are left with the question that the reporters are trying to figure out, what did the millionaire Charles Foster Kane mean by his last word ever spoken 'Rosebud'. It's a unique way to start a movie though, with the ending. And than it goes through flashbacks to his life and we get to see how he rose to fame. The sound of this film is very advanced for its time. Sound hadn't been around for too long, but this film does it very well and makes it believable. Visually as well, this film is ground breaking. Orson Wells did thinks that no one had done before and it helped further film. I would recommend seeing it if you haven't already.",Null,0,1,19 December 2012
The Graduate," The Graduate
","I really enjoyed 'The Graduate' directed by Michael Nichols. The plot and story line are both interesting and suspenseful to see what will happen. It was a turn of events though when Ben fell for Mrs. Robinson's daughter. I didn't expect it, though it makes sense. I was mad that Mrs. Robinson tried so hard to keep Ben and Elaine from being together. The story line though relates to a lot of students who graduate from college, they don't know what they want to do with their lives sometimes. They feel like they are sort of just 'drifting' along. Even though this movie is about 25 years my senior, I still enjoy watching it. It is definitely something I would see again and I would recommend it. It is funny yet serious at the same time.",Null,1,1,19 December 2012

","I do not care for musical movies. I prefer to see them preformed on stage. I love music, I think it helps to express a lot of things, but I do not care for musicals being acted out in a movie. The acting is not very good, though the dance numbers are done very well. Though, the story line and plot isn't bad. It was able to hold my attention, even though I am not one to watch musical films. I did enjoy the song numbers though, they were well written and preformed. The Technicolor of this film is very rich and vibrant. It had a very artsy feel, both technically and visually i thought. For a musical film though, it wasn't half bad.",Null,0,1,19 December 2012
Psycho," Psycho
","I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the plot was excellent and really held my attention. Hitchcock is known to make great movies and I don't think he fell short of that with this one. It is a great horror film, and a great film noir. The way it is edited is unique too. For intense, the bathroom shower scene. You never actually see the knife cutting into her body, but the way it is filmed and edited, you know what is happening and feel the intensity of the moment none the less. Another unique, and definitely Hitchcock aspect, is when the private detective falls down the stairs after being stabbed. It is a very dramatic and non-believable way of him falling, but it is done in a unique Albert Hitchcock way. The photography in this film is well done too. The use of low-key lighting helps with the suspense and dramatic feel that Hitchcock is looking for in this film.",9,0,0,19 December 2012
