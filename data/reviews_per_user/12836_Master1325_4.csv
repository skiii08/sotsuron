Despicable Me 2," Hilarious... But no direction and magnitude
","I loved this film and thought the plot was spectacular and hilarious. However, because I would give the first film an 8, this has to have a 7 because the villain failed to beat the greatest super villain ever- Vector! The rather dull El Macho makes a very small appearance and is no way near as cool as Vector. Everything else is bigger and better, but for me the villain is what makes and defines a film. What would Harry Potter be without Voldemort? What would Peter Pan do without Hook? Amongst the brilliance of this film is this pathetic villain who has a chicken as a henchman- although, admittedly, the chicken is cool! I can understand why Vector did not return, however a better villain is missing here. This film is severely lacking direction and magnitude, but is full to the brim with brilliant jokes and has a wonderful, heart-warming plot which is sure to entertain anyone.",8,0,0,2 August 2013
Interstellar," Rage, Rage, Rage...
","The biggest disappointment of the year for me was when the rating on this website for this film dropped to 8.9/10. Why?The same reason why people criticised Inception, or any other film that runs over two hours in length or causes the audience to actually use their brains while watching it. I am sorry, but if you want to see a science-fiction film like this, you have to expect it. Do not go to see this film if you have no interest in the way that the universe works or any interest in the supposed application of scientific and philosophical theories through the use of film. This is a perfect example of a film maker using his craft in order to teach us something or encourage us to think about the way the universe works. If you do not appreciate the academic value of this motion picture, then please refrain from commenting on it.Growing up, my favourite film director has always been Steven Spielberg. His science-fiction epics, such as Close Encounters and ET, are ground-breaking and have inspired a whole generation of film makers, such as Cuoron and Nolan. When Gravity was released last year, I, among many, was blown away. I remember thinking that no one could possibly create a clearer, more perfect image of space than Cuoron does in that film. Yet, of course, I was greatly mistaken as this is far greater. While many have criticised the side-story about Hathaway's love spanning across time and space, which I must also admit was quite sickening, it is mastery compared to the dialogue and plot in Gravity- need I mention 'the Hairy Guy'?It is therefore clear that, while Spielberg will always remain the greatest in my heart, it has become clear that Nolan is the best of our time. The Dark Knight trilogy is sensational, as no film fan would disagree, and his psychological thrillers such as Memento and Inception are mind-bendingly brilliant. Having studied Philosophy for about 10 weeks, being a student in Year 12 (Lower Sixth), Inception and Interstellar have massively boosted my understanding and application of what I have learnt from the film. If you are studying or have studied this subject, you will find its exploration in Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the Twins Paradox thoroughly engaging, and it certainly provides arguments for the Everlasting Model of God that you will certainly enjoy debating amongst your peers!This is where this film goes where no film has gone before.Another main criticism of the film is that of the articulation of the main characters, specifically Cooper, who seems to have some difficulty in speaking. This is a noticeable issue; however it does add to the realism of the film and, if it bothers you so much, there is always the option to see a film with subtitles! On the subject of sound, make sure you listen to Zimmer's amazing soundtrack, even if you don't see the film. The use of the organ and strings is a complete contrast to any of his previous scores and is possibly his greatest one yet. As a keen listener of film music, I could not wait to purchase the score and, having listened to it numerous times over, it will certainly remain one of my favourites for a long time.Did I mention the beautifully apt use of Dylan Thomas? Enjoy this film in every possible sense, but seriously, do everyone who can watch an incredible film and appreciate it a massive favour by keeping it to yourself if it was 'too long' or 'boring' for you.Don't go gentle into that good night.",9,2,7,24 November 2014
Man of Steel," Kal-El? More like Dull-El!
","I love the Superman franchise. I remember watching the first film and laughing at the effects the whole way through and I adore John Williams' astounding soundtrack. So it is commonplace to expect someone like me to have high expectations of a remake. The film starts on Krypton, like the original film and I was immediately amazed by the effects and Russell Crowe was great as Jor-El. Then baby Kal comes to Earth and for the first hour the film is fantastic. Just like in the original, Superman meets Lois Lane, played brilliantly by Amy Adams, and he sees a hologram of his father that tells him what he must become. Just as we reach the one hour mark, it all goes horribly wrong. Zod appears in the sky and demands to see Superman, who freely chooses to go. This is what the film had been building up to- no film could, or would, drag a climax out over an hour and twenty minutes, would it? Clearly the Man of Steel crew can! Zod and his team come down to Earth and start fighting the US army and Superman which goes on and on and on until you fear your brain has turned in to guacamole!!! It isn't even proper fighting! They launch off walls and fly straight into each other, destroying half of the city and not even scratching themselves. The end came as a massive relief. But I was wrong. Zod suddenly reappeared and we were thrown in to another washing machine of boredom. When it finally did finish, I could not stand or feel anything. My head was throbbing with the sound of crashes and screams and it did not go away until the next morning. My recommendation? As the film is no longer at the cinema, buy it on DVD and watch the first hour because it is brilliant and is the only reason why I have given the film a 6. Then put it back in its box, unless you want to know what it feels like to drink a pans galactic gargelblaster! (For those who are not familiar with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it makes you feel like your head is being smashed by a brick strapped to a lemon!) I seriously believe that this film breaks the law in many ways by damaging anyone who watches it. Loved the first hour, and I'm never going to mention the rest of it again!",6,2,4,5 August 2013
Monsters University," Shh... Do you hear that? It's the Winds of Brilliance!!!!
","Where to begin? I have always adored Pixar and all their films with Monsters Inc. as my favourite. So, when they announced that a prequel was in production I was bursting with excitement, but I was also incredibly sceptical, as are many of you. Two words of advice for those people- don't be. Before the film has even started, you are taken on a wonderful, heart-warming adventure with another brilliant Pixar short- The Blue Umbrella. To be perfectly honest, it is worth going to the cinema just to see this! It follows the story of a blue umbrella who falls in love with a red umbrella, but they are separated in the crowds. The drains and windows etc. then work together to bring them back together and, with a beautiful soundtrack, this is not a short film to miss. Then the main feature starts and Monsters Inc. fans are in for a massive treat. The film is dotted with Easter Eggs which made my heart sing to see in the film. Watch out for a poster in Randall's room behind his bed- look at this review's title for a hint! Then there's the classic inclusion of A113, see if you can spot it in the film. I won't spoil anymore, but keep your eyes peeled. With a fantastic soundtrack which made me run to the shops to buy and a star-studded cast including Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Dame Helen Mirren as the sinister Dean Hardscrabble, this is a delightful, colourful wonder of a film which will have you laughing, crying and cheering. Do not be sceptical- this is just as good, if not better, than Monsters Inc.!",9,2,2,4 August 2013
