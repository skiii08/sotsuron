Howl's Moving Castle," overrated confused mess
","Sometimes reviews assume lives of their own. That seems to be the most plausible reason this film has received so much praise. Yes, it is very visual at times. At other times not so impressive. For example the fire in the castle could have been drawn by a talented fourth grader. But the real elephant in room everyone seems to be overlooking is this film has a very confused, hard to follow plot. In fact the director, Hayao Miyazaki, has as much said he agrees. So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered. Instead, rent 'The Triplets of Belleville' if you want to see creative animation at it's best.",2,28,53,2 June 2006
Munich," Good not Great
","Munich wants to be an important film. It uses the tragedy of the Munich Olympics to explore the effects of hatred and revenge on all involved parties especially the avengers. So I really wanted to feel moved and challenged by this cinematic dissertation on the subject much like I was with Spielberg's 'Schindler's List'. I wasn't. That's not to say Munich is not worth watching. It is. Just be prepared for a sophisticated version of 'Death Wish' except here it's based on a true story with more depth. Perhaps that is a trivialization of a film that does engage. But I was getting weary of the main characters finding different ways to blow up their targets. I wanted more about the clash and conflict of terrorists on both sides. Spielberg attempts to be objective and he is to a point. But both sides here have their justifications of what they did and why. No doubt neither side are purely evil or completely vindicated. What drives these people to the desperation resulting in such horrific actions is really what we should be attempting to understand. Instead Munich shows us how Israel got even and why that was tough on the avengers generating more violence. I suppose the music score should include a track titled 'It's hard out there for an avenger'! The acting is good across the board. Technically the film is well done. But Spileberg's direction, while competent, seems almost clinical in the depiction of this very relevant and timely subject.",5,0,3,13 May 2006
