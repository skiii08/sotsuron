50 First Dates," Nice romantic comedy- but disappointing German sync
","maybe some spoilers, don't wanna cut myself...When I first saw the movie, it was synchronized in German. I found it mostly funny, but not very special - just the sort of movie to fill a boring eve with some fun before going to bed.Then, months later - I already forgot most of the jokes and some of the plot -, I saw it in English and was overwhelmed. If it's not the story itself (it reminds me sort of '√Åbout a boy' - dandy meets girl of his life and learns the real meaning of love) so the pictures of Hawaii and Alaska and the Soundtrack put this one up to a higher level.But back to the German version I saw in the movies on TV recently. I have to say It was soooooooo very disappointing what they did to this real good movie. The voice of Adam Sandler became sort of Donald-Duck-like, Schneiders voice sounds like some old Russian farmer trying to speak German and most of the jokes get killed for synchronous lip-movement.So, if you are able to see the original, I would recommend you to look at this. It loses much in the German synchronized version - pretty pity in my opinion. Steve",10,2,4,18 November 2005
