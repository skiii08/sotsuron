The Blair Witch Project," Is there a zero option in that voting menu?
","Is there?  Because if there is, I want to see it.  I went to see this movie because all my friends told me that it would scare me.  I've never been even remotely frightened by a movie before.  This movie didn't even come close to scaring me.  It was so unbelievably asinine and stupid that I can't believe it even got picked up for distribution, much less called 'great'.  I can't believe it made the amount of money it did.  I should have demanded a refund.  Let's put it this way -- if I took a few of my friends into the woods, with a video camera, and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream, it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie.  I'm sorry, but those 'blair witch' noises sounded exactly like someone playing a prank on them.  A waste of my $7.",1,97,168,13 January 2001
The Others," Better in an audience full of people
","I liked this movie the first time I saw it, surrounded by a crowd of shrieking teenagers.  The second time I saw it, in a mostly empty theater, it was boring. <shrugs> I don't know.  You've gotta have people screaming around you to be able to enjoy it.",6,0,1,8 September 2001
L.A. Confidential," Kept me guessing
","As a general rule I guess the endings of mystery/suspense movies well before the end, which is why I don't like them.  But I rented this because of the very handsome and capable Russell Crowe, and was impressed by all the actors and actresses in the movie, including Kim Basinger, who has come a long way, and Kevin Spacey, who is amazing in everything (though I will always see him as Lester Burnham).  I didn't even begin to guess the villain until he was revealed and was very surprised.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even mystery-haters like myself.",10,1,1,31 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A major surprise!
","I despised Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back, felt mild amusement with Return of the Jedi and walked out of the theatre during the Phantom Menace. So, it was most unhappily that I was dragged to the theatre by my Star Wars-obsessed friends to view this latest installment.First off, most naturally: some bad acting, even worse dialogue.  However, I was totally shocked by how much good acting there was -- and for once, how I enjoyed the story.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have great chemistry, unlike Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher in the first (or second, whatever) three installments of the series.  Ewan McGregor was positively delightful -- he definitely didn't have enough screen time (does he ever?), and the Yoda scene was, well...you'll just have to see it for yourself.How to make Star Wars really good, as opposed to a cultural phenomenon? Rewrite the dialogue in the scripts.  I'm sorry, but George Lucas should never, never be allowed to write his own scripts, and I truly resent the person who started off letting him do so.  He ruins his own stories with his cliched and trite dialogue. He can clearly make a great movie, as proved by this installment and in particular its sets, special effects and cinematography.  Go see it, anyway -- I give it a shocking 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,25 May 2002
American Beauty," An exquisitely beautiful movie
","Before I saw this movie, I couldn't really classify any particular movie as my own personal favorite.  No one movie ever struck a chord in me, allowing me to relate to it and marvel at it at the same time.  American Beauty did both those things.  I know the characters--they are my neighbors, my friends, my relatives.  They are normal people in unusual circumstances. And they brought tears to my eyes.I cannot end this review without mentioning Kevin Spacey, who basically makes the movie, all by himself.  I cannot say enough fantastic things about his performance.  Suffice it to say that though I believed at first that Denzel Washington should win the Oscar after being cheated at Malcolm X, after seeing this movie, I changed my mind.  Kevin Spacey's Academy Award was one of the most-deserved that I have seen in years.",10,0,0,12 July 2000
Spider-Man," Surprisingly enjoyable
","This film was definite entertainment from start to finish.  Although I could smell the stink of James Cameron in the dialogue (don't get me wrong, I love the guy's directing, but anyone who allows him to write dialogue should be beaten with a stick), it never failed to amuse and entertain me -- something movies haven't been doing lately.  I hope Stan Lee and the legions of Spidey fans feel proud of this one; it's a keeper.",9,0,0,6 May 2002
Donnie Darko," The best film I've seen in awhile
","I've recently been getting so sick of films that bore me.  I'm honestly not that tough of a critic -- all a film has to do for me to like it is entertain me.  I suppose I've gotten to the point where the puerile crap that Hollywood churns out can no longer even amuse me.
Enter Donnie Darko.I'd seen the trailer awhile back and it looked wonderfully bizarre, but it never came to the theatres in my hometown.  I forgot about it until I saw it on the DVD shelf in the video store yesterday.  And wow, am I glad I rented it.I was entertained -- my minimum requirement -- from the very start. Donnie, as played by Gyllenhall, is amazing.  He's an apparent nut case who doesn't take his meds -- and we all know it from the very start.  Donnie's adventures in the 28 days after a freak accident in his house are surreal and to put it lightly, trippy.  It's funny, touching and unreal.I do agree with a previous reviewer that if you don't relate to Donnie, you won't like the movie.  I do feel that most people have something in common with him, however, unlikely as it may seem, and I hope that people will give this movie a chance.",10,0,1,15 June 2002
High Fidelity," Oh, please gag me!
","I think everyone has been brainwashed by the idiotic movie critics.  This movie stank.  It stunk.  It *sucked*.  I couldn't believe I wasted eight dollars to watch a 35-year-old whine about his own immaturity.  You know what?  I can walk into any Starbucks cafe and hear that for free.  It wasn't funny, unless you consider crying over your own spilt milk a funny thing. Thanks for nothing, movie critics.  Next time I'll listen to my own intuition and avoid anything you say is 'great.'",1,5,14,21 February 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Wow!
","I went into this movie not expecting much, but I was very, very surprised. This is an excellent movie, hysterically funny in some areas yet managing to clearly get its message across.  And to those critics who complained about this movie being 'too simple for the Coen brothers,' get over yourselves! This is a great movie, and apparently you can't appreciate the simplicity that can be found in the craft that you failed at and therefore, critique.",10,0,0,13 January 2001
