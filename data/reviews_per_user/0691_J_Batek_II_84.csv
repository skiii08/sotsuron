Scarface," Extreme. A Classic That Requires A Huge Investment From The Viewer.
","This was my favorite movie for a couple of years in high school, followed by 'The Godfather' (1972) for a couple of years as I matured a little (very little). There was a time where I would have just clicked 10 stars for this film and moved on to another film to watch and review. Realistically, I have probably started this movie (and watched at least 80 minutes) over 20 times... I have probably finished it over 10 times. As an honest movie reviewer in 2019, I can admit that I used to have a hard time finishing the film that I told the world was my favorite...The hard truth of the matter is that I really wanted 'Scarface' (1983) to be my favorite movie, but it wasn't. This isn't a perfect film. As a matter of fact, it is flawed in as many ways as it is great. The final product leaves the viewer exhausted, unhappy, and restless.Everything about this movie is extreme. Pacino is extremely good, the content is extremely violent, the film is extremely long, and it requires an extreme amount of emotion and time from the audience. But, if you can survive the 3 hours, you will have an imprinted emotional connection with the film that will last a lifetime. Like an assault victim, you will never forget the characters and the emotional investment you made in the film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Love and Death," Dostoevsky Meets Heidegger, Directed By a Neurotic Woody Allen
","Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors. I think he is a genius. With that said...In this early effort, Woody seemed to have a lot of clever ideas in his head that he wanted to put into a film. There are many laugh-out-loud moments, and I enjoy the mix of doctorate-level philosophy and Russian history. Parts of this movie represent 'high brow humor' at it's best. However, this is not one of Woody's best films. If you have seen 10 or more Woody Allen films and you enjoy his work, give this a shot. If you are new to Woody Allen, I cannot recommend this film.Real Review Posting Scoring Criteria:

Alien 3," Shares Nothing In Common With The Original. An Embarrassment To The Franchise.
","I will never watch this movie again. Now, I have learned not to deal in absolutes, like 'never' or 'always'... but, I will never watch this **** again. Not only is this a bad movie (by any standard - take your pick), but the experience is particularly infuriating because this is an Alien film. I was rooting for a rebound, after the failed sequel. I actually thought that it couldn't get worse than that second movie. I was wrong - this is worse.All of the charm of the first movie is gone. Sexy Sigourney? Gone. To make sure we didn't confuse this Alien film with a better one, they shaved Sigourney Weaver's head. The actually shaved her ******' head. There was an attempted rape scene that lasted about 6 seconds and, again, wasn't sexy. You might ask, 'What about The Alien?' Well, in some scenes, the H.R. Giger inspired/designed Alien costume was really cool. But, in other scenes, a digital Alien is used, and it looks like a cartoon from the 1990's. #LazyWhen I began watching this series to rate each film, I didn't expect too much. But, the first Alien (1979) is a perfect film. It's hard to believe that a franchise can devalue itself so greatly. This movie is garbage, and it makes me sad on a cultural level. I mean, don't tell me you cared about making a decent 'Alien' film when you hire a guy to direct that has NEVER DIRECTED A MOVIE BEFORE. This guy directed a couple Madonna videos - for real, look it up... Or, don't look it up - just don't watch this movie.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Catch Me If You Can," A Great Story And Two Iconic Actors Lead To A Classic Film.
","This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The fact the Leonardo DiCaprio won an Academy Award for 'The Revenant' in 2015 but wasn't even nominated for this film is ridiculous. Frank Abagnale has a fascinating story and Leonardo DiCaprio played the role perfectly. Tom Hanks was a good stiff cop and the soundtrack is great. This film is currently one of IMDB's Top 250, and unlike about half of those films, this one actually belongs on that list.

","Unbreakable is a unique take on a superhero movie. Of coarse, there have been 137,428 superhero movies released in the last 15 years or so... Part of what makes it unique is that it doesn't claim to be a superhero film. In a way, Shyamalan tricks the audience into watching a live-action comic book story. Some of the cinematography is framed like a comic book, with drastic angles and colors.I hadn't seen this movie in over a decade and it was better than I remembered. However, since the release of 'Unbreakable' (2000), technology has allowed for some really amazing comic book films that feature actual comic book characters. When compared with other films in the genre, I probably wouldn't choose to watch this again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Argo," A Critically Successful But Forgetable Film About Terrorism. Great For Sleeping.
","I love Ben Affleck and I feel like people unfairly give him a hard time. But, after falling asleep the first couple times I tried to watch this 2 hour movie with a great cast, I kept asking myself, 'Why does everyone love this movie so much? I mean, it's a fine movie, but it's mostly dialog and it's kind of boring. What is the deal?'We live in a time where national borders seem fuzzy. Terrorist groups spring up overnight, with new names and new agendas in new parts of the world. Groups of thousands of people are considered 'migrants' and they just roam with no home.So, in this era of uncertainty, Americans with money fear travel, and they fear the poor, and they fear the general idea of 'terrorism'. Affleck and the studio tapped into that fear, and this movie got way more attention than it probably deserved. The critics panned Affleck as Batman a couple of years later, and 'Batman v Superman - Dawn of Justice' (2015) was a much better film than 'Argo' (2012). This is simply a case of Hollywood fearmongering - embracing anti-Muslim sentiment to sell Blu-Rays and DVD's to conservatives in Wal-Mart stores.This is a fine movie, but it is a critical fluke. History will remember Ben Affleck and will remember many of his projects, but history will forget 'Argo' (2012).RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Us," Brilliant, Original, Scary. Great Acting From A Great Cast.
","It's cool to see an original idea in the horror genre. Carnivals and old amusement parks are scary. When you are a little kid, the lights and the smells and the sounds are overwhelming and intoxicating. As a teen, they represent freedom from supervision; and since we are still kids, we ignore a lot of things that are just below the surface.As an adult, I broke into an old amusement park from the 1930s a couple of years ago. It was daytime in the 'off season'. The park was closed, but it opened every year, seasonally, with no definite schedule. I went to take pictures. I checked the website and it hadn't been updated in years. So, I parked out front, sneaked through a fence, and began exploring. During the day, you notice the age and the dirt. Most people wouldn't ride the rides or eat the food if they saw what I saw. Everything looked like it had been painted over 100 times, yet it all looked like it still needed more paint. Still, there was a beauty to it - an old abandoned Merry-Go-Round kinda seems like the horses are all sleeping, finally being left to rest from 90 years of demanding children. But, as I wandered deeper, lost in my photos, I began to notice that I wasn't alone in the park. There were make-shift shanty towns of plastic tarps on clotheslines and old trailers with busted windows, hiding behind rides and buildings. Someone was living there, and I wasn't sure if they were watching me. I started to wonder... How many people were living there? Where were they right now? How long would it take me to make it back to the entrance I came in, if I had to run? I made it to a lake in the center of the park. I was way nervous at this point and had already decided to leave. As I was taking my last picture of the lake, I veered my camera over to the right. There was movement. I used a zoom lens and, across the lake, I saw a man. He was dirty, he was big, and he was watching me. When he saw me aiming my camera at him, he mounted a four-wheeler and began driving around the lake, toward me. I wasn't even ****ing around anymore. I am a grown man - in shape and strong. But, I ran. I ran fast... I got some great pictures, but I won't do that again. I was lucky.So, yeah, Jordan Peele is right - amusement parks and carnivals are creepy. Don't wander off alone.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The Danish Girl," This Film Is Not For Everybody. Watch At Your Own Risk.
","I was angry while watching this film. By the end, I had calmed down. I found the end very predictable (as I had actually predicted the ending about halfway through the film). In retrospect, the reason I was angry was because I knew I had been tricked into watching one of those films that, in 2019, we are not allowed to criticize for fear of not being politically correct. And, I had criticisms.My original title for this review was 'The Story Of A Selfish Tranny', because that IS this story. This is a tale about one person's journey to a new identity and the cost to be paid by his wife. To any free-thinking person, not clouded by self-interest or political agendas, Alicia Vikander ('Gerda') is the sympathetic character that drives the narrative of this film - not her transsexual husband/wife. Gerda's struggle of losing her husband is the theme of this film - not the theme of gender identification.Vikander is great in everything she does and this film is no exception. In fact, she is so good that I hated watching this story. The camera work is top-notch and the settings in old European buildings were fun to watch. Of coarse, James Bond films have good camera work in old European buildings too, and the Bond girls actually have all of their lady parts from birth...If you choose to watch this, have a better reason than I did; I only watched this because I wanted to earn the IMDB badge for reviewing all of the 2016 Academy Award Nominees. This is a good film but not a great film, and there are better films that will leave you happier for having watched them.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Troy," Love & War In The Mediterranian. Homer Done Right. Intense From Start To Finish.
","In high school, I was told to read 'The Odyssey' by Homer. I gave it about 75 pages of effort. At university, I was told to read 'The Iliad' by Homer. I probably got through a couple hundred pages. Unlike this movie, the gods all have characters too, and they get all wrapped up in the human drama on Earth. So, there are about 200 names that you need to keep track of, and they all have a lot to say. For those of you that haven't seen these books, written in 'dactylic hexameter' poetry style, they are enormous. Together, they are around 28,000 verses. If you ask me, this song goes on way too long...If, on the other hand, I had been introduced to this film as accompaniment to the books, then I would have been more engaged in the story. This is a fine film adaptation of a really complicated tale, that is part of an epic drama. Even this film can be overwhelming in scope, and is probably too much for some viewers. For me, it was just right. A trimmed down, streamlined version of a classic that I never would have read.As far as filmmaking, the cinematography captured a bold feel with all of the widescreen shots of the sea and the city walls. This film was written to feature Brad Pitt, and it does. The fight choreography is solid and the technical effects and costumes feel authentic.If you like classic literature and are capable of a enjoying a 3 hour film, then add 'Troy' (2004) to your movie queue.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Orphan," Isabelle Fuhrman Is Spectacular. Great Horror Film.
","There is a documentary about the family of a missing child that found him years later, in France. When they found him, he's now a teenager, he's traumatized, and he didn't t talk much. It turned out he was an imposter - a 30-something year old ex-convict and con-man that worked the system in several countries. He depended on bad record keeping, human laziness, and the desperation of the family. 'The Imposter' (2012).This is a well-executed and unique horror tale. There probably should have been more sexuality, but the actress, Isabelle Fuhrman, is way underage at the time of filming. Despite the lack of actual sex, Isabelle Fuhrman carries the film and is the definition of outstanding; considering Vera Farmiga is the lead actress, Isabelle's performance is quite an accomplishment.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Cloverfield," Decent Sci-Fi/Disaster Film w Great Casting. A Little Slow, But Worth Watching.
","For this review, I watched 'Cloverfield' (2008) for the third time. Previously, I was under the impression that this was a J.J. Abrams film, because the marketing told me it was. This film may have used a little of J.J.'s money and his name, but it's not a J.J. Abrams film.As for the content, the film is a little slow. The idea seemed to be that the viewer would come for the disasters, and would learn to care about the characters. Ok, then give us a disaster inside of 45 minutes. At times, it's easy to forget that this was supposed to be a disaster film, because there is no disaster and the filming of the party gets boring.Lizzy Caplan is great in every role she plays, and she carries this film.Another interesting aspect in 2019 is use of the technology in the film. 'Taping Over' something is a concept that some viewers in 2019 (and most viewers in the future) will not understand. Since 'taping over the past' is central to the storyline, 'Cloverfield' (2008) will eventually become a cultural nostalgia piece. The effects are dated and cheesy, the technology is dated already, and this will become a film that people watch to see the past - not to enjoy a SciFi/Disaster film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The Hateful Eight," Everything You Would Expect From A Three Hour Tarantino Western. Bring A Pillow.
","Can one actor really stand out in a crowd if every actor has a part of equal importance? Here is the main problem with this film - Tarantino cannot self-edit at this point in his career.If this film would have been a first-effort by an up-and-coming writer/director, it would have been cut to 90 minutes... Many of the lengthy scenes traveling through snow, planting spikes in snow, tracking blood in snow, etc. would have been removed or reduced to transitions... The dialog would have been cut down for 'lesser characters' (of coarse, the young writer/director would have needed to decide which characters to cut down, which Tarantino would never do)... There would have been less gore, blood, vomit, etc... And, these changes would have made a better movie.There were many great performances in this film, but they all get watered down in the 'grandeur' that is Tarantino's version of an epic western. When it ends, most viewers will be tired of watching 'The Hateful Eight', and educated viewers will wish more of the special 70 mm film would have been left on the cutting room floor.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Crash," A Fine Film That Explores Racism In Society. Filled With Implausible Coincidences.
","This is a thought-provoking film that makes the viewer consider his or her own prejudices and past behaviors. Naturally, this type of experience will be uncomfortable for some people. Many reviewers here on IMDB have stated that 'Crash' (2004) is heavy handed and manipulative, and, it is probably both of those things. However, it's only a movie - if you don't like it, turn it off. The point of the film was to make us consider society and our relation to other people. In this case, I am willing to accept the writer/director (Paul Haggis) leading us to to a specific emotional place within ourselves.I enjoyed the cinematography and Los Angeles location shooting, but they could have made a more visually appealing film. Los Angeles is a very visual city, but there were few real landscape shots of the actual city and streets. Haggis dropped the ball on that one.I'm not deducting points for anything on this film, but I do have one complaint - The actual premise is not revealed until the last 20 minutes of the film, and, it's implausible. There are probably many cities in the world where 20 strangers would find themselves all so interconnected to one another. But, not in Los Angeles. The extreme self-interest, income disparity, and well-segregated neighborhoods make these type of coincidences and connections impossible in that specific town.Overall, this is a good film that won best picture in a weak year of nominees. It's a film everyone should see once, but no one has ever called 'Crash' (2004) their favorite film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Alien," A Perfect Film. Turned Both Sigourney Weaver & The Alien Into Cultural Icons.
","I had seen this a couple of times prior to watching it with the expressed purpose of reviewing the quality of the film. It's a classic - if you live in America and watch movies, then you really can't escape having seen 'Alien' (1979) at least a couple of times. I always thought it was ok - a fine movie. I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws. I am proud to award it my 6th perfect score.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Instead, each year IMDB tries to play to the lowest common denominator, and chooses children's cartoons and 'family friendly' films. Based on that logic, we should also choose the 'IMDB Babysitter Of The Year' award.This movie is made for parents to take their children to a film and still feel like the adults can get something out of the experience. Well, as adults, we get to see animals drown and starve and eat each other. No thanks. I'll take a sex scene and a gunfight any day over this manipulative crap.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Lost in Translation," A Good Movie With Some Great Moments. Visually Interesting With Little Dialog.
","To really understand this movie, you need to have had a vacation romance, or a 'summer fling', or met someone in a random airport bar, or met someone at camp as a teenager, or any other romance that was predestined to be temporary. Being in a foreign environment makes us emotionally vulnerable. When you connect with someone it seems extra special because you are in this special place under these special circumstances. Because it's temporary, you never get a chance to see the other person's flaws or shortcomings. A stranger can become an intimate companion in a matter of days. And, then they say goodbye.In my opinion, this movie gets a lot of things wrong. But, the one it REALLY gets right is the goodbye. The goodbye is always awkward. It's so hard. You never know what to say, because there is nothing to say that will ever make it less difficult. Sometimes you want to just avoid the goodbye, altogether - which is probably worse. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Whether you ghost someone on the last day or you share an emotional goodbye in your final moments together, your heart gets ripped out either way.Despite all of the things that I might have found irritating about this film, Sophia Coppola created a sexy film with great shots of Japan, and she filmed a near perfect 'travel romance goodbye sequence'.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Léon: The Professional," Unique Love Story & One of the Greatest Films Ever Made
","This is my first 'Perfect 10' score on IMDB, and it goes to one of my all-time favorite films. When I first saw this film in a run-down motel room in Hollywood, Florida back in 1995, I never expected to be writing this review almost 25 years later. Come to think of it, there were many things that I wasn't expecting... like, I didn't expect young Natalie Portman would grow up to become Luke Skywalker's mom and Jackie Kennedy.'Leon The Professional' (1994) is the type of movie that you saw on HBO on a tiny television in the 1990's, and bought on DVD in the early 2000's, and then later you buy it on Blu-Ray and eventually you download it digitally - because it transcends media and time. As long as there are hitmen and aggressive young girls, then people will be watching this film. The themes of love and loneliness never get old or go out of style.The elements of a great film are all here - the pacing is perfect, acting is subtle and non-verbal at times when needed, cinematography is great, and there is a great antagonist (Gary Oldman). Among all of this perfection, there is also a truly unique love story. Finally, an action film that you can watch with your girlfriend or wife... if she's, like, super-cool and chill about weird and uncomfortable stuff. Either way, this is one of the greatest films ever made.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The next James Bond movie featured Daniel Craig and a whole new tone, which has lasted for over 10 years now...The tone, the lighting, the music score (Kudos to John Powell), the exceptional choreography, the more realistic car chases, the sections of minimal dialog - these are ALL techniques that were lifted for the Daniel Craig era James Bond films, as well as other series of lesser movies that I won't put over by naming here.

Justice League," Wasted Potential. A Sad Ending To Affleck As Batman. Written For Kids.
","Pros - Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, cool special effects, and Ezra Miller made The Flash interesting - good casting decision.Cons - Ridiculous story, Aquaman, stupid flying insects that live on fear (really?), Aquaman, poorly written dialog, Aquaman (seriously, did you hear some of the ka-ka this character said throughout the movie? And, his power is living underwater and having tattoos... Pass.)...Wiki the Justice League - there have been like 100 different members of the Justice league. So, what's with RoboCop? If you have both Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot, then you have to come up with a better group of supporting cast and a better script. Again, The Flash worked out - but, RoboCop sucked and Stepenwolf was better left playing 'Magic Carpet Ride' in some Casino bar somewhere, because that whole storyline was ridiculous. This movie was a reaction to the popularity of The Avengers films. I don't like Marvel comics, I don't watch The Avengers movies, and I think this movie was a huge disappointment.I won't watch this movie again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Bridge of Spies," An Uninspired Film By An Unmanageable Director That Drags On And On...
","Can Spielberg make a movie that's less than 2 hours anymore? Seriously... WAY TOO LONG!!! And, why, you might ask? Well, because of all of the bad puns and jokes that have no place in a movie like this. Also, because of all of the dead air and space that Spielberg left in the movie for 'effect' (like a clock ticking for 20 seconds to illustrate that Tom Hanks was bored... Thanks.) Oh, and it was also long from all of the interludes filled with terrible orchestral music. Music can make a film, and there were times where the music was as bad as the jokes. No one wants to tell the Legendary Spielberg and Iconic Hanks that less is more, so we are left with a movie that will be forgotten by the next decade.One bright spot - the scene where Gary Powers' plane gets shot down is brilliant (not a spoiler - it was in your history textbook in 9th grade).

","It took me 7 years to watch this because I didn't like the title. Yeah, I know, a terrible reason not to see a 'future classic' film. Because I don't watch 'The Hunger Games' series, I had never encountered Jennifer Lawrence. To me, Bradley Cooper was the guy from 'The Hangover' series. So, I guess I wasn't in a hurry to see 'Hunger Hangover with a Happy Ending'.I was wrong to dismiss 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012). This is probably one of the greatest 'Romantic Comedies' of all time. It's a unique love story for the 21st century, featuring several amazing performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. The writing is really effective - the funny moments are very funny, and the serious moments can be very emotional. The film features a a dance routine, but it doesn't beat the audience over the head with music and dance. Also, it should be noted, that the dance sequence at the end is amazing.If you haven't seen it, watch it.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Dunkirk," Best & Most Realistic War Film Of The Current Century. Non-Stop Tension. Perfect 10.
","By the standards I set for the depiction of war on film, this is a perfect movie. This film needs no love story, or 30 minutes of background monologue from Tom Hanks, or cheesy soundtrack music for marketing purposes. This is 100 minutes of tension, fear, uncertainty and confusion. In the fog of war, there is no room for all of that sentimentality that Spielberg and other filmmakers have been propagating for decades in war flicks. So, maybe your mom or your girlfriend won't find this wartime experience enjoyable... ok, so don't ask them to share it with you. Too many filmmakers think they are being clever by placating studio executives and/or ratings boards and softening their films. Afterwards, they brag about the love story that afforded them more violence or an extra 45 minutes in the theaters. In an attempt to make a movie with something for everyone, they end up with a film that is somewhat inauthentic when portraying the actual war. In reality, guys that sit around telling stories and staring at black-and-white photos in a war-zone, die in that war-zone.In 'Dunkirk' (2017), Christopher Nolan avoids all of the mistakes of past directors when depicting war on film. 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) is one of my favorite films, and I gave it an 8 rating on IMDB. An 8 rating sometimes represents a film that could have been perfect, but fell short for some reason. In the case of 'Private Ryan', the film starts authentic and becomes more of a family film. That's stupid - we don't send children to war. We don't take our girlfriends or our mothers to war. We don't take an orchestra to play uplifting music before we charge, or sad music while we talk about our time back home. 'Dunkirk' keeps the tension and tone for the full 100 minutes. No sappy love stories or cheesy music - just war and the effects of war on individuals.'Dunkirk' (2017) also contains the best non-verbal acting in an war film that I have ever seen. For decades, we depicted war through the designer glasses of Hollywood - where everyone speaks clear English and all soldiers look like movie stars. WWII was a WORLD war, including many countries and languages. Add some hearing damage from explosions, and people had to learn to communicate with their eyes and body language. Non-verbal communication doesn't always translate well through film, so Hollywood dumbs everything down for the viewer with dialog. Much like war, 'Dunkirk' requires complete attention to detail. Some viewers will completely miss entire subplots of the film by looking at their phones instead of watching the eye contact between two characters from across a boat. So be it - war isn't for everyone, and this film was made for people to experience war on film.Modern technology allows 'Dunkirk' (2017) to create the authentic sights and sounds of planes and bombs that are period-specific to WWII. Lightweight mountable cameras helped to create the best aerial dog-fights in a film since Howard Hughes set the standard over 60 years ago. In our era of technology, most directors choose to post-produce effects with computers. 'Dunkirk' kept the computers to a minimum. Apparently, Christopher Nolan is aware that war isn't always symmetrical or pretty.After writing a couple of hundred in-depth movie reviews, I am getting less and less comfortable awarding a point for 'My Personal Favorite' movies. I am a 'math guy', and 1 point is 10% of a perfect 10 rating - it's significant. I have only awarded about 5 of those points so far, and I may go back and remove them later. But, I don't know how to quantify, by category or numeric value, just how refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't pander to executives trying to capture the largest possible audience, or editing down to score a PG-13 rating. My rating system doesn't have a way to award a point for being so much better at depicting realism than every other film in the genre, while using less technology. So, until I find a better way to quantify it's greatness, I am going to give 'Dunkirk' (2017) that extra point for being my new favorite war film. Perfect 10 Rated War Film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Aliens," The Alien Is Great... It's The People That Ruin This Film.
","I feel like every time I review a sequel (or second movie in a franchise, or part 2 or a trilogy) that I am making excuses for how hard it is to follow up a big hit movie, and how writers and directors have a tendency to get too ambitious with follow-up films. But, **** that. There is no excuse for these big budget sequels with 'writing teams' and cutting edge effects that fall so far short of expectations.If you waited years for this, stood in line for an hour, smoked great weed and saw the first showing in the theater, then you left happy. However, in 2019, I can watch Alien (1979) and watch this film the next week. Not 7 years of waiting, 7 days. So, I have clear memories of how great Alien (1979) is, and the contrast is striking.James Cameron had a vision. There needed to be a despicable bureaucrat (Paul Riser) and a complete moron (Bill Paxton) and Ripley really needed to have Empty Womb Syndrome, and there needed to be SOOOO MUCH TALKING!!! The constant dialog, often terrible, totally changes the tone from the first movie. Ridley Scott built tension through sounds, accompanied by great direction and non-verbal acting by Sigourney Weaver. I kept yelling, 'JUST SHUT UP!' at the television during this film. The childcare aspect changes the pace of the film, as well.The final showdown with Big Mamma Alien is a great fight sequence, but it should have started 40 minutes earlier. This film had bad pacing, too many ideas, was too long, and is a huge letdown from Alien (1979).RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Die Hard 2," Over-The-Top Action Sequel. Not Well-Filmed Or Acted. A Shame It Wasn't Better.
","A very different movie than 'Die Hard' (1988). A new director and the only movie of the entire series to not be written (at least in part) by Roderick Thorp. This is a more adult Die Hard, with more F-bombs, more gunfire, and more gruesome killings. Speaking of gruesome, a lot of the acting in this movie is rather gruesome and would often make me cringe like I was watching Season 1 of 'The Office' (NBC, 2005). Most of the action scenes are completely over-the-top to the point of being nonsensical.

The Favourite," An Interesting Film That Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda Been A Lot Better.
","This is an Academy Award nominated film with a great cast, some good mood music, and a script with some clever lines. So, why did I only give it a 5 star review? Well, probably for some of the same reasons that it didn't actually win the Academy Award.For starters, when writing an historical period drama, you need a culturally accurate script. Why spend a fortune on location shooting in castles if your just going to drop the ball with script details? In dialog-heavy scenes, this film starts to sound like an episode of 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' (2007), using phrases like 'run amok' that wouldn't have been heard in England for 200 years. Most of the entertaining sexual banter would have been better suited to Kim and Courtney than to Queen Anne and her staff.And, where is all of the steamy sex to match all of this innuendo and chatter? I will always downgrade a movie for having thematic sex and little or no nudity. I don't care what era the movie is filmed in, or what the cast may be comfortable with - if the movie requires sex, then it requires 'sexiness' and nudity. To direct this movie with no graphic sex or nudity is not clever or respectful or artistic - it's stupid and insulting to the viewer.So, nice try.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Modern Technical Effects Make Movie Magic That Wasn't Possible In 1968
","Somewhere out there in 2011, there was a guy that saw 'Planet Of The Apes' (1968) in the theater, back when Lyndon Johnson was President and no one had air conditioning. It was this guys favorite movie. He bought the posters, and wore a monkey costume on Halloween. So, he saw all the sequels, and lived his life, and now he's in his later years. For that guy, this must have been the greatest movie of all time. The effects make something possible that just couldn't have happened in 1968.For me, I don't like watching humans be mean to animals, as a way to manipulate an audience for 90 minutes of big-budget 'entertainment'.

Get Out," Unique. A Blacksploitation Horror Tale w/ No Nudity, That Somehow Won An Oscar.
","So, Jordan Peele, tell me how to categorize this film, so I can accurately rate it... In interviews, you say this film is about 'unconscious white liberal racism'... So, it's political satire? Oh. Well then, that's a pretty harsh take on our society. And, I don't necessarily agree with the sentiment, or think that it's fair depiction of society.But wait - some of these 'educated white film critics' seem to think that it's a really intelligent horror film, depicting what it 'feels like to be black in white America'. Oh. Well now, that's a different story, isn't it? You see, I can't argue with how you 'feel'... And, as a matter of fact, I can say you used those feelings to make an awesome horror flick. It's a unique tale in a horror genre full of stale and poorly-recycled ideas. And, this is the opinion that won Jordan Peele an Academy Award. Since he didn't give The Oscar back, I guess Mr. Peele is ok with this classification.Those are all other people's opinions after seeing this film. Since this seems to be a topic that's up for debate, then I guess my opinion means as much here as anyone else. So, I'm gonna call this film what it ACTUALLY is - a 2017 Blacksploitation Horror Film, with no female nudity. So, now that we know how to categorize the film, let's make this a teaching moment - there is a reason that we put gratuitous nudity in horror and blacksploitation films... it makes the other content more palatable.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Room," A Great Film For Psychology Students & Film Critics. Not Good For Date Nights.
","Brie Larson does something noteworthy in this film. First off, she was great. Aside from her general awesomeness, she played the role of an exhausted mother in the room. When getting free and settling in at her parents house, she reviews the life she left behind, then begins playing the role of a regressing teenager with her mother. This show Brie's range as an actress, knowledge of adolescent and trauma psychology by the writers, and good attention to detail by the director.A fine film about a topic that is no fun. Don't watch this on a date - no one gets lucky during or immediately after watching 'Room'. Twice is enough - I won't ever watch this film again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Ghostbusters," A 1980's Classic... I guess...
","The '80's had a certain charm. The '80's also had a lot of bad hair, bad fashion, bad music, and bad acting in bad movies. I like Sigourne Weaver, but she was stiff as a board in this movie. Bill Murray was funny, but often mean-spirited in his humor (typical of the SNL alumni in the 1980's, but cheap and I don't like it). As for the rest, I find it all very silly. Rick Moranis, DanAkroyd, silly, silly. Ernie Hudson gave what was probably the best acting performance in this film (as the 6th lead... this guy was lucky to find a sandwich left for him at Craft Services). Anyway, this review proves that I am (at least attempting to be) unbiased in my critique of these films on IMDB. I really don't like this movie. I liked it as a child, and I resent it now as an adult. But, I can't argue that it was a big hit, that I DID like it (once upon a time), and that it contains some iconic moments in film.So, I feel my 6 rating is more than fair. Come to think of it, I'm kind of like the King Solomon of IMDB...RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

I tested it by asking for a human being, and it kept saying, 'I couldn't understand your request...' I started typing 'HUMAN! HUMAN! HUMAN! HUMAN!' Of coarse, the bot didn't have an intelligent response to my unintelligent angry rant... not yet, anyway.In the past, it was sometimes irritating not having a human to help us out and having to settle for 'dumb AI'.

Lincoln," Daniel Day-Lewis Paints An Image Of Lincoln To Last 100 Years.
","I can't remember what image I had of Abraham Lincoln prior to seeing this film for the first time. I'm sure I had my own ideas about how he looked, how he sounded when he spoke, his demeanor, etc. I've read about Lincoln - I knew he was said to be soft-spoken, with a sometimes high-pitched voice. I knew he was supposed to be tall, with a bit of a 'stoop' in his posture. Now, when I think of Abraham Lincoln, all I see is Daniel Day-Lewis as 'Lincoln' (2012). Day-Lewis captured all of those qualities I read about, as well as the look from the paintings we have all seen. Spielberg set an appropriate tone and I liked the darkness in many of the scenes. This combination made me feel like I was back in time, witnessing the real Lincoln. And, it's not just Lincoln, but the entire ensemble cast are well-costumed and in top form.This film isn't for everyone, and it's easy to be mislead as to what this film actually is represents. This is not necessarily a civil war tale, or even a tale about slavery. This film is about the legislative process in early democratic America. It's about the law v morality. And, although I love the movie, I fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch it. It is a little longer than it needs to be and the scenes with Lincoln and his youngest son could have been cut to save about 10 minutes.It may not be a perfect film, but after experiencing it, this is the image I will have of Abraham Lincoln for the rest of my life. That happens sometimes, when great actors take on great historical roles. Daniel Day-Lewis has created a new cultural frame-of-reference for Abraham Lincoln.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Donnie Brasco," An Underrated Gangster Film With A Great Cast And Location Shots of New York.
","Whenever you hear a debate about the best gangster films, people argue over 'The Godfather' (1972) and 'Scarface' (1983). Both of those films are a huge time commitment and leave you exhausted afterwards. Next come the Nick Pileggi book adaptations - 'Goodfellas' (1990) and 'Casino' (1995), both featuring an over-the-top Joe Pesci. No one ever mentions 'Donnie Brasco' (1997), but they should.This film is probably overlooked because, on the surface, it's about a cop. However, by the end of the film, Joe is more Donnie Brasco than he is Joe. Al Pacino plays a great stupid, over-the-hill gangster - but, maybe no one really wants to see that. It's kind of depressing to see Michael Corleone looking old, getting made fun of for 90 minutes, and preparing to get whacked.Despite the variations, this is a solid gangster flick. There are great location shots of New York City, a decent soundtrack, and good Italian flavor. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are excellent (as expected), but I feel that Michael Madsen stands out as the ruthless rising star bad guy. I don't know why it took me 20 years to watch this film a second time, but I'm glad I did.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

","This is the most reviewed movie for which I have ever attempted to craft an original review - almost 2,800 posted reviews here on IMDB, so far. I'm sure everything has been said already, so I'll keep this review short.'The Twist' scene with Travolta and Thurman was courageous film-making from a young director, and it took even more courage to include it in the final version of the film. At the end of the day, if we don't all agree that 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was genius, then Tarantino looks arrogant and we all point to that scene as an example of a has-been actor and an over-rated young director. Instead, I watch that scene and hold my breath, because even without dialogue, Tarantino used two cameras to make magic on the screen for those few minutes. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film - bold & brilliant.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Of coarse you don't remember those times - they were hundreds of years ago... 'Entertainment' back then was meant to make miserable people feel less alone in their misery. So, writers wrote LONG, SAD books... which were later made into LONG, SAD plays, with sad and BAD songs.Fast forward literally 200 years, and we don't have a need for this antiquated form of entertainment anymore - we have Netflix now. So, Robin Hood and The Wolverine can sings these new takes on old songs until they are blue in their fake French faces - it won't make this 150 minutes a worthy investment to anyone that doesn't subscribe to theater tickets each year.One bright spot worth mentioning - Samantha Barks as Eponine.

Bruce Willis acquires injuries, and stays injured throughout the rest of the film - this is actually impressive for the 1980's action genre.

The Last King of Scotland," Had I Known This Was About Idi Amin, I Would Have Watched It Sooner
","Another example of how a bad or misleading title can reduce viewership. I love the story of Idi Amin - it's fascinating that this guy committed all of those war crimes, then moved to Saudi Arabia and lived like a Sultan for over 25 years (the movie glosses over this fact). I would have went to the theater to see this film... had I known what it was about. Much like 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012), the title is bad and prevents people from moving toward the film. Bad titles create indifference. Writers and producers that are too close to a project often have creative title ideas that are so tangentially connected that no one instinctively understands or makes a connection. Therefore, a potential ticket buyer like myself is missed by a poorly constructed net of marketing and promotion. Note to movie studios: Marketing starts with a title, folks...As for the movie, it's pretty good. I wish Gillian Anderson would have had a bigger and sexier role. I wish the sex scene with Kay Amin would have been less artistically shot and better lit, with more traditional angles. Forrest Whitaker was amazing as Idi Amin, playing the dictator as a big violent teddy bear.Had I directed the film, it would have been a better film with a better title. But, it's a compelling story and I'm glad someone told it. I look forward to the next telling of the Idi Amin story, from a different perspective.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Die Hard with a Vengeance," The Reason Hollywood Doesn't Allow Teenage Boys To Write Action Movies.
","When I was young, I thought this was 'THE BEST' of the Die Hard series, the way every teenager wants to amplify the importance of everything in their own individual lives. It makes sense that I would have loved this film, because 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' (1995) is written as if a teenage boy supervised this project.The original 'Die Hard' (1988) was about a guy who had a bad day. He got trapped in a high-rise building that was taken over by terrorists. 90 minutes and 1 plot device - a hijacked building. This third installment of the series has so many terrible things happen to John McClain - any one of which should have put him in the hospital. The mugging in Harlem should have given him a concussion, the explosion in the subway should have killed him, surfing on a dump truck (that no one is driving) is impossible, the wave that rushed under him while he hung on a sewer grate should have dislocated several joints in his upper body (and probably drown him)...I'll fast-forward to the end - John survives more hardships, then uses a snub-nose .38 caliber pistol to shoot down a helicopter loaded with a light machine gun.There were some positives - I like the 'shoot first, hardcore' version of John McClain in this film. It's as if this guy has been through so much, that now he doesn't even bother to ask questions before shooting and killing people. In an over-the-top sequel like this, a little realism is nice touch. The New York City location filming was also cool, but not cool enough to make this a good movie. Jonathan Hensleigh wrote this nonsense, and I don't like one project on his IMDB writing resume. This is a cartoonish attempt at a Die Hard film, and although better than 'Die Hard 2 (1990), still has not lived up to the original classic.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

","The purpose of this movie was to break down complex topics in a way that the average person can understand AND is willing to pay attention to learn. Therefore, some of the world's most recognizable actors were chosen to explain topics, while definitions are printed across the screen (multi-dimensional learning techniques).For further study on the housing market collapse (in an entertaining fashion) try the audiobook 'Stress Test' by Tim Geithner (former Treasury Secretary). Geithner reads his own audiobook and drops about 10,000 f-bombs throughout.

The Conjuring," Future Classic Horror Film. Exceptional Cast In The Horror Genre.
","This is a great film and has inspired four sequels in six years. It had a bigger budget and a better cast than most horror films, and the end product stands out as one of the best versions of the tired and well-worn 'possession' story. The current age of streaming content has created a surge in the production of horror films, simply because they are cheap to create. This film broke the current mold, spent some money up front, and created a film that is so much better than its' contemporaries that it will be considered a classic in the horror genre.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot Is A Masterpiece. History & Legend Meet 21st Century Effects. Perfect.
","Her looks, her accent, the way she moves, the way she wears that outfit - Gal Gadot IS Woman Woman. This film is more than a big budget comic book adaptation; it's a complicated mix of comic book legend, WWI history & geography, and Greek philosophy & mythology. The final product is a Wonder Woman that everyone can love, and a film that is basically perfect. The soundtrack helps to make the film, and the blend of cinematography and digital effects creates a beautiful final product that wasn't possible 20 years ago.

The Queen," A Creative Masterpiece. Diana Looms Over This Film, 9 Years After Her Death.
","I was blown away by this film. The way Diana is incorporated into the scenes is brilliant, and I cannot remember another project that uses real footage to add a real-life character in this way. This is a really interesting story, and the specific reactions of the royal family to Diana's death were probably overlooked by most Americans. Helen Mirren was amazing (as expected), but Michael Sheen steals the spotlight as a spot-on Tony Blair.The underlying theme of this film is 'tradition vs connection in a modern world', and it super-cedes Diana's death. By the end of this film, The Queen, Tony Blair, and the English people represent three different generational viewpoints. The death of Princess Diana represented the intersection where royal traditions of the past were confronted by changing social values. Much like the life of Princess Diana, this film accomplishes a lot in a short amount of time, and it seems to end too soon.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The Wolverine," A Well-Choreographed Martial Arts Film That Also Happens To Be About Wolverine...
","Hugh Jackman worked his *ss off for the role of Wolverine - most actors wouldn't change their lifestyle in a way that allowed them to have the body of a superhero. Rila Fukushima shines as a supporting actress - she looks plenty sexy in her fight scenes with that dyed red hair, wearing that skirt. Also, the location shooting in Japan (and primarily Australia) was a good decision. The movie is a little long - a little too long... but, I couldn't bring myself to deduct points for the excessive length. All around, The Wolverine (2013) is a solid installment of a superhero franchise that can stand alone as a well-choreographed action/martial arts film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The Dark Knight Rises," A Fine Finish To The Trilogy, But Too Lengthy & Ambitious
","This is a good example of what happens when a writer/director is forced to follow up a near perfect film like The Dark Knight (2008). This should probably have been 2 separate films. As it stands, it's 164 minutes, and could easily lose 20 minutes and be a better movie. The National Anthem scene should have been shortened, the underground prison scenes should have been combined into a montage and condensed, and there was plenty of room to cut time from early scenes. The Dark Knight (2008) opened strong and stayed fast-paced throughout. This movie drags. Unfortunate final cut, but a fine ending to the greatest Batman series ever made.Real Review Posting Scoring Criteria:

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Epic & Realistic Superhero Tale w The Best Collection of DC Characters Ever On Film
","** I am reviewing the Ultimate Edition BluRay with Additional Scenes **I love this movie. It probably should be rated R - it's, by far, the most violent of DC comic films. Batman returns to his 'pre-WWII' form by using guns to shoot (and kill) many people throughout the 160+ minutes. Amy Adams is still great as Lois Lane. I find the word 'Epic' to be overused this decade, but there is no other way to describe the 'Batman v Superman' and 'Batman & Superman & Wonder Woman v Doomsday' fight scenes. And, speaking of Wonder Woman, best casting decision ever made in a superhero franchise.Although this is a sequel, it plays like a stand-alone film (especially the Ultimate Edition). People are emotional about Superheros and Comic Book Characters - I feel that explains the current 6.5 composite IMDB score. In the future, this number will rise.

","All these mediocre sequels make me a little sad. Yeah, this was a fine action movie. But, John McClain has had enough. This is another Die Hard where there couldn't just be one bad thing happen to John, there had to be about 50 unbelievable catastrophes, At this point, the movies are becoming insulting to the viewer.Timothy Olyphant saves the film. The effects are good, and if you had never seen the original, you might love this movie. To me, watching this version of John McClain is like watching a Marvel superhero movie.

Rear Window," One Of Hitchcock's Best - Great Examples Of Hitchcock's Genius With A Camera
","There are over 700 reviews posted on IMDB for this 65 year old film. Here is something none of the other reviews will tell you...If you are a real film nerd, watch this one on mute with something else playing in the background. Throughout the film, you will see creatively framed and lit shots and scenes that are totally original. Hitchcock was in love with Grace Kelly, and when watching without sound, his obsession with her is more apparent. Not every film offers a worthy experience when muted, but 'Rear Window' (1954) is so well-shot that the story and dialogue can distract from Hitchcock's pure genius when holding a camera.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

The Purge," Philosophical Horror. Low Budget Brilliance Exploits Timely Income Disparity To Create Authentic Fear.
","I first saw this movie advertised in a pile of DVD's in the power aisle in front of the electronics department, as I held my breath and tried to escape a WalMart one afternoon. My first impression - probably another ****** low budget horror film that scored a PG-13 rating and got to hang a sign in 1000 WalMart locations for a couple of weeks. As the years went on, I saw more Purge ads for more films. I saw them on Netflix. I saw trailers for sequels on television and on YouTube. 'The Purge' seemed to be everywhere. It took me 5 years to finally watch the first film. Although I knew it wasn't a great movie, I became obsessed with the theme and quickly devoured the rest of the films and the season of television. So, what is it, exactly, that makes all of those WalMart customers and I so crazy for these movies?'The Purge' series is 'Thinking Man's Horror', or 'Philosophical Horror'. We live in an era of political extremism, cultural intolerance, and income disparity. Our government admits that it drastically underestimates the true unemployment rate, by excluding entire groups of the population and placing a time limit on how long a person can look for work before they disappear from the government reported 'total available workforce'. So, if you happen to find yourself on the bottom end of any of these themes, or if you happen to be a member of a group that has been targeted by right-wing extremist politics, then you might find this future scenario quite possible.'The Purge' series creates an almost universal appeal by leading each viewer to consider their own Purge behavior.Would you go out and commit crimes on Purge Night?Would you steal?If so, what would you steal?Would you do something worse than stealing?Would you purge?Would you purge someone you know?If so, then 'The Purge' becomes more about criminal fantasy than political commentary. Tales of revenge are as old as the film industry, and they are ubiquitous. Most people have lottery fantasies, about what they would acquire if they suddenly didn't have to work for anything. My thoughts on my own personal Purge behavior have evolved over time. I have had discussions with many people that spoke passionately about their 'Purge Fantasies', and they all seem to have put a great deal of thought into the subject... WAY more thought than most low budget horror films are able to inspire.This isn't a perfect horror film. More people would use Purge Night to rape and pillage than to murder, and no theft or sexual crimes were depicted (or even implied) in the film. Boooo. Rule #1 in low budget horror - Nudity Is Necessary. Shame on you, Cersei Lannister... Shame.This film is another example of how I was wrong to have prejudged a movie based on marketing. With open-mindedness, comes great movie watching experiences. Namaste, and blessed be our New Founding Fathers...RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Her," If My SmartPhone Operating System Breaks Up With Me, Can I Get A Refund?
","This is a smart film from 2013 that explores 'future' social issues that are already present in Asia in 2019. The idea of 'A.I.-Human Love' is already fracturing society in Japan and Korea, as lonely young men turn to mobile apps, games, and animated dolls for companionship, rather than human women. I worry, as I type this review, that in another 6 years I may read this and find it dated. By 2025, there may be a significant part of society that will choose technology over human companionship. Who knows, maybe I will have a robot lover or an operating system that tries to have phone sex with me at night...Scarlett Johansson proves that she is one of the most sexy women on the planet by seducing Joaquin Phoenix (and every male audience member) with nothing but her voice. With every pause, every laugh, and every vocal inflection, Johansson pulls you further into moral 'grey areas' of love, technology, and self-consciousness. Scarlett's portrayal of 'Samantha' is the definition of a standout performance by an actress in a film.I enjoy thought-provoking movies. This film is meant to be discussed, argued about, and romanticized by groups of people over coffee or cocktails. And, maybe those conversations will help prepare some people for the future of human relationships and society.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Waterworld' Set In The Desert, But Not As Good.
","As of the time of this review posting, this movie is carrying an 8.1 IMDB rating. Why? Did the reviewers come into this film really NEEDING to root for a character? If so, were these the character they really WANTED to be rooting for? If so, why? The male lead doesn't really say much for 90 minutes, and wears a mask for the first 45 minutes. Why are people rooting for Charlize Theron's character? And, why am I supposed to naturally dislike the guy with the mask who controls the water? I mean, he seemed really upset when his favorite redheaded milk machine got killed. And, his feelings were hurt when Charlize Theron broke their deal.... And, why are all of these desert dwellers so angry and pale?These reviewers would have given this movie high scores no matter who played the characters or what they did in the film. For some reason, supporting the Mad Max franchise makes pseudo film critics feel smart. Well, this movie sucks - the setting sucks, the writing sucks, the story sucks, and the franchise sucks. It's gross, it's stupid, and I don't care. 'Waterworld' (1995) was a better movie, and Nick Holt will always be Tony Stonem in this house. #BadMaxRealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:
