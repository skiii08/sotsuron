The Ring," Ringu vs. The Ring
","Usually when I hear the word 'American Version/Remake', it just makes me want to grab my hair and tear it off my scalp. I have watched both the original version (Ringu) and the American version (The Ring), and made a conclusion that the original version is MUCH better than the American version. One of the reasons why the Japanese version is better is because it explains more of the situation or plot rather then throwing audiences around in confusion. Yet the American version does try its best to follow the original's plot, even though Hollywood has a bad rep of screwing up original stories from books and video games. For those who didn't know, Ringu (the original Japanese version) is a series that has two sequels and a prequel , followed by tv spin-offs, a Korean remake of the original, and many others.",Null,0,0,11 December 2002
Resident Evil," It Wasn't That Bad
","Ok, for the good stuff. This movie wasn't that bad when I saw it for the first time in the theaters. Even though a lot of the characters... ok ALL of the characters, weren't the ones in the game, this movie does stay true to the plot with the Resident Evil video game. First they got the Mansion. Second they got the STARS Swat team. Third they got the zombies. Fourth they got the dogs. And last they got the Licker. Their object is to break into The Hive, which is a secret Umbrella facility deep underneathe the mansion, to investigate what the hell was going on in there. Oh did I forget to mention they're going to have Nemesis? So this movie does go little bit closer to the games, unlike Mario Bros the Movie, Street Fighter Live Action Movie, and the dreaded Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. The special effects were cool and well done, and the gore scenes were awesome!Ok now for the bad stuff. I'm going to talk about 'some' of the things I thought needs improvement on. The make-up and special effects of the zombies were cool in the beginning of the movie, but some how they started to get dull throughout the rest. All of the zombie's make-up started to look the same, without any of the special effect features like the ones in the beginning...you know the zombies that had their eyeballs missing or the one with part of its face missing. The zombies later in the movie just looked like they've been hit in the face with some white powder to make them look pale and a pair of blurred contact lens. Spencer was the exception. Next, I kinda thought the little hologram girl started to get annoying throughout the movie. And last, they should of added more action scenes which takes place INSIDE the mansion, instead of having most of it in The Hive. This will make it seem more equivalent to the first Resident Evil game.7 out of 10",Null,0,0,21 January 2003
Princess Mononoke," Great Movie!
","I've watched the Japanese dubbed and the American dubbed version of this movie after my friends saw the American dubbed version in the theater and they we all thought this movie was totally awesome. You should watch the Japanese version with English sub, the voice acting is better. This isn't my favorite anime, but still goes on my 'Animes I Like' list. The animation was great and beautifully drawn. The story was terrific. The violence was excellent. Speaking of violence, I thought the gore would be toned down due to Disney. Heh I was wrong!I read this rumor somewhere a long time ago when the movie was in theaters. It was an incident which happened in this one movie theater. Apparently, a mother brought her young daughter to watch this movie, thinking that since it's distributed by Disney, it would be a typical children's film with funny musical characters. About near 1/4 of the movie, the mother, in rage, walked out the theater with her child and complained to the theater about the violence and gore. She sued the movie theater for having such a violent 'Disney' movie be shown to kids. Funny...she actually thought this was a Disney movie. Also after this incident, she wrote an angry letter to Disney to spit up on more of her complaints. This is what I read long time ago. It's just a rumor that was still unproven.",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
