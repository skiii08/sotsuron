Catch Me If You Can," One of Dicaprio's finest movies!
","Leonardo DiCaprio is one talented actor!*Minor spoilers*Summary: Frank jr. lives with his parents, but his father Frank Sr. is having problems with is store and the IRS are after him. Frank Jr. learns a lot from his father and in school one day he pretends to be a sub-teacher and gets caught after a week! At the same time, Frank's mother is having an affair and his parents then get a divorce and Frank runs away from home, but the cheques he has bounce all the time so he finds a way to make better cheques and changes his appearance from time to time to show what he does to cash the cheques. From a pilot to a doctor he uses the television to guide him in a way and soon an FBI agent catches on to Frank's trail, who now becomes a wanted fugitive.I really enjoyed this movie, it kind of reminded me of one of my favourite tv-series The Pretender (Michael T. Weiss, Andrea Parker) and how there are some people in the world that can pretend to be anyone they want to be. Leo was great as Frank Jr. and I think its his mother Paula that is to blame for him running away, she was having the affair that killed the family and how his stolen fortune soon messes his mind up so badly that he loses prospective of everything. Tom Hanks was very smooth as the workaholic FBI agent. Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. who loves his son dearly and Frank John Hughes who starred in a series called Players where he and 2 others were forced to work for the FBI, what a coincidence that he plays an FBI agent in this and especially because the ending is somewhat the same as that series.I rate this 10/10.",10,1,2,1 January 2003
Unbreakable," Took forever to end!
","This has to be one of the dullest movies I've seen this year. David is a security guard at a football stadium when he ends up being the only passenger to survive a train accident without a scratch on him. Elijah was born with broken bones and through out his entire life he had several problems one being that he broke too easily so when Elijah discovers David's remarkable miracle of surviving he knows David has what he didn't have, a gift to be unbreakable and when he also bumps into people he gets images of their bad doings. These guys teamed up in Die Hard 3 and that turned out to be adventurous, action packed and worth watching, but this didn't live up to a decent story line. There is in total one action scene and even that was a disappointment, but to hear Samuel L. Jackson constantly rave on about comic books, heroes and villains,it just got on my nerve! And then David's son Joseph holds his own father gun point in order to prove that the bullet would bounce off of David... This is NOT a good movie for kids and I wouldn't rate this an adult either there were no romance/violence scenes. A movie of Bruce Willis that actually is VERY disappointing!",1,2,4,26 August 2001
Memento," It's backwards but great!
","I was wondering what this movie was like so I finally rented it.Summary: The ending is at the beginning when Leonard kills someone. The with lots of flashbacks we walk through his life ever since his wife was raped and murdered in their home whilst Leonard had his skull bashed against a mirror. To the present, he suffers from short term memory loss, he can't make new memories and only can remember his past and now puts all his efforts into finding the killer of his wife by using notes, pictures and tattoos all over his body with clues and facts to remind him how far he has gotten with his mission, but everyone who knows about his condition messes with him even more.It was a very confusing movie that really didn't have an ending at all, but I got to see a different prospective, it was almost like you feel sorry for Leonard because he has no idea what he is doing at all and people are using him and he has no clue whatsoever. In another way the 'condition' as he refers to every 5 minutes is some way a payback due to one of his insurance investigations that resembled a case of another person who suffered this condition. It's amazing to see a man doing everything in his power above his limits trying to keep everything in prospective even though he forgets about it a few minutes after.Guy Pearce was great in this movie as Leonard, who lets people know the problem he has yet doesn't want anybody to pity him so he stays strong in his struggle. It's great to see Guy has come so far ever since he left the Australian series Neighbours.I rate this movie 8/10, the plot was great, but it did confuse me. His wife is raped and murdered, he is out looking for a guy he doesn't even know, but how did the other characters get involved?My favourite lines in this movie were : Natalie: 'So what's the last thing you remember?' Leonard: 'My wife....' Natalie: 'That's sweet' Leonard: '...dying...'.......",8,0,2,5 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Movie of the year... so far!
","This was truly a joyful and entertaining movie that from my point of view was most likely this years worth a watch!!The curse of Cortez is set on the pirate ship crew by the name of Black Pearl. In order to remove the curse they have to find the missing gold piece they had stolen and to spill the blood of a dead pirate after they retrieve the last piece. Unfortunately the missing piece is in the hands of the beautiful Elizabeth Swann, a governor's daughter in love with the local blacksmith and swordsman Will Turner. When Elizabeth is kidnapped by the crew of the Black Pearl, Will Turner accepts the help of the low-life pirate Jack Sparrow, but little does Will know about the true story of Jack Sparrow, as they sail after the Black Pearl.We were very hesitant to see this movie in the beginning, but after reading the reviews we decided to give it a chance and we were surprised and in awe of the wonderful story it contained. The movie has it all, action, adventure, humour and a wonderful cast. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful appearance outside of his superb portrayal of Legolas in Lord of the Rings as Will Turner, the young man, who knows so little about his family. Johnny Depp was quite surprisingly brilliant as well as the strange, wigged out and 2-faced pirate Captain Jack Sparrow and least of all the beautiful Keira Knightley, who portrayed Elizabeth Swann is a definitely rising star in the chain of Hollywood actresses! I rate this 10 out of 10 and then some!",10,0,1,17 July 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," love it!
","Robert Redford and Paul Newman make a terrific team in this movie as Butch and Sundance. Butch is the brains and Sundance is the fast gunman. They are the complete opposite of each other yet they share everything. Whilst robbing another train they spot a group of henchmen sent after them in order to kill them.The remarks, the humor and the way they keep coming out of dangerous situations not to mention that this film truly is a classic even though it was made way before I was born this movie is now in my top 20 DVD collection. Note: The DVD has some behind the scenes stuff which is truly worth a watch! I gave this a 9/10, the only thing I was annoyed by was the color format.",9,0,3,9 February 2002
Scary Movie 2," Another terrible movie
","This movie was terrible. Shawn Wayans looks great again, but the rest of the cast were dumb even as actors trying to act. And what's the deal with that guy's hand?? It was just terrible i just fast forwarded through it all! It was supposed to make fun of other movies, but instead it wasn't even worth a laugh at all. Save your money!",1,0,1,17 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best movie ever made and there's going to be more of it!
","When this hit the cinemas a bunch of my friends went to see it, but I didn't go and the reviews I got from them made me think it was either a bad movie or an average movie. So I finally decided to see it, I rented the extended dvd version and now I own it! Summary: I'll keep it short. In a distant time several rings were made and given to elves, dwarfs and mortal kings, but another powerful ring was made in the land of Mordor by the evil Sauron so he could rule Middle-Earth and control all other rings, but by accident his hand was cut off by Isildur, king of Gondor, who took ownership of the ring, not knowing that the ring had a mind of its own and it ended up betraying him. The ring, lost and forgotten was found first by... a thingie called Gollum, who the ring betrayed after keeping him alive for 500 years, and then it was found by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, a small person. There it remained in his pocket for some 60 years, but Bilbo didn't age a day, until one day he wanted to leave. In that moment his old friend Gandalf came to see him. Gandalf realised that there was something about the ring, since Bilbo had made himself disappear in front of a crowd. Bilbo left the ring, but Gandalf could not touch it, so it ended up in the hands of Bilbo's cousin Frodo. Gandalf discovered that there would be people who would come after Frodo and take the ring, so he sent Frodo and his friend Samwise on a journey to make sure the ring did not fall into the wrong hands. But the ring has started to long for the hand of its master... On their journey their are aided by Strider, a mysterious ranger, who they don't know if they can trust. When two of Frodo's friends Merry and Pippin join in on the quest and with black horsemen riding after Frodo, they put their lives in Strider's hands hoping he can help them, unaware who Strider really is. When they reach Elrond he isn't able to help them, but comes with the solution of taking the ring to where it can be destroyed. Someone has to go to Mordor to destroy the ring, and when Frodo volunteers, in total 8 others join him and become the fellowship of the ring.
At first I thought the movie was far too long and it had too many things that we really didn't need to know, but after seeing it so many times, I keep questioning why they couldn't make it just a little more longer? My favourite character is Strider/Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, he is perfectly casted for the charming mysterious stranger no one can seem to quite place in the whole movie until the middle. In fact I like the entire cast, they were brilliant!!My rating for this movie is 10/10 and I don't believe another movie can top this one.",10,1,1,15 December 2002
Pitch Black," Good movie, bad ending.
","I hate horror movies, but I thought I'd give this one a chance since i heard it was good.Summary: A spaceship crashes on an abandoned planet with passengers and a convict on his way back to prison. Among the survivors there is a pilot, who just wants to find a way off the planet, a junkie policeman who is escorting the convicted killer Riddick, a holyman, a few kids and a few other people, who gather together what they have to survive the drought of the planet, but next to finding water they have to find Riddick, who they fear will kill them eventually, but they eventually figure out they aren't that much in danger of Riddick than what lives in the darkness on the planet. A step into darkness leads to a death and soon they learn that once there is a solar eclipse, what is in the dark will appear and they won't be able to see 'it' except Riddick, who has had surgery on his eyes giving him the ability to see in the dark, but does he even want to save the same people that want him dead?The plot was great, I fast forwarded most of the ending of the movie to prevent nightmares, but it wasn't that scary or anything (Sure, you'd expect me to say that once I've just admitted I fast forwarded!) The special effects made for Vin Diesel's character Riddick were awesome, as for the monsters, they reminded me of Alien in a way, but the movie was very dark towards the ending and also the ending sucked due to the last person who gets killed, that shouldn't have happened, but sad to say it did happen and it ruined the movie.I rate this 7/10, Vin Diesel was really good as Riddick, the guy you just start to like, but end up laughing at his sarcasm and then end up hating him.",7,0,0,15 January 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Wait for it to come out on vhs/dvd.
","This movie was so not worth a watch.Summary: We speed up in time and join the loner John Connor, now an adult unaware that his time is approaching to take control of his life and the lives of others to survive judgement day. A new terminator, the TX has been sent back to destroy all those who were commanding officers under John Connor, but John, along with the help of an allied terminator go on a rescue to save his future wife from being killed by the new improved terminator TX and to stopping judgement day.The ending is not what you would expect, the new TX was very cool although she had 2 lines in the whole movie and as for the rest of the cast, Arnie is back butt naked again as the allied terminator, but apparently isn't the same one that died before... he's a new one and he only takes commands from Kate Brewster... John Connor's future bride, but the kids here have some history, which Kate keeps bringing up at odd times. The first Terminator movie rocked, the 2nd one rocked more but the 3rd one rolled over and died. The only highlight is the new TX, who is described by a close friend of mine as being 'hot'. I've rated this a 4 out of 10, but just barely.",1,1,4,5 July 2003
American Beauty," So that's why it got so many nominations!
","I always wondered why this movie was so popular, but I was never a fan of Kevin Spacey, but I am now!Summary: Lester works for a magazine publishing house, he lives with his wife Carolyn, a real estate agent, who feels like a loser because Buddy King (Or Kane I can't remember), another real estate agent is better than she is. Their teenage daughter Jane is...well...a 16 year old teenager, who hates her parents, because they argue all the time. Next door to them, a new family moves in. The father, Colonel Fitts, a marine nazi fanatic with homophobia, his deranged wife Barbara and their 18 year old son Ricky, a peeping tom, who films everything he can with his video camera. At a highschool basketball match, Lester sees the cheerleader slash so-called friend of Jane's called Angela and he steps into midlife-crisis mode, has a teenage crush on Angela and starts working out just to impress her. Everything around Lester seems to be falling apart when he quits his job, his wife starts having an affair and his teenage daughter gets involved with the drug dealer slash peeping tom Ricky. All Lester seems to care about is Angela and his body.....A hilarious movie with lots of quick sarcastic remarks from everyone. Kevin Spacey was truly excellent in this movie, I didn't like him in the movie Seven, but this movie is definitely a turn around from that movie.I rate this 9/10. It's really worth watching!",9,0,0,5 January 2003
The Fast and the Furious," great movie, ending sucked
","Lots of cars, lots of people and an all around good plot.Summary: Brian works undercover to find out who has been hijacking a bunch of trucks, that carry around a lot of expensive stuff in them, which draws him to Dom and his crew, who build cars and race them at night with others.I'm rating this movie 8/10. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are great in this movie.",8,2,2,26 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Can't wait for the 3rd!
","So I finally got to see The Two Towers and during the first half hour the pace slowed down, but it later picked up and got better by the minute.Summary: The story continues with 3 different tales, Frodo and Sam journey alone towards Mordor to destroy the ring, but are lost. They finally catch the annoying Gollum, who has been after them since the Mines of Moria. I got so tired of Gollum, the annoying gibberish and screaming. His only mission is to get back the ring, but as the movie progresses we learn that Smeagol, Gollum's real name needs a shrink due to his split personality. Anyways, Smeagol decides to help them get to Mordor, but instead they run into Boromir's brother Faramir, who seems to have the same intentions as his dead brother. On the other end, Pippin and Merry escape from the Uruk-Hai and end up in a forest, where they meet treebeard...who is a tree, that talks and walks....right...And behind them are Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who take the path to Rohan to find Pip and Merry, but after Gandalf re-appears now as Gandalf the white they are sent to help the king of Rohan who is under Saruman's spell and the annoying Wormtongue, who has a schoolboy crush on the king's niece is there working undercover for Saruman, one look at him and you will know he is a bad guy. There, Aragorn meets the fine Éowyn, who is the niece of the king and a major tom-boy. Anyways, she falls for the elegant and charming Aragorn, let's face it, who wouldn't fall for him? But Aragorn's heart belongs to Arwen, the elf, whom he seems to have broken up with...whilst Arwen is forced to choose between her immortality and her love for Aragorn, the guy who dumped her.Whilst Frodo is going under the spell of the ring, he fears he won't make it, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli lead the refugees of Rohan to the great fortress of Helm's Deep aware that they have at least ten thousand Uruk-Hai heading their way for war, Merry and Pip are hanging around on trees literally, Middle Earth seems to have no hope left and all that, you can actually see in the trailer as well.This movie is much darker than the one before, I even read the books, they took a whole to read, they are packed with each character singing and dancing through out all 3 books (no joke) and with the books you can't really visualize the surroundings of each character and scenery much, it's great to see that Peter Jackson's imagination really brings life into the characters and the whole story. There's also quite a bit missing from the books to the movie, but I guess that's to be expected.In this movie the only person who had a comedy part was Gimli (John Rhys-Davis), a lot more Elvish is spoken in it between the characters and my favorite scene was when Gandalf rode out of the stables, that was great. There was a lot of hard work put into Helm's Deep and it was truly worth watching and as for Gollum, he seemed nice and innocent at times and that was cute. I do hope there will be an extended version of this movie and the cast are really breath taking in their roles.I'm rating this 10/10. All Lord of the Rings fans will love it.",10,0,0,23 December 2002
From Hell," Why did I bother watching this garbage??
","I guess being from England and having been reading about Jack the Ripper for 12 years from books to movies I finally saw the right movie here in Denmark a few years ago where everything seemed to make sense and it was the mini series with Michael Caine. So my friends and I had to choose between Shallow Hal and From Hell. We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises. 27 minutes of the movie and we are in total suspense and something happened and they had to restart the movie once again! So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first ½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on! WE WERE WRONG!!! The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction. If they had to base a film on something like that they shouldn't have made a Jack the Ripper film it was almost an insult to what Michael Caine had preformed so perfectly as Abberline. Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there. The real Inspector Abberline was in his late 40's, did Johnny even look past 30? This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good! Other than that don't bother it unless you have some extra cash in your pockets and nothing else to do.",2,2,4,17 January 2002
Casino Royale," Failing upwards
","Okay so here's my 2 cents. If we go back to Goldeneye we learn that M (Judy Dench) hadn't been head of MI6 for that long since Bond (Pierce Brosnan you are missed) mentions that her predecessor kept some cognac... hinting that since he last had a drink in that office there was another M in charge... which couldn't have been that long ago. With that in mind, how is it we jump back in time to the beginning of when Bond became a 00 agent and with Judy Dench still playing the part? Sean Connery was the first, George Lazenby was an accident, a total mistake, Roger Moore was the wimp and a gentleman. Timothy Dalton played the cold-hearted Bond, who wasn't a gentleman, but an agent who wanted the job to be over and done with, he was good. And then we have Pierce Brosnan, the gorgeous, charming gentleman that not only could get the job done, he got it done with style, finesse and he even got the girl in the end. Yes, he was perfect, perfect as Bond and simply the perfect man altogether. Now as for Daniel Craig... He did an okay job of playing a cold version of Bond, but that's already been done by Timothy Dalton. He couldn't charm anyone even if he paid them, he does NOT look good in a suit, and by smashing the Aston Martin he is no gentleman... And he's blonde. His body is too big for his head, or his head is to small for his body, whichever way, he is not the right Bond. I heard somewhere that there was this whole thing about how he emerged out of the water and the scene wasn't supposed to be in the movie, but since all the females (and males) were gasping because of his torso, the scene stayed in. I've seen better. Yes there was that freaky scene where he is tortured by getting his jewels smashed in a few times, and then he just passed out. He didn't have his super stunning tooth (or whatever. Since he was naked... he could have had a secret weapon attached to his nipple) that could knock anyone out for hours and his trusty watch to cut him loose, no... there was no O, P, Q or R branch that could save him. And then there was the Ford Focus.. granted it was car of the year some years ago, but seriously, if I wanted to see a Ford I would have just gone to the showroom! I wanted to see the amazing sports cars, this was a James Bond movie, super agent with all the cool gadgets that one can hope for and the super cars one can only hope to be in the proximity of. That's my rant. I give this movie a 1/10. Not near as interesting as any of the other James Bond movies... including never say never again.",6,25,47,20 November 2006
The Deer Hunter," Was not what I expected.
","I can't believe I got this movie. After the first 10 minutes, the boredom of the plot kicked in plus the never-ending wedding!Summary: The story revolves around 3 friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, who have enlisted themselves and are on their way to Vietnam to fight the war. With only the weekend they have left as free men, Steven (John Savage) is set to get married. The wedding, which doesn't seem to end lasted well over an hour of the movie, then skips over to Nick and Mike, who decide to go with some friends and kill a few deer before they get sent away. Then the gigantic leap, the 3 guys are in Vietnam and are held prisoners by the Vietcong and there they learn to play the game of Russian Roulette...guys taking chances to see how long it takes them to empty the gun before the single bullet left in there blows ones head off for no reason...must be a guy thing. Then they escape and Steven ends up losing his legs and his arm and can't stand to go home so he stays at the Veteran hospital. Nick vanishes into the crowd of Saigon  trying to find more action with Russian Roulette and Mike heads on home and shacks up with Nick's girlfriend. 3 hours of complete torture, I found it amusing to see Robert De Niro (Mike) running naked in the middle of the night on the wet streets of Pennsylvania. I wonder if it was really him because that took guts although I really didn't understand why he felt the need to do so, okay I understand De Niro probably got paid enough to do that, but still, it was a shock! Nick, played by Christopher Walken was good, his attitude as the cold as ice guy, who stopped caring about his life and wanted to see how long it took for him to die was well thought out. It suited him. John Savage is a wonderful actor but he gets the worst roles I've seen to date. I must admit his only performance that I've really enjoyed is in the T.V series Dark Angel (Now canceled). He still brings out the best in the dead characters he plays.I rate this movie a 2/10 ok that's too low, let's say 3/10.
Thank god I somewhat missed the 70's.",2,11,20,9 November 2002
X2: X-Men United," The first was better.
","The long awaited X-men 2 was a little disappointing yet also brought other characters to life which was an asset to the movie and therefore worth watching.Summary: **some spoilers**An assassination attempt on the president by a mutant puts the security on high alert on the mutant 'problem'. Storm and Jean are sent by Professor X to find the culprit introducing Nightcrawler, who could teleport himself but it turns out that he had no knowledge of what he had done. Professor X and Cyclops visit their old enemy Magneto in jail only find out that Magneto had spilt all the secrets of the school and Cerebro to someone and they get captured. Meanwhile Wolverine returns from his search and at the same time a man named William Stryker sets out a full launch attack against the school with a personal vendetta. The only one who can help them is someone they cannot trust. Wolverine finally meets his match and Professor X meets his own.The younger generation of the mutants were more in focus in this movie. Rogue and the Iceman Bobby try to make their relationship work while Bobby has to finally come clean with the truth and tell his family about himself. A new friend of theirs named Pyro has a habit of burning things, Jean is having emotional issues with not just her powers but her heart and the only characters I liked in this movie were Nightcrawler and Mystique. The ending was weak, very weak and since that would ruin the entire movie I'm not going to go into details and I don't know why Wolverine always gets to fight with women all the time. Personally I liked the storyline between Wolverine and Jean and hoped for the better, but... I rest my review with that.I rate the movie as a 8/10.",9,0,0,3 May 2003
