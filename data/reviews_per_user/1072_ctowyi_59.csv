Blade Runner 2049," Masterpiece
","Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is a natural progression from the original film in terms of tone, themes and narrative. It deepens and expands on the original's narrative template to dizzying levels and in my book this is a much better film. From the opening establishing shots coupled with Hans Zimmer's intimidating score, I was awash in a bubble of déjà vu and 35 years whizzed by just like that (snap).There are many ways to tell a Blade Runner story – it could have gone by way of a regurgitation of the same old ideas or simply a re-boot, maxing out all the elements that made the original an enduring classic, but Blade Runner 2049 organically furthers narrative elements in the original to a deeper and philosophical place, making one contemplate over the theme of what makes a human being a human being.Like the original, there is a Neo noir element tied to the proceedings, and Ryan Gosling takes over where Harrison Ford left off. Gosling's deadpan expression is inscrutable, but behind the facade lies vulnerability. Some of the best scenes involved him and his virtual girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas oh la la). Watch out for a sex scene involving a surrogate that betters the one in Her (2013). It is at once scintillating and tender, but also profoundly sad.Harrison Ford returns in his original role and right now at his age he plays it marvellously, grumpy and tired, as it should be. His return doesn't feel like sentimental fan service and is woven neatly into the compelling narrative. Unlike, A Force Awakens, Ford does put in a shift.Narratively, Villeneuve doesn't pander or pays homage readily, meticulously forging his own mythology. Does Villeneuve even know how to make a bad movie? Characters speak little and mistrust in relationships is the glue that binds. The story feels opaque, filled with enigmas. The world is as bleak as the one 30 years ago, but updated to show a deeper sense of social disconnect. The CGI is outstanding – for nearly 3 hours, I was transported to a world that feels 'it could happen'. Cityscapes and landscapes, I have never seen before in all the countless sci-fi movies I have seen. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking – please tell me this is his finally his year.The near 3-hour runtime does offer pacing problems, but I find it so easy to luxuriate in this emotionless dystopian world and look for fleeting instances of hope and glimpses of humanity. If there's another weakness, it is in the villainy of Niander Wallace's character, played by Jared Leto. He just isn't bad ass enough, but thankfully there's his bodyguard Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) who kicks ass.This is easily one of the year's best films. It aims for the sky and lands up in outer space, way beyond my wildest dreams. This needs to be experienced in IMAX and I don't even use the word 'seen'.",9,6,17,5 October 2017
Your Name.," Watch this like your life depended on it
","For two whole weeks my students have been telling me about this anime, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), begging me to check it out. Over the grapevine I also learned that it is the first non-Ghibli non-series based anime movie to earn over 10 billion yen. So last night we did and I have to say it is truly one amazing entertainer with intelligence to boot. It was so good we felt so lost what to see next and so we didn't. We wanted nothing to ruin the unique experience. I will spare everyone the synopsis and plot details because the experience of going into this totally blind is roller-coaster-fantastic. What I will just say is writer-director Makoto Shinkai took some great risks with the narrative and it pays huge dividends in terms of storytelling. This is not something you can sit back and let the story do all the work; you will need to constantly think about what you are seeing, as well as where and when it is all taking place. I love it when a director respects the viewers and brings the game to me. After the electric pace gender bending opening act I have no doubt that like me your mind will throw up the direction of what the narrative will take. You and I would be so wrong. I was gobsmacked at every twist and turn the narrative takes which subverts all my expectations. Shinkai also does a monster mishmash of so many genres that I didn't see when the romantic euphoria ended and when the detective procedural began. He even embeds an element of horror and melancholia. All through this widely imaginative ride he knows where the beating heart is - the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers separated by time and space. Above everything else, the anime captures something so elusive so beautifully. By elusive I mean the temporal seconds you were waking up from a sweet dream, your entire being is still consumed by last night's dream and the memory of it immediately dissipates as you step into the waking world. However, the essence of the dream continues to envelope you throughout the entire day like a cocoon; you will try to hold on to the remnants unsuccessfully. Name one film that got that magical quality spot-on. Shinkai's Kimi No Na Wa got this right many times over. Everyone needs to grab your loved ones and watch this like all your lives depended on it.",9,12,19,21 November 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," I like about 85% of it
","liked about 85% of it. The 10% that didn't sit well is the ending and 5% is the spaces between the emotional beats. But it is still an immensely entertaining movie. This movie feels like a Twilight Zone TV episode extended to feature length. It is very tightly focused on three principals with a tension that builds ominously. The tension is psychological, not gimmicky. My mind is constantly engaged, pondering what is the truth and which is the lie. The debut director, Dan Trachtenberg has done a superb job of subverting my expectations and tropes all the way through the first two acts. It is the spaces between these beats that didn't quite score with me. I like this particular problem solving genre in which an ordinary person has to use his/her particular skills to solve problems. That's why I love b-grade lousy movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries her role well and she is totally convincing as the non-damsel in distress. But the actor that made the whole movie worked is definitely John Goodman. His geniality coupled with his sinisterly behaviour is a potent concoction. It is John Gallagher Jr as the third wheel in the mix that I find weak. His sole purpose is to be a sounding board for Winstead's Michelle and to push the plot forward. The first two acts is a piece of superb filmmaking. Trachtenberg performed some tricky tonal shifts marvellously. There was suspense, melodrama and comedy intermixed together so well that the seams disappear. Coming into the final act the narrative totally abandons the subtlety and nuanced storytelling and moved into the typical Hollywood bombastic ending. For me, the tonal shift was too seismic to resonate with me emotionally. But I think it will work for most people based on the reviews I see.",7,1,4,13 April 2016
The Finest Hours," I wouldn't say it is the finest hours
","The Finest Hours is just plainly put, serviceable, albeit in an old-fashioned way. There are some exhilarating sequences of problem solving and rescuing on the deep sea, but they quickly fizzle off and become a melodramatic lull; it feels more comfortable being there. This being a Disney movie and all, hard and gritty is not the tone it is going for, which means just like the sailors and rescuers we will be chest-deep in sweet syrup in the end. I didn't mind that so much. It just feels like a missed opportunity to be something different. The thing I hate the most is the love angle - feels like a last minute afterthought to give the dude a reason to come home from an arduous rescue. Emotionally, it doesn't resonate.",6,1,5,20 May 2016
Airlift," Not convincing one-man show
","The film follows Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, as he carries out the evacuation of Indians based in Kuwait during the Invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's Iraq.Akshay Kumar as the Indian Oskar Schindler? Sure. The guy has a very believable everyday man charm to pull this off. I love how he is portrayed from the start. Just like Liam Neeson in Schindler's List, he is no hero from the onset. He earns his way to being a hero as the story progresses. Katyal is a male chauvinist and a stubborn patriarch. But sad to say the movie just doesn't engage me in a deeper way. I find it so superficial and the whole story just maps out pre-determined emotional beats that I can see from a mile away. There are lots of missed opportunities here, like the character working in the ministry who steadfastly helps Katyal feels so under-developed. This can't be a heroic story of just one guy. How can it be?",5,0,1,11 June 2016
A Star Is Born," A richly layered devastating love story
","Why do we enjoy watching anyone - an athlete, a musician, an actor, a dancer, a circus performer - do something difficult, but yet make it look so easy and joyful? It invigorates us, gives us a jolt and makes us feel euphoric. Perhaps, it tells us that that person has perfected his/her craft through sheer endeavour and cathartically we, and in turn human kind, have scored a victory.The talent on display in A Star is Born, from the refreshing crafting of a familiar story to every stellar performance, was electrifying. There have been three iterations of this story, starting with the Pygmalion tale in 1937, but somehow first-time director Bradley Cooper has given the laboured story a fresh coat of paint and it is a movie for that informs these times.The Oscar season is months away, but I will bet my bottom dollar that this gets a slew of nominations, including Best Picture. I had goosebumps rising while watching the plot unfold and this is the first time it happened this year.One of the movie's pleasures is that it's really about something and of course romance takes centrestage. It also has something to say about the price of fame, the propensity to cultivate talent and how contagious it is. The story of a doomed romance you can see from a mile away, but Cooper and Eric Roth (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump, 1994) somehow managed to retell an old story in a fresh way.The first thing they did right is in the casting of Lady Gaga. On paper, I didn't think she makes for a wise choice for a streetsmart Ally because of her larger-than-life much malingered persona. I can't remember the last time I actually saw her face with no enhancements and make-up on. In terms of her music, I could only get into her infectious debut The Fame, and none of her subsequent albums registered in my consciousness. Wouldn't a guarded Ally be the anti-thesis of Lady Gaga's rock star persona? But all my misgivings evaporated the moment she hits those power notes. She is the mother lode, she is the real deal. All the singing in the movie was done live, to the camera and scoring Lady Gaga is the first major coup.The story of how one star gradually goes supernova, while another fades into oblivion is a story as old as romance. The way to make the dots and lines disappear is to make the characters relatable and believable. Bradley Cooper, going the way of Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart, turns in an outstanding performance. His voice is a couple of octaves lower than his usual roles and seeing him in a constant inebriated state and yet having the acumen to see talent is quite something to behold. You can almost pinpoint the moment he begins to love Ally, and of course their onscreen chemistry is electrifying. And when I say 'love', I don't mean Hollywood's version of wanting to get into each other's pants as fast as possible. His journey from admiration to love for Ally is immensely moving.Cooper's choice of close-up shots and handheld cinematography gives the story a sense of realism. How the camera weaves around the actors on a rock concert stage gives me an adrenaline-charged view of what actually happens on stage while the audience is cheering.Above all else, what actually did it for me is how the devastating love story never becomes manipulative. Although the music and songs direct and reflect the feelings of the characters, it never cheapens the narrative by being overly sentimental.A sad sense of inevitability pervades and the movie does get a bit exhausting after the charm of the sensational start wears off. But heck... I think it is meant to be exhausting. How else can one see Maine's star wane and Ally's get meteoric?A Star is Born's blend of romantic tragedy and emotional delimma is presented with compelling conviction and honesty. It ends with a sort of honey-trap but by then I was a goner and with a definitive final shot the movie earned its namesake, A Star is Born.",9,1,2,9 October 2018
Train to Busan," Board this train!
","This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. Putting 80% of the action on a bullet train didn't constraint the wealth of inventive ideas one bit as the commuters escape the crazy zombies from car to car. The momentum is terrific and I kept marveling at all creative problem-solving; some I have never seen before. The character arc of the main actor from narcissistic anti-hero to titular hero is very potent and what injects the narrative with much forward power. Love the subtext of class and government hypocrisy, class division, vileness of human nature and the dreaded herd mentality. Ya ya ya, I know the movie never delves too deep into them. Because that would rob the movie of its relentless momentum. I think Paul Greengrass who made Jason Bourne needs to study the cinematography here. You don't need to do split-second cuts and shake the camera to make the audience feel in-the-moment. The action set-pieces are so well choreographed that I understand and see everything. Straits Times (my local papers) said the last act is disappointing with the train derailing, crashing into some cliché-obstacles and careening through melodramatic territory. Hello? This is Korean cinema - melodrama is expected and in this case welcomed with open arms. IMHO the first two acts are so explosively fun and rollicking thrilling that it practically earned its melodramatic ending. Heck! I was nearly tearing up. This is one of the most entertaining and unpretentious zombie movies I have seen in a while. This is one train you need to board.",8,198,372,4 August 2016
Zootopia," More layers than a rainbow cake
","I really wasn't in any mood for a Disney cartoon. Somehow I can always see behind the sheen of the screen and notice all the usual Disney mechanics at work. Then it happened - the word of mouth is great and I kept getting shoutouts from friends why I haven't checked it out. So we did last night and this is the second good film I have seen this year. Notice I didn't use the words 'good cartoon'?The world of Zootopia is so meticulously designed with its own logic that mirrors our societies. I came out feeling that it is a world that is built on metaphors and it is a real place. The emotional beats are spot on and pitch perfect. Thematically, this is strong. Its themes of empowerment and the dangers of stereotyping so timely and so effortlessly delivered. Unlike all the other typical Disney cartoons, this latest outing is never preachy and laden with so many rapid spitfire puns. We laughed ourselves silly at so many inventive scenes and the unlikely friendship moved us. This one has more layers than a rainbow cake. The kids will probably get it at one level but you know what? Over a MacDonald's happy meal you can start opening their minds to read into the other themes. It is time to educate them.",8,10,19,24 March 2016
Spotlight," A journalistic procedural as good as All the President's Men
","At one point in my life I was seriously considering becoming a journalist, hoping to write hard-hitting stories that would break down walls and change lives. There is something so captivating and singular about the job - sniffing out good news and not letting it go until it becomes public information. That love for the printed page remains strong with me through the years. Coincidentally, I am teaching journalism in a school now and I am loving it. Teaching it and watching this latest journalistic procedural are the closest I will ever get to it. The spotlight is on Spotlight, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States and its investigation into the widespread child sex abuse cases in the Boston area. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The investigative unit uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. There is a moment when John Slattery exclaimed '90 fcuking priests!' I suspect the f-word is used in equal weightage as a verb, an adjective and as a spontaneous intensifier of shock, horror, or anger. This is a story that is so insanely criminal that it has to be told but how it is told is the bright spot. The ensemble acting is pitch-perfect. The talent on hand is amazing. No one one-ups another in any scene and I didn't get the feeling these are accomplished actors doing a job. They look and feel like real journalists. Armed with a keen and focused mind, a trusty pen and a notepad, the close-knit group of four reporters 'gegenpress' all the way to the ugly truth. For slightly more than two solid hours we are treated to a showcase of some incredible work ethics - setting aside every stick of hay in the stack till they get to the needle. There isn't a need to preach about the sacrifices they have made but we know it intrinsically when we see Mark Ruffalo boiling two sausages for dinner or Liev Schreiber leaving the office when the sky is pitch black. There is something so intoxicating about watching professionals born on earth to do one job and to do it exceptionally well. I was riveted. The acting is nuanced and restrained with no fanfare and a jolly pat on the back for a job well done. What a breath of fresh air. Going after a systemic expose of the Catholic Archdiocese, director Tom McCarthy never paints the priests as villains the size of mountains. But there wasn't any doubt in my mind they are monsters, spiritually lost monsters. There was never any need to preach a 3-point sermon but yet the message hits my raw nerve. This is extremely assured filmmaking which gives us the respect we crave for and seldom see in movies. The film may be a talkie but it has the rhythm and pacing of an intelligent thriller. The dialogue cuts right down to the bone and I am surprised there is no fluff and zero fats lined the bone. Every scene serves an important purpose and if you take anyone of them out I have a feeling the movie will lose its momentum. Spotlight is a tour de force and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1996) as one of the best journalistic procedurals ever. Every element of the film is flawless and the sum of all its parts gave me a tingling feeling underneath my skin. Surely this has Best Picture written all over it (I have yet to see The Revenant and Brooklyn though). PS - I had a hoot seeing Liev Schreiber here and can't help feeling this movie works like a sorta revenge sequel in an alternate universe to Ray Donovan in which his character was abused by a priest.",10,2,4,21 January 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," This Thor is Thor-some!
","Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old 'save the world' routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.New Zealand director Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thor's third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him and he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and he went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not been done before?Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but no less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample opportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the one thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor 'What are you, the God of Hammers? ' that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many colourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in the early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalo's casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By giving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so hilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that 'he ain't heavy, he is my brother' vibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.Cate Blanchett plays Thor's estranged sister with evil relish and you don't cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a gladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just to a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his people. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director. The risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just to catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!",8,270,541,27 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," What a blast!
","This is a blast! As usual, Marvel Studios makes it look so easy. The humour is spot-on, the character arcs so well-drawn, the action sequences so well-conceived and purposeful, and the expositions well-handled. This is not an origin story, it tells the story of how Peter Parker comes of age and becomes worthy of becoming a member of the Avengers.One of the things I hate the most is watching those Defcon One city levelling destruction climaxes in superhero movies. I know I know that's so lame because these climaxes are practically mainstays in these tentpole movies. However, when the storytelling is excellent and the characters are compelling, all these skull-numbing destruction doesn't even feature and my senses are glued to the screen. It is when the art of storytelling takes a backseat that I start to mentally count the cost of reconstruction and don't get me started on homes being flattened and families destroyed. Why doesn't any superhero movie address the consequences of superheroes using our cities as battlegrounds? Finally, someone did.Spider-Man: Homecoming begins after Spider-Man's participation in a superhero gang fight in Captain America: Civil War (2016). But it actually begins 8 years prior, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri which made NYC their playground in The Avengers (2012). In the midst of the big clean-up, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) who has secured the rights to the project got laid out by self-important bureaucrats. From that moment onwards, it isn't hard to see him becoming the Vulture, if only to strike back at the uncaring system that wipe their expensive plates with the common folk. Action has consequences. It is not difficult to see his motivation and to feel for him.There is so much I love here. The pacing is spot-on and 2h 13min passed by like a breeze. The jokes hit their marks, especially those scenes with Ned (Jacob Batalon) which are a hoot. Herein lies one of the best narrative risks taken – the identity of Spider-Man was revealed to this inquisitive geek very early on, and it opens up so many interesting turns in the narrative. The dude longs to be the 'Man in the Chair' and he asks hilarious questions like 'do you lay eggs'. I am still smiling thinking about his affable personality and antics. Then there are the expositional scenes. I thought I needed to see how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man. I thought wrong. The 'how' was explained in a throwaway line and that was it. It felt so refreshing. Neither was the movie burdened by having someone uttered that 'with great power comes great responsibility' line. In fact, the movie moves like a buoyant spirit with cool narrative choices and risks taken. Even the new hi-tech Spidey suit is a character itself, but a purist would probably hate that.All would be nought if the casting was off and Tom Holland just scores in the titular role. It really helps that he is a teenager when he landed the role and his tackling of teenage acceptance and wanting to become a member of the Avengers feels palpable. The stakes feel real and his learning curve is steep but a rewarding experience. Tom Holland's Spider- Man punches way above his weight. The action sequences have awesome stakes and by the time they rolled in, I was so in love with the characters I lapped them all up.Every year we are indundated by giant budget superhero movies, but I suffered no superhero-movie fatigue with Spider-Man: Homecoming. This felt like home.",8,3,6,26 July 2017
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange made superhero movies fun again
","I read a lot of Marvel comics and possess good to excellent knowledge in all the characters in the MCU except two - Howard the Duck and Doctor Strange. The former is self-explanatory, the latter I know uses mystic powers to fight villains. That doesn't interest me. Magic, IMHO, is a cheat code and with that the dude can conjure anything out of his imagination to win any bout. Boooooooooring. However, great word of mouth brought me to the cinema and I must say this is the best Marvel movie I have seen this year. From an archetypal megalomaniac for a villain to a flawed hero to a Defcon One destruction-of-yet-another-city climax (poor New York City again?!), superhero movies adhere to an overused template. Doctor Strange doesn't do it differently in a broader sense but it made the journey through the tropes suddenly feel refreshing, and that is one mark of an excellent film. The visual and sonic effects are absolutely marvellous. The opening action sequence which featured a kaleidoscope of turning and tilting buildings is simply jaw-dropping. The world building is so interesting and exhilarating. In a lesser film, the lengthy exposition would have kill it beyond the point of resurrection, but here it feels so rollickingly fun. I didn't even need to park my head outside the door, I willingly put it in my lap and devoured all the excesses like a sponge. Benedict Cumberbatch (I read in a friend's FB post that a couple of girls called him Benson Cucumber :)) anchors the movie superbly and it is difficult to see another actor in the role of Stephen Strange, an egotistical narcissist turned superhero. But it is especially hard to despise him even when he is at his most selfish. Cumberbatch is heroic in the way he allows his character to joyfully take over any situation and call out anyone who doesn't serve his purpose. When he fights, it is not with the zeal of a focused Avenger who is hellbent on saving the world. It is with the constant one-upmanships of a cunning jokester. He doesn't plummet the villain till he is a pulp, he makes the baddie give up wanting to fight him. My wifey never likes movies with high concepts like time travel and time paradoxes, but surprisingly she never complained about this one bit. It totally succeeded in making the big concepts bite-sized and they served the story well. That is another mark of a good film. The movie also never takes itself seriously and pokes fun at the ridiculousness of it all. We live it cathartically through Strange as he constantly wants to sieve through the bullshite to find the scientific explanation behind it. Other than Cumberbatch, all the supporting roles came out aces. Yes, some of them do feel under-developed but the film got the measure between fun and pathos just right. This is one Marvel-ous movie and just like that, it made superhero movies fun again.",7,2,6,1 November 2016
Lion," This Lion Gives a Resounding Roar!
","Lion is superbly inspirational and it has Oscar baits all over it. The story sounds so out of this world that part of my mind thought it is a case of God playing a cruel trick just to witness the emotional devastation it would cause. Then the ultimate act of redemption is so moving that God will lift His finger off the button of mass destruction of the world. The first half of the film is simply the best Hindi film I have seen this year that didn't hail from Bollywood. IMHO this has been a disappointing year for Bollywood and thank goodness for Lion for showing the way. The effortless acting by the two child-newcomers, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate, is so great that I didn't even for one minute think they were acting. I love how Garth Davis captured the Indian cities, and it is even more remarkable that Lion is his first feature film. The city is portrayed like a lurking monster with different terrifying elements out to devour the innocent children. There is also an air of mysticism about it. The direction is assured and never heavy handed. However this is a film of two halves. The first half is so amazing that it is almost a futile task to be able sustain the wondrous energy in the second half. However, Dev Patel as the adult Saroo, demonstrates superb range; he has really blossomed as an actor since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The problem with it is that it is too pre-defined and you would already know how it would go. Even though the narrative goes through the usual tropes and hits the typical emotional beats with a shoehorned romantic angle, Davis makes a creative choice to skim through and tip- toe round all the usual traumatic scenes, giving the film a refreshing feel. You know exactly what you will see at the end, but kudos to the filmmaker who still succeeds in never cheapening the journey and for making you an emotional wreck of a blubber. When the shameless weeping stopped, I felt my soul displace and move to a different place. This Lion roars resoundingly! The search for identity and home is absorbing and never boring. Don't forget to bring tissue and hankies, and remember there is no shame in crying for it is what makes us human beings.",8,5,11,27 November 2016
Baby Driver," What a ride!
","Freshly minted, super-duper fun, uber cool, confident, thrilling, propulsive, exhilarating, inspired, geeky glee inducing these are just some adjectives I would bandy around Baby Driver and it is definitely deserving of even more. This is pop-culture filmmaking at its best.I once read that there are seven basic plots for telling any story in movies. Nowadays, hardly anyone tries to do anything remotely original anymore. 'Better tell the same story and mixed it up with CGI' feels almost like a template. I can count on the fingers of one hand, movies that dare to push the envelope this year (Get Out, Bad Genius, Dunkirk) In that respect, Baby Driver isn't original in its story â€“ how many times have you seen a story about a nice guy who thinks he is out, but he is pull back in for one last score and it all goes to shite? It is in its execution and style that it hits the sweet spot.Edgar Wright shot the action to the rhythm of music, not the other way around. Everything about Baby Driver and Baby is about the rhythm and the beat. Bullets exploding from gun barrels to the beat and car drifting to the tempo. The whole thing feels like a magic carpet ride to geek innercity. I love how Baby's character is established gradually â€“ we see his uncanny ability in weaving in and out of traffic like a bat out of hell, always a few steps ahead of the police cruisers. We see how he has different iPods with carefully curated playlists for any occasion and mood (Apple, please bring back the Classic ðŸ˜¬). In Baby's world, music exists in every frame, so much so that his world turns to shite when the music is gone or when he can't find the right tune.Ansel Elgort brought the winsome character to life. From the very first scene, he is the propulsive beat of the whole movie. This is a career-defining and star-making role, and he nailed it. However, the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders alone and the supporting cast is a match made in heaven. We have the 'Man with the Plan' Doc (Kevin Spacey), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza GonzÃ¡lez), Griff (Jon Bernthal) and Bats (Jamie Foxx). Just let their monikers roll off your tongue. Aren't they cool? The characters have disparate personalities and each of them brings their own distinctive spin on their roles. These are not cannon fodder or plot movers, each of them menacingly memorable in their own way.In the heart of it all, is a romantic interest played by Lily James. The meet cute is scored to, you guess right, music. We hear the music first before we see the face. By the time the scene hits, you would be so into Baby you know he has now something to look forward to without the movie telling you in boring expositional passages. Their chemistry is palpable and sincere. You want them to get in a don't-know-what car and head west into don't- know-where.Where Baby Driver sort of gone off track for me is in the final reel where characters take somewhat jarring detours and a coda that feels too convenient, but I am not dissing this one little bit. I saw the whole movie with a wide geeky grin on my face, and the first hour is one amazing tour de force. The gears and mechanics at work are calibrated for maximum impact and the car chases are shot with such verve. IMHO this one left any movie in the Fast and Furious franchise in its wake and it is up there together with Bullitt, The French Connection and Ronin.",9,5,10,26 July 2017
The Revenant," Masterclass filmmaking
","Visceral... Onslaught on the senses... Nail-biting... Unforgiving... Brutal... Punishing... Riveting... Chest heavingly breathtaking... Spiritually meditative... Hellishly harrowing... Disconcertingly beautiful. Believe the hype. This is master cinema!The Revenant feels like it could easily be reduced to the usual revenge thriller platitude, but Alejandro González Iñárritu just loves his big themes - redemption, loyalty, betrayal, survival, loss and revenge. What Iñárritu does so masterfully well here is that he creates a world so real that this is the only world that matters for 2.5 hours. Then he amplifies these themes till they filled the entire canvas. This is no wrong move. Every one is calibrated to hit the right note. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fluid, contrasting against the heaviness of the narrative. It feels like Birdman all over again with all the sublime long takes but IMHO he absolutely ups the ante with his hovering and weaving shots drawing you directly into the action. The opening attack scene reminds me so much of the storming of the beaches of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. It draws you in, making you one of the frontiersmen under siege. There is such a level of realism to the action because Lubezki uses natural lighting in all his shots except for one scene. While my eyes were riveted on the mayhem and madness, I remember feeling a little sad for Roger Deakins' outstanding work in Sicaro. I have a strong feeling it is not going to be his year again. Talking about strong feelings, I think Leonardo DiCaprio is almost a shoo-in for Best Actor. If the Academy loves to give the Oscar to long-suffering and tortured soul characters, then DiCaprio deserves at least 3 awards for The Revenant. OMG... The stuff that happens to him... Getting mauled by a bear, left for dead in a grave, having to eat raw nasties to survive... Give him the award already. Not only did DiCaprio bring his A game, so too did Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy. The latter fully deserves his Best Supporting Actor nomination. His enthralling portrayal brought an internal logic to his character and I could understand so vividly how he ticks. As much as the film is about so many things, I also feel it is about nature. This isn't an ode detailing the awe of Mother Nature but about the danger and no-holds-barred take-no- prisoner nature of it. Nature is treated with the deepest respect and it is constantly fraught with danger from every angle. Nature is definitely one of the stars of the film. This is a film that above all else has a certain death rattle rhythm to it and Iñárritu's hold on the proceedings is impeccable. He is the master. To watch misery heaping on misery and pain piling on pain for 2.5 hours do not make for easy viewing but Iñárritu's command is absolute. This is not a movie for all tastes. In fact this is not a movie. It is an event and you are in good hands.",10,3,6,30 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," An Old-School Cold War Spy Yarn
","The missus asked me what I wanna see this week and I replied: 'what else, the Spielberg-Hanks one'. This collaboration has always been a marriage made in film-heaven. Yes, I even adore The Terminal. But I don't know about this latest one. My wife dozed off a few times and the dude sitting next to me slept through most of it.The story is based on the true-life tale of James Donovan (Hanks); a lawyer who was pushed headfirst into the Cold War during the 1960s when he had to negotiate for the release of downed U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) after the airman was shot down over Russia.The title refers to the popular Cold War nickname for what's now the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Germany at the time the film is set. Its official name then was the Bridge of Unity, but it garnered its alternate moniker due to its notoriety as a prisoner exchange point for Western and Soviet powers.This Cold War story is certainly ripe for a rip-roaring cross-country yarn but Spielberg went for a sweet classical tone instead. There is a certain elegant sheen to the proceedings and the film poses deep ponderous questions like what makes us citizens of our countries. Hanks' nobility shines off like a light from a candle in a dark room as he takes up the job that nobody wants. The spycraft is captivating and absorbing, and when I say spycraft I don't mean Bourne or Bond. Dead drops are meticulous affairs. Gadgets are giant cameras installed on the bottom of light-weight aircrafts and hollow coins with a poisoned pin for instant death inflicted on oneself by oneself. It is all good and fine but the film couldn't engage me totally with its lack of severity and tension.For me, the film worked best when James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and Rudolf Abel (Michael Rylance) are sharing a scene together. Abel's face is impenetrable, yet it is filled with the weight of histories and subsumed patriotism. There is a scene in which he opens up to Donovan that is absolutely haunting. The moment the movie just focuses on Hanks it loses me. There is nothing wrong with Hanks. Hanks is just playing.... Hanks for the umpteenth time. You know which Hanks I am talking about... he is the cleverest man, the perfect man in the whole world. He bounces up from setbacks with a dusting off of his pants. You know he will save the day. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with that. But it didn't help the cause of the character when he is depicted as the noblest Saint of Earth and all others are evil, vile and dumb. Where are the cat and mouse games and the battle of wits between the Germans, Soviets and this lone American knight in a shiny armor? Nobody stood a chance against Hanks, and to really drum it into you Donovan's Messiah powers, every American looks to him like he is the enemy of the state and the scum of the earth. I don't appreciate being manipulated like this, especially by a movie.Still, this is a handsomely made film with some superbly crafted scenes that will remain in my memory for a long time, like the building of the Berlin Wall scene. Spielberg's typical musical cues are a little too in-my-face for my liking, forcing me to feel a certain way. The narrative circles and probes, but it didn't manage to percolate. Usually Spielberg's magic envelopes me and makes me a believer, just not in the case of Bridge of Spies. The film resonates and beats with the sweet energy of a full orchestra with Spielberg-Hanks as the maestro, but like Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's new manager, sometimes I prefer Heavy Metal.",7,4,11,15 October 2015
Split," M. Night Shyamalan's one big step in the right direction
","M. Night Shyamalan is back! No, not the The Happening-Lady in the Water-The Last Airbender-After Earth toxic one. It's the Unbreakable-Signs-The Sixth Sense celebrated one. I wouldn't say Split is as great as his earlier films, but I can safely attest he has taken a giant step in the right direction. Split is a psychological thriller built on a 'what if' - what if a man with 23 personalities kidnaps three young girls and a 24th personality threatens to appear in the looming horizon. How will the game be played with the 24th? Will anyone survive? Shyamalan's films always adhere to an over-used template in which the final twist of the knife is the whole selling point and he draws compelling characters and builds a grounded story to encompass it. If the film works, especially his early ones, the twist is the most memorable aspect that is seared into your brain. In his successful films, the twists always feel earned. With Split, Shyamalan doesn't quite tread the same path (some of you may think the final scene has a OMG-WTF twist, but I see it more as a clever coda with a link to an earlier film). The conceit of movies involving characters with multiple personality disorder is that the revelation of the mental illness is the eventual twist, with movies like Psycho (1960), Dressed to Kill (1980) and Identity (2003) coming to mind. Split wisely stayed clear of the well-trodden path and is able to give us a different type of monstrosity, holding my attention throughout. All would be naught if not for James McAvoy's tour de force performance to sell the premise. He plays all his roles with chilling finesse. With a variance to his voice, mannerisms, facial expressions and body language, he sold every character with aplomb and then some. As I typed this out, 9-year-old Hedwig and matronly Patricia still send shivers down my spine. The three girls also gave excellent performances and their character traits efficiently differentiated for interesting group dynamics to happen in some kind of evil lair. But we are clearly persuaded to follow Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) whom I last saw in the outstanding The Witch (2015). In clever flashbacks we are given crucial context of how Casey's mind ticks and how she stands the best chance of escaping this terrifying ordeal. But will she? Finally, there is Betty Buckley who is sympathetic as the psychiatrist, but being a professional in her field some of her actions beg for scrutiny. Some of her expositional dialogue also drags the movie down at some spots. The tension is neatly build up to a feverish climax with a whole suite of cinematic tricks thrown in for good measure. I was perched on my seat as the story closes on an impactful soul-searching note. It was a very satisfying ending for this reviewer with his wifey in equal agreement. Then, if that's not good enough, trust Shyamalan to lay one final moment on you that will make your jaw hang open in a mixture of geeky joy and pure shock. Oh yeah... make it happen pleaseeeeeee!",7,1,9,28 January 2017
North by Northwest," Masterclass Cinema!
","I have seen all those iconic scenes in snippets but have never seen the film in its entirety. By iconic I mean the scenes where a plane swoops down to attack Cary Grant like a hawk to a prey and the climatic foot chase at Mount Rushmore. Nowadays, the weak CGI might cause a frown on your face and they would probably feel too familiar, but you must remember they are first done here; this is the genesis. It's because of Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest that so many action scenes are possible. This is where it happened. I knew all that plus the taut suspense, the economically drawn characters, and the music score, but I never counted on such an awesome screenplay. The dialogue is simply amazing. Just the foreplay dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is the stuff of so much conversations. It is erotic and playful enough to make me grin like a monkey. It is filled with eroticism, yet subtle, never high-brow, with a cheeky know-it-all tone. The suspense coupled with the comedy and romance is almost a template for movies of this type nowadays, but no one can direct like the master. The film may be 1959 but it feels so on the beat even today. This is masterclass cinema.",10,2,4,24 March 2016
Dangal," A Powder Keg of a Monster-tainer
","If I had seen Dangal last year, it would have easily blazed into my Top 30 list. Being a sport genre film, you will know what will transpire in the final climatic scene from a mile away, but it does hit all the usual tropes and emotional beats with verve and aplomb. The good ones in this genre know how to make the arduous learning journey resemble inspirational life lessons and will also make you feel vested in the story. This is not just a good one, it is a great one. Dangal is a biographical sports drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari. It stars Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. The former is India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal (55 kg). Her sister Babita Kumari won the silver (51 kg). I have seen inspirational life-affirming stories like this but what makes Dangal stands out from the multitude is that it got all the basics right. The film never sermonises the age old themes like sexism, gender inequality and patriotism, instead it hits the usual repertoire of greatest hits with a deft balance. There was never any need to hammer some of the ideas into your consciousness like nails to a wall. It trusts us to understand the issues because so many predecessors have already done so. It just presents them in a refreshing way to make them come up smelling like roses. For example, in a scene where the sisters lament their father for forcing them to learn wrestling, their friend who is a young bride-to-be shares with them how she wishes she has a father like theirs. In that simple monologue, a light is shone on the plight of the female gender in India. The film also got another aspect right - it manages to explain the sport with superb clarity, so much so that it almost feels like a wrestling 101 manual. It is never boring or preachy, and when the climax rolls in like the tide, you will smile gleefully because it has succeeded in actually making you feel smart. Talking about the climax, my wifey turned to me and whispered how the final bout would be won. I concurred and added that it will be underscored in extreme slow-mo. Of course, both of us were right. But the thing to remember is that even if we could guess it, it is always the mechanics behind we couldn't see. By then we were so vested in the story we were welcoming the final scene with opened arms and warm streaming tears. Dangal is also buoyed by convincing fight choreography and the wrestling sequences are well shot and without quick edits which are cheat-codes. You will believe the principals are wrestlers first and actors second. Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) are truly commendable in their roles. Even all the peripheral parts are well portrayed. That leaves Aamir Khan, who went over and above himself to turn in a superb performance and to think that he put on 38% body fat to play the role really made me want to salute him. But when I learned that he later went back to a lean mean fighting machine to play a much younger man in the initial part of the film, I wanted to bow down in front of the master. This is one powder keg of a movie with loads of great humour and infectious music. It doesn't matter that it is familiar because it feels like a great home-cooked meal and the Yoda-esque training lessons mirror what life throws at you. This one will definitely make you appreciate the sport that has been demonised and trivialised by WWF.",8,3,5,5 January 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The IMF Team is Back!
","Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb Der-der-der----Der-der-der----Der-der-der-Tur-ner No way is this latest installment dumb . Is there even any doubt? All the usual M:I narrative elements are here, but they are remixed and served up with renewed vigor. Yes, I choose to accept this mission.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation doesn't pretend to be what it set out to be - a solid espionage entertainer and nothing more. It doesn't re-invent the wheel, not that it wants to. Going into the cinema I know exactly what I will see - lots of chasing, driving, fighting, shooting, gadget-ing, disguising, double-crossing, triple-crossing, death-defying stunts and that indispensable 'let's go to the fortress and get that thing' scene. We get them all here in the 5th entry helmed by Christopher McQuarrie. Kudos to McQuarrie for changing it up so well that it never feels like an old dish.IMHO there are a few reasons why this is still a winner. First off is definitely Tom Cruise's winsome charisma. At 53 he still doesn't want to act his age. He runs shirtless at one point and insists on doing his own stunts. That's really him hanging outside an airplane at 1500 feet. I read he did that 8 times! Give him da money!! This new entry also continues the recent tone. Gone is that over-emphasis on realism and over-reliance on relevance, in comes a little over the top goofiness. I must confess I laughed out loud the most in Rogue Nation. The camaraderie and chemistry between all the veteran cast is outstanding. It feels like every character here is born to do one thing superbly well and they all have great lines to shine. Also outstanding is a superb supporting turn by a visually arresting Rebecca Ferguson, who more than holds her own in the physical scenes.The action scenes are amazingly shot and totally thrust me into the action. I abhor motorcycle stunts but I changed my mind about that after seeing how they were so viscerally shot here. There are some magnificently choreographed sequences here and I enjoyed the assassination at the Vienna Opera scene. The action draws counterpoint from the ongoing opera and there are so many captivating elements in play, including Ferguson in a stunning yellow gown... Oh-la-la Perhaps the only weak spot for me is the villain who didn't get a lot of screen time to cement his villainy. It certainly didn't help matters with the IMF team talking long expositions of him in the third person. Everything else works marvelously well.Rogue Nation may be the fifth outing but the franchise continues to feel pumped and alive. I love how every entry is directed by a different filmmaker who has his own take. All the M:I films are a great way to illustrate how do you up the ante with the same narrative ingredients stirred up in a different way. Apparently there are many ways to serve up the same dish. Bring on part 6 please (before Tom Cruise's joints start to ache). Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is one of the best action movies I have seen this year.",8,1,6,30 July 2015
Dunkirk," This is a great war film because of the things it didn't do.
","Dunkirk was literally my third war movie at the cinema in a roll. It started with War for the Planet of the Apes, which was one of the most evocative and unsettling human war films I have seen. It was followed by a Japanese anime, In This Corner of the World, an exquisite time-capsule of a movie, which showed me a new way the harrowing story of Hiroshima could be told. Then there was Dunkirk and what a film this is. I can't remember the last time I sat in stunned silence as the end-credits rolled, my mind awashed with the feeling that I have touched greatness. This is not just an excellent film, it is a great war film and it is great because of the things it didn't do.A word search of 'dunkirk' in IMDb threw up 19 entries! (N-n-n-nineteen in the metallic voice of Paul Hardcastle's 19 ðŸ˜¬) I had no idea the evacuation of Dunkirk became the inspiration of so many films and documentaries. First up, Christopher Nolan didn't need to serve up a history lesson again. A few simple opening sentences give context and we are thrown into the deep end. Dunkirk is about men trying to survive into the next hour with the onslaught of danger coming from every conceivable angle, plain and simple. It is how Nolan goes about showcasing it that is sheer masterclass.When was the last time you saw a war film without someone screaming jingoistic slogans in your face or not seeing a scene of a conflicted protagonist trying to justify the reason for war? When was the last time you not see scenes of carnage and human viscera? When was the last time you not see the face of the enemy in a fire-fight? These are practically the foundation of which the war genre is built on, but Dunkirk never treads the path of familiarity. Heck! It doesn't even have a single drop of blood (the bloodied bandage on the wounded soldier is not counted ðŸ˜Š). But yet the tension is so nerve-wrecking, the fear so real that I gripped the armrests for dear life and I thought I forget to breathe for over an hour.The dialogue is so spare and functional, it might as well have been a silent film with sound effects, but yet my entire being was transfixed on the big screen, ogling at the spellbinding vistas of war from the land, air and sea. The characters, what characters, are nameless, but yet their fear is so palpable they are instantly relatable. The heroics of ordinary folks is monumental but never felt emotionally manipulative. The cinematography is astonishing, recreating the combat of WWII so marvellously. I felt like I was running with the hapless soldiers or trapped in a God forsaken place praying for deliverance.Hans Zimmer's music score is an interesting detour from the usual soundtracks of blockbusters. It has no recognisable melody or an infectious refrain that will cement itself into your consciousness. It is largely monochromatic, like a few repetitive notes linked together, but by golly it worked. This is a score that makes absolute no sense when you play on your hi-fi system, but together with what transpires on screen the music feels larger than life, building that suspense to a mind-blowing crescendo. IMHO the music and the action share a symbiotic relationship, each element helping the other to create the biggest impact. On its own it wouldn't have worked as well, but together, it is a masterpiece.There are some superb films I have seen this year, but so far there is only one great film â€“ Dunkirk. Throw away all you think you know about war films and immerse yourself in the biggest possible screen (that would be the IMAX and it is worth every cent) and feel the crushing blow of grim defeat. Next year's Oscars may be far away, but I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that the Academy will remember this big time.",10,8,16,28 July 2017
The Conjuring 2," Not as good as the first but way better than a lot of horror films out there
","One can literally count on the fingers on one hand the great horror films that are intelligent and yet not derivative. James Wan has honed his arsenal of horror aesthetics through the years and he reached his most potent level with The Conjuring in 2013. One of the reasons Wan succeeds so well in this genre is that he knows the audience - when to tighten the piano wire noose and when to let you take in a breath. The scares are simple yet elegant, and damn well effective. It is a tough act to follow. A little personal story first...I am an avid reader, a habit that began when my mom gave me a few Enid Blyton books when I was in P3. But the moment I hit Sec 1 I told myself I need to start reading adult fiction. I remember going to Times at Lucky Plaza, a short walk from my school, and picking out a book to start on my next reading journey. I picked up Jay Anson's The Amityville Horror; I figured by reading this genre it meant I am all grownup. It scared the living daylights out of me. To think that all the stuff actually happened really put the fear of God in me. The Conjuring ended with Ed and Lorraine being called to the Amityville haunting and that is where The Conjuring 2 begins. There is no need for any synopsis because the sequel adheres to its predecessor in form and structure. It is yet another haunted house, this time from across the pond in London. A nice family is being tormented; nightly shenanigans ensue; all levels of hell break loose. An air of familiarity breeds - a little girl possessed, speaking in a husky menacing voice, uncanny levitation - all too familiar. If you have seen the demon possession film The Exorcist, you have seen them all. That isn't a slight against it; merely an observation. As much as Wan can scare us, it is the quiet passages that he also excels in. We understand the pains of the tortured family and the relationship between demonologist and clairvoyant, Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively. Vera Farmiga's Lorraine's tender exterior holds a steadfast sense of justice at bay. Her warm performance counter-balances a Patrick Wilson's Ed who is headstrong in his fight with the demonic monstrosity. Their screen chemistry feels natural and lived-in. It is precisely because Wan makes us fall in love with the characters first that the horror of what happens to them become emotionally unbearable. IMHO where it fumbles for me is the familiarity of the narrative. I see the usual scares coming and none of them resembles the original in terms of elegance and simplicity. I am also of the opinion that great horror movies do not rely a lot on CGI (take a good look at the good ones in the past few years - It Follows, The Babadook and The Witch). The moment I see CGI-ed ghosts my mind starts to tune off (here's looking at you, Crimson Peak). I am also of the opinion that great horror movies don't have a runtime of over 2 hours. My wife would say 'chop chop curry pok' and get it done fast and furious. The Conjuring 2 could have used a faster pace to get to the meat. Still, this is a solid piece of horror filmmaking culminating in a full-blown final act of symphonic terror in which so much is at stake. I would definitely welcome a third part but James Wan needs to choose the next case from the Warrens' files wisely.",7,1,3,12 June 2016
Inside Out," Pixar is Back!
","After Toy Story 3 (2010), Pixar's outputs seemed to have plateaued. Gone are the characters that stayed in your consciousness long after the movie has ended. Gone too are the original ideas that are amazingly simple but yet instantly relatable. In comes sequels/prequels that milked nostalgia like cheat codes. Sitting in a cinema yesterday, a big smile stayed on my face from start to end amidst some bouts of streaming hot tears. Pixar is so so back!Inside our heads, there are five principal emotions, each personified here as Fear (Bill Hader), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black) and Joy (Amy Poehler). They live inside young girl Riley (Kaitlyn Dias). Joy, by running the controls and keeping everyone else under check, becomes the de facto boss. A happy Riley is a well-adjusted Riley, and her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) are pleased with her. But, an accident involving Riley's happy memories changes her entire outlook. Joy and Sadness need to find her memories and return them to the Headquarters before it is too late.The centre of the story is sadness. It is an emotion that I have always believed the most important in giving breadth to all other emotions. In all the writing classes I teach, I always ask my kids to think about the last time they were happy and to feel its fleeting intensity. Then I get them to recall the last time they encountered failure, a betrayal, a belittling statement... The sheer intensity and torrent of feelings never seem to diminish no matter how old you are. Time does heal old wounds but it doesn't make you forget them. Inside Out exemplifies all my beliefs and that all great stories come from a moment of sadness. Before anyone starts to conclude that this latest Pixar offering is a sad-fest, it is not. This is a piece of incredible filmmaking. The ideas and visuals are electrifying but yet rendered with much tenderness and poignancy. I am no psychologist but I do have a strong feeling that everything depicted on screen has been carefully researched and no cognitive tidbit is left unchewed. For example, I have read somewhere that it is during our sleep that short term memories becomes long term ones, and how the concept is illustrated here is so simple and stupendous. The mindscape illustrated here is also a lavish wonderland of possibilities. There is also the proverbial 'train of thought' that only runs when Riley is conscious which is so ingenious. The continuous personifications of the abstract into the concrete really makes this a 101 guide to 'Understanding How The Brain Functions'. The wordplay is fantastic and they come fast and furious. I am sure I missed some in the midst of hearty laughter but the problem will be addressed once I lay my hands on the blu- ray. What I didn't miss are the emotional moments which have so much unforced poignancy. Absolutely love the moment when Joy realizes her place in the scheme of all things and when Sadness finally understands and embraces her meaning in life. Inside Out is not just a superb return to form for Pixar, IMHO it might just be the best Pixar film to date, and it is easily one of the best films I had the pleasure of seeing this year. The only minor quibble I have, and I do underscore the words 'minor' and 'quibble', is that children might not be able to grasp the the full extent of the ramifications of the story. But I guess that would mean much healthy conversations between the parents and their kids. That's never bad thing. Growing up is a scary thing and being sad is absolutely okay.",9,2,22,30 August 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," This decade's Love Story, Ghost, Titanic...
","The good ones are the hardest to write about. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations...The Fault in Our Stars (henceforth TFiOS) is a story of first love, of how to deal with loss and the business of dying, of giving a number from 1 to 10 to the pain you are feeling, and a wake up call to how you want to play the game of life with the cards you are dealt with. The teenage lovers depicted in TFiOS are cancer sufferers stage IV. It sounds like one pretentiously powered to the nth degree emotional manipulative tale. IMHO it isn't and has this almost evangelical sheen gleaming like a halo at the seams. It breaks your heart not because it's sad. It does that by swelling your heart with beauty until it burst. It's sad but it's also very funny and insightful, with the right blend of levity and honesty. It tackles big subjects - life, death, love. And it does it amazingly well, constantly buoyant with a hope even in the face of death. I know the book first and the movie feels like the actual movie that played in my head when I read the book. The movie is extremely faithful to the book. Movies of this sort live or die on one thing - the chemistry between the leads. The chemistry is spot-on perfect. The two are kindred spirits, sharing an irreverent sense of humor and immense charm, and watching them fall in love even as they face universal questions of the human condition - How will I be remembered? Does my life, and will my death, have meaning? - is deeply moving. Shailene Woodley, I know since The Descendants and The Spectacular Now. But they IMHO are not 'sit up in your seat and see me' material. I see Woodley not as a young Jennifer Lawrence, but an actress with a sweet fragility. TFiOS is her star making role. She embodies the role of Hazel Grace Lancaster so well I couldn't see another actress in it. Love how she plays her - she is not your archetypal teenager suffering from cancer. Ansel Elgort, I only know from Carrie in a dumb role. His performance is pitch-perfect and winsome. Together they are simply marvelous (I know both of them played sister and brother in Divergent but I have yet to see it).The supporting cast did a superb job too and each of them has good scenes to shine in. I thought Willem Dafoe was superbly cast as Van Houten. He totally imbues the character of a bile-spitting curmudgeon. I hate him but I also pity him. If I have to nitpick, I would say Dafoe's character is the weak spot. He feels like a simple plot device right at the end. In book form, I could see the over-arching purpose, but in the film his purpose seems simplified. But I am really nitpicking and scrapping the bottom of the barrel. IMHO TFiOS is near flawless and for a runtime of over 2 hours, we didn't feel the narrative was long drawn. And it has one of the most creative and cutest ways of showing SMSes and emails on screen (I bet it will be copied soon). It's a movie that like pain, demands to be felt and I hope people will fall in love with it like how we fall asleep, slowly at first and then all at once.",9,3,8,11 June 2014
It Follows," This is Horror that Doesn't Scream in Your Face But Makes You Scream in Your Head For Days
","Any horror fans out there? This one comes highly recommended. It borrows heavily from the masters of the genre but yet it manages to do it intelligently. Made for only 2mil but it looks like it was made for 5 times that amount. Good horror is like a needle in a haystack. This is good horror.The premise sounds dumb - a terrible curse is transmitted through sex. The supernatural entity will then come for the unfortunate person in any human-like form to kill him/her. You can't stop the curse, you can only propagate the curse by having sex with another person, but if this new person dies the supernatural force will then come for you and work up the food chain. Dumb right? But the execution is pure masterclass.If you didn't already catch the allegory, let me tell you that the writer-director is 'metaphorizing' STD. This one is going to make you think twice about having casual sex. The subtext doesn't become full-on distracting winks at you but does enough to get under your skin.The characters are not over-written and easily relatable. The atmosphere is nail-biting and the unnamed dread is killer. The tension builds and builds to a point that it becomes a visceral force. The music soundtrack hearkens back to the electronic scores of John Carpenter and it really creeps me out. This is lo-fi horror but it is buoyed by the Mother of hi-fi power, with just a teaspoon of blood. It is horror that doesn't scream in your face but makes you scream inside your head for days.PS - I saw this on blu-ray in the comfort of my home. Nothing beats watching horror movies at home. When I soil and pee in my pants, nothing beats the convenience.",8,24,48,12 July 2015
Get Out," Darkly funny and whip smart satire of our time
","Get Out is a timely entry in these cynical pressure-cooker of times. It is a piece of compelling entertainment, ensnaring the viewer with a rising intensity of stirring paranoia; it is a sly whip-smart satire of our current world wrecked day in day out with racial tension and inequality. How it never becomes top down heavy and preachy is sheer master-craft. Part of the fun of Get Out is the winding twists and audacious turns, and a discussion of the plot will rob you of the fun. So I will refrain from doing that and will also not post the trailer. Best to go in blind. Believe the hype. Writer-director Jordan Peele's debut film is assured and deliciously wicked. Get Out feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is a potent genre blender, pushing many racism buttons, sending them up in a refreshing manner without being preachy. Peele's comedic roots is showcased here and the high-tensioned wire-act is neatly interspersed with some hilarious respites, which believe me, is much needed. Peele also achieved some great tonal shifts as the narrative easily slides out of comedy into horror and vice versa with a snap. I love narratives I can't guess the outcome and even though I could see some twists coming ahead of time, I never felt short-changed because the characters are so well- drawn and the situation so twisted. Daniel Kaluuya, best remembered as Emily Blunt's sidekick in Sicario and an episode in the excellent Black Mirror series, is outstanding as the deer caught in the headlights. He demonstrated a lot of range and his character arc left me breathless as he raced toward the devastating finale. It is a dazzling performance that will make your blood run cold. When the ultra-violent final denouement rolled in, I was punching my fist in the air; only the really good ones can make me do this. It is definitely one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced in cinema and Peele has knocked it out of the park with his first film. Cleverly written with a pulse on today's crazy world and deeply unsettling, this darkly funny examination of what happens when you have got nothing left to lose is brilliantly addictive. This is a must-see for anyone who is occasionally reckless, ruthless or just plain psychologically weird, and anyone who loves clever movies.",8,8,18,22 March 2017
Room," When the movie ended everything around looks the same but feels different. A profound movie experience
","Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) is sublime alchemy, switching from heart wrenching horror to endearing tenderness with an air of innocence permeating throughout. It is a book that is so profoundly good that immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum (http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose, the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts, his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay. How the film manages to avoid all the usual trappings of exploitation and emotionally manipulativeness is a case of absolute marvel. Room deftly dances around these big holes of hysterics and histrionics, but yet still manages to make the horrendous situations feel authentic and heart-hitting. From top to bottom the cast shines, especially with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson has turned in a career defining performance and I think she is the one to beat at the Oscars. Such humanity and honesty, and through her character arc we are graced with what a mother would do for a child. She essentially creates a cocoon to nurture her child and to protect him from the cruel reality. Newcomer Jacob Tremblay is also phenomenal and he carried the film's weight on his little shoulders. He would of course say it is his long hair that gave him 'strong'. This is not a dutiful and obedient boy that does everything his Ma says. They do quarrel and have shout-fests but their diamond-hard bond is the beating heart of the story. I do feel the movie is largely spoiler free but I don't think I should say more on what happens after their escape from Room. The second half is essentially their journey back into the world and I am thankful that the movie doesn't whitewash everything into a stroll towards a golden sunset. Just like reading the book, I came out of the cinema feeling everything has changed, and I am grateful for the story of an unconquerable love between a mother and her child in harrowing circumstances. This is the first great film I have seen this year and I feel it is a profound cinematic and emotional experience to have lived in Room for two hours. Do yourself a favor by checking in at the earliest convenience.",8,2,7,14 January 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Feels like yesterday's spaghetti bolognese
","This unnecessary fifth entry of the franchise feels like yesterday's Spaghetti Bolognese. The gravy has coagulated into a thickened blur of red and the noodles have congealed into a bloated mess of starch. It looks great from far, but once you get up close all your alarm bells start to go off. If you put one spoonful in your mouth, the only thought pervading your consciousness will be how much you miss its formal glory and then you will proceed to spit it out in a hurry.For a movie franchise that is built on fun and adventure on the high seas, while maintaining a deft balance between light and dark elements, these sequels missed their mark with increasing notoriety. For me, On Stranger Tides (2011) flatlined from the get-go, while this new one helmed by Kon-Tiki (2012) directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg takes a while to get to the point of no return. There is no denying the fact that this entry feels unnecessary and almost redundant. There is some effort in trying to do a soft reboot with the introduction of new characters Henry Turner (son of William Turner and Elizabeth Swann) and Carina Smyth, but they lack chemistry and the uninspired script barely allowed them to stay afloat.One of the joys of watching a Pirates of the Caribbean movie is Jack Sparrow, a joyful collision of spur-of-the-moment slapstick and irrelevant eccentricity. The script of this latest entry doesn't even push the character a millimetre forward. He slurs and staggers his way through any scene and nothing is truly memorable, except maybe that guillotine scene.The story features yet again a MacGuffin, the Trident of Poseidon, and it feels too familiar and bloated. It doesn't help matters with so many characters which basically dissolve into a chain of cause and effect events.Dead Men Tell No Tales does look great at times, especially with inventive scenes featuring zombie sharks and the parting of an ocean, but like all money-spinning franchises the studios don't want to think up fresh storytelling ideas and is content with letting the CGI overwhelm the movie like a Kraken. The studio motto is 'the boat that carries the gold shall not be rocked' and it is clearly evident here.",5,6,14,29 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," This has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle
","Gotta hand it to Bryan Singer. He knows the subject matter like it is the back of his hand. You may be watching a full-on superhero romp about mutants, but you can also feel it in your bones that the movie transcend to a different plane subversively. Just substitute mutation with the current hot-button issues like xenophobia and racism you will see a very different movie. Singer understands ostracism and social prejudice so well that his X-Men movies feel like veiled shout-outs of misunderstood people. In X-Men: Apocalypse, he has made another entry in the franchise that has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle. I had a feeling that I wasn't just watching a summer popcorn movie but something relevant and important. The script is whip-smart and manages to juggle so many characters, both old and new. In one funny moment it takes a clever dig at Brett Ratner's abomination. The characters have link to the past and the future. There is pathos of the Shakespearean level and tragedy of the Greek magnitude. This is yet again a Defcon One 'End of the Earth' scenario with the Adam of all Mutants, Apocalypse. The chap may be buried under a ton of blue makeup and housed in a blue strait-jacket, but his quiet menace shines through. This is a villain with a capital latter 'V', well-established, religious connotations all around and his motivations thoroughly well-drawn. The action set-pieces are well done with no hint of repetitiveness. I mean we have all seen Magneto and Prof X strut their stuff but it never feels old with the tweaks incorporated. For example, Gotta love how they up the ante with the Quicksilver scene, easily one of the highlights again. If I do have some quibbles I would have to say the runtime could have been shorten (I really felt the full 2h 24min) and the final climatic smack down is exhausting to watch (it felt like it will never end). I have read some of my favourite critics' reviews and nearly all of them didn't dig the movie. Their reasons are exactly the polar opposite of what actually worked for me. This isn't as effortless and fun as X-Men: Days of Future Past, but it comes real close. 3.5 / 5",7,4,10,20 May 2016
Coco," An exploding piÃ±ata of vivid colours and warm feelings
","Back in 2014, DÃ­a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) was used as subject matter in The Book of Life, but I couldn't get pass the half hour mark. It was too kid-friendly and too contrived for my taste. I never like stories which I can map out the narrative trajectory way ahead of time. Sitting in the cinema, the first 15 minutes of Coco had me charting the story ahead of time and the dreaded feeling cascaded over me. Then, when it was least expected, the rug was pulled out from under my feet and I watched the rest of the movie with a big smile and with tears streaming down at the end, every tear was earned.Coco had some exposition to get through in the beginning and got through it did with panache and familial familiarity. The backstory is told through paper cut-outs and we learned why music is downright detested in the extended family. Though the attention to details is stunning, my mind unconsciously went down the dream-broken-dream-fulfilled road of redemption. But ever so surreptitiously Pixar surprises with a sharp turn and delivers another sumptuous piece of storytelling with Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) holding the steering wheel.Coco possesses a kinetic charm as Miguel, excellently voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, waltzes through the Land of the Dead in a vivid sea of colours. The world building is amazingly rendered with its own internal physics and reality. It is a riot of warm hues and buoyant mariachi music, a thoroughly realised universe with skeletal figures that have real souls.The characters are all well-drawn and the voice work by the all-Latino cast is excellent. The passion is evident in full wonder and as vivid as a rose petal on snow. The Mexican culture and traditions fill the screen with authenticity and are lovingly rendered. So much is conveyed via a framed photograph on a family altar that it transcends to something else altogether. The reverence for the folks who have passed on is well-handled. When it hits the last act, my tears streamed down.Coco is no Inside Out (2015), but it is still a timely and glowing piece of work, an exploding piÃ±ata of colours and all shades of warm feelings. School is out, bring your kids to watch this and after that, sit somewhere nice and share about all those family members who had passed on and who meant so much to you. I think the act itself keeps them 'alive'.PS â€“ I do feel that the trailer inadvertently let out some of twists in the story, so I would suggest not watching it if you intend to see the movie.",9,4,14,28 November 2017
Sing Street," Thanks for the music lessons
","Brilliant. Once will forever be one of my desert island films, but Sing Street comes really close. Together with Begin Again, John Carney has made an amazing trilogy of 'music' films that beat with warm hearts of gold. This one is about a boy living in the 80s who wants to start a band because he likes a girl. A rather simple storyline but the execution is bliss. If you were weaned on songs from the 80s you are so going to love this. The music is of course A1, but I never counted the familiar story to be so winsome and endearing. It fricking made me tear up. The reason why it is so good is because Carney knows how to portray the kids and adults like how we think them to be in our idealistic minds. In our minds, at one time or another, we all wished we were like them. I love the banter between the boy and his older brother in the music man-cave. Doesn't anyone want an older brother like that. A bro that knows, feels, loves and understands music, and talks music like it is the only knowledge in the world worth knowing. Carney knows music and he uses it to bridge relationships and incidents in our lives, and it is about getting the girl. It is also about 'finding the happiness in sadness' that transcends us to a new level, and 'no woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins'. I will remember that one ðŸ˜¬Thank you for the music lessons.",8,6,8,1 August 2016
The Imitation Game," A Biopic that Didn't Quite Work for Me
","We saw The Imitation Game on opening night and for some reason it was quite an underwhelming experience. Maybe we were on an euphoric high after back to back solid films and our expectations were sky high. I do recognized aspects of it which were exceptional but they couldn't cover what I thought was a very safety glove affair with not much depth, especially for Alan Turing later years. So I didn't want to write anything unless someone does first Benedict Cumberbatch is marvelous to watch. In all his noteworthy roles, he plays these savant type characters with a serious lack of social etiquette coupled with arrogance. Here he essentially plays the same but with a difference - he is a human computer with a secret. His brilliant performance rightfully deserves an Oscar nomination.I like how the story is framed and with added context from his childhood years. But as most biopics go, this one doesn't set the genre alight. The plot simply plays it too obvious and the central focus is held tightly only on the human calculator, so much so that all the rest of the characters feel peripheral. At times, because of the homosexual secret and the reverence for Turing, the story seems to play it too safe. For instance, I find Turing later years nearing his suicide feel too vague and everything feels so touch and go. I mean I don't need to see Turing having sex, but it would help to illustrate vividly the shameful period in English history when homosexuality is a terrible crime and how these 'criminals' are inhumanely treated by the government is worst than the homosexual act itself.",7,3,3,26 May 2015
Jurassic World," A Dino-Mayhem-Disaster Flick Populated by Staple One-Note Characters
","Once again it's a dino-mayhem-disaster flick populated by staple one-note characters - a couple of kids from a fractured family, a 'are they going to or are they not' couple, a shady corporate bigwig, a 'Dr Evil' type and so on. Thank goodness one of them is Chris Pratt who is the epitome of cool. Love the way he calmly plays his character, dripping with killer machismo and testosterone. Think Steve McQueen. Chris Pratt is the new old. Who cares about the other characters anyway?It took quite a while to get going but once the mayhem started it is actually quite a rollicking good time. The story pays homage to Spielberg's Jurassic Park and I find it a bit laborious and self-conscious in that some of the homages roar in my face. The theme of corporate greed is again highlighted in rainbow colors and underlined in bold strokes, and there is just so much one can milk it. Why the heck people don't seem to learn? But I am getting ahead of myself. After all these are people in the movie world. The problem is that the narrative feels too familiar and it very soon became repetitive, but still it is really a logical extension from the idea posed in Jurassic Park, a 'what if' brought to full fruition - a full-fledged dinosaur theme park.Colin Trevorrow's storytelling is uneven and the tone feels a little unsettled. It feels like he was hovering around 'shall I give my due respect to Spielberg' or 'shall I do my thing', but it couldn't quite figure out what it wants to do. The tone can also feel preachy (especially the long exposition in the beginning) and goofy, and it doesn't feel like it was comfortable blazing its own path. Thankfully Pratt's character smooths out the ragged edges for me. The poster of him on a bike with the raptors made no sense, but after the movie it made perfect awesome sense.Jurassic World didn't re-invent the dino-disaster wheel. I doubt that is its aim. IMHO it is a greatest hits album packaged with a few remixes of old tracks. Like a theme park ride, you would easily push the lousy parts like the long wait to the back of your mind, and only remember the thrills and spills.",6,114,230,12 June 2015
Logan," Sweet adieu, Logan
","You will know from get-go that this is the Wolverine movie you have been clamouring for when the first word out of Logan's mouth is an F-bomb and he proceeds to slice and dice scumbags who are trying to jack his car.I like what director James Mangold has done here. It's great that I see risky turns being undertaken in a genre that is rife with just adhering to an over-used template of upping the amount of Defcon One city-levelling destruction. Here, everything is stripped down to an almost unplugged lo-fi setup. Titular characters are distilled to their bare essence and everything that they held firm are tested, their resolve magnified as they stand up for one last hurrah before the curtain call.All through 17 years of Wolverine, the character never had a chance to unleash the level of violence that is synonymous with the claw-for-hands brutish hero. The first one is an embarrassing made for kids action flick, while the second one is a marked improvement albeit with just a sprinkling of blood. I think we have last year's Deadpool to thank for when the studios finally realised an R-rated action superhero movie can haul in big bucks. Of all the Marvel characters, Wolverine practically cries out for the same treatment; he has been crying out for 17 years. It is just gratifying to finally see the character unchained and the balls-up action up to the bloody wall. Hugh Jackman finally gets a chance to flex his acting muscles with an incredible swan song to a fascinating character.Though distinctively lo-fi in its setup, it is ultimately hi-fi in the way the story respects the characters. The theme here is family with Professor X as the grandfather and Logan as the father figure to a precarious child not in touch with the workings of the outside world. The story also takes a hard look at superheroes beset by everyday problems of putting food on the table and running away from their past. Physically, they are ageing and ailing, their abilities becoming liabilities in a world that find them irrelevant and only fit for the comic books. It is a brave way to tell a superhero story and I only hope this opens the door to more experiments.Is Logan perfect? Not by a long shot. Some of the expositions have no guile and the actual story takes a while to get going. The middle act has some really inert moments and the pace also slacks quite a bit. So in a sense the risk taking turns are curtailed by some storytelling elements. Still, this is finally the Wolverine movie I have been waiting for.Sweet adieu, Logan.",7,0,3,11 March 2017
Everest," A Devastating Survival Film
","There is a scene before the fateful climb up Everest in which the climbers huddled togOne can view this as a disaster flick but kudos to Kormakur for not making it feel like a retread. An outstanding cast headlines the movie. However the star of the movie is definitely the humongous mountain and the treacherous storm that accompanied it. By intentionally going down a not overly dramatic path and with icy deaths portrayed matter-of-factly, the movie has a ring of authenticity around it. The triumphant feeling when the team hits the peak is never underscored in bold, but their extreme effort to reach the pinnacle is. The characters are not quite the stereotypes of typical disaster flicks - there is no one singled out as the hero and even though there is a scaredy cat he is no coward. Perhaps that is why the characters feel a little hollow and some of the back stories feel perfunctory. The moment the film goes into survival mode, it becomes a different beast. The devastation of the Himalayan storm is ferocious and the loss of human lives is gut- wrenching. The photography and focused storytelling is exceptional. Even though at times I couldn't see who is who because of the massive gear the mountaineers are wearing, the danger is very real and nerve wrecking. The sense of cinema is huge and the whole screen is used amazingly well. I particularly love the immersive sound design which really shows you what a devastating storm up in the mountain feels like. I swear I felt the temperature dropped in the cinema and I can't wait to re-inexperience the movie in my home theatre. This is what cinema is about - the magnification of the human endeavor against the unstoppable force of nature. ether to discuss the 'why'. One said it is only when he is climbing he feels the clearest in his mind. Another said he is doing it to inspire his kids. A 47-year-old Japanese woman said she has climbed 6 peaks and this will be her 7th, her perfect 7. Finally all agreed unanimously that they were doing it 'because it's there'. The moment is quietly poignant because we all know most of them won't make it back alive. Icelandic filmmaker Baltasar Kormakur has captured the thrill and spill of an ill-fated climbing party with gut-wrenching verve.",7,0,1,30 September 2015
Once Upon a Time in America," This is Master Cinema!
","Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niroand James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years. The runtime of the film is 3h 50min and I didn't even go to the toilet all through it. It may be too long for most people but I can tell you that my wifey and me weren't even bored in the slightest. This is Sergio Leone at the height of his game and his direction is masterclass. His sketches of the characters are brief but underscored with verve. Words cannot begin to describe what he has accomplished here. The opening sequences kept me spellbound - a scene of violence, a sickening death, leading to De Niro at an opium den. You know the dragnet is closing in on him, then the fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing. I kept looking for an elusive ringing phone but it never comes. We are treated to images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all, but dammit I couldn't tear my eyes and ears away, and then we flash forward 35 years and we see the bloody phone. What audacity! What spunk! The opening had me on the palm of its hand. I was minced meat, ready to be pounded, tenderised and moulded to become a viewer Sergio Leone wants. Such opacity in the images but you will instantly know you are in the hands of a master and have complete trust in him. Every scene is handcrafted to perfection with such a high level of meticulosity. Don't get me talking about the ending. This is an ending that is impossible to shut up about. You will want to discuss with someone with at least some measure of acuity WTF was that about. For me there are two ways to look at the ending and what it means for the preceding over 3 hours you have just seen. This is as good as a mindfcuk but with such brilliance. I can say this is not a film for all tastes but it is definitely for cineastes out there",10,6,10,24 March 2016
3 Idiots," An undeniable masterpiece
","One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is 'I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,' discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.  The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.  In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.  The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.  Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.  The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of 'All Izz Well'. Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the 'All Izz Well' metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?  I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.  But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph.",10,14,24,29 June 2013
Don't Breathe," Horror has a new name!
","The power of a film's opening establishing shot cannot be under-estimated. If done well it will pull the viewer in and the storytelling becomes an easier job. One of my favourite opening shots hails from Highlander (1986). It has that curious gaze on a scene of mayhem that breathes with unusual counterpoints. It is hypnotising, beguiling, almost surreal, as you try to make sense of it. However I can't say the rest of the film did that clever opening scene any justice. Don't Breathe, on the other hand, has none of these issues. It opens with a scene that feels weirdly out of place but yet has a visceral and realistic quality about it. Questions whizzed through my mind as I silently prayed that the journey of discovery be a rewarding one. It is. Oh my... It fricking is. Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez's debut is a remake of Evil Dead (1981) called.... ahem.... Evil Dead (2013). It is loud, deafening and pours a swimming pool of blood all over you because he thinks more is good. His sophomore effort Don't Breathe is quieter, superbly lo-fi and the scares hit a lot harder. Running at 88 minutes, this is one lean, mean, crackerjack of a movie. Nary a scene is wasted. It resembles Netflix's Hush a lot in the sense that it is a home invasion psychological horror film and the homeowner is physically impaired. In the excellent Hush, the female victim is a deaf mute, while in Don't Breathe we get a blind man. But mark this, the similarities end there. Hush is a straight up thriller and we can easily root for the victim and celebrate her clever one-ups against the psychopath. In Don't Breathe we don't get that luxury and our sympathies for each character will sway across the board. There is an air of unpredictability permeating throughout the movie and the tension slowly rams up to dizzying hair-pulling levels. There are some inventive scenes that press the 'genre refresh' button and if you have been watching as many of these genre flicks as I have, that is something quite rare. The best character here is definitely The Blind Man played devilishly well by Stephen Lang. His dialogue is very spare but when it comes it will send a shiver down your spine. He is feral, doesn't listen to desperate cries of mercy and is a force of primal nature. Being blind means naught to him because he knows the lay of his house like the back of his massive hand. The battleground is his playground. You can go in but you can't get out. At a certain point we discover a sickening secret about him and it is such an uncomfortable eye-popping moment. But yet it is a powerful scene because I started to pity his heartbreaking desperation. Lang has brought his A game and it is a character that will haunt me for a long time. The cinematography is fluid and really brings out the claustrophobic feel of pure terror. Alvarez has delivered a thoroughly satisfying genre horror flick that is definitely not derivative. Evil Dead (2013) is forgotten. Don't Breathe is Alvarez's new first horror film. Horror has a new name. Remember his name.",7,7,17,25 August 2016
Sicario," Sicario... In Mexico it Means Hit-man
","After getting awestruck by Denis Villeneuve's Incendies (2010), I told myself I will see anything made by him. The spellbinding Prisoners (2013) came next followed closely by the only slight misstep Enemy (2014). Villeneuve is no flash in the pan. He has a terrific knack of grabbing you by the neck and slowly wringing it until you go white hot with nerve- wrecking tension. I think the armrest of GV@Suntec Cinema 6, Seat G10 might have been broken by me because I had practically gripped and shaken it for 2 hours straight. This is one taut, lean and mean thriller. Every shot by DP Roger Deakins holds so much indescribable menace. Even a shot of a boy rolling a ball across table had my heart in my mouth thinking that a shot would ring out and his brains would splatter all over the dining table. A slow building wide shot of a looming mountain feels like it could explode anytime. Innocuous delicate scenes become fierce, primal and shattering in scope. They are almost Hitchcockian but yet they are their own entity. Nobody does white-knuckled mounting suspense like Villeneuve. Our heart and mind is aligned with Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she leads a tactical team to storm a house near the Mexican border which ends up blowing in the faces of the team, literally. She is our moral compass as she becomes continually torn in how justice is not meted out by the book. Blunt is great in the role and she continues her amazing streak as a steel-edged lady justice figure with aplomb. As much as she is our 'go-to' character in the story, it is Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who is the spanner in the works, the winning wild card. His intriguing role outshines Blunt's in spades. When he finally becomes the namesake in the film title (in Mexico, 'sicaro' means hit-man), your jaw would have dropped to the floor. Villeneuve's superb foreshadowing is masterclass. At one early point he says to Kate: 'Nothing will make sense to your American ears. You will doubt what we do. But, in the end, it will make sense.' As much as these slightly condescending words are meant for Kate, they are also meant for us. Unlike the rest of Villeneuve's oeuvres, the action scenes here are more explosive than the drama. There are a few stupendous highlights like the fugitive extraction scene and the tunnel storming sequence, which any action movie cinephile would happily deconstruct with schoolboy glee. Villeneuve is helped by Roger Deakins' superb cinematography. His deft play with light, shadows and washed out colours is itself a character in the movie. If this doesn't earn Deakins his thirteenth Oscar nomination, I won't watch any movie for one year! Coupled with Jóhann Jóhannsson's pulsating score, Sicario is one of the essential must-sees this year. Perhaps the only quibbles I have is its doggedly opaque story that requires some work from you and its lack of a higher meaning. It is still not quite the perfect marriage between pure adrenaline action and high cathartic drama that I had wished for. Maybe, the Bladerunner sequel will be the one. I await its arrival in reverence.",8,19,39,17 September 2015
The Witch," Coffin loads of atmosphere and dread
","The past couple of years have offered up some very interesting horror flicks that defy genre conventions. Movies like The Babadook and It Follows continue to haunt me at the back of my mind whenever I think about them, like now... This year we have another frightfully good one - The Witch. Like the previous luminous examples, Robert Eggers' debut film focuses on themes rather than on the usual tropes and plot to drive the story. It is a marvel of minimalism and a wonder of unnerving terror. Eggers' meticulous construction of historical details is spellbinding and he even goes to the extent of having the entire cast utter King James English. The Puritan world of Christianity is the disquieting battlefield and the sweet family stands no chance. It almost feels like the story of Job in which God has deserted them and lets the devil play with them like dolls. The drab cinematography is immaculately precise, every frame carefully thought out. Above every aspect of filmmaking, Eggers got the difficult ominous tone spot-on. The sense of dread is so overwhelming and enveloping that you can't breathe. 5 minutes will feel like 10 minutes - usually when I say this I mean it negatively, but not with The Witch. The film has coffin-loads of atmosphere, and the horror is so real that it borders on pure torment.",8,4,7,20 May 2016
Steve Jobs," I am not sure if it is about the man but I am sure it is about the tranny of a mad genius
","Steve Jobs, the film feels like a steroid-addled mess but somewhere in its epicenter of chaos actually lies coherence. Forget about your usual biopic narrative structure, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay can't be bothered with that. Three moments are distilled from his Apple years and we get to look behind the stage during product launches in 1984, 1988 and 1998. The products unveiled are the Macintosh, the NeXT Black Cube and the iMac respectively. Those who are observant will notice that Danny Boyle uses different film formats to reflect the different pivotal periods - 16mm, 35mm and digital respectively. The three moments are essentially the traditional Hollywood three acts but it doesn't possess a cinematic feel. Boyle and Sorkin went for a theatrical feel and the ensemble cast is solid. Fassbender, Winslet and Rogen and Daniels are so good that I couldn't see another actor in the role. It's a jaw-dropping marvel to look at Fassbender playing a maestro that tries so hard to be the most hated man in the office and a man who wants the final word in any discussion. From the start to its end, the movie feels like it is going for a delirious high. It doesn't want to romanticize the man. If it is romanticizing something, I think it was celebrating the tranny of monster mad genius. I have a feeling nothing much in the movie is true and Jobs is just a canvas for Aaron Sorkin to work his usual porn. By porn I mean fleet-footed dialogue and repartee firing on all cylinders. Danny Boyle just takes the script and runs with the fifth gear with full-on acceleration. The pace is relentless, even faster than Mad Max. Forget all you know about biopics and enjoy the full-throttle ride. I have a feeling the movie is very divisive - you will either love it or hate it. I love it but my wifey not so.",7,0,1,18 January 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Slapdash Unfunny Affair
","lavished 4.5 stars on Hail, Caesar! but it just didn't work for me. I love movies by the Coen brothers and they seldom ever missed its mark, but this one did. It is a satire of Hollywood filmmaking in the 1950s, complete with Astaire and Rogers tap dancing sequence, Esther Williams' synchronised swim-dance, the communist left wing insurgency, the Hollywood classic aspect ratio and even the gossip columnist of that bygone era. But everything feels so slapdash with little regard given to a already flimsy plot. The characters didn't lift off the screen and feel so dull. Sure, there are some surreal scenes with dry wit, but this is no The Grand Budapest Hotel. This all style and no substance, and mostly dull and uninspired. I struggled to keep awake but I was weak; I kept hoping something will happen and the whole movie will lift off. I should have left with a couple midway through the movie.",5,2,4,24 March 2016
Kong: Skull Island," This is a BLAST!
","I really had no high hopes for this as I ventured inside the cinema, but surprise surprise, I came out with a bounce in my step and if nobody were around I would have beat my chest and roared.Kong is the second movie in the MonsterVerse series, following Godzilla (2014). The latter is a bit of a disappointment – the monster element is fine, its height used to great advantage and the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed and joyless storytelling. The human component felt neglected; they barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist whom no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-name actors very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self-importance. Fast-forward to 2017's Kong, I would love to say the filmmakers have learned from their predecessor, but in all honesty I can't. However, Kong is a lot more entertaining than Godzilla and for a B-grade movie it embraces its shortcomings with finesse. This is a blast!Kong has the right blend of silly humour and all-out monster action. Yes, the human characters still feel hollow, the exposition can be clunky and the story is unoriginal and riffs off Francis Ford Coppola's sublime Apocalypse Now, but it is plain dumb to expect the ensemble cast and screenplay to hold up during award season. What this is is a good ole pulsating monster mash of fun. There is a wee bit pressing of genre refresh button in that Kong doesn't fall for a white woman which will lead to his downfall and the sandbox playground is no longer a skyscraper city but Kong's Eden home ground, which is home to a multitude of humongous creatures. It is getting increasingly tiresome to see another city getting devastated, so it is refreshing to see a straight-up survival movie on an island where the human beings aren't on top of the food chain. The star is definitely the lonely God, Kong and the rest of crazy inhabitants of Skull Island. The visual and sound effects are stellar, and most importantly, the action doesn't feel repetitive. Each time Kong goes mano a mano against another monster, there isn't that dreaded been-there-done-that feeling. My fave is definitely Kong having an octopus sashimi for lunch; definitely won't be forgetting that for a while, especially when I am chewing on a tangy squid or octopus.The impressive ensemble cast plays second fiddle to Kong and his monster 'friends', and they seldom rise up beyond a distinctive character trait. Tom Hiddleston as John Conrad has to be some kind of convenient homage to Joseph Conrad whose Heart of Darkness is obviously an inspiration. Brie Larson, after her award-winning turn in Room, shows off different levels of seriousness. Samuel L. Jackson almost had time to utter his famous muthafcuking line. John Goodman plays a corporation type with affable charm. John C. Reilly obviously had the most fun playing a WWII pilot marooned on Skull Island for decades. Then we get a myriad of soldiers playing fodder and meals for the inhabitants of the island. This being a partially financed movie by China, we also get a completely disposal China actress doing 'I don't know what'. Sure, the complete cast doesn't get much of a chance to shine, but they are definitely colourful and not bogged down by an overly important story.Remember to hang back for a post-credit sequence that entices a neat future prospect. After that you can stand up and beat your chest with animalistic confidence and shout 'All hail the King!'",7,7,13,11 March 2017
Arrival," Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind
","Arrival is one of the front-runners in this current award season and the hype is deserved. This is brainy sci-fi for intelligent audiences, which means it is not a bravura shoot-em-up- with-laser-beams in the vein of Star Wars or Independence Day. I would say it is in the territory of Contact, but thankfully without the kitsch sentimentalism. This is Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind. Linguistic professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called upon by the military led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) when a dozen shell-shaped spaceships appear at different locations on Earth. Together with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), she is tasked with interpreting what the aliens want.That's it, saying anything more of the plot would ruin a profoundly unique and I dare say, spiritual experience. This is based on a simple 'what if' scenario, teased out into a larger tapestry and then hitting the climatic note with such panache that you walked out of the cinema hall more in touch with life. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer have adapted Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning short story, Story of Your Life, superbly. We are lulled into a state of awe, then once we are entranced by the strangeness of it all we are entrusted with multiple conceptions of what is right and normal. Villeneuve's storytelling is hinged on open-ended dialogue, quiet but tense scenes, dream- like cinematography and intensity exuding from characters in stressful situations. Not once does the story talk down to you, explaining difficult concepts through simplistic expositions. The narrative respects you enough to connect the dots (or circles) yourself. The story isn't just a clever intellectual exercise, it also carries great emotional heft. It accomplishes it through Amy Adams' excellent performance. Her deep emotions of love and loss boiling just beneath her melancholic exterior is a beauty to behold. Louise Banks is our anchor in this strange world and it is through her we not only learn what the aliens want, but we also enter into her mind-space and see her life as a mother. Despite some minor missteps, Arrival has so much verve that most people will just dismiss them. The whole exercise is stimulating, intelligent and thoughtful, with something wise to say about the human condition. We won't get many films of this caliber in a year so it would be wise not to miss it. Villeneuve has reached a new epoch in filmmaking with this and I can't wait to see what he does with Blade Runner 2049.",8,3,10,14 January 2017
The Big Short," Concepts of High Finance Made Easy and Fun
","I finally learned the meaning of big high-finance words like synthetic CDOs, MBS, shorting, sub-primes, hedge funds, bonds and so on. Cognitive thoughts flew in my face at the speed of light and big high-finance words bombarded me at Mach3. This is scathingly funny, whip smart, surprisingly intelligible to laymen and a crackerjack of a movie and the best part is it actually has a conscience beating at its centre. In 2005, eccentric and socially awkward hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable, being based on subprime loans that are high risk and providing fewer and fewer returns. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007, he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against the housing market. Banks thought that he is giving 'free' money and accept his proposal. Burry faces pressure from every direction and finds solace in his Death Metal. He continues to beat the drum at his own pace and eventually brought in 489% profit while the rest of the world are covered in red. Then we have a trader named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who hears of Burry's actions from one of the bankers he dealt with, and soon realizes that Burry's predictions are true. He decides to put his own stake in the credit default swap market. A misplaced phone call alerts hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to his plans, and Baum is convinced to join Vennett. Baum is a man who sees the world as one big giant surreal Enya MTV and he runs in counterpoint to everyone, circling the brim of anger and madness. Finally, we have a pair of eager young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who discover a flyer by Vennett and also decide to become involved in the credit default swaps. Since they are too inexperienced to pull off the trades necessary to profit from the situation, they enlist the aid of retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt). Together these individuals discovered the groundwork for the financial crisis of 2007-2010 and managed to profit enormously from it, but are ultimately left with their faith in the system shaken. This isn't a poor to riches or a 'I told you so' story. These people are drawn like antiestablishment reluctant heroes calling out the big financial institutions for their greed and lack of foresight. In the midst of the narrative's relentless propulsion it retains a compassion for the everyday American without the histrionics. For a movie with so many high concepts flying around, it is surprisingly easy to understand. Part of its marvel is that the film employs a very creative way of making the concepts digestible and scintillatingly funny. Imagine Margot Robbie in a tub, Selena Gomez in a casino and Anthony Bourdain in a kitchen using simple setups and tools to explain the high finance concepts. It is so funny but yet educational. The best one has to be the one using Jenga bricks to explain the housing bubble. These are scary big financial terms invented to screw with your brains but after this 2-hour tutorial you will be smarter. I guarantee you will remember the concepts better than what your university professor had lectured. The energy is recklessly infectious and I was easily caught in a whirlwind of euphoria. Using an unreliable narrator who breaks the fourth wall and even lays out all the Hollywood contrivances, we get a very entertaining film that throws everything including the kitchen sink at you. A film that is so top heavy should by logical sense be bogged down by the sheer weight of its self-importance, but Adam McKay didn't make that film. Thankfully, in the midst of all the reckless abandonment, it retains a core of seething anger at the fraud of the institutions which were at last bailed out by the very taxpayers they were out to screw in the beginning. Contrary to what Gordon Gekko has proclaimed, greed is not good.",8,2,4,17 January 2016
Wonder Woman," A female hero and a female director will show what other ways the superhero game can be played
","After all the big budget misfires, the DCEU really needed to score one and Wonder Woman has delivered a glorious goal. This is a coming-of-age tale, an origin story, a romantic comedy, a 1918 period movie and a superhero genre tentpole flick all rolled into one blistering motion picture. This is a winner! Batman, Superman, Suicide Squad who?After a brief prologue set in modern day Paris, we are brought to the timeless mystical Island of Themyscira in an extended flashback sequence. We meet Diana, daughter of Amazon Queen, Hippolyta (Connie Nielssen). She longs to join the ranks as a fearsome Amazon warrior and her aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright) wants to train her. The story begins in earnest with the crash landing arrival of American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who works for British Intelligence whom Diana rescues. IMHO the brightest spot of Batman vs Superman is Wonder Woman. Here in her very own spotlight, she shines like a beacon of hope for the franchise. The casting of Gal Gadot is an inspired choice and her femininity and her strong character form a hypnotic aura around her. This is not femininity of the weak kind; she doesn't look into Chris Pine's blue eyes, disappear into them and forgets all her fighting skills. She is a woman with conviction and yet she is always inquisitive. She is athletic, strong, knows her purpose in life (even though it will take her a while to get there) and statuesque in her convictions. She has compassion and feels for the common folk. In short, she is a breath of fresh air. Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman (henceforth WW) is directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, best known for Monster (2003) which won Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar. Her narrative voice is refreshingly distinctive and she blazes a new path for the overcrowded superhero genre. WW draws strength from Diana's growth in character and learning her ultimate place in humanity. As much as it is about that, it is also about a world torn by war earning their right to have her. This wise narrative trajectory gives the story gravitas and emotional heft. Most movies of this sort tend to embed an action scene every 10 minutes, but WW takes a different path and IMHO the quiet moments are also its strongest moments. Even when the action scenes rolled in, there is a 'never seen that before' awesome feeling. The scene of Diana running head-on into the German front is superbly shot and has so much emotional power that I won't be forgetting that for a long time.Chris Pine is definitely Gadot's counterpart. Their chemistry feels genuine and I especially enjoy their double entendre dialogue. Pine's Steve Trevor is a man of that begotten time period, he doesn't react immediately after laying eyes on a beauty. He bides his time and treats her with respect; he earns the right to be with her by being who he is, a patriotic soldier and a chivalrous man. Tell me you don't want to see that more in these present times.Up to this point, I sound like I am describing a superhero genre masterpiece and if you scroll down and see my score, you will probably feel it doesn't commiserate with what was written. As much as I think it is a very satisfying movie, it derailed for me in the final act in the typical bombastic manner with which all the emotional built-up is thrown out the door and in its place comes the Defcon One city-leveller noise. Thankfully, Jenkins does anchor one particular scene with an emotional heft seldom seen. At 141 minutes, WW does require some judicious snips and the villains do deserve better. But all these don't take away the fact that it is the best movie in the DC extended universe to date. It is super fun, satisfying, dare I even say edifying, and in a genre populated by men, it takes a female hero and a female director to show in what new ways the game can be played.",6,3,17,2 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Why so serious?
","really had no high hopes for this because from the umpteenth trailer only a fool wouldn't be able to unspool the entire plot. That's alright, sometimes a movie can still come up with surprises and the journey is worth it. Unfortunately, BvS failed us (but it may not fail you).My expectations are really low going in and it should by all means take little to buoy them up, but no, BvS lumbers along with no buoyancy, no purpose, and no clarity. Why does it kill it to add some levity to the narrative, instead of drowning us in self-importance and morose characters for 2h 31min. This is 151min which I totally feel every single minute of its passage, a skull-numbing and hollow def-con-one-yet-again experience. Why so serious?There are so many things that didn't work for me and the missus (and also the idiot who was on his phone the whole time sitting next to me). Right on top of the heap is a Lex Luthor who got the short end of the stick. His motivations are drawn without clarity and his portrayal grating on my nerves. Next comes the narrative that tries to juggle so many threads and characters, and for me didn't get anything done satisfyingly right. This is equivalent to someone so scared that his dart won't hit the bullseye, and so he throws a whole bunch of darts at the same time but lo and behold, nothing lands up on the board let alone the bullseye. This is a major disappointment. Sorry if I ruffled some feathers, I am just being honest and saying as it is for me.",4,5,10,24 March 2016
Monsters University," Managed to coast by because of the good will generated by Monsters Inc
","Some years ago my wife and I were honeymooning at Tokyo Disneyland. The Monsters Inc ride was one of our faves. She had a bright idea and bought the Monsters Inc popcorn container (without the popcorn). I remember asking her what she wanted that for.  She says I have to wait to find out. When she came back home, she took out the strap, carefully put in a used plastic bag and wala... It became a mini trash bin.  It now sits happily on our living room table and even has a blue helmet We love Monsters Inc. It had an ingenious world and an inventive concept. The ending with Boo was heartrendingly poignant and sweet. Thank goodness Pixar didn't try to sequelize it because that ending can't be topped.  Instead they made a good move to pre- quelize it, essentially to tell the story of how Mike and Sulley's friendship began. The good thing about Monsters University is the familiarity with all the characters. Watching this feels like a warm fuzzy meeting with old friends. The Pixar staple visual and verbal gags are aplenty and executed with gusto. The Monsters world we all know.  The difference here is that the main story occurs in the university where monsters learn their craft. This part also feels very familiar through watching all the American TV series and movies with their education establishments as the backdrop. The plot is also formulaic and familiar, like all those losers-finally-win scenarios.  In short there is not much in MU that surprises me, unlike MI. But it's still an enjoyable movie. I think one of the main problems stopping MU from reaching stratospheric levels for me is it's lack of pathos. It was breezy enough but nothing moved me till late in the third act when Mike discovered what Sulley did to make their fraternity win. For me the real Pixar movie began there but by then it was so late in the game the idea couldn't gain a lot of traction. I also like MI's antagonist Randall who actually has his beginning here but his character arc feels very thread bare to me. The message and themes are well presented - nobody is a nobody, teamwork and friendship, but it just lacks the pathos to hit you in the heart. All in all MU is a good movie but not a great one. During supper my wife and I got talking and I asked her that since this is essentially a prequel, would watching MU without any knowledge of MI work in the movie's favour. She gave it a 5-second ponder and said nope. My thoughts exactly... MU managed to coast by because of the good will generated from the much beloved MI. Taken on its own MU is quite ordinary by Pixar's standards but IMHO Pixar has lost their cutting edge sometime back. For me their last great movie was Up.",7,6,12,30 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," TFA Feels Like Comfort Food We Love So Much We Don't Mind Eating it Again
","I was 9 when I sat in heightened anticipation in old Cathay awaiting a movie experience like no other in the year of 1977. It was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. I only had a limited amount of vocabulary and movie experience under my belt, but I was wise enough to know that Star Wars: A New Hope was going to be a classic mentioned under the same breath as Casablanca, Gone With the Wind and the likes. Star Wars: The Force Awakens on the other hand will never be one.Don't get me wrong. JJ Abrams' TFA didn't suck at all. In fact it totally redeemed itself of the horrendous sins of the prequels. It is a handsomely made film that hits every nostalgic and emotional button. TFA rewards the old fans with its nods to the original trilogy so much so that I wore a smile each time I see a familiar bow to the classic and old characters who had become my 'friends'. It really felt like this creative team studied long and hard what made episodes 4 to 6 soar and what made 1 to 3 suck, and they came out with a storyline that feels too familiar. I can see plot lines borrowed liberally from the original trilogy. I shan't say what are they but if you are a true fan you will notice all of them in a fraction of a parsec. One would think after so many years the narrative could be told differently.If you were to ask me, I think Abrams made a mistake naming this as episode 7. There are so much back stories left untold between the end of episode 6 and this new one to fuel a trilogy. But that would make this trilogy the prequel of this sequel and the real sequel to RotJ. Wooooh... Let's not even go down that road... again. Anyway if he wants to he can name them episodes 6.1 to 6.3 I be lying if I say I didn't have a great time. In fact, I had to stifle back a sniffle and tears when the wall of yellow text rolled off into infinity. Sometimes it isn't wrong to use the same formula or mashed up all the great ingredients for a film. IMHO Abrams certainly earned the right to use all the classical elements. TFA feels like a dish we love so much we don't mind eating it again. But it is never going to be a classic.",7,1,9,20 December 2015
Godzilla," Godzilla makes Pacific Rim feels like a masterpiece
","This is quite a visually stunning film - the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. The stars of the film are definitely the monsters. Lots of money shots. That's it... for the nice stuff about it. I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed, joyless storytelling. What happened to B-grade fun? Why so serious?!? I think the only light spot is seeing a few firemen kicking down a Nevada hotel door to Elvis' Devil in Disguise, but I choked down my uneasy giggles because I doubt anybody in the cinema got it. IMHO the director, Gareth Edwards got the monster element gleefully down but completely neglected the human element. This is a shame because I thought his debut, Monsters (2010) was an outstandingly balanced drama and the fantastic. I have no doubt he got the 'Gojira' job because of it. The humans here barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist that no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-named characters very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self- importance. Comparing this to last year's Pacific Rim, it makes Pac Rim feels like a masterpiece.",5,9,18,15 May 2014
Spectre," This Spectre-Martini is Stirred, Not Shaken
","In preparation for Spectre, we re-watched Skyfall and still love it to bits. It practically pumped new life into the Bond franchise which I never thought needed one. It reinvigorated Bond with a electrifying jolt. I knew the action spectacle would be great but I never counted it to be so emotionally satisfying. Coming off the coat-tails of Skyfall, Spectre felt like a disenchanted regression and it felt like it was caught in a constant struggle between dissecting Bond more and giving Bond fans of the lowest common denominator what they want.Roger Deakins is off and in comes Hoyte Van Hoytema who also gives an elegiac sheen to the film. Some of the vistas are just stunningly jaw-dropping and postcard-worthy. The opening Day of the Dead festival in Mexico one-take tracking shot is spectacular, coupled with so much symbolism. It continues from where Skyfall's back to basic primal ending left us. Perfect! Then that Sam Smith theme song comes in and really... the song does sound somewhat grand but it is just not memorable enough. There is just no hook in there that would serve as DNA or primer for Thomas Newman's score, unlike Adele's majestic turn.From then on I find this latest Sam Mendes installment struggle to find its heart. That's just me, I guess. I know a movie doesn't work for me when my wifey and I constantly whispered wisecracks to each other - 'ah, this is the part where the bad guy tells his entire evil plan to Bond and for our benefit' or 'wah, I didn't know a ring can tell you so much. What do you think our wedding band says about us?' The evil megalomaniac rule the world plan is post-Snowden inspired but the execution feels off for me. In Skyfall, the same thing also happened but it worked for me so well because the film does a great job of building up to that moment and we feel Javier Bardem's evil diabolical presence even though we have yet to see him, and we can never forget that two rats metaphor story. Ravishingly awesome and demented. The big exposition in Spectre just didn't work wonders for me. There are also pacing issues especially in the middle act and felt over-stretched. My posterior sadly felt the 2.5-hour runtime.Action spectacle-wise this is good ole fantastic. But forget about it having any emotional resonance. This is the Bond of old, getting beaten up a fair bit but you will have no doubt that the bad guy will be dispatched away and Bond will have nary a scratch, a crease to his tuxedo and not even a slight lowering of his sexual appetite. It is pure male fantasy escapism fun.In terms of the new female lead Lea Seydoux, her character feels under-written, unlike Eva Green's in Casino Royale who was more than Bond's match. There is also Monica Bellucci in a memorable cameo. Craig is Craig but coming off what was pulled off in the previous entry, he is just a torpedo shooting in one direction. For this I can only blame the screenplay which tries to be clever by linking all the Craig-Bonds but ended up feeling slightly slapdash and uneven.Ultimately, I will just say Spectre is not as good as Casino Royale and Skyfall, but it is way better than the abysmal Quantum of Solace. It would please the usual Bond fanatics but for the cinema aficionados whose hopes were raised in Skyfall, this Bond-24 feels like a Spectre-martini, stirred, not shaken.",7,1,8,8 November 2015
The Nice Guys," Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious
","The Nice Guys begins with the killer bass-line of 'Papa Was a Rollin' Stone' and some 1970s attention grabbing neon font, and just like that I arrived in 1977 in my time machine. The film hearkens back to the heyday of bubby movies of the 80s, the celebrated world of porn stars and the crime noir of the 70s. All these is given neo-twist of a fresh lemon slice and wala... out comes a new concoction that I gleefully drank non-stop for 2 hours. The story is not really as important as the ride. It is merely about an enforcer (Russell Crowe) and the world's lousiest private investigator (Ryan Gosling) joining forces to look for a girl named Amelia. Along the way they will encounter goons, a hired killer, Pocahontas, a human fly and strippers dressed as mermaids in a world of government conspiracy. I only managed to glean the story much later on and was befuddled for the first two-thirds of the movie, but that never took away any joy, not one single bit. I found myself laughing out loud at the hilarious antics of these intensely lovable pricks. Writer-director Shane Black gets the 'anything goes' tone and the 70s vibe just right and deftly balances the gravity of the story and the hilarity of the situations. How I know? I found myself laughing at sequences of gratuitous bloodletting as boorish people die on screen. That is not an easy feat to achieve. Even though the film is far from perfect, the snappy dialogue crackles with such vibrancy that it smooths out the uneven passages. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling makes a superb pairing for an odd couple and both of them dial down their gravitas to serve the story. They also have the help of Gosling's daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice) to neatly get them out of plenty of troublesome situations. What a threesome they make! Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious, you would want to hire these not so nice guys for a missing person case and watch the ensuing havoc with a beer in your hand.",8,3,8,24 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A B-grade Story Concept Lifted Up to Master Class Level
","I am totally speechless. Looking at the trailer, I thought I will be watching a dumb, mindless, madness personified vehicular mayhem action movie. Take the first two adjectives out. This is fugging incredible! A kickass brainy dystopian story set either before or after the time of Thunderdome.George Miller has lifted a B-grade story concept to Master Class level. I am not just talking about the stunts which used minimal CGI. Miller has never forgotten that the action serves the human element and that is kept front and centre with superb pathos.The action is out of this world and it wisely stayed rooted to real world physics. Every vehicle looks like a Franken-monster stitched together from waste metal. The weapons, primitive and deadly. The desperate race across the desert is exhilarating and a symphony of sounds, excesses and madness. Each crash and explosion of twisted metal more jaw-dropping than the preceding one. Yet through all the crazy mayhem, Miller's hand is steady and the orchestra of madness is conducted with superb clarity and pin-point accuracy. Not once did I fall out from the story. I was pulled in immediately and the action is so relentless that I forgot to breathe. Thank goodness for a short respite 30 minutes in.Charlize Theron turned in an outstanding performance and Tom Hardy as Mad Max, the renegade of the wasteland and the Road Warrior, is fantastic. After a while, my mind was thinking Mel who?Not a good review... The words here cannot begin to capture the grandiosity of what Miller has achieved. I apologise Mr Miller. Let's just say after the movie ended, me and my wifey felt like buying another pair of tickets to see it, this time with more inquisitive and observant eyes, like how the heck were some the scenes filmed! Hands down the best action movie we have seen this year.",8,4,13,7 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson is back! Incredibly satisfying movie. This is amazing cinema but not for the faint-hearted.
","This is blunt but absolutely effective, loud but quietly tender, derivative but fetchingly sincere, cheesy but earnest to the core. Mel Gibson didn't even try to be subtle with the themes - everything, including spilled bloody guts and other anatomy, is splashed on your full-alert consciousness. Heck! The movie has no shades of grey but yet he delivers with a true story so amazing that my heart swelled up like a balloon. This is one of the most harrowing war stories ever put on screen and it is definitely not for the faint-hearted. This one truly earns its M18 rating and it wears its crimson heart on its sleeve, a blood-soaked tribute to courage, patriotism and following one's principles in the face insurmountable odds. Mel Gibson sure loves stories about men of faith getting their insides turned out. The irony of a man refusing to bear arms but yet wants to serve his country is right up his usual alley. For all its cloying melodrama, he got the casting absolutely right. Andrew Garfield is simply outstanding in the role of a conscientious 'cooperator'. His genial smile hiding a resounding resolve to adhere to his religious beliefs no matter what. Garfield manages to find the right balance of inner strength and vulnerability. His early scenes of being smitten by a nurse named Dorothy is heartwarmingly sincere. It is a credit to Garfield's moving portrayal that the romantic scenes don't feel manufactured. The movie takes its time to build Desmond's world so that we understand the soul-shattering decisions he would make later on. Elsewhere, Hugo Weaving as Desmond's father is especially potent and I will bet he gets a nomination at the Oscars. Vince Vaughn as Sgt Howell and Sam Worthington as Captain Glover are very effective too. The film is neatly divided into two halves and it is in the second half we get the namesake money shots. I have always felt Saving Private Ryan is the benchmark for depicting the gut-churning reality of the frontline of war, but Hacksaw Ridge comes incredibly close in usurping it, losing out by a whisker. Gibson pulled zero punches here and we are treated to exploding human viscera in visceral and gory details. This almost crossed into the horror genre, but thankfully the first half pays its dividends here. In the midst of the mayhem and carnage, the human element in the stupidity of war is kept front and centre. Gibson has wring the source material for all it is worth and more. This is an incredibly satisfying and thought provoking story. I have my doubts I can even hold on to my precepts and beliefs in the eye of a maelstrom, but it is such a great feeling to know it can be done by someone so scrawny and big-hearted like Desmond Doss. This feels like a blueprint for living one's life.'Please Lord, please help me get one more. Help me get one more.'Last night I slept with that line on repeat in my mind.",8,3,8,19 January 2017
Me Before You," The Mother of Dragon's goofiness save the day
","Romantic dramedies of this sort rise or fall depending on the chemistry of the couple. It is a foregone conclusion they would fall in love but they will have to earn the right to fall into each other's arms. There is no need to give me new twists to the familiar turns; just sell the couple to me and hopefully make me tear up at the end. On that note, Me Before You scores beautifully. I love watching Emilia Clarke, the Mother of Dragons. Her goofiness, all-out spunk, total honesty, awkward behavior and gaudy sense of fashion lift the chick flick slightly higher than it deserves. It took me 10 seconds and suddenly I don't see the Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Breaker of Chains and the Mother of Dragons. I couldn't take my eyes off her twitching eyebrows which have a life of their own. Sam Calflin plays his character with the right amount of sarcasm and levity; he is believable as a quadriplegic, a man who knows he couldn't ever be the same man again. Both of them turned in authentic performances. The story goes through the usual paces and there really weren't any surprises, but who cares. The theme of euthanasia wasn't handled with a searing depth, but the theme of living life to the best of your ability rings true. Yeah... We cried but we weren't a mess like we were with The Fault in Our Stars. Me Before You isn't breaking new ground nor did it try to, but it just felt like good comfort food. Sometimes I long for that.",7,2,4,15 June 2016
Macbeth," Blisteringly Nightmarish
","Some say the movie with the Mother of all twists is The Sixth Sense (1999). Then the Father of them all must be William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written way way back in 1606. It didn't just have one monumental twist, it had three. This is my favorite cautionary tale of how the love for power can corrupt the most righteous person. The play has many visceral layers and each time I teach it in schools, I discover something frightfully new. As I plumped the depths of murky hell, I gratefully clawed back into the light. This is one of the world's best stories and I sometimes feel it is the blueprint for telling all great stories. But do we need yet another film adaptation? Do we need to wake Shakespeare up from his eternal rest for this? O for Goodnesse sake, quake thee absolute yea! (But there are some caveats. Later on that)Australian director Justin Kurzel's vision for Macbeth is one of tone and mood. He has distilled the essence of Shakespeare's most enacted play in any form and translated onto the big screen with a huge soundscape and an implosion of monochromatic colours. If you want to know how a waking nightmare feels like this is it. Watching this feels like taking a stroll in hell. Every frame is carefully shot to illustrate a paean of pain and madness. Kurzel knows the story all would know, so narratively he is even handed and allowed the nightmarish tale to unfold itself. Under his unique vision there is no gloss, nothing and no one is romanticized, all the characters are distilled to a single motivation, an entity resigned to the supernatural forces at play. Everyone seems resigned to play out the game, no one wants to break out of their state. The theme of puppets and the puppeteers comes to the fore like a stab to the heart. I was glad the hellish journey to hell was over but I was utterly lost why I felt like I needed to stab something (I did stab something after that - a piece of chicken chop. Thankfully not the two idiotic PRC women sitting behind me).The performances by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are frightfully spellbinding. Their soliloquies performed with venomous aplomb. Making us fall in love with Shakespeare's exquisite turns in phrases is not Kurzel's aim. He was more intent on making the madness real for us. Macbeth's despairing complaint about life: ' ... it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing' hits a spot in my heart I never thought existed, and Lady Macbeth's painful 'Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!' is poignant and as the shot pulls out we actually see who she is lamenting to. My heart broke.Kurzel's Macbeth though blisteringly visceral and gut-twisting in its vision, doesn't say anything new or reward the faithful. It is an unwavering and outstanding adaptation, but unlike Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (1953) and Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool (2007), it doesn't breathe new life into the tale. 30 minutes in you will already know what you will get: an unsentimental retelling of an old favorite. It does tweak a few scenes remarkably well like how the film opens and how its relevance is made so pronounced through Lady Macbeth's final soliloquy. I particularly also enjoyed the three witches scenes which play up the nightmare angle. Overall, the film is intense and depressing to a fault, unapologetically so. I am grateful for the moody experience but I wouldn't want to relive it. One visit to the murky depths of hell is enough to last a lifetime.",7,1,4,1 December 2015
Sully," an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger
","Running at a lean and spry 96min, Clint Eastwood's Sully isn't so much a clinical bio-pic in the traditional sense, but an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger. On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the 'Miracle on the Hudson' when Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.Tom Hanks underplays Sullenburger but in so doing he brings out the multi-layered human qualities in the man. This is about a man who has 42 years of flying experience and he knows the aircraft like it is the back of his hand. Here is a man who does his job to the best of his abilities and he does it well. He will tell you he is not a hero but simply a man who is just doing his job. From a man with no time he becomes the man of all time. However, he is shaken to his very core when the doubts start to set in as the NTSB rips apart his heroic maneuver. Is Sullenburger a hero or a fraud? The story rests on Tom Hank's abled shoulders who has built a reputation playing understated and reluctant heroes in Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips. On first look Hank didn't seem to put on his acting hat, but after a night of rumination his character continues to stay with me. His sullenly insular and taciturn manner displays a fully functioning problem-solver's mind, calculating the probability of survival in that instance when the birds hit the plane engines. Thank goodness he trusts his instincts rather than the computer. Hank isn't the only star in the story. At 86, Eastwood has meticulously crafted an honest story we thought we already knew into a tense drama with little bell and whistle. His unfazed skill in storytelling is assured and Sully definitely belongs to the top tier of his pantheon of good movies that include Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. In Eastwood's hands, the film flies above the usual biopic tropes and it feels like a homage to a modest man who rose to an extraordinary occasion and a salute to professionalism. It is a wonder the story doesn't carry an ounce of jingoism and it is a superb amalgam of the loud and the silence and the human elements of a near air disaster. The final star is definitely the plane crash. For a home-theatre enthusiast, the visuals and sonics are a feast for the senses. We get to see the crash and its aftermath from every physical and emotional angle. I can't remember the last time I see a reenactment of a plane crash so visceral and real. This is the closest you will get to experience one without actually being in one. I didn't care much for Eastwood's last directorial effort American Sniper because it carried too many skull-numbing and blatant embellishments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself. This may feel like a straight-forward story but the use of Rashomon-resque plot manipulation transcends the film above the usual biopics that you would forget after a night's sleep. I didn't forget this one today.",8,63,88,12 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," A back-to-basics balls-to-the-wall Alien entry
","This will be the sixth time we get to see a xenomorph explode from a human chest after using the human host as baby gruel (eighth if you include the Alien vs Predator abominations). In the world of narratives, the shock value depreciates like the value of cars, but there is still a tingling thrill if the story is well-told. After the ponderous top-heavy Prometheus (2012), it is nice to see Ridley Scott serving up a back-to-basics Alien entry that has many fan-nods to his 1979 sci-fi-action-horror classic Alien.Some years after the events of Prometheus, the ship Covenant, loaded with the hibernating bodies of settlers, is en route to colonise another planet. A tragedy forces the crew – Daniels (Katherine Waterson), Oram (Billy Crudup), Tennessee (Danny McBride), Lope (Demian Bichir), Karine (Carmen Ejogo), the android Walter (Michael Fassbender) and others – to make an emergency landing on an uncharted planet, where they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.Tell me the plot doesn't resemble Alien. These days movie franchises like to reboot itself by making a 'new' film, case in point being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This is not necessarily a bad move because it gets to keep the old fans and new ones to the franchise happy. Frankly, after being weighed down by all the lofty God and Creator ideas in Prometheus, we are due for some let's-kill-em-all balls-to-the-wall action.Alien: Covenant is definitely a piece of effective sci-fi-horror gut-bucket filmmaking and IMHO Ridley Scott hits the mark (not the bullseye though). Sure, the characters are hackneyed and are largely cannon fodder for the aliens. Sure, the world may be different but the actions of the crew are the same. But at least none of them does dumb things like yakking cringe-y lines to a baby alien like it is a puppy and getting crushed by a giant rolling croissant (here's looking at you, Charlize Theron). That said, the crew of Covenant, especially the captain, are still gullible, but I can forgive that for the matter of storytelling.The action set-pieces are well-staged and have the right amount of freshness and yet could harken me back the classic, like the flushing out of the alien onboard the ship and the closing of the hatches after them. That gave me goosebumps of the good kind. Daniels (Katherine Waterson) is no Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), but still she channels a compelling yet softer edge. But the movie is really a Michael Fassbender show whose performance is sinewy and spine-chilling. He plays dual roles here with the right amount of distinguishing traits – rigid upper body, posture, speech patterns, menace-laced dialogue – with finesse and aplomb.Ridley Scott has come out tops through an ocean of guts and gore, and he has reminded me how much I love the first two Alien entries. I like Covenant, but don't love it, and this one easily slips into third place. Scott has successfully answered the questions proffered in Prometheus and got my senses up to ultra-wary levels for the next one.",7,45,90,10 May 2017
The Martian," A Supermassive Monster-tainer!
","I superduper love the book. Andy Weir's book is practically celebrating the geeky nerd in me, but I am under no illusion that Ridley Scott can just take huge chunks of Mark Watney's thoughts and monologues, shoot them and wala the movie would work. It wouldn't. The science experiments, the guess and check methodology and the constant hypothesis testing do not make for anything cinematic and most people will go into deep space slumber by Sol 47. What Scott and his team did is to take all the compelling narrative elements and propel them with an authoritative drive, and The Martian becomes for me, this year's most undeniable supermassive monster-tainer of the nth degree. The narrative is not new. I am sure anyone can see this is a concoction of Robinson Crusoe, with a heavy dose of Apollo 13 and Gravity. I love this genre tremendously and I am now going to tell you a secret - I love watching terrible movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. There, I said it, and I don't care if I lose your respect :). There is something so primal, singular and compelling about a character solving problems to survive in the face of insurmountable odds. In The Martian, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. This narrative can be found in many films and it is IMHO best articulated by this quote - 'I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.' If you know where this is taken from, we must be related in some way :). Watney articulates the same sentiment in the epilogue of the movie, which is not found in the book.How Scott succeeded in reining in his usual self-important space opera mumbo jumbo is already cause for celebration. His hand is light, sure and every creative choice he made serves the story. We get wide vistas of Mars and the spacecraft, but somehow Scott stops himself from underscoring them with his usual larger than life signature. By doing that the story of one extraordinary man on Mars becomes front and centre, and bigger than everything. The cast is solid all round, especially Matt Damon who carries the movie on his everyday man's shoulders. His smarts and snarky personality shining through. We rise and fall on his little successes like repurposing his excrement as fertilizer and we laugh with him through his not too outrageous notion of colonization. For once, and for such a welcome relief, this movie is populated with super-intelligent people who don't do stupid dumb things like touching unknown objects or walking into unknown territory. This particular genre is full of these stereotypes but you will find none here. There is not much melodrama here to manipulate you emotionally. You are not going to see a scene of an insufferable wife calling from Earth to make sure Watney doesn't give up (watch Everest for that and I don't mean that in a bad way). What we have here is a tenacious man solving problems like how to make water, grow food, and communicate with NASA on an unforgiving planet. There is no monster, no inner demons, no anger towards God, just one man who is ready to 'science the sh*t out of it' as he 'gets busy living'. Who would have thought watching a man's constant efforts to stay alive for another day makes for such compelling cinema. Some of the great stuff in the book like the broken drill bit and the accident with the rover on the final trip to Ares 4 didn't make it into the film, but I am not taking any points away. This is a superb tribute to human ingenuity and will probably make young people want to study harder. It may not have pushed the envelope in terms of cinema but it succeeded in what it set out to do - a supermassive feel-good visual extravaganza. I am so glad I sat between my wifey and a geeky teenager. The dude was gasping in wonder and cheering animatedly through some of the amazing scenes. This type of special effects money can't buy. My wife said that boy is probably me when I was a boy. She is right.",10,3,59,2 October 2015
