Skyfall," Coursework in The Beating of A Dead Horse 101
","For all the money and talent available to make a Bond film Skyfall comes off as phony and weak as any of them ever made. Whereas Moonraker was silly guilty pleasure Skyfall is just silly without the guilty pleasure.The most significant line in the movie spoken by the new Q (a god-awfully written character) when he states that he could 'do more damage with his PC by 6:00 AM while in his pajamas' than Bond could do in days of field work. This line represents the attitude of the writers. They feel that they can just write anything and since they wrote it on their PC it is wonderful.If the writers ever did go out into the field and do field work they would know that it is impossible to just magically make a gas explosion timed to go off when M has her car stopped on the bridge. And just why was M's car stopped? No explanation is given...there was no attempt at a set-up of a terror threat (or else that was edited out).The writers would also know that it is impossible to just magically have a 'virus' program suddenly open all doors, etc., in a building. They would also know that Q is acting like a rank amateur plugging in an unknown PC into the whole network without even contemplating that this may be a bad move. Way too coincidental but ...hey...when you wake up and just magically type magical characters then it is all so easy for villains to do this!The end of the movie is actually one of the more atrocious Bond endings ever. It is pure video game fantasy. Let's have an isolated building in an isolated area be taken by assault and we will...over a series of very staged scenes...blow up room after room culminating with sending a helicopter into the building for final destruction.Then...somehow on a beautiful chilly day in Scotland...at night...the moor is iced over! And not just thin ice...noooooooo...it is 'breakeable only by bullets' ice. Not only is it night and iced over when one is below the surface of the ice one can see upwards perfectly.To cap it off...after escaping from the water Bond makes it to the chapel to save M...and he is completely dry. He is completely composed like he is ready to order a martini. No hint of hypothermia here! And he throws a knife with such force from across a room that it impales perfectly in the back of the villain killing the villain in seconds! Just like in 'Skyfall...the Video Game!'Given the run time of the film there are massive amounts of other inanities that can be pointed out but why beat a dead horse? And that is what Skyfall ultimately is...coursework in the beating of a dead horse 101.",4,22,40,2 December 2012
The Hunger Games," Young Chick Flick meets Survivor
","I have not read the books. I went in with an open mind curious about the hype and smash sales.Halfway through the movie I found myself bored. Nothing had really happened at all. It was all young girl fantasy: 'I come from the poor oppressed area and I am special and I am self conscious and people are forcing me to kill people because I bravely volunteered to save my sister's life and I have cute boys and I get to wear cute dresses and I am the hope of the whole galaxy!' The futuristic society is yet another futuristic society that could never happen...and this is probably why the story does not translate well from book to screen. In a book one can create a cool future world where all the failures of the cool world are not seen. On screen in a visual context these failures become warts seen by many. All the people in the capital (no other major cities or countries evidently exist) wear colorful clothes and makeup...and do nothing but await The Hunger Games all year? Who makes these clothes? How does capitalistic behavior work in this socialist society? The capital is immaculately clean...not a single wastebasket is in place...is there no trash ever generated? And with all the spectacle of this no one has ever seen clothing that acts like it is 'fire lit'? What...they kept the fabric in hiding waiting for the heroine? The place where the Hunger Games takes place is a domed world where there is a perimeter...yet they must create a firestorm to send the girlie back from the perimeter? Why, won't she run into a wall? Beasties can be CGI made to appear in a forest and to kill people...but isn't that concept in violation of the idea of The Hunger Games of having the contestants kill each other?There are too many convenience that are told (the idea of a foreshadow is to 'show'; not 'tell'). 'Show them you are strong; throw this' means this will occur later. 'I learned camouflage icing cakes in my Mom's bakery;' a bakery that exists in District 12 where people are so hungry they beg for bread in rainy streets. Then the camouflaged person immaculately fits in to the scenery with a perfect face meld with a muddy area...despite the person having been gashed with a sword (if he was so injured did they let him go? He was a wimp, the idea is to kill the other contestants so why not slaughter him then?) The camouflage is perfect...even though there is no mirror to help make the face lines match perfect. Way too convenient.The bullet train is cool looking. The engineering behind it is farcical. When is maintenance done? You built a vehicle that runs 200 mph over angles hundreds of feet above a tree canopy...but no one in District 12 has any electronics...except they all get to see The Hunger Games on TV? Comments have been made about the struggle to move the book to screenplay. I can see why.",5,6,10,30 March 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Poor scripting can't be overcome by the Special Effects
","I liked the first 3 X Men movies. They had something that this movie does not: A good script.The concept of the X Men and Superhero world in general requires a significant suspension of disbelief to make the characters work. Doesn't it ever seem odd that each individual Superhero created is exceptionally unique? For example, The Beast has no genetic family tree. His mutation is singular. Scott Somers with the laser eyes is singular too. This is not normally how nature operates.The first 3 movies overcome this by having some interesting plots. This turkey can be summed up one 'matter-of-fact' scene.The evil people go to get Scott Somers. Scott is in school after hours writing something like 'I will not nuke any food unless I am asked to on the chalkboard.Now...Scott has powerful laser eyes when his sunglasses are off and he opens his eyes. The laser beams are so powerful that when the glasses are off his beams 3 floors of his school building are laser burned all the way through causing fire and destruction.So...Scott is in school after hours and the evil people come for him. There is not one single person other than Scott in this 3 story school. The school also has no problem keeping a kid who can laser beam everyone in school.Sorry...can't check the suspension of disbelief for such crappy writing.",3,1,2,22 January 2012
Knocked Up," Clever Writing? NOT!
","Here is what you are supposed to buy off on: The hot blonde Heigl works for E, gets a promotion to put her 'on TV'; but she has no rich, wealthy boyfriends chasing her tail. Her bosses don't even take her out to celebrate her promotion. Instead she goes to the bar with her sister who she lives with...as well as sister's hubby and baby. Even with the promotion she won't make enough money from E to move out on her own. Who knew working for E was so 'cheap?'On the way to the bar the only dialogue between the sisters is about the married sister walking in on her husband masturbating. Nothing worthwhile about...oh...Big new job and promotion to discuss! Nope...sister is disgusted because she can't get the spooge out of her towels good enough to make the towels soft again. Ha ha...aren't you just laughing? Heigl goes with her sister to a packed bar to celebrate. The bar is so quiet people can talk to each other with ease. Rogen can just reach over the bar and grab a couple beers and leave money on the counter to pay for the beers...and he opens them and gets the lime in the top of the Corona's. No one smokes cigarettes at all in the bar. Yet, the bar is a 'packed hot spot.' Sister gets a call from husband at home with the child while she is at the bar. The conversation is one that everyone can hear...and comprises two lines to speak to her husband 'Is it a rash or chicken pox?' followed by 'Oh, I'll come home.' Ha ha...golly gee...that is just so real and funny! Sister dumps Heigl at the bar with other men...good thing they don't have any GHB on them! She dances and does shots and closes the bar and stumbles home drunk with Rogen...and has sex with bra and panties on. To top it off at 7:30 AM the very next morning she is up, sober, no hangover, showered, made up, disgusted with herself...and has to go to work. Fortunately she has time for breakfast with Rogen before leaving.Isn't this what sex and accidental pregnancies and one night stands are all about? This trash is only the first few minutes of this stinking heap...it only gets worse from here.God, what awful screen writing. The characters all deserve to die.www.poje.biz",Null,3,5,21 August 2011
Underworld Awakening," Resident Underworld
","I can see I am not the only person to feel that they thought they were watching an Underworld movie and Resident Evil broke out. My god this was awful! There is now an evil corporation named Umbrella...um...er...Antigen. The opening sequence has Alice...er...um...Selene awakening from liquid sedation...nekked, of course...with her same clothes from the prior movies handy. Alice\Selene 'escapes' but that is just a front.From there the morphing comes fast and furious as characters just zap in and out of T Virus...um...er...Vampire\Lycan status. The silliness and stupidity that is engaged in is absolutely mind numbing.I'd also like to know if Selene ever changes her clothing. My god...what woman wears the same outfit for mega years? She is inhuman.There is more nonsense about...well...no real reason to go into it here. There's no real story...just morphing and guns and phosphorous grenades and banality. Just god awful.",1,4,8,9 May 2013
Salt," How convenient
","Definition of Pastiche: 'an incongruous combination of materials, forms, motifs, etc., taken from different sources; hodgepodge.' There is no real plot here. Just a series of ever escalating pastiches that make no sense. To make the parts fit together everything appears as choppy matters of convenience.How convenient when the apartment is raided that the chaser looks out the window exactly when AJ is hidden by an air conditioner. How convenient that when global world security is in NYC for the funeral of the vice president AJ magically is under the cathedral.How convenient that when a motorcycle is needed to escape a traffic jam and police vehicle that one not only appears but is disarmed and taken over in the flash of an eye.How convenient that the police vehicle chasing the motorcycle is on the left side of traffic jam...then suddenly is driving down a hill on the right side of the traffic jam...how did all the cars get leapfrogged? The Lara Croft films were at least tongue in cheek. The acknowledgment of 'cheese' helped make those films 'work.' Salt has none of the fun...just haphazard editing jumbling together some ridiculous sets of scenes.This is the type of film that is the reason why I became an author and am creating my own material...I can and have done worlds better than this crap!",2,3,8,8 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Bella needs to go potty
","I've not read the Twilight books...and I am a 49 year old male...so...I know the demographics are not targeted at me. However, I have no begrudging anyone their success and harbor no ill will towards the Twilight gang. My opinion is that I am 'calling as I see 'em.'Technically the film is structured OK. The cinematography is nice and the CGI is fine. To me, though, the film is like the Vampires of true Vampire myth...soul-less.I see many reviews state that Twilight is 'teen porn.' I find that I disagree with this assertion. Twilight is more like people who need some porn in their life for there really isn't anyone in Twilight.For the movie Bella acts like she needs to pee. Like...pee really bad. Bella is in blue jeans and she is so tormented that she is almost constantly bending in her blue jeans like she needs to find a potty quickly.Bella pines for Edward...and acts like she must pee. She tells Jacob 'Don't do this' in such a tortured manner...and acts like she must pee. She exits the car to run to the clock tower not knowing what to do...and she acts like she must pee. That is most definitely not 'teen porn.' If mopey, whiny characters who bear no semblance to reality are your fantasy bag then have at it. In this kind of fantasy the characters are all tortured and the nerdy girl who looks like she needs to pee is loved by both vampire and werewolf. In real porn she is enjoying doing both of them at the same time...and she probably has more substance than Bella. Considering how little substance that porn girl is demonstrates how little substance Twilight is.",4,5,6,28 October 2012
Elysium," El-Stupid-ium
","WOW! This movie is just awful. They call it Science Fiction but there is no science in it...only really bad fiction.Have you ever noticed in these kind of futuristic society stories they never really explain how society got to the current state it is in at the start of the movie? There is a reason why. There is no possible way that such a stupid societal construct could ever come to be! So ...like a Paul Krugman economic theory...the answer is that the construct exists because the premise starts out saying 'Let's assume that all logic and common sense goes out the door.'(!)Evidently in the future only future Los Angeles and Elysium exist. Supposedly the world is ravaged by population and disease but there are no Asians or EEU or South American or African members...or even Washington, DC, involved with Elysium! EVERY POLITICALLY SYSTEM GLOBALL JUST SOMEHOW UP AND VANISHED! DOH! So...Elysium is built and lived on evidently by only Hollywood types who rule the planet! The internet as we know it has also completely vanished. So has e-mail and cell phone technology...but you can still get a good deal on GMC vehicles that look like leftover Road Warrior vehicles! Matt Damon (say it Team America-like) works in a factory where he...I guess...builds robots (?). That's a little unclear. But...he is stupidly badgered into some sort of elevator style 'heat-treatment' booth by his superior. Since their is no OSHA anymore his character gets trapped in the room where they...get this!...dose the robots WITH HUMAN KILLING RADIATION! Now...there's like no big signs up anywhere in this factory that say WARNING: RADIATION AT WORK! It is never explained why robots need radiation treatment but that is what they do. AND...get this!...when the treatment is done the radiation 'magically' disappears! People just walk in and out of the room! Like...WTF!??!!!??? How does radiation magically dissipate or get moved out of a room? IT DOESN'T! Unless all science goes out the window! Poor Matt. Now he has 4 days to live because of Radiation poisoning and he is very ill and can barely walk or stay awake or keep from puking...for about 5 minutes! The rest of the movie he is hooked up to a biometric-ally controlled exoskeleton and Matt never shows any effects of radiation poisoning and he fights his way all over LA and Elysium! So...in a complete Johnny Mnemonic rip off (they should sue)...Matt Damon has the magic data in his skull and people want his head. How this all comes about is so incredibly ridiculously stupid and unbelievable I wanted to throw things at the screen.Matt then shows up with a grenade with the pin pulled out and his hand holding the grenade from exploding and he demands a ride to Elysium or he will blow his head off. So...not strapped in...and with no refueling of any sort at all...the ship just flies off on a 12 minute flight to Elysium! So...they are breaking through Earth's atmosphere with the super rocket powered ship...he is not strapped in and is holding a grenade...AND THERE IS NO BLEEPING G FORCE CAUSING ANY ISSUES! The final 'evil guy\good guy' fight is just awful. The 'evil guy' basically runs around saying 'I could kill you but I will continue to spout stupid statements to drag this out until you...and this will be SUCH A SURPRISE...manage to overcome and defeat me because I kept just spouting off at the mouth rather than just killing you!' This is after Matt goes to the armory and rescues the girly and Leukemia ridden daughter(tug my bleeding heartstrings). Now...dig this...3 bad guys are taking over Elysium...there is a big armory with plenty of weapons...AND NO ONE IS COMING TO GRAB THE WEAPONS AND TO STOP THE 3 MAN COUP OF ELYSIUM! DOH!!To call this a craptacular is an insult to crap. This is just big money lazy story writing pushing a phony agenda. And it is just awful",1,411,739,16 August 2013
Con Air," If brainless is your brand you will love it
","I happen to like thinking. Therefore the film does nothing for me.'Con Air' is the zeitgeist of American Hollywood film society circa 1997. There was a time in big budget film when viewers were required to think even a tad little bit to understand what is occurring on screen. Not now. Instead it is 'tell me 100% instead of 'show me.' The screen play writing that must have occurred: 'OK...all the convicts are getting on the plane. We must tell the audience exactly who the characters are. We do this by having the supposedly good cops list off simplistic statements while the convicts go from bus to plane and are superfluously searched by a bigoted guard making statements to bring the characters to life.'Almost every statement that anyone makes in the film shall be a single line of snappy dialog. We will allow for a couple lines to set up the mastermind of the operation. He is a (I can almost quote the film exactly because the dialog is so banal) 'product of the criminal system having lived his whole life in it...a moron who was illiterate when he came in and now has a law degree...and killed like 20 people both in and outside the prison system.' He gets locked in the cage like an animal. He and Hero Nick Cage have a single line of hate with each other to set up that they will not get along.We have the line up introduced. We have the black guy with the do-rag. Of course, why not. We have the mouth inspection and the bad breath comment as a joke for having sex breath. All the while what are basically voice overs with a shot of human body to occupy the screen say things like: 'This one is so bad...(cue the audience to say 'How bad was he?' like Gene Rayburn on Match game episode)...'he did this and that evil thing.' All the while the whole set up going on of loading this plane of prisoners is so incredibly ridiculous in premise that my head was beating itself on the wall. Unless there is a need to have all these incredibly evil men...with one good guy...to be transported by air all at once...so that they can all go to the exact same place...there is no way that this could happen.So...you must believe that people in law enforcement are incredibly stupid. They say and do incredibly stupid things and are very one dimensional. I mean, if you are transporting the 'unholiest of unholies (save one)' then wouldn't the crew already know who is being transported BEFORE the arrival at the airplane? Wouldn't they have a staff meeting to do some prisoner planning and contingency planning? And what about the guy in a cage on an airplane for a few hours? What if he has...oh...an accident of mother nature while in the cage? Would you really want this person escorted to the bathroom on a flying airplane? Wouldn't the ACLU be up in arms about cruel and inhuman punishment?'Suspension of Belief' is something that usually requires a an audience to have suspend belief. Con Air doesn't require that to happen. It gets more and more ridiculous as stupid decision is compounded by stupid decision to make the big explosions and fight scenes occur. If you have no belief to suspend you will love it. Otherwise you will find it painful.",Null,0,1,2 October 2011
Looper," More Clever Stupidity
","There are plenty of reviews on the IMDb website that document the ridiculousness of the time travel paradoxes as explored in Looper. This review will not dwell on those inconsistencies. Instead, there are a couple of scenes that really point out how cleverly stupid this film is.At the end of Looper Bruce Willis has been captured. They know he is dangerous. So what do they do? Put a bag over his head. This works very conveniently to effect Bruce's escape...sort of. Bruce body slams people, whirls his arm backward and snatches a henchman's gun and shoots him dead with one shot. If Bruce had been bound he could not have escaped in this manner. That would have been smart for someone handling a dangerous criminal to do. It is very convenient as always that henchmen are completely stupid.Now...how does he know exactly where to grab to wrest the gun free to shoot the henchman? Did he have X-Ray vision in the back of his head? Because I sure know that I could not have pulled that move off. Then again, I am not Bruce Willis.So...immediately the requisite group of more henchman show up to kill Bruce. What does Bruce do? He grabs the exceptionally conveniently placed super machine guns that just happen to be laying in the room and he mercilessly mows everyone down because Bruce is the only person with the super machine guns with magazines that never empty.After killing everyone Bruce goes to kill the 5 year old Rainmaker. And how...pray tell...does Bruce go about doing this? He has traveled from the future and fought through hell to get to this point slaughtering people along the way. He knows the Rainmaker has 'magic powers.' After all this bloody hell Bruce shows up with...what is essentially...a pea shooter! He just slaughtered 50 people with super machine guns (and also hand grenade bombs) and he is going to kill the magic powered one and he shows up with essentially a 6 chamber handgun (that, in Hollywood fashion, can shoot as many shots as possible).It is so clever it is stupid. Bruce has done all this and he knows the kid is bad news so he shows up and starts shooting from 50 yards away. No attempt to ambush the little kid with magic powers! No attempt to get close to the target before shooting! Nope! This is just more really conveniently illogical writing and film making.So...the Rainmaker kid starts his Exorcist possession routine of making everything float. Now...somehow...while his Mother and Bruce magically float in the air as well as blades of grass...the Rainmaker creates a dust storm to knock down the vehicle at the road running beside the field they are in. Yet...despite the appearance of the tornadic storm...there is NO DUST ANYWHERE! The dust magically disappears and the camera views of everyone and everything are clear as a bell. How bleeping convenient! So...Bruce is shooting...and he is wearing a blood soaked shirt which shows the battle he has been through some mega miles away from the farm. Bruce is in such a hurry to kill the Rainmaker he not only traded all his high tech weaponry for a pea shooter...he didn't bother to get a change of shirt! I don't know about you but when I am wearing a shirt soaked in blood and I have a minimum one hour long drive ahead of me...I'll find a shirt somewhere! So...Bruce grazes the cheek of the Rainmaker which causes the Exorcist effect. Now, the bullet went across the cheek and conveniently opens a cut. During the whole next scene...the cut never bleeds. Oh, Rainmaker has blood caked on and in the vision scene Rainmaker has hopped a railroad car and is nursing a bleeding cheek...but the kids cheek never bleeds at all. Just a minor continuity error.The people who made Looper thought they were so clever constructing this silliness. This film is filled with these cleverness constructs from start to finish. Their cleverness is their downfall. They were so clever they couldn't see the stupidity they were making.",3,3,7,22 October 2013
