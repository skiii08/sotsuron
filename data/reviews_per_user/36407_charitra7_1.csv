It," Most Pathetic Movie ever
","Haven't seen a more worse movie ever. Was there anything to be scared of. huh The horror movie which had everything Romance, Comedy, somewhat thrill but HORROR... Really wondering how its doing so much of business. In the time of The Conjuring, Annabelle, Insidious and stuff hard to believe this movie is doing so well. Wasted my complete 2 hours.",1,4,13,20 September 2017
