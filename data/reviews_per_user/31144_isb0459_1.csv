First Man," The Real Stuff
","I am of that age. I was a 10 year old when my Dad woke me up to watch, along with hundreds of millions of other Earthlings, the live televised broadcast of Neil Armstrong taking the first steps on the Moon. This movie brought back all the wonder and glory, brilliance and sacrifice of the US space program during the 1960s. Yes, the way too shaky, nauseating 'cinema verite' literally forced me to look away just when I wanted most to take in those dramatic expressions and honest, personal moments that made the portrayals of the central characters believable and poignant. Nevertheless, the power and terror of the death defying flight scenes brought home the epic heroism, discipline, courage and fortitude of Neil Armstrong. The Moon landing was outstanding, thrilling but not failing to make it absolutely real that the two astronauts were just seconds away from their doom before touchdown. The Moon walk scene was awe inspiring and emotional, reproducing essential moments but leaving room to experience the stillness and literal otherworldliness of the moment.
See this movie, feel a bit of that extraordinary greatness, literally a unique accomplishment for all time, and be awestruck by the people who achieved it.",9,1,3,2 November 2018
