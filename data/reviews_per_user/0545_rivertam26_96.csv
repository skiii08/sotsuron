The Rock," Explosively entertaining
","Michael Bay's blockbuster action epic began here. Even though Bad Boys came out a year before and was moderately successful. This was the movie that really made his career and even watching over 20 years later it's easy to see why. The movie is fantastically entertaining. Some military dudes that were wronged by the government take some hostages at Alcatraz and demand a whole lot of money from the government for the families of their fallen comrades. Things escalate when they threaten to release a deadly chemical. So they call up scientist fred rookie Nicholas Cage and pair him up with a disheveled but bad ass Sean Connery as the only man whose successfully escaped the rock. The action is brilliant and in true Michael Bay fashion it can be a bit silly at times but overly entertaining. Funny, action packed and edge of your seat with a surprising amount of character depth. The movie also stars Ed Harris, Tony Todd, Claire Forlani, Michael Biehn and David Morse.Budget: $75m

Insidious: Chapter 2," disappointing
","James Wan is hot right now. After establishing himself in The Saw Series and than bludgeoning that franchise into the ground he made a huge return with Insidious establishing that he was great at setting a suspenseful mood enhanced with nightmarish imagery. He solidified those talents with this year's genre masterpiece The Conjuring, the scariest movie I've ever seen and an absolute instant classic. With hopes raised so high it's hard for Insidious Chapter 2 to not be a disappointment. I just never thought it would be this big of a disappointment. Following the events of the original movie we once again find ourselves with the Lambert clan as the mystery is enhanced and unraveled concerning the demonic presence that wanted to get into Josh's body. I really loved the first film. The first half is absolutely terrifying in an expected sort of way but when the plot veers into astral projection it lost a lot of people but not me it was so bizarre and twisted I found myself even more freaked out. People who had a huge problem with the film's second half will have an even harder time with this film because it mostly takes place in that bizarre universe. There are some clever goods here not to spoil anything for those intent on suffering through it. But despite the cleverness it's feels overly gimmicky, a lot of it just doesn't make any sense and the attempts at juvenile humor are only partially funny because of their forced absurdity and not that they are breaking any of the film's tension like in the first film. As for that heavy dread induced atmosphere he has become such a master at. it's not existent here we are instead punished with bouts of forced melodrama, insane campiness and one cheap scare after the next (I mean really this baby walker needs to go). Sadly there are some good ideas here. The only summation I could come up with especially with the vastly superior Conjuring and this film coming out so close together is that he spent all of his time executing that first movie and when approached about a sequel to Insidious he said awesome I have a great idea for that flick and than just kinda lost interest. Too sad because what could have been a unique spin on the haunted movie sub genre has instead become a by the numbers unintentional laugh fest. Not to say it's the worst film I've seen this year or the worst horror sequel (the grudge 2) but it's definitely a franchise killer. **.5/5",5,4,11,12 September 2013
Alien 3," A fitting end to the trilogy
","Alot of people have a problem with this entry especially coming off it's Superior predecessor. But instead of trying to top that film it creates a new experience more in the spirit of the original. The unfortunate Ellen Ripley crash lands on a desolate prison planet, the only survivor after the last films events. There are only a handful of prisoners there with a warden, medical officer and a preacher of sorts. Upon arriving she begins to search for the reason why he crashed and discovers the horrible truth the infamous xenomorph was responsible and has followed her to her location. Once there monstrous extraterrestrial bonds with an ox and than a canine taking a slightly different form. Once again she has to face it down and save as many people as possible. I appreciate the theatrical cut but the extended is where it's all at. For some odd reason they decided to cut all the action out of the film and it makes a huge difference pace wise. The performances from Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton are award worthy. To say that powerful is a definite understatement. The story really rounds itself out perfectly. Bringing a respectable end to Ripley's saga. The practical effects are impressive but the cgi doesn't hold up. All in all the movie is a criminally underrated piece of cinema. Directed stylishly by a young David Fincher it's ambitious in its scope and inspired in its execution.Budget: $50m

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," brilliant
","When I read Breaking Dawn for the first time I loved it. It was shocking and chaotic and I couldn't believe the author could take it in such a bizarrely perverse direction. But in no way did I think any of the novel's real gruesomeness would make it to the screen in the squeaky clean series. Well i'm happy to say that I was so off my game and happily so. Breaking Dawn pt. one is everything you have been hoping for in these adaptations. The characters are fully drawn finally with solid performances to match. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are at their best and Taylor Lautner is finally really good. The film is directed wonderfully by Oscar winner Bill Condon of Dreamgirls and Of Gods and Monsters. The film is always engaging, interesting, funny, clever and even a little terrifying. How this film escaped without an R rating I just don't know the sex scenes are pretty impressive but is nothing compared to the grotesque birthing sequence only briefly outlined in the book but much more effective here. The film is powered by potent melodrama as usual but it's much more effective this time around creating an atmosphere of utter suspense. Now there will no doubt be haters as usual, and maybe even more so because this is such a bizarrely perverse and darkly wonderful film. But it is without a doubt the best of the series and one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd also like to say that Kristen Stewart be commended for her utter dedication to the role. She looks sickly and completely immerses herself in it. It's quite striking with a film too match. Brilliant!",10,10,31,17 November 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best movies of the year!
","I just read this book about two weeks ago. I read it in less than a day. I found it to be heart wrenchingly honest with a fresh approach to mostly standard material. Afterwards I rewatched the trailer which although I thought looked good it felt very different from the book I read. So after a few weeks in limited in finally made its way around to my local theatre. Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Because the film really captures the material while enhancing it with a truly appreciated honesty rarely captured in films of these kinds. The book which featured letters written to an unknown person describes the life of it's main character Charlie loosely based on the author/writer/director himself has been visualized in a somewhat amateur but throughly engaging and unflinchingly honest portrayal of a struggling young man coming of age. The book which dealt with depression, suicide, drug use, abuse, molestation, bullying and a barrage of enhanced emotions are expanded upon and explored in the film. There are moments where I found myself forcing back the tears as my throat felt like it was closing. It's a film most if not all people if they are honest can relate to. Logan Lehrmans lead performance as Charlie is astounding and must be seen it's one of the best of the year. On the downside Emma Watson feels a little forced as Sam and Ezra Miller does a little too much over acting as Patrick. Still the book and movie creates a character in Charlie than we can love and appreciate. The complexities of his emotions and the way he deals with them are visualized in some truly brilliant sequences. The downside besides the supporting performances are the dreadful cinematography the film looks fudgey and way too low budget and a bit of a forced sense of the cool factor. Besides that the film is a truly unique experience and should take it's rightful place as one of the best teen movies ever made and one of the best of the year.",9,2,4,13 October 2012
The Expendables 2," Glorious crap
","A tour-de-force of explosive action and intentional and unintentional laughs. The first film worked as a sort of homage to those ridiculous but highly entertaining action epics of the late 80s' and early 90s'. Being a child of that era raised by TV and movies for the most part lol. It's a very cool thing to see these guys on the big screen and in a surprisingly better film than its predecessor. This entry pretty much delivers everything you wanted the first time around that you didn't get. This time around the expendable crew picks up a new member in the sexy but way younger Liam Hemsworth of the recent blockbuster Hunger Games as a sort of expert military sniper. As the film starts they are on a mission to save a Chinese billionaire and we are thrust into the pit of the action but upon returning home they discover they have another mission and something happens that leaves the group wanting revenge with a new female member in tow the action really starts and gets crazy violent and obscenely graphic. It's amazing that Stallone , Schwarzenegger, Willis , Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme amongst others are pulling off such insanely physical roles, my hat is off to them. They're acting not be so strong but it never really was they have charisma, loads of it. As the somewhat young-ins so to speak Jason Statham, Crews, Cotoure are around some amazingly physical especially Statham who is just amazing and Crews who has some of the funniest scenes. The movie is fun, crazy and surprisingly addictive. The expendables 2 is an explosive, testosterone filled action fest that delivers some amazingly entertaining good. It may be crap but it's glorious crap. 4/5",8,4,11,20 August 2012
Skyfall," A Pleasant Surprise
","I've always liked the James Bond movies but I wouldn't say i was enthusiastic about seeing them. The trailers for Skyfall looked decent and despite the buzz I set my expectations about mid range.I have to tell you I was really blown away. It may be the best of The Bond films and one of the best of the year. Daniel Craig reprises his role as the title character but this time around he looks aged and battered. Gone are his slinky, seductive charm and anew is a more human relatable angle, gritty even. I don't really want to go into Skyfall's surprisingly unique and complex plot line but I'll just say it blew me away. And it all lies in the films superb execution Director Sam Mendes beautifully fuses heightened action sequences, character based drama and good old fashioned espionage suspense into a film that explores age, history and relationships between lovers, friends and mentors to surprising depth that illicits a surprisingly emotional punch. Gone are the the high tech fluidity and garishness of previous entries and it's back to the basics in a form that really works for this franchise. But the great thing about Skyfall besides the outstanding direction, strong performances from Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem is the fact that it feels new altogether. The film starts off with a nicely choreographed but less than stellar and little hammy in my opinion action sequence and morphs into a character drama with some truly unforgettable scenes. One of my favorites concerns Bond being Interrogated by Bardem and he starts to feel him up a little. It's played with a sly homoeroticism that takes the scene to all kinds of new levels as Bond replies 'what makes you think this is my first time'. Also I really loved the cinematography it has the most gorgeous visuals I've seen all year lush colors and settings used to full effect and an abundance of well placed lighting and shadow that echoes films of the past and brings them roaring into the present. Skyfall may be a Bond film but it's a new experience all together there's even a little Home Aloneish nod turned into the films finale which adds to the films overall unexpected effect.",9,1,9,9 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Growing up
","I would like to preface this review by saying I don't know much about the comic books that Iron Man comes from but I do know it serves as an inspiration. Upon exiting the theatre I heard some people complaining that the film differed from the source material and weren't very happy. That being said as someone uninfluenced by those standards I thought the film was great! Director Shane Black of the fantastic and criminally under seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang takes the helm with appreciated results. Jon Favereau fared well the first two creating a grandiose, sarcastic, sassy mouthed but fantastical universe filled with big characters people have loved spending time with. The first one is still the best in my opinion, it lost a little luster in the sequel but this follow up entry brings the franchise into it's smaller, more character driven roots which is much appreciated and changes the overall effect. The film humanizes Tony Stark played by the lovably jerky Robert Downy Jr. as he lashes out at a terrorist and suffers the consequences when he is attacked at home. Most of his equipment is destroyed and his girlfriend Pepper is nearly killed. Presumed dead by the public he moves ahead trying to solve the villains mystery and begin to rebuild his machinery so to speak. There's lots of clever quips and even emotionally resonant add ons. the humor is there for the most part but doesn't feel as funny but the action sequences are truly breathtaking. And there is finally a kick ass character arc for Pepper Potts played with a seductive ferocity by Gwyneth Paltrow. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the original material or even if it makes all that much sense but it is grade A entertainment and most of all it shows that the franchise is growing in a more adult direction a brave act in a slew of constant cinematic immaturity. 3.5/5",7,1,4,2 May 2013
The Ring," A solid remake
","The American remake that launched 100 more American remakes to varying degrees of quality. The truth is if the movie wasn't so damn good it wouldn't have started such a big trend. That being said its really one of the only ones that adapts it's source material quite successfully. It takes the story of an evil girl whose thrown down a well and haunts a cursed video tape. That if you watch it you get a call and only have 7 days to live. It's truly a nightmarish concept that has an urgency that just works. The original Ringu is superior and a brilliant film that is saturated in Japan's religion and mythology. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) adds a domestic spin to the material that doesn't overdo it and just works. I remember going to see this at a preview show weeks before it came out and people freaked during the finale. In fact one grown man ran out of the theater. It's easy to see why the film was such a word of mouth big hit and deservedly so. From the stylish direction to the star making performance from Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) as well as solid work from hunky Martin Henderson (Torque), David Dorfman (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Amber Tamblyn (Grudge 2) and Brian Cox (X2). Unfortunately it was followed up by an overly mediocre sequel and an awful reboot. Hopefully somewhere down the line they'll be able to continue it all successfully. A direct sequel to the first wouldn't be a bad idea.Budget: $48m

Resident Evil: Afterlife," Ultra stylish and fun but hollow
","Paul Anderson (Event Horizon) returns to the franchise he created for the first time since the original. The results are aesthetically astounding but slightly hollow. For the first time in the series it seems as though characters are simply added for a higher body count than having a real purpose. That being said it's a hell of a lot of fun especially if you turn off your brain. There are some truly dynamic scenes, the slow mo shower battle is gorgeous and enthralling. This time around the clones descend upon umbrella and are quickly disposed of and Alice looses her power and becomes human. She searches for Claire and the gang but stumbles upon a new gang at a prison that includes sexy Wentworth Miller (Prison Break) and gorgeous Boris Kodjoe (Addicted). The zombie army rages outside with some new mutations afoot while they try and escape to a supposed safe facility called Arcadia. The movie is fast and fun and ultra stylish. It's a step down story wise from Extinction but it's much prettier.Budget: $60m

Gravity," Cinematic Brilliance
","When I see a truly great movie it leaves me speechless. There's so much going through my mind. Because a great film is one that can't be taken at face value it inspires thought and leaves an imprint on you. At it's surface Gravity is a Hollywood popcorn movie about survival in space during a horrific accident but underneath it and most importantly it is a film about the human experience. From it's wonderfully entrancing opening shot Director Alfonso Cuaron immerses you in the environment of space. It's the closest experience many of us will get to actual space travel. We meet our central characters executing their assigned tasks and goofing off a bit, and than they get an emergency message that debris from a damaged satellite is heading towards them. It strikes with no sound, because there is no sound in space. it's a truly nightmarish sequence that leads to some of the most horrifying moments you've ever seen on screen. The film is a tour de force from beginning to end. A monumental technical achievement, terrifyingly beautiful but what makes this film so successful is in the way the heavy effects that drive the film blend with it's emotional core making for a truly engaging experience. When Sandra Bullock sheds her suit and floats in a fetal position you can feel the subtext of rebirth as well as finding the will to survive and echoes of that in the films conclusion. Gravity is a film about death but it's also a film about life and loss and the will to survive not just in the events that are happening on screen but everything that happens to us on a day to day basis. Director Alfonso Cuaron a master film maker directs the film with an eerie simplicity challenging us with nearly unbearable tension and delving deeper into something truly spiritual. George Clooney leaves a charismatic imprint in a small but important role and the central performance by Sandra Bullock is truly remarkable and quite possibly the best of her dramatic career. She's a definite shoe in for a best performance nod and anyone going against her will have a hard run of it. The movie flows like liquid cinematic poetry covering every inch with cinematic brilliance. Gravity isn't just one of the best films I've ever seen it's an amazing experience. *****/5",10,4,7,4 October 2013
Star Trek," Yes it's that amazing!
","I'm not a sci-fi geek. In fact my favorite sci-fi movie of all time is Serenity and closely following that is Gattaca and 12 Monkeys. I don't count myself as either a fan of Star Trek or Star wars I've enjoyed both franchises but none of them really drove me crazy. I entered Star Trek with high expectations though the trailers were awesome and the reviews have just been astounding. 95% positive last time I checked on Rotten Tomatoes.com. And let me tell I was no where near being disappointed. The film is incredible it's adrenaline fused mind blowing entertainment. Sort or a remake but not really the film follows the early years of the shows famous characters on their first battle mission. And it is exciting. The story is great, the direction from J.J. Abrams is near flawless the casting is exceptional except for a mediocre turn by Eric Bana as Nero. The spfx miraculous. The cinematography fantastic. The score goose bump inducin. And the film is well paced and very exciting. But lets get to the casting first. Chris Pine is handsome I don't think he's hot but his performance is endearing and he completely embraces the raw sexuality and cockiness of Captain Kirk. Zachary Quinto is perfect as Spock especially in the moments when his character breaks through his emotional guard. Zoe Saldana is also really darn good as Ahora I've never much liked or disliked her in other films but she is really at home here. John Cho working his way over from his comedic lead in the Harold and Kumar films is really impressive as Sulu. Simon Pegg is of course wonderful as Scotty although i wish there had been more of him, Anton Yelchin is incredible as Chekov and Karl urban is perfect as Bones. The film is funny and very well directed by J.J. Abrams which fuses tehf ilm with a sense of realism although what your seeing on screen is fictional. There is a fluidity in it and he keeps the emotional connection high so that you can really that whats happening on film is really happening. this movie is quite an experience I really have nothing negative to say about only that I saw it at 9:50 and the last show already went in. So I guess I'll have to wait tiltmrw to check it out again. P.s. there are even some welcome side performances from Ben Cross, Winona Ryder, Leonard Nimoy and Tyler Perry yes that Tyler Perry. Enjoy people this film has set the bar extremely high for summer movies and movies in genneral. The best movie of the year and one of my new favorites!",10,2,10,8 May 2009
This Is the End," Funniest film of the year!
","This movie is funny, like really funny. As I'm sure you know from the trailers it's a bunch of young Hollywood actors playing themselves as they attend a party at James Francos house and suddenly find themselves in the middle of a biblical apocalypse. The movie works so audaciously well because the events happening although outlandish take themselves pretty seriously. So in essence like Shaun of the Dead it's just a bunch of funny actors playing versions of their real selves dealing with it as if it were really going on. The main ones are James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Many other celebrities show up for the festivities like Michael Cera ( a scene stealer), Channing Tatum, Rihanna, Mindy Kailing and so many more. Many jokes are made at their expense and it culminates into a bizarre, wild experience unlike anything you've seen before. A smart script and smarter direction compliment the material and although it feels a bit long especially for a movie of this type you'll find it hard to see something funnier or more clever this year! 4/5",8,7,25,14 June 2013
World War Z," Big Surprise
","I've read WWZ by Max Brooks and wasn't really all that impressed. Still while reading it I visualized a much different film than what appeared in the first trailers for this film. But in it's long journey to the screen there were rumblings of troubled set reports and than a huge release date shift, never a good sign. So it is indeed surprising that the finished product is as solid as it is, not to say it's flawless by any means. The cinematic adaptation works more as an inspiration than a story base. The girth of the novel is still there. It is a world taken over by the undead. But the creatures in this film are of a different sort. Similar to the fast zombies of 28 days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake these are even more aggressive if you can imagine that. Not only do they run but they dive and jump. The movie like it's zombies possesses an urgency that makes the proceedings work fairly well. Moving from one expertly choreographed action set piece to another as it spans the globe. That being said there is some goofiness here an airplane attack although shocking is a bit silly and some of the zombie moments come across a little unintentionally funny. Still the idea of the zombies moving like a virus swarm through the human body and the defense strategy are impressive and do breathe a bit of life into the concept. As for the human characters they are decent if a little generic Brad Pitt does surprisingly well in the lead giving a depth to his character that is much needed. I only wish they would have slowed down more throughout the film to develop a depth to the material a bit more and amped up the soft ending. But after the massive opening weekend there are now talks of a sequel as it was originally planned as a trilogy. which leaves me a hopeful that they will iron out the few kinks. Still what stands is a solid summer film. Very entertaining and breathtakingly intense. 3.5/5",7,3,6,31 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Impressive and powerful
","I was sort of obsessed with this movie when it came out. Watching it years later I still love it but can understand that I was a little infatuated. It's a solid flick and I think what makes it work so well is because of the smaller moments. The film is filled with brilliant performances from Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks and especially Josh Hutchinson. From the flashbacks to the revelations of his character he really nails. Also good are Wes Bentley with the coolest beard ever, Donald Sutherland and a surprisingly complex Alexander Ludwig. It's easy to write off Kato as one note. A hulking, looming privileged character but those moments he gives him towards the end really make a huge difference. Unfortunately the other love interest of sorts Liam Hemsworth is just eye candy. The movie is disturbing and well made but lacks the punch it really needs to drive the desperation and darkness of the material home. The end result is still an inspired piece of filmmaking that pushes its PG13 rating to the max with an independent, artistic flare. The costumes and set design are award worthy and the impact is still powerful",9,3,5,19 February 2020
The Impossible," Harrowing
","What happened in Thailand was truly a nightmare. One that I didn't really think about until I saw this film. The Impossible is a harrowing sometimes too intense emotional journey that although flawed has a truly powerful impact. Naomi Watts in a stellar performance and Ewan McGregor solid as well star as the parents of 3 young boys on vacation in Thailand when the Tsunami hits. The initial impact when the terror happens is daunting to say the least and handled with a suspenseful hand akin to Spielberg's in Jaws. The film that follows that scene is at times emotionally manipulative and frustrating in some spots but the overall effect is successful. What happened there was awful but the fact that this family survived is truly a miracle. Visually the film is gorgeous with tracking shots of the event, slow motion sequences that are breathtaking and lighting that really illuminates the emotions behind the events being depicted. It's a strong film from Director Bayona who made his mark with the brilliant horror film The Orphanage you can see shadings of the genre here with some questionable but intriguing directorial touches. All in all it's a great first film of the year and I really hope it sets a benchmark for the films to come. 4/5",9,4,9,4 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," One of the best movies ever!
","Back in the day Fangoria sent me and my friends to an advance screening of this in NYC. There was hardly anyone there and they actually pulled people in off the street I remember there being this large family there with babies. Despite that inconvenience, the lights went off and the movie began and me and my friends were introduced to one of the best movies of all time. We laughed, screamed and cried and when the lights came up to out delight a handsome Simon Pegg and Nick Frost greeted us when we were leaving and signed some posters. They were truly the nicest guys and the movie still holds up perfectly. It's so funny and witty with great makeup and truly amazing performances.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not even C worthy...
","Pirates 2 is a constipated, mangled,confused sequel of epic proportions. the first one was wonderful but it's an Oscar contender compared to this. I've never seen a film franchise spend time create characters and than destroy the, Everyone in this film seems to be a different person or actually many different people throughout. the story is all messy something to do with davy Jones or a cannibal island or aomething. In the end you feel like you've just survived some natural disaster despite a quirky turn from Knightley that is ruined in the last 5 mins. of the film. The acting is all pretty lame, the movie is pretty lame and stands as an example of why not to make sequels without a valid purpose. It has some moments mixed into it's three hour running time. But moments I can definitely pass on seeing again.",4,3,6,30 July 2006
Argo," Solid if expected
","There's been a lot of big buzz surrounding this movie that it's hard not too be a little disappointed. Let's just say this Ben Affleck is a great director and he always makes solid, interesting films but he has yet to make another film that excels that region into masterpiece territory. Argo although ambitious in it's storytelling and premise is sadly not that film. The film based on a true story focuses on a CIA agent that concocts a plan to free 6 American Hostages from Iran by posing them as members of a film crew. The scenes in Iran are suspenseful and the ones in Hollywood are pretty funny. Performance wise in my opinion Alan Arkin seems to steal the show as a big time Hollywood mogul and Bryan Cranston fleshes out his supporting role nicely. As for the others although it's nice to see Clea Duvall, Rory Cochrane and John Goodman amongst others on screen they aren't really given a lot to do. The Hostages in general are a bit underdeveloped and the film could have even been more suspenseful had a been a bit more engaged by him. As for Ben Affleck doing double duty he's a great director but still not the best actor. Although his skills have improved he would do better to let someone else take the leads in his films with a little more presence. All in all it's a solid film with very interesting subject matter told well if a little bit expected. And another notch in the actor/directors belt after two solid films he adds a third, at this point I'd definitely see anything he directs.",7,2,4,16 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," 100% Grade A entertainment!
","I didn't want to see the 2009 reboot but I did and I absolutely loved it. I don't consider myself a trekkie but I've watched my fair share of Star Trek courtesy of my father and friends. So I consider myself to be somewhat decently versed in the source material. I just thought that first film was just absolutely brilliant and despite all the positive buzz and the incredible trailers and TV spots I was pretty sure it just wouldn't be able to, well I'm happy to say I was wrong. Cause Star Trek Into Darkness is a complete blast the best summer movie in years. Smart, addictively engaging, funny, action packed and emotionally resonant. I'm not gonna run down the plot for you but those familiar with the original films are in for some surprises. J.J. Abrams once again adds an intense visual zest with a pacing that just doesn't quit. The film like the first is an absolute roller coaster ride. And it does what good sequels should it expands lightly on the original films mythology and as well as adding new welcome additions and deepens the characters and their relationships. I can't imagine him not doing more of these films especially since they are so perfectly casted and he just executes them so well. Hopefully he will stay in this galaxy instead of taking over another franchise . Because he's stumbled onto real cinematic magic here. Star Trek Into Darkness is 100% grade A entertainment and one of the best films of the year and one of the best summer movies ever! 4.5/5",9,4,13,15 May 2013
Ted," Haven't we seen this movie before?
","I'm not sure what I was expecting walking into Ted. I found the restricted trailer to be funny and creative and I do enjoy Family Guy every now and than but something in the back of my mind just kept saying eh, are you really sure you wanna see this? Well I should have followed my instincts because despite some inspired moments Ted is just that eh, it was okay. The film centers on a friendless young boy who makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life. And well it does. 27 yrs. later the young boy has grown into Mark Wahlberg and has a girlfriend and well Ted has grown as well into a pot smoking, foul mouthed, crude best friend that hardly ever leaves it side. The whole fairy tale thing taken to a realistic place is inspired and could have been very funny. Instead don't be fooled this is one of those films where the main character is a big child and has to grow up before his girlfriend leaves him. Ugh, not again. Surprisingly enough it's in it's dramatic scenes when the film is most effective sure there are a few inspired comedy bits the hotel fight was great but most of the jokes fall completely flat. Like the whole flash Gordon reference, a prostitute who defecates on the living room floors and Ted having sex with a turnip and the checkout girl. In fact although I'm not easily offended I couldn't help but be by some of the irresponsible humor in this film. The whole gay underground beat up subplot was insulting and unhelpful to the struggling gay community and some of the jokes just go to far like this whole father and son creep acting just comes off disturbing. That being said I have to give credit where it's due and Mark Wahlberg is a hell of an actor he completely commits himself to whatever role he's playing, Mila Kunis is likable and beautiful as his love interest and the CGI Ted is quite impressive. Never once did I feel like it wasn't real when watching the film even though I was continuously rolling my eyes. So all in all Ted is just another crude, forgettable comedy with a creative spin on it's premise yes but the same old man child movie we've been watching for years. Also I hate that they insulted Superman Returns I loved that film and unlike this one that was critically acclaimed.",4,1,6,15 July 2012
Spice World," Not for everyone but fun for a select audience
","There's no way around this is in fact a pretty awful movie. That being said it can also be a bit of fun for the right audience. The movie is a spoof of itself taking the Spinal Tap approach. It's nonsensical and works more as an advertisement for the soundtrack which is kind of successful. There are spies, aliens, insidious gossip columned and more ad the girls play vigoursly into there set stereotypes trying to make us believe they have been friends since they were kids. Most of it doesn't work but there are some funny and clever bits and the movie is surprisingly feminist and not as annoying as it should be. You'll know if your it's audience as soon as it begins. All in all it's an extremely guilty pleasure that I mostly enjoyed.Budget: $25m

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," is this rating a joke?
","This movie was pretty awful with the exception of a few moments from Jackman and Reynolds in the opening sequence. Not as terrible as Daredevil but the worst of the series without a doubt. The origin story seems lame and kinda screwed up and I'm not really sure how close to the actual comic origin it is. not that it matters much what is on screen is silly. And the bad performances are just as bad as the lame charachterizations and ridiculous dialogue. take for instance Jackman's terrible love interest, the blob, Wil.i.am is this a joke and the much wasted character of Gambit which is lamely portrayed but some decent looking morn with a fluttering cajun accident. Add in generic action sequences and not very good spfx. And you have Wolverine. Enjoy.",3,15,39,2 May 2009
Orphan," Stylish, unique and intense
","You either love it or you hate it. That's really the effect of any great twist. I was one of those who absolutely loved it and found this creepy, disturbing movie even more terrifying with the reveal. Vera Farmiga (Conjuring) stars as a mother whose just gone through a miscarriage and with her husband played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key) decides to adopt a mysterious young girl played by a very creepy Isabel Fuhrman (Hunger Games). At first Esther seems a little off but it's mostly acceptable until people begin having horrific accidents and some go missing. There is a palpable sense of dread that builds throughout the film and so many setpieces are expertly executed. The scene in the playground is an especially effective one. The film culminates in a surprising and edge of your seat fashion and all though there's a small loop hole here and there. Its completely successful at being a stylish, unique, intense piece of genre.4/5",8,2,2,3 March 2020
Resident Evil: Extinction," The Mad Max chapter of the RE franchise
","Directed by Russell Mulcahy of the criminally underseen awesome creature feature Razorback. I've always really loved this chapter. Maybe its because it has that epic Mad Max feel mixed with the telekinesis of Friday the 13th 7 and although it can be a little silly it takes the franchises back to it's scarier roots with homages to the birds and day of the dead. This time around Alice is still on the run from the Umbrella corporation and the world has become a desert wasteland. She stumbles upon some old friends and some newbies like a teen girl named Kmart, the singer Ashanti playing a nurse and a bad ass Ali Larter as Claire Redfield from the games. This one is the goriest of the first three and features some great old fashioned practical effects. The movie is fun, scary and action packed leading up to a bad ass finale and one hell of a cliffhanger.Budget: $45m

Fast & Furious 6," More Furious than ever!
","I don't think there has ever been a franchise in which the sixth entry has been it's best. I also don't think there has ever been a franchise where it really started getting good with the fourth. But here it is Furious 6 is one of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen. I won't lie and say that the series isn't a pure unadulterated guilty pleasure but make no mistake there is quality here. Director Justin Lin seems to be a master of orchestrating grand action set pieces, family melodrama thats actually engaging and a group of actors that let's face it are coasting on pure charisma and presence in these films at least. It's also surprising to see a franchise whose numbers have grown critically with each installment reaching an all time high with almost 80% positive on rotten tomatoes. And it's completely deserving. Picking up where the super entertaining Fast Five left off we find out automotive heroes enjoying their riches when Hobbs played by the king of likable himself the Rock tracks down Toretto (Diesel) for help with a very attractive international terrorist played by sexy Luke Evans the twist that was displayed in the last film is played as he tells him that the supposedly dead Letty played by Micelle Rodriguez with fierce sneer is alive and kicking. He of course immediately gathers up the gang and they go after her. What unfolds is a bit ridiculous which should be expected but it's also explosive. From the film's twists to the utter charm oozing off these actors to the one of a kind testosterone fueled adrenaline pumping action sequences this is one hell of a ride. There's even a few big surprises especially towards the end. With this entry they prove the formula isn't a fluke and I look forward to loads of more vehicular carnage for years to come. Gone are odd character moments and insipid car themed dialogue and what's replaced them is something you shouldn't feel guilty about loving cause it's awesome! 4.5/5",9,1,2,27 May 2013
The Expendables," Explosive carnage fest!
","Being a child of the 80's and early 90's I was a big fan of the kind of action film this movie is throwing itself back to. You know the ones with giant action stars that we had posters and action figures of. The kind of films with senseless violence where everyone in the background of all the action scenes got killed. Te ones with nifty one liners where you never took the plot too seriously but relished the kill scenes because they were amazingly over the top. Like body slams with bone breaking and decapitations. Now looking back on it they were pretty much like slasher flicks but on different level of course. I'm a huge fan of the films that came out in my youth and they made me into the fan I am today. Of course my tastes have progressed but I still love a balls out carnage fest and thats exactly what the expendables. forget the plot, the acting or even the surprisingly funny screenplay. Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, some wrestlers and hell even Crews. The Expendables is a gory, 100% American action fest. When the film stops to build any type of type of actual story it begins to stall a little but it's a good thing there is some much action and explosiveness at that. Decapitations, knife fights, giant guns, missiles, diving from fire, planes and building blowing, two giant guys demolishing each other, martial arts, one liners and if thats not enough Eric Roberts as a slimy villain it's all good fun and done with a winking eye. It's a hell of ride with more substance than you'd expect and surprising amount of good chemistry between its stars. Good stuff!",7,3,6,18 August 2012
Life of Pi," Fails to connect
","Acclaimed director Ang Lee has taken the supposedly unfilmable book and turned it into an overlong, technically brilliant mixed bag. Centering on a young boy who finds himself stranded on a boat with a Bengal tiger after a ferocious storm sinks the ship he was on. There is about 40 minutes before leading up to those vents where we meet the main character and his family. I got the themes of truth vs. fiction, coming of age in the face of tragedy and the symbolism of an animalistic nature, but i can't say that I got anything to deep or profound from this film. And there are many reasons I believe I didn't but here let's start with the good. The movie is technically brilliant. The effects are truly sensational especially the animal design. it's truly captivating to say the least and the movie also has some inspired whimsical cinematography. Now for the not so good I found myself unimpressed with the films human performances especially the central one. It's not that he was bad but he failed to engage especially in the face of such incredible events it just didn't feel emotionally resonant and engaging like it should have and part of that lies in the direction which I'd like to say was solid for the most par. But here's the thing once you discover what this film is about it kind of is unfilmable. It's something that works much better on the page. Because as a film it just doesn't mesh well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone thinking of seeing it. but if you're expecting to be inspired and feel as though there is a strong profound message that will mirror something in your life, you're going to be disappointed. The film is just what it is and nothing more in my opinion at least. It moves along ploddingly and although it has genuine moments of cinematic inspiration it fails to really connect on a level that counts and after a while it all feels like you are the one barely surviving.",5,5,20,25 November 2012
Pacific Rim," Exciting
","If giant robots against humongous creatures sounds like a movie for you. Than this is it, your not gonna find one that's better. As a fan of that genre and director Guillermo Del Toro I can say that you won't be disappointed. That being said the film does leave a little to be desired. It centers on pilots called Jaegars who are used to pilot the giant robot suits, two to a machine. To do so they must do something called drifting enabling them to tap into each others psyches so they can power the machine together one for the right and one for the left. it's an intriguing concept solidly executed but a little underdeveloped. Although it's a whole lot of fun and surprisingly more character driven than you'd expect. The character arcs don't reach the heights that you would hope for. And the finale feels a bit rushed and not as developed as you'd hope. Still the fight scenes are phenomenal and the movie is tailor made for IMAX 3D more so than any other film recently. Besides the exciting creatures and striking visuals there are an allotment of very attractive guys piloting this film Charlie Hunnam(sons of Anarchy), Diego Klattenhoff(TV's Homeland), Idris Elba (Obsessed), Charlie Day (It's always sunny in philadelphia), Max Martini (Revenge) and the delectable Robert Kazinski (True Blood Season 6) all looking very nice in Imax 3D.And as the sole female character Rinko Kikuchi(Babel) more than holds her own and her storyline is the most engaging of the characters. There's a fare bit of cheese mixed into the proceedings as well as an expected lot of typical genre clichés but Pacific Rim is a thrilling, original sci-fi, action film that needs to be seen on the big screen! 4/5",8,1,9,15 July 2013
Predator," A macho masterpiece
","I really do like this film. It's taken me a while to have a better appreciation for it. I remember seeing it with Aliens on a double feature when I was 7. Aliens scared the crap out of me but i don't remember how I reacted to this film. For most of my young life macho stuff was pretty much thrusted down my throat by my father. It wasn't until later in life that I began to find an appreciation for it. Being an out gay man i can certainly appreciate how hunky Schwarzenegger and crew are but it's more than that. I love the brute force of this movie and how raw it is. It's big, it's dumb and it's silly and most of all it's unapologetic. The practical FX and gore are beyond amazing. The plot is pretty much a throwaway. It's pretty much our beast versus a beast from the stars. And on those simplistic limits it delivers a hell of a time.Budget: $18m

Man of Steel," disappointment
","I love Superman. He is my favorite character of all the DC and Marvel line up. He's virtuos, brave and loyal an outsider who puts others before himself with a high moral standpoint and a strong defense, he only uses when it's absolutely necessary. That being said I don't know much about the comics or history and wasn't a huge fan of the original movies although I did really like the first one. The one that I loved was Bryan Singer's now all of a sudden frowned upon reboot. Superman played by the perfectly casted Brandon Routh was heartbreakingly beautiful not just in his physicality but in his delicateness. Never before had his and Lois's relationship felt more prevalent or his connection to humanity felt more real. There was a real sense of awe and wonder in that film. Most people had an issue with that film because of the lack of action but most importantly the story was there and a real depth of emotional resonance. So with that I am sad to say that Man of Steel was such a huge disappointment to me. I didn't have the highest of hopes despite some amazing trailers the buzz began to come back very mediocre (not that you should always listen to it) and with the presence of a once promising Zack Snyder directing after many failed experiments( Sucker Punch, questionably Watchmen and even the visually strunning but ultimately souless 300. To this day his best film is still the Dawn f the Dead remake) I had my doubts. And it's kind of the same scenario here although not as huge of a misstep as sucker punch, Man of Steel lacks any real depth or story continuity. It feels rushed and forced with a ton of unnecessary action sequences and just not enough of anything that really counts to back any of it up. This is not the Superman that Christopher Reeve or Brandon Routh played. This version wants to be darker but ultimately comes off a bit too goffy with a frat boy sort of edge and a huge emotional imbalance. It doesn't help that the lead character is played by an actor that spends all of his time working out and none of it in the acting classes he should be taking. Not to say he was dreadful it's definitely a step up from his unintentionally funny turn in The Immortals, and he does have a few silent moments that felt just a little endearing. As for one of my favorite actresses Amy Adams as Lois Lane, she's not developed enough to be much of anything. Sure she's a bit feistier in this version and not much of a damsel but since there's no real emoitonal girth to any of it, it's hard to make any real relatable connection to their characters or their material. And they have zero chemistry. The wonderful Michael Shannon(so amazing in Take Shelter) hams it up as General Zod with some questionable performance choices as does Diane Lane as Superman's earth Mom. The only two people that stand mostly uneffected by the material except for a few goofy scenes are Russell Crowe as his real father and Kevin Costner as his earth father(the tornado scene aside). Oh and let's not forget the always dependable Chris Meloni as well. Despite an amazing setup the film slowly begins to fall apart into silliness from one shirtless Henry Cavill scene to the next. Everything thing feels rushed and none of it feel as engaging as it should be. The special effects seem to be the star here and they are impressive especially in Imax 3D, this is the first time Snyder had worked with a budget of this magnitude and he does have a bit of fun with it. As for the action scenes, they are cool but begin to get very repetitive and confusing. I can see that he was trying to do something new with all of it but it doesn't seem to translate as well as he hoped. And that really is the ultimate summation of this film. It's a decent effort but the direction is the real problem here it's ultimately to weak which leaves Man of Steel feeling joyless with no sense of wonder or emotional pull and just a tad bit dull. 2.5/5 LikeCommentShare",5,1,2,31 July 2013
Armageddon," A cinematic dud
","I wasn't a fan of this when it came out although I was in my pretentious non mainstream phase. Revisiting it I have discovered that my first thoughts on it weren't far off. Despite an exciting and engaging beginning the movie soon becomes a blend of amateur melodrama, bad writing, cliches and hammy performances. I'm sure everyone has seen this by now but just in case it's about a group of miners who are sent up to space to blow up an asteroid before it wipes out earth. Although Liv Tyler eventually became a good actress her performance here leaves something to be desired. There's no chemistry between anyone but it's all quite goofy and messy. I'm actually a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer I enjoy his balls to the walls aesthetic when it comes to making movies but the film is an absolute dud. The only bright spot is a hunky Ben Affleck.5/10",5,0,0,18 June 2020
Hugo," cinematic marvel
","All the things you've heard about this film. Magical, whimsical, brilliantly imaginative, one of the best films of the year, are all true. Like the best family films Hugo can be both sad and a little creepy at certain times but it's also smart, funny and just plain sweet a film for lovers of film young and old. It centers on a young boy whose father passes away and lives in a train station tuning clocks and collecting parts to finish his father's last project in hopes of learning why his father is deceased. But more than that it explores how powerful the art of film is and how if you're open to it can inspire you in all of life's aspects and mysteries.As a fellow film lover myself i found myself blown away by the passion Martin Scorcesse displays on screen with the help of a talented cast and wonderful cinematography Hugo is truly cinematic marvel.",8,3,4,19 September 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," The best film of the year!
","David Mamet blew me away with The Fighter. What looked like a generic sports drama from the trailers was really an intricate, overly entertaining, emotionally resonant character piece. I'm not sure how this came across in the trailers to me but there is no way it came across as brilliant there as the actual film is. Silver Linings like the fighter is an intricate character piece but even more evolved that film. It tackles complex, off the wall characters and story elements and combines them into a wonderfully unpredictable and emotionally endearing grade A cinematic stew. The film tells the story of a man named Pat (Cooper) who after an 8 month stint in a mental institution is released under his mothers care. You see he had a break because he found his wife cheating on him and was suffering from an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Along comes Tiffany (Lawrence) a young woman who has just lost her husband and is living with a variety of personality disorders. They meet a rom com storyline forms but doesn't move in the way you'd expect. This is a film about damaged, imperfect people. People everyone of us can relate to if we are honest. There are scenes of such emotional vigor and astonishing rawness it's hard to tell you're even watching something that has been orchestrated. Bradley Cooper sheds his Hollywood image and opts for an intensely brave and personal performance. Jennifer Lawrence shows up reminding us why she was nominated for an Oscar for Winter's Bone. Her character Tiffany is so fully realized through her performance it's hard to put in words. It's so real and unhinged it hurts to watch. Robert DeBiro stars as Pat's father in his best performance in years he displays the emotional complexities of his character his slight OCD, the longing for a relationship with his son and the fear he feels about it. Jackie Weaver is also really amazing as Pat's Mom so maternal and not in a scary way like her other mesmerizing performance in Animal Kingdom. Chris Tucker even shows up for some light hearted fun, some of his best work ever. Also I would love to spotlight the inspired cinematography the constant tracking shots really freshened up the events and kept things feeling new. The thing about this film is that it's not perfect. But it's about those imperfections who make us who we are and form the relationships and experiences we have. It's an honest, funny, hilarious, endearing and memorable film. The best I've seen this year and one of the best ever! *****/5",10,3,12,28 November 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Best movie of the year so far!
","I don't know what people went in expecting. But my expectations were above average and I got more than I had hoped for. it's not a perfect film by any means but delivers on what the title promises. it's a fun, gory, silly fantasy horror flick. The film centers on the classic story of Hansel and Gretel and picks up after that tale as they are now a brother and sister team of bad ass witch hunters. They are hired by a town because children have been taken and come upon a devilish plot that is surprisingly unique. I'm not sure what all the bad buzz is about there is a fare amount of development for a film of this kind. And most of all it's just fun. It's a quick flick at 88 mins. So it doesn't over stay it's welcomes Jeremy Renner and Gemma Armeton (better than she's ever been) have a decent amount of chemistry and deliver raunchy but fun dialogue with a sarcastic pizazz. Famke Janseen hams it up as the grand witch in her best role in a while, The fight scenes are well choreographed and the direction is promising from Tommy Wirkola of the awesomely fun Dead Snow. Sure it could have been a bit more fleshed out and there is a bit too much reliance on the f bomb as a joke but it works. Most of all the film possesses a dark kinetic energy that doesn't shy away from the gooey dark stuff which is really commendable from a major studio considering how much genre films have become annoyingly censored. All in all a great time and leaves it open for sequels of which I hope they will make. 3.5/5",7,20,41,27 January 2013
Step Up 2: The Streets," Best of the series
","Some time ago I was a huge fan of this franchise. It all started with this sequel because I thought the first was a little lackluster aside from a mega hot Channing Tatum. Well he's topped here in my opinion by a gorgeous and very talented Robert Hoffman and a sexy and fierce Brianna Evigan (Sorority Row). This time around we are introduced to a competition called the street in which a group of MSA students gather to become a crew and compete. The politics are expected but effective and the dance sequences are electrifying. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a guilty pleasure filled with melodrama but it's the best of the series, overly entertaining and filled with some diverse, colorful characters.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Just above average spider man
","You would think someone named Mark Webb would be a shoe in to direct a movie version of Spider man with that name. You would also think a movie entitled the amazing spider man would be in in fact an amazing take on the material. On both of these accounts you'd be wrong. Not to say the film doesn't have moments and is generally entertaining but for the most part it's kind of a mess. This time around the take on Peter Parker is a more realistic one. He's a little annoying, a little selfish, a lot more sarcastic so your normal teenager. The events in the film transpire accordingly with the bite of the spider and the death of his parents and than Uncle. But the film unravels in an interesting way making the material seem fresh and mostly unvisited. What the film gets wrong mostly lies in it's direction. Despite a few stabs at the darker side of things this seems like spidey light. It's very comical, with lots of jokes and a sort of disneyish generic atmosphere. Which is all fine and dandy but the film just doesn't mesh well. It moves sloppily back and forth beneath genres and subplots without building a realistic engagement to the events depicted. The good lies in the films interesting and inspired casting choices Andrew Garfield is geekyily gorgeous in the lead and although his character is somewhat angsty he manages to make him likable and is truly gifted at being emotionally resonant. Emma Stone is cute but unnecessary as his love interest and even though the 2 share winning chemistry their relationship isn't allowed time to develop appropriately and seems a little forced. Sally Field also adds some solid support as Aunt May. The film sports nice special effects but the 3D is just so so. A better take on the material would have been a darker one such as as the dark knight is to Batman franchise. I do think they made the right decision in rebooting the material as the last installment in the previous franchise had worn out it's welcome. As Spider Man films go this one falls into being the second best. However, it should be noted that although I enjoyed the original film immensely I wasn't a big fan of the others. There's a lot to enjoy here and I would welcome another installment but I do hope Marc Webb is not a part of it as well as the screenwriters that penned this installment. Although a piece of passable Hollywood blockbuster entertainment the film admirably works better on it's human levels which is a great feat to accomplish. That being said the film ends up being a just above average spider man than an amazing one.",6,1,6,3 July 2012
No Strings Attached," Dear Ms. Portman
","Dear Ms. Portman,I just wanted to say congratulations on your pregnancy, engagement and you awards for your brilliant performance in Black Swan. So to be leading up to an Oscar nomination and probable win no doubt. Your life really seems to be on a upswing professionally and personally. So not that I am anyone at all but as a big movie fan I'm here with some movie advice. I recently just saw your newest film No Strings Attached which hit no. one this weekend, another congrats. Unfortunately I must tell you it was pretty bad and I'm shocked that you stooped to such confused, sordid material and with a half assed performance that was without a doubt the worst of your career. And that is truly saying something because your performance was okay, pretty generic because you've had such an accomplished career thus far. My advice would be stay away from such cinematic turkeys as this. Yes your role was completely underwritten and your character had little to no reasoning of why she acted the way she did but despite that the humor came across as crude and vulgar and the movie felt so unnecessarily long and not long enough at the same time as it came to it's ridiculous and confusing unending. In fact I would like to say in fact that the best part of the movie was surprisingly Ashton Kutcher that found a way to show some actual range with his performance. Maybe there is hope for him yet if he could just escape the horrible type casting. Sure the film had moments and you certainly elevated that dinner scene with Kevin Kline but only momentarily. Now I'm not saying you were the worst part of the film at all that was the actual film and running a close second was a supporting role by Ludicrous. And I'm certainly not trying to be insulting but as an avid fan I'm just suggesting you stick with better material and make the films you've always made respectably and no pander down to such trite, nonsensical, unmemorable and excuse if this is harsh dumb garbage. Not saying this the worst film I've ever seen in fact it's far from it but that's precisely the category it lands in and everyone associated with this should know better. For now a slap on the hand but next time I will start to loose faith. I'm crossing my fingers for Thor.**/5Sincerely,Richard Cavellero",4,12,23,23 January 2011
Resident Evil," cool, slick, action packed and scary
","Resident Evil is one of the biggest if not the biggest video game franchise ever and rightly so. The games are intelligent, action packed and scary as hell. Taking the first game and sort of making a prequel/sequel to it with this film Paul W.S. Anderson of the 1995's visual spectacle Mortal Kombat executes the right formula with his adaptation. By setting it in a sort of alternate universe he manages to keep an heir of unpredictability. We open the film with a viral attack on a huge underground laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation. Soon after that we meet Alice the films lead heroine who is suffering from memory loss played by Milla Jovovich with a exceptionally physical cool factor. A studly mystery man named Matt played by hunky Eric Mabius and soon after a security team featuring a very young and quite annoying Michelle Rodriguez. They of course go into the hive where they encounter many biological and digital terors such as an evil computer program, mutant creatures and loads and loads of zombies. What make this film work so well is the way it's paced it feels like a video game and you feel like your playing. As the film opens into its later segments and you learn more about the main character and the storyline you seem to be one upping levels it's an intriguing experience and a brilliant approach. Sure there's a little goofiness afoot and some of the FX are unimpressive especially by the standards now as well as being slightly repetitive at times. But Resident Evil is the best adaptation of a game it's cool, slick, action packed and scary!",9,0,1,22 August 2012
The Fault in Our Stars," Extended version is quite powerful
","I haven't seen this since theaters just because it was so emotional I wanted to spare myself. This review is for the extended version which is actually just a touch better because like the book it's not afraid to show a little bit more truth of the situation. This teen weeper is about a young woman named Hazel played by an always strong Shailene Woodley (The Descendants) whose had cancer since she was young. She tries to deal with stuff as realistically as possible even when she meets hunky, swoon worthy Gus played by charming Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver) in a star making performance. They have great chemistry and he pushes her boundaries giving her somewhat of a new lease on life. Initially I was more moved by the parents story and their amazing performances by Laura Dern (Jurassic Park) and Sam Trammel ( True Blood). I still felt like that was very strong but with the extra footage I was really enamored with the central relationship. Although I'm 40 I really felt their story and was even more affected by it's tragic outcome. Funny, sad and powerful Fault is one of the best weepers of all time.Budget: $12m

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Much better than I expected
","I liked the LOTR films but I wouldn't say I was a fan. I've only watched the first and the third entry more than once and haven't read any of the books or even spent any time trying to learn more about the characters or the world it takes place in. All of that being said my expectations weren't very high for this film. It just seems like a way to cash on the original trilogies success. My opinion of prequels is that even the story was all that great they would have told it the first time around. Well I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised The Hobbit feels like it takes place in the same universe, which it does but it's an all new experience altogether. I found it a little difficult to follow the storyline but I really did enjoy the film. Here are the positives the film is well paced and shot beautifully. The spfx are top notch, Smegal has never looked so terrifying and awe inspiring and the characters although not as developed as the ones in the other films are interesting and engaging enough in that you want to know more about their story. As for the negatives the film isn't nearly as engaging as the first or third LOTR film of which it will be compared. The characters and storyline aren't developed enough to be fully engaged and the film feels anticlimactic as they have decided to divide it into three films. The film also has awkward lapses into unnecessary humor that just feel out of place and their is some questionable directorial touches that veer on the cheesy. All in all it's a solid film with promise of other films that will only heighten this ones overall effect. Kudos to Peter Jackson for pulling off a prequel that feels fresh instead a dull retread of the same. ***.5/5",7,3,8,26 December 2012
28 Days Later...," It's definitely a horror movie
","Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) still refuses to call this a horror film and went with eco thriller amongst others. But the rest of us know one when we see one and this film is a big one. Sexy and nude Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) stars as Jim a young man whom awakes out of a coma after a pandemic and discovers that most of the survivors left are infected with a rage virus which drives them crazy and drives them to attack and infect others. The plot is quite similar to so many. Mostly like every zombie movie ever made. Along the way he meets some survivors which include a truly bad ass Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Carribean 2&3) and they try and find help. A radio broadcast leads them to a group of soldiers with questionable intentions. There's nothing really new here plot wise but the execution is creatively stunning. The grainy, sort if found footage style easily immerses you into the events on screen and it's both terrifying and addictive. The movie is also emotionally effective because the characters and their plight are well developed. Despite the director's intentions the horror community has claimed the film as one of our own and it's undoubtedly worth celebrating.Budget: $5m

2012," kinda awful but fun
","Make no mistake about this film it is a gargantually...retarted movie. It may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in fact but I still managed to have a pretty good time. I know many of you will be saying well what did you expect it's from the director of Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Stargate, 10,000 BC, The Patriot and Universal Soldier. All for which I can say I enjoyed some much more than others. To me his films have always been fine tuned popcorn machines. The truth about 2012 is it's kind of a mess and I don't think he's ever really made a bad movie, this is a bad movie. If your not getting the jist of what I'm trying to say let's put it this way for those of you who had problems with XXX being unrealistic beware. Because this is the most jaw droppingly silly film ever made. What's it about? Basically the prophecy of world apocalypse from the Mayan civilization brutally ripped apart and dumbed down by the Hollywood machine. You don't care about any of the characters well except for Jimi Mistry, oddly enough. The acting is mediocre(John Cusack) to horrendous (Amanda Peet) and there are just some really weird ones thrown in (Woody Harrelson). The visual effects are striking at times and really cheestastic at others. The green screen is so majorly overused too much in this film. What the film does have to offer is an admirable devotion to its stupidity which makes the proceedings at times to be so extremely entertaining. In fact for most of the film I was pretty much on board. The LA scene outlined in the trailer and TV spots isn't really suspenseful but it's shockingly fun. But in it's ponderous last 40 mins it lost me mainly with an unintentionally laughable moment with a stereotypical Russian thug and a flying kid. And it's a moment that will be remembered forever. It's in that moment that I realized that nothing can really, truly redeem this film from it's obsurdity and length. So with that I say that I'm happy that I saw it and may peek again on DVD just for a few scenes but another full viewing the future does not hold. All in all not the disturbing impact you'd effect but if anything discourages any realistic fear aligned with prophecy altogether.",5,1,3,13 November 2009
The Mist," brilliant
","THE MIST THE MIST: Dimension/Mgm/Ua 2007 color 122 mins. Horror-Thriller Thomas Jane, Jeanne Tripplehorn, William Sadler, Laurie Holden, Alexa Davalos, Sam Whitwer and Nathan Gamble star. Written By Stephen King Directed by Frank Darabont Rated R for strong language, violence and gore.What to say about The Mist hmmmm... Well I hated 1408 the last King adaptation and I liked Shawshank but didn't think much of the Green Mile both directed by Darabont. I'm definitely a Thomas Jane fan I had a huge crush on him in Deep Blue Sea and Laurie Holden of Silent Hill and Alexa Davalos of Chronicles of Riddick kick major ass. But that first trailer was so lackluster it looked like a bad TV movie and than came the second one and it was more enticing. The fantastic reviews starting popping up calling it one of the best films of the year and such so I started to get a bit more excited. But had to remember that 1408 got good reviews as well and I hated that. So I went into The Mist with decent expectations hoping it wouldn't be like The Fog remake. It wasn't. The Mist is one of the most hardcore, intense horror films I've ever seen it's also the best film of the year and one of the best films I've ever seen. The Plot setup is simple and can be seen in the trailer. A storm comes and people race to the local foodmart to pick up supplies just in case there is another. They become surrounded in the mist and must fend off creatures that live within it. Creatures that range from giant mosquitos to giant acid spewing spiders and leech like tentacles amongst others. This is a monster movie people. The most realistic monster movie ever made. And it will make you shake. it's scary, disturbing, emotional and thought provoking. I'm not sure what to make of the film's finale. I have only to say that it affected me on a deeply profound level rising the film above sheer entertainment value and making it a piece of art. The acting is fantastic especially from Thomas Jane whom gives a surprisingly emotional performance, the minor characters are also quite involving and do more than hold there own. With special kudos given to Tripplehorn as the person you will most hate in any movie ever. Gamble as Jane's son and Laurie Holden who does an awesome job as a new addition to the town. The film is layered with twists and subtexts. The cinematography is richly direct, realistic and dreamlike at the same time and the direction is artistic and comendable and the screenplay is powerful. Only the spfx seems lightly flawed but are easily forgiven by the film's incredible execution. The Mist has many things to say and I couldn't quite take all of them in but it's the type of film that you have to keep seeing and discussing because it's not one to be dismissed lightly surprising for a monster movie, huh. The best film of the year, The Mist is brilliant.*****/5",10,3,8,22 November 2007
The Bourne Legacy," The best of the series sort of...
","I just rewatched well most of the Bourne movies(it was like 2.5 because I didn't have the time lol) this week to prep for this reboot installment. And I was glad I did I forgot how great they were. They were a smart mans action movie and felt raw and realistic in part due to Matt Damon's intentionally stiff, sort of cold, bad ass performance. The only thing that didn't play well was how slightly redundant the movies became after a while the second installment was way overlong and since his love interest is killed off in the beginning it definitely takes something away from the proceedings they felt darker and not as fun as when Marie was around but by the end of the film he began to get in touch with himself which was nice to see in a subtle character building scene. Entering into the Bourne Legacy I think it's important to have an open mind. This is a completely different movie. It centers on Aaron Cross aka no. 5 he's a sort of super soldier engineered by the government but after the events of the first two movies and during the events of the third his story unravels as the government begins killing off it's 'experiments'. As you can guess he escapes and makes his way to the doctor he met with for his dwindling meds that keep him strong physically as well as mentally. Chaos of course ensues he meets up with the doctor aka his new love interest played well enough by Rachael Weisz and they do a little globe trotting as they are pursued. It all seems fairly generic but the movie has an almost amateur, visual pizazz to it. The film feels a little clumsy and it definitely works in it's favor in my opinion, the action feels more real and not as stagey and the last motorycyle setpiece chase scene takes the genre to new heights it's kinetically electrifying I was literally on the edge of my seat and even yelled out a few parts. It's a fun flick. As for Jeremy Renner well he's no Matt damon which is a good thing because they are two different characters and his take on Alex Cross is more emotionally engaging which makes for a nice change and his relationship with Weisz although a slight bit forced feels solid. The movie smartly starts off with a scene of him emerging form ice cold waters scantily clad echoing the scene that started the franchise. And when he emerges I had already fallen in love, he's so sexy in this film and I'm sure this will really start his career as a leading man/box office draw he's enaging, masculine but emotional and he nails the fight choreography aggressively. All in all it's not a perfect film there are some questionable moments but overall I don't think you can compare this film to the first three it's a different beast a little less smart maybe but one hell of a wild ride. I'm exciting to see where it goes.",7,5,9,10 August 2012
Coyote Ugly," An energetic guilty pleasure
","Mostly everyone casts this movie aside until I force them to watch it and than they love it. Jerry Bruckheimer tried to recapture flashdance success and besides making a much better film it also was a hit at the box office. The story is familiar as a small town girl from Sayreville, NJ heads to the big apple in hopes of selling her music. Unsuccessful she picks up at a wild bar called Coyote Ugly where the girls are rough, dance on bars and are master bartenders. She also meets a hunky Australian beau. The movie isn't complex but it is emotionally resonant and overly entertaining. So if you're feeling down it's definitely a pick me up. A young Piper Perabo (Covert Affairs), Bridget Moynahan (The Recruit), Maria Bello (Assault on precinct 13), Adam Garcia (Riding in Cars with boys), John Goodman (10 Cloverfield Lane), Izabella Miko (Step up all in), Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures) and Tyra Banks (Higher Learning) star.Budget: $45m

Moulin Rouge!," The best movie ever made.
","This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time. Although I'm a bigtime horror freak as you can tell from feed. Baz Luhrmann's ultimate cinematic masterpiece is unlike anything that's ever been or will be released. Nicole Kidman (whom is my favorite actress because of this movie) is absolute perfection as Satine a courtesan who mistakenly meets a young poet named Christian played by the handsome and amazingly talented Ewan McGregor and they fall in love. Unfortunately she's been promised to the Duke whose going to turn the club into a theater and Satine into a famous actress. Against all odds they pursue their romance with the villainous Duke moving in. The movie is wonderfully romantic, magical and infinitely creative. There is no other cinematic experience like this. As soon as it begins you are transported to a timeless, inspired world of endless potential and magic. Everything about this film is perfect, it's not for everyone but if you go in with an open mind and heart you may find yourself having one of the best experiences of your life. <3Budget: $52M

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," New Moon has real bite
","As most of you know I am a Twilight fan. A TwiHard if you will even though I refuse to address myself as that because it's on a different level of dorkdum than I'd like to be apart of. I throughly enjoyed the books after they were forced upon me. They actually reinspired me to start reading and working on my writing again. As the first film approached I eagerly awaited it. But upon seeing it for the first time I was extremely disappointed the film felt amateur and so much of the stuff I had loved in the first book didn't seem to be there. Stewart was good but her performance seemed a little off and Hardwicke's direction was mediocre at best. The best thing about that film was smokin hot Robert Pattinson and the electric chemistry he had with Stewart. But being the fan I was I decided to revisit the film and started to like it. I started to like it a lot. It was easy to admit it wasn't a great film by any means but there was a certain charm to it. A real guilty pleasure I grew to love. After that I reread the books (a few times) and found myself eagerly awaiting the sequel. But despite the hype and incredible trailers for it. New Moon was the least favorite book of my series and Deep down I thought okay get ready to hate it but it will grow on me after a few viewings. Well I just got home from it. And it was freaking AMAZING!!!!!!! The film is not only a close adaptation of the book but it really nails the formula. The film feels larger and more epic than its predecessor and maybe thats because it's supposed to be. But it also feels professionally executed with a real style to the proceedings. Sure Rob Pattinson is good, And Taylor Lautner's abs do well enough but this is Stewart's movie. And she is amazing. The unbelievable amount of heartbreak she manages to convey in her compelling performance is tear jerking and award worthy. On a technical level the cinematography is breathtaking. The film is filled with a lush atmosphere and eye catching explosions of color and surrealistic depth. The underwater sequence in particular is award worthy and I would be surprised if any film came remotely near it this year. The score makes the film feel so large and dramatic and the film's soundtrack is cleverly added in. The screenplay is good enough but it's the direction that really makes this film soar. Weitz responsible for the horrifically bad Golden Compass seems to be in his element film the film never drags, moving at a wondorous pace. It's romantic and the weirdness of its concept and the actual book is perfectly captured on feel making for a truly creative and thought provoking film. It's that good. The film is also really funny. Weitz adds some much needed humor into the film so that you find yourself laughing through tears at time. It's that good. If I could change anything I only wish that sam and his pack were given a little more screen time I found them to be a charming and talented group of guys. Now I went in as being all about Eward in fact I can't even contemplate why there is a Team Jacob but after seeing the film although I'm still all about edward I find myself sympathizing with his character and even liking him a little. Now I may be a bit biased in this review or just really overexcited. Only time will tell if my opinion of the film goes a little downward or possibly gets better . But for now let's just Twilight Saga new Moon is one of the best films I've seen ever.",10,9,33,20 November 2009
The Illusionist," disappearing Act...
","Jessica Biehl is one of the most beautiful actresses working today. She has a fine healthy physique, long gorgeous blonde hair, medium sized pouty lips and seductive eyes that pull you in dry the manhood out of you. I didn't know what to expect from her in a period piece, I didn't know what to expect of this film. I had heard it was good, but you can never really trust reviews. But I can now lay my fears to rest. Both are good. Jessica Biehl shows her versatility as an actress while portraying the object of two man's separate desires one for love, the other for possession. Her performance is immediate and plausible. The film itself is good, not great. It presents a layered storyline setup as an illusionists magic trick. As the film moves along we are introduced to plot twists, character revelations, none of which are too surprising. But still confident and skillfully executed. Biehl and Nortons chemistry is so-so. But solo they both do quite well in the film. The love story isn't as involving as the film makers would like it to be. But the suspense is. The film is well done, shot beautifully with wonderful costumes and good performances. The direction is confident without being smarmy but isn't very inventive either. The films pacing is a bit long but never dull. In the end the film is a solid good effort for all involved but despite Jessica Biehl's surprisingly confident turn the film is like one of it's characters magic tricks. Plausible when your watching but ultimately it's nothing more than a disappearing act. A little more involvement on the character level would have made it much more memorable.",7,1,1,6 September 2006
Transformers," cinematic junkyard
","So what's wrong with Transformers?... An easier question is what isn't wrong with Transformers. Let's see Shia Labeouf's performance is wonderfully appealing and he's starting to look more attractive. Megan Fox is pretty to look at. And the spfx are good the first time they happen. That's about it. Now what's wrong with it. I'm not a fan of the cartoon nor have I watched therefore I can not speak for that group of people. No story. Loud. Obnoxious. Dumb. Directionless. Boring. Bad Acting. Bad cinematography. Bad casting. Actually reduces your brain capacity after watching. Very little entertainment value. Painfully repetitive. Yep well that's about it. Transformers certainly isn't the worst film I've seen but it's definitely one of the worst. It's dreadfully loud and obnoxious. I left with a horrible headache and found the movie to be painfully stupid. I didn't really understand what was going on and really couldn't see anything because of the chaotic Blair Witch style cinematography. Except for those now ridiculous Michael Bay slow motion shots and pan outs. This is quite possibly the dorkiest film ever made and you have any bit of coolness to you, you'll run for the exits. Transformers is a cinematic junkyard...",8,8,16,2 July 2007
Magic Mike XXL," More like Half Magic Mike
",I'm not sure how to review this film. The first one was a surprisingly well rounded film about male strippers which was fun but had an undertone of sadness running through it. It wasn't really a film that needed a sequel. But here we are with Magic Mike XXL. those looking for a film to continue the development of the title character's story line will be disappointed as will those looking for the original fun streaks to be supersized. Here we have a film with characters who are somewhat interesting and definitely charismatic but the storytelling lacks any real depth in getting to now who they are. Now I guess that would be fine if it delivered on the other goods. But it doesn't although the dancing is impressive the film lacks the playful sexuality that made the first one so appealing. Instead it plays as an inconsistent underdeveloped comedy of sorts. It's no doubt that the film has charm and the cast is game for some improv work but most of the ramblings feel pointless and the overall execution almost feels dreamlike and directionless. I'd be lying if I didn't say the film had some fun to offer but it's too weighed down by trying to boost up it's own self esteem to find the movie it should have been. **.75/5,6,6,27,1 July 2015
1917," What an experience
","Now that all the glittery dust has settled at the golden globes and 1917 has made away with best picture award and stolen the weekend at the box office with over 37 million I finally got to see it. And guess what it was great. Sam Mendes's execution of the WWI flick is a unique, edge of your seat ride that follows two men as they try and warn a battalion before they fall into an enemy trap. George Mackay of Pride(2014) is our guide through a horrific war torn landscape that's as nightmarish as it is beautiful. The execution makes you feel as if the entire venture is one non stop shot that you're unwillingly participating in. Theres not alot of development character wise and that's definitely a conscious decision but because of that I felt oddly disconnected at times. That being said the first half of the movie has an intense first person flow to it that's almost unbearable at times. But when it finally breaks for air, when our lead comes into contact with a young woman it reminded me I was in a theater. It was a solid scene but definitely broke up the pace. That being said it returns to its anxiety splitting pace not long after. When I say this movie is intense I mean it but it does stop and smell the roses so to speak. It is quiet and inspired. The lead performance from George Mackay is really fantastic and definitely deserves some award attention as does the film which I'm sure will ring it up at the Oscars and deservedly so. From the sweeping but intimate cinematography to the nerve shredding score. Its definitely one of 2019s best.",9,0,2,13 January 2020
Empire Records," A criminally underseen classic
","Initially when this film was released it flopped financially and critically. It has definitely built a deserved cult following over the years. It's one of my favorite go to make me feel great movies that explores a plethora of emotions making it similar to having the impact of the breakfast club and fitting perfectly in the wheelhouse of films that explore youth in a genuine way. This review is for both the Superior theatrical version and the interesting but flawed extended version. It centers on a group of employees whom deal with a variety of issues while working at a record store that's on the verge of closing. All the characters are quirky and wonderfully likable Renee Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler being the standouts. It's easy to see why the extended stuff was cut and the impact of some of the films best scenes are lessened including the amazing finale. I would highly reccomend just skipping the extended version and just sticking with the best cut. As it stands it's a love letter to the changing music scene as well as youth in general. Its hilarious fun and heartfelt and also stars Joe Mategna, Debi Mazar, Ethan Embry, Maxwell Caufield and so many more.Budget: $10m

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," An action packed guilty pleasure
","This is truly a guilty pleasure. Whereas the original was an actual good movie, well to me anyways. This is pure trash but it's so enjoyable. Milla Jovovich (Fifth Element) is back in mega kick ass mode along with Sienna Guilroy (Love, Actually), sexy Mike Epps (Hangover), Oded Fehr (The Mummy) and gorgeous Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason) amongst others. Picking up right after the events of the previous film Alice awakens in a distressed Racoon City overrunning with all forms of the undead. Slowly she builds up her powers leading up to a battle with Nemesis a.k.a. Matt (Eric Mabius- Welcome to the Dollhouse) and a killer finale. The movie is fun and funny thanks mostly to Mike Epps. The movie unfortunately looks a little cheap because of its ambition and limited budget but its effective nonetheless. There's no real scares here but the action and stunt work are impressive. To the films detriment its main problem is the amateur, sloppy direction from first time director Alexander Witt. Despite the criticisms the movie succeeds exactly where it sets its low expectations at, its mere popcorn entertainment.Budget: $43m

Evil Dead," Old School
","Remake. Reimagining. Reboot. Sequel. You can use many terms to describe this film but this addition to the Evil Dead franchise manages to create a niche all it's own composed of some appreciated unpredictability, recycled ideas from other films and a plethora of gore soaked goodies. Set in present day the film centers on a group of friends gathered to help a young woman beat her heroin addiction. Mia played by Jane Levy in an uneven but decent performance is that young woman who is the first to fall victim to the notorious necronomicon which of course leads to a night of sadistic horror, the likes of which you've come to expect from these films. Solid and sexy Shiloh Fernandez turns up as her abandoning brother with a slightly melodramatic past, handsome Lou Taylor Pucci as his too curious friend Eric, the talented and gorgeous Jessica Lucas as the most believable of the bunch Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, David's girlfriend and the not so great actress of the group. The direction from Fede Alvarez is solid I think if a little generic although I am impressed by the enormity of this guy's balls. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous from it's heightened suspenseful camera angles and the ones that capture the scenery in just the right way to the beautiful composition of light through out the film, it's really very commendable. Speaking of commendable the old school nod to practical effects is much appreciated and way more effective than the CGI crap that crowds multiplexes nowadays. But all in all the film feels feels a little recycled with not much an identity of it's own. it borrows freely from the Evil Dead films and other similar films like it and in truth feels more like a sequel than an actual remake and in that sense it never really feels like it can stand on it's own. Don't get me wrong the film has a barrage of wonderfully gory set pieces but when you look up Evil Dead 30 years from now on the net I'm pretty sure this won't be what comes up. The screenplay however does have some nice touches the reasoning behind them staying is well though out even if the opening is a little hammy and confusing and the constant merry go round effect of who is the films real main character is wonderfully deceptive. That being said, my expectations were set very high I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead films and I had recently watched them and the buzz on this film has been incredible and I bought into a little against my better judgement. When it first started out I didn't feel much of anything and than as it went on it was decent enough but the disappointment started to creep in. I can't say that the feeling ever truly went away completely but the film culminates too such a grand, horrific, entertaining, completely over the top, ickfest finale I couldn't help it when the slight blues fell away replaced with a childish grin that helped me to remember why I have been such a big horror fan since I was a kid. And for that reason alone it's more than worth the price of admission a few times. 4/5",8,10,81,4 April 2013

","Truly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sam Raimi's inspired foray into the genre has rightly gained an enormous cult following and as well of an extended franchise of its own including a superior sequel, a fun follow up, a solid remake and an amazing tv series. At its core is the handsome, charismatic Bruce Campbell as him and his friends are terrorized by a dark evil from the book of the dead, 'the necronomicon'. Que the grotesque possessions, blood spraying, tree raping, and mutilation. The movie is guerilla filming at it's best and most inspired. Slick cinematography and smart direction elevate the proceedings and make it all feel real, intense and at times comical despite its budgetary limitations.The results are one hell of a scary movie that helped defined the genre.Budget: $375,000

But its aged well since. Throughout its theatrical run I found a love for the film and started looking at it on it's own terms. Besides sexy and charming Chris Pratt in the lead. Bryce Dallas Howard kicks major butt, the kids are good and the supporting cast are solid. The story is both familiar and refreshing and the FX are pretty spectacular as is the park they have created. In a sense it's sort of a reimagining of the first film and it does a solid job of doing some fun stuff with the treatment.

At times it can be a bit much but it holds together fairly well and culminates to a ferocious finale that left the audience screaming and clapping. A solid summer thrill ride that does a great job of reinvigorating the franchise but the best advice i can give the makers of the unavoidable follow up is too slow it down a bit.

The characters are developed a bit more but not in the way you'd like them to be and the film does have some dragging sequences. That being said the new characters are fantastic Scarlet Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen is fierce and Quicksilver played by hottie Aaron Taylor Johnson is fun.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Thrilling
","I have been a long time fan and defender of The Twilight franchise both the books and movies. I've fought a lot of battles of people unnecessarily attacking the material just because they didn't get it, or wasn't their thing. In all my 33 years I've never encountered the sheer hatred for any movie/book series that Twilight has managed to garner. But on the flip side I've never seen people as passionate or energetic about any property either. Anyone whose been to a midnight show knows just what I'm talking about. there is a fluid respectable energy and although about 80% female there are people of all ages regardless of what people may think. So finally after all this time I can tell everyone who hates the Saga to suck it because this movie kicks major ass. And not just in the way I and you have come to expect from the other films but it actually graduates the material to an intense level I've never experienced in any film before. I was literally on the edge of my seat having heart palpitations during the stunning, uber violent finale. It's not just what you've always wanted from these films it's the culmination you've always wanted from most films. The only comparable material I can think is how the Avengers played out. It's not just the ballsy clever maneuver to twist the material a bit but the execution overall. Everything ends on a high note. From the production design to the costumes to the much improved special effects, the now explosive special effects, the toned down/up screenplay and the performances. people who have complained about the acting in the other films will see what I mean. As these characters have grown so have the actors. Robert Pattinson is mesmerizing as always but Taylor Lautner finally stretches his whiny chops and explores a more adult, caring side to his character while Stewart steals the show gone is the clumsy, awkward, slightly annoying girl from the other films and replaced with a seductive, bad ass woman with a fierce mean streak. As a fan it's sad to see it all end but I've never felt so satisfied leaving something like this behind. All the questions are answered and the franchise goes out on a super high note. It's truly the most thrilling cinematic experience I've had in a decade. It's funny, romantic, edge of your seat, intense, clever and unique. And Kudos to Condon for t=giving the fans some love with that montage at the films end and the addition of the visualized pages from the book.",10,12,34,15 November 2012
Sinister," Stupid
","I am so sick of scary kids in movies. They are just not scary f one came at me I'd kick them in the throat. Despite a truckload of positive buzz I never jumped on the Sinister train completely the trailers and TV spots just didn't look very good. So I went into this with not low but mid level expectations and came out a little disappointed to be honest. Not to say there weren't things I liked about this film. There were a few decent scares and the home movies usually feeling forced come across quite genuine, amateur and disturbing. That aside honestly there's just not very much to recommend here. There is a good idea here and Bagul could have been a frightening character but that last twist just throws off the movie completely in my opinion and the worst thing is that you see it coming and your still hoping for something more. And thats basically the film a waiting game that rarely pays off and when it does it's decent enough if a little generic. The film stars Ethan Hawke slumming it as an author of true crime novels who moves into the house of a murdered family he's basing his next book off of. He discovers some old home movies in the attic featuring some of the old murders and creepy things start to happen. As the movie plods along unenthusiastically we learn about a Deity named Bagul who 'eats' small children. I don't wanna spoil anything for those of you who are going to see it. You should relish every small twist because there's not many and don't look at any of the trailers, TV spots or poster because they show everything. When it finally culminates it's not very exciting and moves into even more forced generic territory coming off like a mediocre rip off of the Amityville Horror remake without Ryan Reynolds abs sadly. All in all it's a mixed bag and although it has some decent qualities it's nothing special. And it's all really just kind of stupid.",5,4,10,15 October 2012
Les Misérables," Little bit of a disappointment
","I would first like to say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical Les Miserables. I saw it on Broadway when I was much younger and fell asleep and did enjoy the non musical version unlike so many others. Now watching the story unfold I can appreciate it's scope and complexity but I can't help but feel it's all a little dull, sorry. And I think that mainly has to do with the way its been executed this time around. After a brilliant first 35 mins reaching its peak when Anne Hathaway delivers a heart stopping, tear inducing performance of I dreamed a dream the film begins to flat line. Each scene less effective than the last. And the performances seem to follow suit. Hugh Jackman who blows you away in the beginning starts to come off too intense and forced, Russell Crowe although not terrible seems ill suited for the role and speaking of terrible Amanda Seyfred is just that she's so shrill sounding and has the emotional range of a stunted deer in headlights. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also show up and deliver the films ghastliest performances with not an wink of charm. And as a pretty much a first timer of the material I can say most of it is pretty mean and dreary. Which is not a bad thing if it had been delivered with the panache that the film started with this could have truly been an amazing experience. Something raw, original and ground breaking. Instead we are left with halted promises as the we get further from the films powerful opening numbers after a while it all feels drab, lethargic and a little rushed at the same time. But I don't wanna be too mean to the film it has a lot of great moments and some truly wonderful songs that are performed exquisitely and it's no doubt that these actors have shown up with their game faces on too bad the proper direction wasn't their to assist them in making something truly special instead of another missed opportunity. ***/5",6,2,5,26 December 2012
The Fountain," Fountain of Dreck...
","I consider to myself to be an intelligent person and I consider myself to be a fan of Darren Aronofsky but the Fountain is absurd, pretentious, boring and uninvolving. Lacking the visual impact of his earlier films it tells the story of two people throughout the ages played confidently by weisz and Jackman. What it comes down to without giving anything away is the film is about creation through death. Which is understandably a powerful and intriguing idea but never has it been done so creatively and uninvolving. The characters are hardly developed and though they are not the main focus they should be. Because without an emotional attachment in this type of film it just doesn't work. The film is confusing at best but not because of its intelligence or coherence but because it tries to be different when it probably would have been more effective played straight. What seems to be leading up to a powerful plot revelation is something you already attained within the first third. There is a lot of symbolism and subtext but the film is very repetitive within its limited themes. Aronofsky has some important things to say but doesn't know how to say them. The film's pacing makes it seem hours when it's just 96 minutes. The performances are good but the characters are poorly written and underdeveloped and the cinematography is acceptable but cheap looking. There are no other words but to describe this movie except to say it's a waste of time. maybe my expectations were to high after his previous two victories but this films wreaks of studio meddling, whats left has nothing to say and should only be seen by extreme art-house fans who like something just because its different and no one else likes it and by insomniacs looking to finally get some sleep.",2,5,11,25 November 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," Intricate
","I feel like people are going into this film with the wrong expectations. I'm not sure what most people went in expecting but I got pretty much what I thought maybe a little less. Not as powerful, emotionally resonant or captivating as Hurt Locker Kathryn Bigelow's controversial follow up to that film is still a throughly engaging, edge of your seat dramatic thriller. One that realistically for the most part tells the stories of the brave women and men involved in the hunt and assassination of the terrorist known as Osama Bin Laden. The film chronicles and centers on the exploits of a woman named Myra who id hired to lead the search. What follows as we all know are many the pitfalls and fake outs that happened over the years eventually leading up to the event. What we do see an an addition to that is a look on the inside of the investigation. The anxiety ridden events, the tragedies, the friendships, the assassination attempts, the vendettas and although the film doesn't fully work as a procedural because there doesn't seem to be enough detail or as a character piece because it doesn't seem to want to go to those depths it does work as a smart, adult piece of grade a entertainment. Jessica Chastain tackles her role of Myra with a fiery, school girl enthusiasm I can imagine such a person filling that role and the supporting roles fill out nicely as well. I'm sure many things were added to dramatize many of the events and you can feel the Hollywood anchor throughout but the film still carries a subtle power to it and even though you know what the culmination of the events will be you still feel like you don't know how they will enfold. And that is the stamp of some truly intricate film making. 4/5",8,7,13,21 March 2013
Burlesque," Fabulous (pardon the intended stereotypical expression)
","I had my doubts walking into this film who wouldn't. Sure the trailers looks glitzy, fun and kinda silly but how often does that turn out well especially with the acting debut of a musical star. The film has so many things stacked against it and if I were to be extremely critical I'm sure I could pick apart the performances and generic somewhat clichéd plot but I had so much fun watching it I can't help but to give it the highest of my reccomendations and for so many reasons. First up here's the stick thin plot Poor girl named Ally(Aguleira) moves from Iowa to LA in pursuit of being a star. She comes across a flailing Burlesque club run by a tough as nails diva (Cher) who gives her a shot in the show and she ends up saving the club to some extent with her powerful voice. It all sounds fairly miserable I will admit. But the movie is told in such an energetic, visually exciting and light hearted way it's hard not too be instantly engaged by the films slightly amateur but exciting execution and dare I say it an engaging, charming but somewhat uneven lead performance from Christina Aguleira. there's some nice multi layered supporting turns from Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci and a phenomenal much welcome share. And there's some delicious eye candy in the form of a scantily clad and one point nude Cam Gigandet of Twilight. The songs are fun, the choreography tight and exciting and the cinematography is so visually enticing from the a flashing light spectacle to the soft hues of a dark stage reflected off of Cher's facade during a powerful ballad. It's no doubt that the film definitely brings out the gay in and anyone who knows me knows it's also true that I relish camptastic films such as Showgirls, Elvira Mistress of the Dark, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Coyote Ugly among many others. And Like those films it's hard to see the bad in those films such as this one when I so completely enjoy them. there is a raw, seductive energy to this film and it feels fresh and unique. I'm afraid it might flop but it's no doubt prime real estate for cult status. It's everything I could have hoped for in all the right ways. It's fabulous!",8,4,6,25 November 2010
Scream 2," Almost as great as the first
","Like Aliens and T2, Scream 2 is one of the only sequels as great as the original. Picking up after the events of the original Sidney is off at college with Randy and some new friends when the murders start up again. Like the original the film is a slasher whodunit as we along the characters try and figure out who it is as it marches towards its thrilling conclusion. Like any great sequel of which there is few it expands the universe and fleshes out the characters even more. There is one emotionally devastating scene concerning Dewey and Gale that may be the best of the series. Craven refreshingly adapts the material bringing new life to the genre. The movie is comedic but also suspenseful, scary and surprising. When the mystery finally unfolds it's not only shocking but so well constructed you can't help but be awed by the complex methodology that went it to it courtesy of its amazing creators master Wes Craven and my idol Kevin Williamson and the strong cast that pull it off. Speaking of performances everything is upped a notch. Neve Campbell is electrifying as Sidney giving her a u pique strength and relatable vulnerability. Courtney Cox really has a journey in this film as Gale and David Arquette is again wonderfully and layered as Dewey. As for the newbies Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber offer solid support. This entry has a bit more to say about the mechanics of the genre and is even a bit more involved than it's predecessor but the sheer magnetism of the first is never fully met. As it stands it's still one hell of an amazing movie.Budget: $24m

Bram Stoker's Dracula," A cinematic masterpiece
","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is s cinematic masterpiece. The film is just a beautiful work of art and its without a doubt the most romantic horror film ever made and one of the best movies. Starring a seductive Gary Oldman, a sensual Winona Ryder, Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes and a questionable but handsome Keanu Reeves amongst others. The movie is a sweeping epic about love and death. Its unlike any other film and although it can feel a bit much at times. Its ambitious and creative nature deserves to be commended. It's truly a rare thing for a film especially a studio entry to take so many chances. The end result isn't perfect but its damn near close.",9,3,3,19 February 2020
It Chapter Two," Disappointing but somewhat entertaining
","Initially I hated this movie. I have to admit my expectations were a bit high especially since the first chapter is truly one of the best horror films ever made. This time around we see the Losers club 28 years later after the evil returns. Together they must overcome their fears and find the courage to face it once and for all. The truth is the adult storyline is way less interesting than the kids but the way in which this film handles is overtly goofy and mistaken for most of it's run time. First up the casting is good but the roles are underwritten. Only Bill Hader and sexy James Ransome manage to make any kind of impact. The film also spends too much time in forced flashbacks that are neither engaging or effective. Plus the awful digital de aging is definitely a problem. Because of all that we never really get to know the grown up versions which consist of an underused Jessica Chastain. An underwhelming but handsome James McAvoy, Old Spices Isiah Mustafa (a.k.a. the hunky centaur) and an overly Jay Ryan as grown up Ben. Even though the original TV miniseries struggled especially in the second half it was more cohesive and effective. This sequel actually lessens the impact of its predecessor and actually takes away some of the quality. That being said watching it again and knowing what to expect I enjoyed it a little more and actually liked some of the scenes that are more atmospheric and not bogged down by bad cgi. In the end it's overly mediocre but does manage to be mildly entertaining. But with rumors of a third chapter on the way, I beg of them. Please stop.",6,0,0,16 February 2020
Sherlock Holmes," great fun
","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I entered this film. In fact the only reason why I went to see it is mainly because of it's three killer leads. Safe to say that was reason enough. Although Guy Ritchie might not be the right director to bring this stylish and smart new franchise to it's full potential. The chemistry and style injected into the proceedings is enough to make for a wonderfully smart if at times too fast but entertaining update the classic source material. Robert Downey Jr is of course wonderful in the lead role of Sherlock Holmes. He portrays the character with a manic sensibility befitting a crazed genius with a genuinely strong physical side. He is equaled by Jude Law's brilliantly charismatic sidekick Watson who has just as much brain and braun as his counterparts but is equipped with a little less passion but a lot more common sense. They are joined by the likable Rachael McAdams in her first real meaty role since The Notebook. She stars as the love interest of Holmes a seductive, brilliant and courageous but sneaky thief. The film's only weakness is Ritchie's manic and chaotic direction which I liked more here than anyone of his films. But still the film would have benefited by having someone much more skilled behind the camera. A strong sense of cinematic artistry accompanies the film in it's set design, costumes and cinematography and it's just a really fun time. One that I will will spawn another sequel very soon.",7,2,5,26 December 2009
The Blind Side," far from blind
","I was a hater. I went into this film with the lowest of expectations. I expected a one sided, melodramatic, lifetime movie with an odd looking badly cast Sandra Bullock at the films center. Boring, unnecessary and too silly to take serious. well I'm happy to say that I was so wrong. I had heard good things about this film and they were hard to believe but they were all true. The true story on screen here is inspiring and heart warming. The film is handled with a genuine sincerity and never falls into melodrama instead touching and than avoiding only to further the films complex and unique story line. With themes of racism, class, love, fear and courage among many others. The blind Side handles them all with a soft ease making for a wonderful experience. it's intelligent and objective with a truly moving performance from Sandra Bullock the best of her career. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love this film.",9,3,8,12 December 2009
The Conjuring," Instant classic
","I love horror films and as someone who loves horror films I ask other fans is there ever a moment when you're watching something really scary and you go ' This was a mistake, I hate this crap, I can't watch this, I have to leave.' It's a very rare reaction especially in a cinematic sea or remakes, retreads and countless unnecessary sequels (not to say that some are great). The Conjuring the new film from James Wan made me have this reaction. Yes the film has all the tropes of a standard haunted house thriller but the film's smooth, ultra realistic execution is what sets it apart. The film tells the story of a family in the 70's who move into a new house and begin to experience strange occurrences. Those occurrences increase rather quickly and they list the help of the now famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren played perfectly by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farminga. What culminates is something truly unique and horrifying and hasn't been seen in the movies in a very long time if ever. Although it sounds fairly generic but this film is anything but. The proceedings are handled with a genre maestros finesse. Smoothly moving between each set piece to create a tapestry of terror. And to add to the films overall effect the proceedings are given an emotional girth so we care about the characters and the events going on. The film boasts solid performances all around especially from Vera Farminga, Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor. The cinematographic is creative and top notch, the score haunting and effects nightmarish. But the star of the show here is James Wan he has effectively made a instantly classic horror film. It's finely tunes, feels very real and pacts an emotional wallop while scaring the crap out of you. Itis the scariest movie I've ever seen and one of the best not just of the year but ever. 5/5",10,0,2,31 July 2013
Scream," Cinematic masterpiece
","What is there to say that hasn't been said about Scream. Innovative, scary, funny, clever, smart, etc. Its definitely a movie that's one of a kind and a magic that will never be replicated. Taking all of our beloved slasher cliches and flipping them on their head redefined the horror genre in 1996 and no one saw it coming. Although I desperately was waiting for the films release not too many people were. It arrived that December with very little buzz and only a selection of mixed reviews. Made for $15 million and opening with only a little over $6 million it looked like a flop. But as the weeks went on and word of mouth spread and critics started seeing it. The reviews shot up and so did the box office. Ultimately making over $173 million worldwide. I'm happy to say that I got to experience the phenomenon first hand working at a movie theater. To this day the movie is still fantastic. It's truly a perfect storm from the fluid, accomplished direction from Wes Craven to the brilliant screenplay by My personal idol Kevin Williamson and a perfectly cast of actors giving inspired performances. Neve Campbell was without a doubt one of the strongest scream queens to grace our genre and of course we can't forget the charasmatic Courtney Cox or lovably dopey David Arquette that followed her through the excellent franchise. And of course memorable work by Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and more. Of course no one can forget the amazing cameo by Drew Barrymore. Intelligent unique and genre defining the film stands as a masterwork of modern cinema.Budget: $15m

Halloween," The perfect horror film
","The powerful effect of the original Halloween is even more potent today than ever after a bunch of entertaining but misguided sequels and goofy rip offs. Although it seems very basic it's been impossible to replicate with the same effect. The timeless horror tale of innocent young women that are stalked by an escaped mental patient on the title holiday is atmospheric and gorgeously filmed setting the standard for the slasher film. Jamie Lee Curtis is layered and likable as Laurie and Michael is a looming, dread inducing presence. John Carpenter's ultimate masterpiece is truly a perfect film and one of my all time favorites.",10,1,1,23 February 2020
Marriage Story," Powerful
","I'm finally getting caught up with the highly rated flicks of 2019 and this is another best of the bunch. Noah Baumbach's heartbreaking, genuine and unique examination of a normal couple going through divorce is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. Scarlett Johansson delivering her second amazing performance of the year and the oddly sexy and powerful Adam Driver delivers a career high performance as her husband. Theres also a fine cast of supporting performances from Laura Dern and Ray Liotta amongst others. It's a truly powerful and realistic examination of the material that's explored in such a way that it resonates with you long after it's over from the powerful arguments to the subtle touches. But it's not all sad, it's joyous, heartwrenching and supremely engaging. I found myself absolutely captivated and honestly i didn't want it to end. I felt like I knew these people and I wanted to know what would happen in their future.",10,6,9,5 January 2020
Taken 2," Unnecessary but fun
","I had no interest in seeing the first Taken I thought it looked pretty generic but when I finally got around to seeing it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the film was a blast. Smart, edgy and filled with a kinetic, fiery energy, emotionally engaging and highlighted by a slick, sexy kick ass performance from Liam Neeson in the lead. So when the trailers for Taken 2 first came out I was planning on seeing it even though they were really underwhelming. And than these horrible reviews started flooding in saying it was boring and stupid, nothing like the original and just a cash in on the first film. So I decided to skip it. But today i was feeling kinda off and needed some escapist entertainment so I went. And I'm happy I did. Although it does't hold a candle to the original it mostly works because of the first film. We know these characters and care about them. The film works best in it's smaller more intimate moments but there are some thrilling action sequences particularly a chase involving Neeson and his daughter played by Maggie Grace. This time around Neeson finds him and his family being hunted by the relatives of the people he killed in the first film while on vacation. The plot is a little shallow and the direction feels very unrefined and amateurish unlike the first films stylish, sophisticated but gritty execution. A lot of the film feels very hammy but I guess thats the point, it almost seems to be making fun of itself and it's absurdities. Still the proceedings are engaging enough to merit a solid recommendation. Although ultimately unnecessary it still makes for above average entertainment especially if you were a fan of the first film. One of my big complaints though and hopefully they will rectify it in the next film which I'm sure is coming out is can Maggie Grace please play her age no one is buying this young girl routine but kudos to her on her involvement on some of the action especially that breath taking rooftop chase.",6,0,0,19 October 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," A horror masterpiece
","I haven't revisited this much since I saw it as a kid. I remember my uncle took me to see it and I really liked it but just didn't understand it. Now as an adult I can fully comprehend what's happening and having seen thousands of movie since I can appreciate the quality. I've never read the book but the film feels so genuine in its approach just like its main character Clarice starling played by an amazingly vulnerable but strong Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins is also amazing in his role and so is Ted Levine. But it's more than that the screening and the way its adapted is unique and intriguing. There's not one moment that's not supremely engaging. Especially the cleverly written and brilliantly performed dialogue. Its without a doubt a perfect storm that makes this horror thriller an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.Budget: $19m

The Wolverine," vast improvement.
","A vast improvement over the crapfest X-Men Origins Wolverine the film pretty much ignores the fact that the film even really happened which is a good thing. Picking it up after the finale of X3 we find our title character loning it up when he is found by a bad ass Japanese woman in search of him because he saved her boss some fifty odd years ago. After some discussion he decides to say his goodbyes and discovers a conspiracy involving the Yakuza trying to assassinate his granddaughter who Wolvie takes a liking too. The film is a little underdeveloped but engaging enough to merit some solid entertainment. Tightly choreographed fight scenes and some strong female characters as well as Jackman's lovable character and trademark biceps and Abs enhance the films viewing pleasure. A downfall is the character of Viper and the actress who plays her who are pretty cheesetastic and seem out of place in the films more reality based setting. I also wish they had spent a bit more time developing the films core relationship. Still what stands is a fun, somewhat ferocious and much improved installment of Jackman's lovable take on the iconic character.Stay a little after the credits for anintriguing cliffhanger. Btw Jackman's body is beyond sick in this movie whatever he's doing, it's working!***.5/5",7,11,23,31 July 2013
Casino Royale," bond is a hunk...
","How hot is Daniel Craig. He is smoking hot in the latest addition to the Bond franchise. I have to admit I've never been a big fan of the Bond films and I promised myself I'd see this one only if it got great reviews but after seeing the trailer where Craig walks slow motion out of the ocean I was sold. And than along came the reviews and they were fantastic so I was siked. Casino Royale plays as a sort of prequel to the Bond films it takes place when 007 first started out. It shows his first kills and when he fought in a more amateurly violent sense and why he's usually so cold in other films especially towards women. This film fleshes out his character successfully and although I was pretty much sold on Pierce as 007 I understand now what peoples complaints were. Daniel Craig is gorgeous in a rugged way but he portrays Bond as cocky, charismatic and guarded. He displays 007 as a three dimensional character with emotions and explains why he is the way he is, why he acts the way he acts. Most of the Bond films have been nothing but dumb fun. But this is not the case with this new film it's tough, gritty and dark even a little sad. It makes it's title outlandish character human in a way that should probably be recognized come awards time but it won't be. Eva green fills out a supporting performance as the mysterious female partner and Judi Dench is sassy as ever as M and has many of the films best lines. But Craig is the real prize here as a gay man I was basically fanning myself in every scene he's more than just looks though, it's his attitude, his charm, his swagger that comes across, he's a definite man's man. Besides his look and attitude he gives a great multi layered performance he never sheds a tear but you can see him being torn apart inside. The actions of his character never seem unbelievable and the film never feels fake. It does however run a bit long in places and could've benefited from some editing. The poker scenes are a bit much and the film drags a bit in it's necessary but drawn out conclusion. But this is definitely worth a look people, the actions sequences are exhilarating, the story is twisty in all the right ways and the film is involving on a personal level and on top of all that Craig gives a great performance and his looks are to die for.",8,0,1,17 November 2006
Signs," Shylaman's only great movie
","I'm not a big fan of Shylaman's (Sixth Sense) stuff although I do tend to enjoy it somewhat the awful Unbreakable, happening and after earth aside. The movie is a edge of your seat suspenser in glorious Hitchcock style about a little family at the cusp of a full scale alien invasion. The movie is creepy, intense and filled with solid performances from Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin. The only real issues I have with the film is instead of keeping it simplistic we are burdened with the goofy Shylaman twists. Although it doesn't come together completely it's an exciting film that holds up quite well.Budget: $72m

Moonrise Kingdom," Surprisingly great!
","I'm not a big fan of Wes Anderson films at all. I find all of them Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic etc. to be odd for odds sake. I also find them kinda dragged out and ridiculous. That being said I have to say I kinda loved Moonrise Kingdom. This tale of two pre teens in love and running away together has such an undeniable charm. Sure it's odd but maybe because it's focused on the kids is the reason it works so well. Yes it's still odd but it's without a doubt the most imaginative of his films and one of the best and most creative films this year. With an all star cast that really shines Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Francis McDormand and led by two addictively raw and lovingly awkward performances from Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. Filled with some beautifully endearing moments of genuine connection it still gets a little too silly in spots but it's really quite a fantastical cinematic experience. 4/5",8,1,3,29 December 2012
The Purge," Brilliant
","I've heard that a lot of people have felt disappointed by this film. Critics as well as the general public. It had a phenomenal weekend. Costing just 3 million dollars to make and netting almost 38 million. The concept must have hooked people. Because in a cinematic genre age of remakes and sequels the rare original flick with the intriguing concept will net a lot of attention even if people come flocking to it for all the wrong reasons. From what I've heard people expected to see something broader concerning the concept, something more action packed and entertaining. What I saw a standard home invasion horror thriller amped up by an unusual twist. Ten years from now in the future a new group is the government and they have authorized all crime legal for twelve hours once a year. Since people are allowed to exorcise all their violent and psychotic tendencies. Crime has dropped substantially as well as poverty and unemployment. Set in 2022 on the day of The Purge a family gets accidentally involved in a 'purge hunt' when a young boy lets a wounded victim into their home. As a result a cult of psychotic yuppies targeting him decide to take out their aggression on all of them. If you go in expecting something that's gonna be action packed you will be disappointed. If you go in expecting something that will take the concept on in a broader scenario in which you can witness the brutality across the country you will be disappointed. And lastly if you go in expecting a movie that's going to glorify the violence you will be sadly disappointed. The Purge despite what you may think is a small intimate film that explores the morality of it's concept on a smaller scale to execute a feeling of how everything and everyone is affected individually. It does have broad scope in what it's trying to communicate but is done in a controlled location so it can build characters that frustrate you while you care for them. It makes no subtleties about exploring the bowels of human nature. those feeling that the concept is unrealistic would be right but than again you probably shouldn't see this movie. it's intended as an exercise in taut suspense grounded by a intense observation of the human condition. Furthermore The director smartly orchestrates the situations so that you change the way you feel constantly throughout the film so that you question yourself and those around you. It's a disturbing film. But it's also a brilliant one filled with two strong lead performances from Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke much better here than Insidious. That being said some of the scare tactics are a bit too desperate and come across hammy such as the mask where goons montage and some unnecessary skipping. The twist at the end of the film is the most disturbing part and everything culminates in a way that will leave you speechless. The film runs 85 mins and honestly I'm happy it does cause it ratchets up such disturbing intensity I almost couldn't bear it. It's a taut, unnerving ride that will echo long after it's over. 4/5",8,0,3,9 June 2013
Pitch Perfect," Something Special
","I didn't want to like it. Despite what you may think I don't want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.",8,82,142,28 September 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic
","This is one of the best films ever made. As an 80s kid, born in 79 I worshipped Freddy but definitely had more love for the sequels because I thought he was cool in them. I did not think he was cool in this one he was creepy as hell. In fact Noes was the first horror film I saw at 5 and actually ended up going to school psychiatrist because of it. As a young effeminate boy my father thought it would butch me up. But it just made me have awful nightmares and idolized Nancy and wanted to be her. I mean after all she was the one who survived and she had a hot boyfriend played by a young Johnny Depo wearing a crop top. As I got older I really began to appreciate the perfection that is this film. Robert Englunds iconic performance as Freddy is nightmarish and the film's dark, gritty tone is disturbing. I now regard it as my favorite of the franchise and celebrate the unique creativity that went into every stylish frame and was the first step in establishing the late horror master Wes Craven as my favorite director.Budget: $1.8m

","There was this little genre film I saw fairly recently called The Caller. It centered on a young woman who moves into a new apartment and begins receiving frightening phone calls from a woman searching for someone. As the film builds towards a truly unique and shocking conclusion you discover that the film is dabbling in the whole time travel sub genre although very different films Looper reminded me of that film. This film centers on a group of specialized assassins living in the year 2044. Like the most believable films set in the future not much differentiates the times accept some nice touches here and there futuristic architecture, flying motorcycles, new laws etc. Getting back to the assassins they specialize in assassinating people delivered to them from a criminal futuristic organization so they can dispose of the body. Soon after we learn that eventually their future selves are sent back to them to erase evidence of what they've done and they are paid a large wage and given 30 years. But when a young man played by the ever so talented Joseph Gordon Levitt runs into his future self he hesitates for a moment and his future self played by Bruce Willis escapes. Thus setting the stage for a barrage of unexpected twists and a surprisingly emotionally resonant storyline. What's great about this film is how unique the feel of it is. It's hard to really describe it but it really feels like something new altogether. Unfortunately the film isn't flawless there are some questionable directorial choices although some great questions are brought up not all of them are answered effectively. There is a load of unnecessary characters that aren't fully developed and the film is a little cheesy in its action sequences. It is most successful in it's smaller moments like the one in which the two versions share a conversation over breakfast, a soft love story is explored as well as the relationship between a mother and her child. Levitt is solid in the lead and Emily Blunt is an unexpected surprise delivering a character i never though she would take on. Bruce Willis is less successful as the older version of Joe and the usually likable Piper Perabo is given so little to do besides an awkward topless scene it makes you wonder why she signed on for it. Still all in all the film is pretty solid and most of all it just feels really fresh a blessing in a cinematic market saturated with countless remakes and sequels. It may not be perfect but there is more than enough here to merit a more than solid recommendation.Plus the whole tk subplot although hammy had some really cool culminations. Good stuff. 3.5/5",6,0,11,1 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Powerful
","I'm not sure what I expected from Cloud Atlas except for its lengthy running time but whatever they were they were excelled. Cloud Atlas is a truly moving and unique experience. The film follows several different story lines over a very long time period that are somehow connected and affect each other.Like many films of a similar nature some story lines work more than others depending on how they engage you and how they are executed. The most powerful and emotionally resonant for me were the Sonmi 451 storyline which just blew me away and the one concerning the closeted gay composer. All had great moments and were impressive for different reasons in their own rights. As for the performances Tom Hanks is well enough but his multiple roles and extreme differences are a lot to pull off and he does well enough with them. More impressive is Halle Berry who has less to do in the film but reminds you why she won that academy award by giving a solid variety of different performances. My favorite performance of the movie was from Doona Bae an extremely talented actress most powerful as Sonmi 451 , I also really liked the sexy and talented Jim Sturgess in that storyline as well as well as the one in which he plays an ill writer. Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant, yes Hugh Grant are rather good as well. The only performance I wasn't huge on was that of Hugo Weaving. He's been way better in other films but never very good in my opinion. But at this point he's more of a staple of The Wachowskis. And speaking of them and the films direction the Wachowskis started off really solidly with the noirish thriller Bound and followed that up with the first accomplished Matrix film but ever since than it's been a mixed bag. This is without a doubt the grandest and most ambitious film they've ever done and thats saying something and it's also their most solid feature since the first Matrix but it's far from flawless the bits directed by them are mostly good but their are a few questionable choices here and there which make you feel the films length. The same goes for Tom Twyker who had an amazing debut with Run Lola Run but hasn't followed it up with much his bits are good here as well and he does fare a bit better in some aspects but the film does need a bit of fine tuning. The spfx are amazing as expected especially considering the films smallish budget for something of this magnitude and I have to give extra credit to the films different age and character make ups they are truly incredible. All in all it's a really solid experience some moments are better than others but the films underlying message is inspired and unforgettable. it's without a doubt the bravest, most ambitious film I've seen this year and one of the best. 4/5",8,6,11,5 November 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," David Slade finally nails the material!!!!
","Twilight the book series area guilty pleasure written in such a way that makes it very easy to connect with it's characters and story lines. twilight the original film was a big time guilty pleasure. Quality wise it wasn't very good, uneven performances, uneven direction accompanied by some slick cinematography, a great soundtrack and an entrancing chemistry from Pattinson and Stewart. It's sequel fared much better. Although critically trashed the film was made for the fans. Anyone whose read New Moon knows how extremely close it is to the book. All the good and all the bad that film was accompanied by a solid lead performance from Stewart, some truly inspiring cinematography, a giant helping of wonderful creative and confident direction. This installment Twilight Saga Eclipse is a merging of the formula that both those films so successful and add it's own touch of pizazz with Director David Slade who just absolutely nails the material. Fans will love, the regular movie going audience will love it, critics seems to be loving it for te most part it's just a great movie. The performances are so solid in this film and the chemistry between the main threesome of main characters is so enthralling and believably complex in this installment. the effects seem to have been cleaned up and refined, the cinematography is once again beautifully striking although not as creative last time around, the score is breathtaking and the film just feels fresh, like nothing you've ever seen before. The film is just so entertaining and involving on so many levels but almost flawless with the exception of two things why change Victoria from Levre to Howard. I mean Howard didn't have a big enough role to merit that change. If it was performance they were looking for I could understand Howard being a better actress. But it just seemed to be a wasted change. And the one thing I hated was Bella's wig it just looked awkward and weird in so many scenes besides that the new editions to the story line fill it out nicely if only for a brief period of time and at the center of this truly brilliant film is just a theme of graduation, self discovery and decisions and not in the way you would be led to believe something we've all experienced. It was just wonderful without a doubt the best of the series, the best of the summer, the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I just can't see them topping this one.",8,20,44,30 June 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," the coolest movie I've ever seen!!!!
","One would think walking into a film that's been shelved for 3 years that the result wouldn't be very positive. But you'd be wrong because the reasoning behind this films delay is due to the bankruptcy of MGM the releasing company. What stands is one of the cleverest, freshest genre films ever made. If you've seen any of the trailers of TV spots you can pretty much tell that the film takes the clichéd set up of teens visiting a cabin in the woods and flips it on its head. To say anything else would spoil too much for you but Cabin in the Woods is so smart in the way it tacles it's material not pandering down to the clichés up engaging and expoliting the material and twisting it unforeseen and energetic ways. The film clocks in at about 98 mins and there's not a drawn out spot in the films entire running time. it's filled with inspired direction from Drew Goddard of 'Let me In' fame showing off his talents in a more efficient way here strong self aware performances from a good cast most notably Franz Kranz as the films fool and sexy Chris Hemsworth in the 'alpha male' role as well as an extremely seductive Jesse williams as 'the scholar' my new obsession lol. The film also employs some very missed old school horror movie feats like classic monsters and gory makeup effects. The result is simplistic in it's entertainment value but as complex a film a stheyc ome. It's entertaining, funny, a little scary and wonderfully inventive. Without a doubt one of the if not the coolest film I've ever seen and definitely one of the best movie s ever!!!",10,2,10,13 April 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," Truly remarkable
","Initially when first seeing this I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean I thought it was cool but it felt very 'style over substance'. Years late I've watched it countless times and I definitely have a different opinion of it. Its without a doubt one of the wildest, creative, pulse pounding, unique films ever made. The star of the movie is of course Furiosa played by a fierce Charlize Theron whom justly won an oscar for it. Nicholas Hoult is the second most interesting character and his journey is truly emotional and engaging. And well the title character Mad Max is the third most interesting character. Tom Hardy does a solid job of playing him crazy but the role is underwritten and mostly depends on his impressive physicality. Set years after the third film and Max has failed to help the tribe of children. He's constantly haunted by them and finds himself suddenly thrust into a harrowing situation in which Furiosa betrays her boss and decides to help his wives to escape. The action scenes are thrilling and have a real raw energy to them. The score is wonderfully intense and epic and the cinematography and stunt work are something truly magical and need to be seen to be believed. In the end it's not completely able to shake some thin spots but overall it's one of the best films ever made.",9,1,2,16 February 2020
The Great Gatsby," Luhrman's worst film
","I've been a long time fan of Mr. Luhrman. Strictly Balloom, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Austrilaia are amongst my favorite films. And Moulin Rouge is my favorite film of all time. I enjoy it's manic creative intensity that gives his films a memorable original flair not seen in any other films. So it is with sadness that I say that The Great Gatsby is a huge disappointment. The combination of modern day music and Luhrman's visual dazzle may have sounded like a good idea on paper but it makes the film feel disjointed and unrelatable. Although I'm not too familiar with the source material I'm assuming shadings of it come through but overall I'm not sure anything much comes through at all. The film starts out chaotically enough like Moulin Rouge (a little too simlar in fact) but than it begins to settle and there is a moment when you think Oh this a love story and than the focus strays away and we are left confused again. The performances are decent with a few too many unintentionally funny moments. these are fine actors here just not in their best form. As for the films visuals they are indeed stunning but feel unnecessary in translating such a storyline. And well the direction feels a little directionless the party scenes are fun but nothing seems to be going anywhere or amounting to much. the hyper intensity displayed throughout the film doesn't fit the proceedings at all constantly leaving you feeling a little bored with a stunted sense of empty awe. This is without a doubt Luhrman's worst film. That being said it's not a horrible film there is still some stuff to see here the modern soundtrack is electrifying if not fitting. The party scenes and cinematography although unnecessary are wondorous. I'm not sure when he started to disconnect with the material but I'm willing to forgive this little blip on his resume in hopes that he will get back to his more traditional, original faire. 2.5/5",5,1,4,15 May 2013
The Proposal," Charming but expected
","Hunky Ryan Reynolds and the always dependable Sandra Bullock are the mvps of this otherwise generic rom com. Betty White of course always adds some life and is the ultimate scene stealer. Bullock plays a driven book editor who finds out shes being deported because her work Visa has expired. In a last minute ditch effort she says her and her assistant the sexy, charming Reynolds are getting married. After a proposal to save her career and some immigration officers on their tales they have to visit his family in Alaska for his grandmothers birthday. The movie is fun but expected and if I'm being honest their chemistry is more friendly than fiery. That being said there are some big laughs, it's all in good fun and its entertaining which is the point.",7,0,0,23 February 2020
Warm Bodies," Surprisingly great
","This movie came as a surprise to most people when it was initially released. I expected great things from it after having read the book and that's exactly what I got. Warm Bodies is a charming teen zom rom com. What makes it works as well as it does is the effective chemistry between R played a sexy Nicholas Hoult and a feisty Teresa Palmer. The supporting work from John Malkovich, Analeigh Tipton, Dave Franco and especially Rob Corddry isn't to shabby either. Jonathan Levine takes his premise seriously but also with a winking eye. The movie can be creepy, funny and romantic and the red stuff is kept to a minimum but is there surprisingly. Also impressive is Levines screenplay it keeps the story, engaging and creative taking the concept into unexpected and appreciated areas. All in all it's a fun, surprising little gem that's quite entertaining.",8,1,1,23 February 2020
Warm Bodies," I <3 this movie
","Adapting a popular novel to film is always a very challenging thing. You have to try and please the fan base as well as making it accessible enough so that people can find a way to relate to it. It's even trickier when that source material is so uniquely weird. It's a hard thing to pull off such a successful adaptation and that is the reason why Warm Bodies is so damn impressive. Centering around a zombie who calls himself R played by the adorable Nicholas Hoult who while on a hunting spree with his fellow undead finds himself falling in love with Julie played by the really impressive Teresa Palmer, one of my new favorites. There's a little more to it than that but it's hard to explain without it sounding a little too bizarre. I myself have read the book and was a big fan of it and although the film differentiates from the source material it really nails the feel and ultimate message of it all while remaining true to it and just completely committing itself to it's cooky concept. In some instances it even enhances it with subtext of about adolescence, human connection and society in general. It also helps that strong performances populate the film throughout most notably by the 2 leads and Rob Corrdry as Marcus R's best friend. The film is funny, a little gross, a little scary and just really endearing. It's a sweet but dark valentine for people who want there rom coms a little edgy. Zombie fans may be a little disappointed at the films lack of actual horror but if their open will find an exciting new angle to revisit the now clichéd material. I've heard a lot of people comparing this film to Twilight and the truth is although I'm a fan of that series this is far more complex, clever and not as mushy. Warm Bodies is a film that should be celebrated as it takes the chance to break new ground and for that alone in a slew of unnecessary remakes and sequels that is a truly special thing. 4/5",8,4,9,3 February 2013
Jurassic Park," A popcorn masterpiece
","I still continue to be blown away by the sheer awesomeness of this movie. I remember being dropped off at the theater in the summer of 1993 with my little brother, not knowing what to expect. And basically nearly crapping my pants. I mean at 13 it scared the utter crap out of me. It was the first movie with digital surround sound and it was amazing. Steven Spielberg's popcorn masterpiece has a number of sequels at this point but nothing even comes close to the original. It's scary, funny, smart and action packed. It's nearly flawless in every way from the perfect performances pretty much all around except for some questionable moments from Dern. The movie's spectacular effects also hold up surprisingly well. It's still the best blending of practical and CGI to date. The characters are developed enough to care about and the movies pacing is perfect from the awe inspiring thrills of the first third to the primal terror in its final half. Truly one of the best and scariest movies ever made.5/5",10,1,1,5 March 2020
Atonement," the reason i got o the movies...
","ATONEMENT: FOCUS 2007 color 123 m Rom/Drama Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave, Saoirse Ronan and Brenda Blethyn star. Written by Christopher Hampton Directed by Joe Wright Rated R for language, sexuality and adult themes.I was privaleged enough to see the film 'Atonement' tonight. A film that reminds me of all the reasons I go to the movies. I couldn't possibly even begin to praise this sensational film enough but here let me try. This second pairing of director Joe Wright and Keira Knightley is even more successful than there last go around with Pride and Prejudice. Although i throughly enjoyed that film I found spots in it to be a little long and the film ultimately offered up nothing more than witty adult entertainment. This time around the film centers on three central characters Cecilia (Knightley) Robbie (McAvoy) and Briony (portrayed by three actresses through the years). Cecilia and Robbie have spent their entire lives growing up next to one another until one hot, fateful summer evening they decide to finally embrace there emotions and tell each other how they truly feel. Briony witnesses some events through child's eyes and through a moment of jealousy lies, blaming the rape of her cousin on Robbie. He is torn away from his Cecilia that very evening and it isn't until almost five years later that she finally admits to making the whole thing up. Cecilia and Robbie are separated by the lie through jail time and than war but still remain very much in love. The film chronicles many things but the central theme is the consequences of telling a lie. And how it alters the fates of everyone around it. The film is very sad. One of the most effectively emotional films ever made. It's a sumptous feast for the senses from the picturesque cinematography. Which features some of the most beautiful shots ever found on film. Shots that radiate passion, wonder, creativity and enthrallment. It also features a wildly creative score enfused with the sounds of typing reminding us of the written word and how powerful it is throughout. The performances are all top notch. It's hard to put into words on how truly great these performances are. Keira Knightley is at the top of her game here and at such a young age. She manages to embody years of longing within a single glance. James McAvoy is wonderfully handsome and a fantastic treasure to behold as Robbie a gentleman to the end. Filled with such rage and such softness at the same time. He has a stirring intenstity throughout. His chemistry with Knightley is stellar and there scenes together are hauntingly romantic and will stay with you long after the film is over. This film will stay with you long after it's over. The direction from Joe Wright is monumentous. He is one of the most talented directors out there today. Althhough he showed a spark of professionalism in his previous film. Here he grabs this story head on and makes this films every moment completely enthralling and original. This may be the best film I've ever seen. I have emotions streaming out of my every pore and a headful of memories from the film that feel like my own. It's very rare to see such a spectacle. In the words of my friend it's just a privilege really. Atonement captures what the Notebook and Titanic aimed for but couldn't quite engulf. It's more than the best film of the year and one of the best films I've ever seen. It's one of the best experiences I've ever had.*****/5",10,2,3,1 January 2008
