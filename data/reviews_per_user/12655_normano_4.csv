Mission: Impossible III," Great but Cruise's off-screen antics spoiled it for me
","I quite enjoyed the story and action in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as the villain - so cool yet nasty.Beautifully shot, fast paced story - there's not much I can fault it on. The only thing that really ruins it for me is Tom Cruise. Every time I see him I can't get the image of him couch jumping and acting a fool on Oprah. I just don't buy his acting like a serious person. Kind of like seeing Weird Al Yankovic in a romantic drama.Part of the reason I rated this so poorly is because of the ridiculous ways Ethan gets himself out of ridiculous situations. What should I have expected from a film of this title I guess... It got to a point where I just thought that it was too much. No one person could always have luck on their side.One point for the beautiful cast and one point for Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. I think I've had enough of this series - and of Tom Cruise.",2,0,1,5 November 2006
Ocean's Twelve," What the ...?
","Man I loved Ocean's 11.Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed.SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.END SPOILER.Wait until it comes on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this.",1,24,35,29 December 2004
Meet the Fockers," Better than the original!
","I saw this with my wife and was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be more of the same from the original but after seeing a preview of the 'footy ball' scene on Jay Leno I thought we should give it a try.With the original I found the grilling of Gaylord by his potential father-in-law funny and amusing. But when the whole movie is full of it, it gets very annoying very quickly. Fortunately for this sequel, it has a saving grace in the form of Gaylords parents, Bernie and Roz. What a breath of fresh air. I feel stuffy and uptight while watching DeNiro (maybe cos DeNiro's character is stuffy and uptight) but when it switches to Bernie and Roz I relax and the laughs came out a lot easier.Maybe I felt for Gaylord after going through the same thing when I was in the process of marrying my wife.I have a 1.5 year old son but the baby in the movie just annoyed me. The baby in the movie though was quite smart in baby signing.This movie is good fun. A more balanced experience than the first movie and my wife and I definitely enjoyed it more. Unfortunately after this movie my wife and I saw the ridiculous Oceans 12. Maybe we should've just gone home after seeing Meet The Fockers...",8,0,2,30 December 2004
Cars," Excellent movie for the whole family...
","This movie opened here in Sydney, Australia today and my son was eager to see it so I took him as soon as I picked him up from daycare.I knew he was going to love it but I also found myself enjoying it very much. At times I couldn't control myself and burst out laughing aloud. I think it loosened up some of the other adults in the cinema and they started laughing as well.The graphics were awesome. The amount of details such as reflections in each scene, etc was amazing. I need to own this movie. If only they were taking advanced orders for the DVD already.In a nutshell, the movie is about Lightning McQueen's awakening from being a selfish, arrogant person/ car to one who realises the value of friendship. A truly feel-good movie for the whole family.The only thing that bothered me in regards to my son was the one part where there was name calling - the part where someone referred to McQueen as a moron/ retard (can't remember). I just didn't want my son picking that up and referring to other kids in that way. But that was very slight. One word, two seconds. The rest of the movie was amazing. For the first time my son sat still for a whole two hours!! Well done, Pixar. An amazing movie that I want to own already. I hope they make a sequel and put as much effort into the story and character development as they did in this one.Do yourselves a favour and see this for yourselves and if you have kids, take them along. It's not just a boy movie. Being a cartoon and not overly macho all kids should enjoy it.",10,1,1,8 June 2006
