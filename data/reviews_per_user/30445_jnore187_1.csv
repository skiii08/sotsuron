Scarface," al pacinos role as tony montana shows hes one of the best
","Theres probaly no other actor that could of played this role no where near as good as Al Pacino.His performance in Scarface is what made him my favorite actor.Even if you dont like the story to Scarface its worth watching just to see how good of an actor Al Pacino is.But i think its a good story and a good line of supporting actors as well.Michelle Phieffer throws in a good performance also.She doesnt have that much of a part in it but the scenes shes in has some powerful acting.Scarface is what set the standard for todays street dramas.Its explosive ,directed well,and powerful writing by Oliver Stone.",10,0,0,26 March 2000
