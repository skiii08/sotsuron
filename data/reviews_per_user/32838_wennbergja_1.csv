Ford v Ferrari," An Old-Fashioned Race Car Drama
","A slick, thrilling look back at the golden age of auto racing. Ford v Ferrari is an old-fashioned film, not only due to the fact it takes place in the mid-60's but also in the way it is directed, the story being told, and the experience delivered in the theatre. The film is a tip of the hat to old-school movies about people with real-life problems. Well-directed, well-written, well-delivered.",7,1,2,1 March 2020
