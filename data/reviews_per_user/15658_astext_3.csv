Blade Runner 2049," Somewhat pointless
","Can't work out what the point of this film is. It rambles around, getting itself lost, for the most, in the somewhat bland and underwhelming scenery. As for Ryan Gosling, all I can say is, a lump of wood would have been more expressive. Is it a thing that replicants have little or no emotion? If so, job well done, but of couyrse, that isn't true at all when finally, 50 minutes before the end, the Deckard character appears. Have to say, Ford made the movie, he is obviously into the part and made the most of his limited screen time. I was completely uninterested in the tired 'find my family' obsession that so many films have used before. One of my pet hates is ridiculous hairstyles for male actors. In The Force Awakens, Ford as Han Solo has a very ridiculous bouffant (how come he agreed to let that happen?) that makes him look silly. So happily in BR2049, he's got a good haircut, and he looks the part.Did not enjoy the soundtrack either. The big pad sweep sound that denotes coming into view of a breathtaking panorama, so effective in the original, is here flogged to death and used for any kind of scene intro, thus negating any thrill the viewer has from this signature musical association.I'm sure I shall glean a little more from it when I rewatch it.",3,2,3,17 January 2018
Children of Men," Vile propaganda
","I thought this film was grossly offensive. It presents a completely hysterical, one dimensional view. The movie is a full on anti western propaganda screed, intent on presenting a very one sided, one dimensional view of certain issues. As such, it is nothing more than a nasty polemic which does not attempt in any way to present a balanced view, or a balanced projection of the future. It is loaded with anti-west, anti-establishment clich√©s. The greater hypocrisy is that this message is intended as 'free speech' - the same freedom they deny to anyone who disagrees with them.I feel this film is contemptible in every way, nothing more than agit prop to push the same tired old barrows that have actually caused the current fouled up situation in the UK.",Null,13,22,15 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a waste
","Most of the reviews I've read here confirm the negative opinions I had on watching this tiresome film.There is a litany of offenses here: the vapid plot - it doesn't grab your interest at the start, and goes downhill from therethe woefully unlifelike aliens which looked like they were plastic dummies - was this a badly executed exercise in 'let's not use cgi for some of this to achieve a more realistic effect'the storm troopers have had their day. they came across as boring and dated. for the plot to depend on one of them being a wimp and defecting is very implausible.This criticism extends to planets and other scenarios etc All feeble and inadequate. Was the budget blown by giving Ford, Fisher and Hammil fat undeserved pay cheques leaving not much left for the film? (O, and Ford is going to do another Indiana Jones? - - wow . . )A good Star Wars episode is part travelogue and a part adventure and this never succeeded.Incredibly inadequate and ridiculous is my general summary. Followed by underwhelming, uninspiring. I hate to say it but I skipped sections of it as the boredom threshold sank lower and lower. I just wasn't interested in what was happening.Finally, one thing which alone was a show stopper. Harrison Ford's crappy hair. You'd think that they could Mad Max him up a bit, have him being more macho, with a buzz-cut and not looking like a complete grandad dag. After all, they've ha ha 're-invented' the whole concept in all other ways, but apparently, they still get their hair stylists from the 1950s and for some mysterious reason the producers just don't get it.",1,28,33,13 April 2016
