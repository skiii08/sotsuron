National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Though often implausible, 'Book of Secrets' is a gloriously exciting show
","Though often implausible, Turteltaub's sequel to his 2004 box office smash is a gloriously amusing show, lush wish creativity and heaps of excitement. It rings many of the same bells that National Treasure did, which it seems to be okay with, yet the hunt it proceeds to take its viewer's on is a much grander one, which, essentially, makes it feel more important.Ben Gates' great-great grandfather is implicated as a conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln following the turn-up of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), a descendant of an under-appreciated historical figure, who makes the claim and supports it with a missing page to John Wilkes Booth's diary. Ben and his National Treasure companions (Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha and Jon Voight) collaborate with Ben's mother, a University professor (played by 2006 Oscar-winner Helen Mirren), to prove the innocence of Thomas Gates, and, in the meantime, unearth Cibola, the legendary City of Gold.Book of Secrets surpasses its predecessor with more thrills and even more high-caliber Hollywood names, and is, at times, blissfully reminiscent of Spielberg's classic (and far superior) Indiana Jones series. It's perhaps the most thrilling Disney release since The Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's certainly a wonderful experience that can be shared with people of all ages, and family, too.",7,0,1,26 December 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too.
","Jagshemash! Sacha Baron Cohen, star of HBO's hit comedy series, 'Da Ali G Show,' further embraces the Kazakh TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev, extending his ludicrous mannerisms and farcical cultural habits to us by way of the most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too. 'Borat' is a new breed of cinema; one in which insolent humor and audacious pranks are loaded upon unsuspecting persons with neither regret nor apology. This class of comedy is one unafraid of all those out there who will, with their every breath, attempt at discrediting its material. And it is of no fantasy that this film will be a target for many to pursue in the months following its release. The film's crude go-about-things is relentless in its hunt to abash and debase any and all social cliques, glorified unions and self-reputed organizations. However, beneath the barbaric slaughtering of all targeted by this film (which varies from Jews, Gypsies, gays and blacks to Feminists and cowboys and the American Fraternity) is concealed a furtively executed pearl of comedic cinema; one that will only grow in its likability, despite being anything but. As would say Borat, 'Great success!'",9,4,14,4 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," involving story that lacks in comic relief, quality acting and never really presents its villain
","I enjoy the film for its fun action sequences (aside from the over-rated pod race), and instigating story. Nearly a split between a 5 and a 6 (out of 10), though, because of a few good performances and the beautiful cinematography, I gave it the better half of the 5.Actor to character analysis:Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn -- Neeson provides yet another exceptional performance as the positively bull-headed Jedi knight who takes it upon himself to train the young, mysterious Anakin Skywalker. His performance: 8.5/10 Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi -- Ewan dishes a performance of slightly above-average status as the soon-to-be mentor to the chosen one. His performance: 8/10Natalie Portman as Queen Padme Amidala -- The only thing I can say in her behalf is that she was miscast. To be honest, the performance she delivers to this film is among the worst of her career. Well below-average performance: 4.5/10 Jake Lloyd as young Anakin -- Not to dismiss his acting ability, his performance was awful. Unfortunately, the ability he shows in the movie IS the extent of his ability. The casting of Lloyd as Anakin was a major miss! The performance: 3/10Last, thought not least, Ray Park as the extremely dangerous Sith Lord, Darth Maul -- I LOVED Park as Darth Maul! However, I was extremely disappointed in the makers of the film for not using him more. Darth Maul is among the greatest villains in cinematic history, and with that, one of the most underused gems of the screen as well. Park's performance: 8/10 -- In his infrequent and brief screen time, he subconsciously persuaded the audience to side with him, for finally a villain presented his or herself to be truly evil; something Vader couldn't fully pull off.Ahmed Best's contribution as Jar-Jar was a waste. I'm not going to dog on him, for in the eyes of the filmmakers, he did his part. Though, I believe Jar-Jar to be the film's largest mistake. So much could have been without Binks, such as a more serious approach to a film that tried and tried to provide some humor -- at which the film's creators failed miserably. In addition, it could have clipped the film's 2 hr. and 13 min. running time -- one that is not unbearably long, but unbearable because of Jar-Jar. The only reason I can think of Jar-Jar's existence is that the Gungans (his alien race) are needed by the Queen to help resist an attack by the Federation's clone army. Still, did they really have to insert the annoying dialect and silly Jar-Jar character?",5,1,2,6 August 2005
3:10 to Yuma," As pure a Western as there's been since 2005's 'The Proposition'
","A remade version of the '57 Glen Ford picture of the same name, James Mangold's amped '3:10' is as pure a Western as there's been since 2005's 'The Proposition.' Tacking on an extra 25 minutes to his adaptation, Mangold proves a knack for the Western style, bringing to life a genre that seemed to have been gasping its last breaths, and stylishly retelling a model story for a modern audience.His film, like the original, focuses on two men: Ben Wade (played marvelously by Russell Crowe), the fastest, most feared gun in the West; and Dan Evans (Bale), an unconfident, self-demoralizing rancher and Civil War vet. As Dan and his two sons go looking for their lost cattle, they approach the scene of an overturned armored carriage, which had just been maliciously attacked by Wade and his trusty gang. As it turns out, Wade had taken Dan's cattle and used it as a diversion in the robbery. Subsequently, Dan and his boys head back to the town of Bisbee, after gathering their livestock, to report the incident to town officials and inform them of Wade's intent to arrive there sometime shortly.When Wade is captured off his guard with a woman in Bisbee, railroad director Grayson Butterfield offers a fine reward of $200 to anyone willing to escort Mr. Wade to contention, from where a train will depart to Yuma prison at approximately 3:10. Reluctantly, given the much-needed sum of the reward, Evans  whose unproductive land has been plagued by droughts and harassing attempts to force he and his family out for the sake of the railroad's construction  accepts the task, alongside four other volunteers (including a bounty-hunting Peter Fonda).From then on, the film explodes into one of this year's most exhilarating films  as Wade's grisly right-hand man, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), leads a murderous brigade after the rescue of their leader  and culminates with a blood-bathy, gun-blazing conclusion that will have every hair on your body standing straight. Additionally, the performances are truly absorbing, especially those delivered by specialists Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, who delivers a performance that is heart-breaking, captivating, and uplifting all in the same. In fact, his character's struggles  the burdening thought that he is unable to aptly perform on his land due to an injury he sustained in the war that cost him one of his legs; and the exhausting notion that he's failed his family and himself because he can't provide for them as much as he'd like  are so despairing that we hurt for him on a very real, even physical, level.The summation of all of '3:10''s gleaming aspects is a very big one  a valuable reward we get for the price of admission  and comes without the danger of escorting a vigilante as brooding as Ben Wade. Since the release of his previous film, 'Walk the Line,' James Mangold has been knocking on stardom's door. Well, '3:10 to Yuma' blows that door down  and does so fashionably, with a heap of the Old West's most volatile dynamite.",8,1,2,15 September 2007
United 93," This movie is aberrantly sound; perfectly synchronized in every way and will go down as one of cinema's most monumental achievements when it's all said and done.
","Paul Greengrass, acclaimed director of 'Bloody Sunday' and 'The Bourne Supremacy,' provides this film with intensity beyond climax; tautly and intoxicatingly retelling the events of the ill-fated journey of United Airlines flight 93, which would cease its travel in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Breaching my personal list of the '100 Greatest Movies Ever Made,' Greengrass' '93' is easily the most emotionally strenuous film in a decade, leaving its viewers shocked and still and utterly silenced in horror by its conclusion, which, despite being a film of unparalleled quality, couldn't come too soon. This film could go down as one of the greatest un-enjoyable movies ever made, alongside disturbing epics such as 'Schindler's List' and Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ.' From the film's opening sequences to its HEART-POUNDING finale, I was on the plane, alongside the heroes, straight as a statue as I saw the dismay unravel. My knuckles were clearer than ice as a result of clinching my fists with such vigor. The tension was so disheartening I couldn't blink, leaving my eyes cracked as soil outliving a drought. My body was frozen; it was minutes before I could even move, and my shirt had doubled in size because my heart was beating through my chest with such force. United 93 is downright essential cinema. Unfortunately, due to its relentless psychological strain, I can't recommend it to anyone not prepared to witness one of the most brutally disquieting motion pictures of our time. The editing, the sound; sound editing, cinematography, acting, direction, screenplay, historical accuracy; it's all flawless. This movie is aberrantly sound; perfectly synchronized in every way and will go down as one of cinema's most monumental achievements when it's all said and done.",10,0,1,22 October 2006
I'm Not There," Abstract, poetic, not entirely enjoyable...yet recommended
","Given its title in reference to an outtake off of one of Dylan's studio recordings (which can be found on the film's two-disc soundtrack), Todd Haynes' ethereal bio-depiction of the folk music legend plays out like a moving Picasso abstract, displaying several stages of Bob Dylan's long-lived day through several alter egos. I'm Not There is an insightfulyet extremely obscurelook into the life and times of the man it attempts to uncover and showcases a handful of actors that are as luminous as their characters.Marcus Carl Franklin plays an 11-year-old vagabond and blues-belting prodigy named Woody Guthriea name he informally borrowed from the post-depression era folk musician. The young boy's intellect is far beyond what anyone would expect of someone his age, though his age seems to be a blanketing pretense behind which Haynes conceals the hopeful and naïve stage of Dylan's journey to stardom. Retrospectively, Jack Rollins (played magnificently by Christian Bale) is a once-enthusiastic folksinger and protester whose confident outlook took a grim turn to cynicism. In Heath Ledger's portrayal, his character, an actor named Robbie Clark, falls victim to his Hollywood-esquire lifestyle, which chips away at his marriage and provokes a scornful, agitated side of his (similar to that of Jack Rollins', who he actually plays in one of his films) that pushes away everyone closest to him. Richard Gere is a secluded ex-thief named William who signifies Dylan's fixation on mythic Western tales, and Cate Blanchettwho emerges as the film's focal studyis a restless, troubled reflection of Dylan's mid-to-late-60s celebrity. As these characters' stories unravel in a not-so-comprehendible way, the story as a wholethe big picture, if you willis narrated by the voice of Kris Kristofferson, with snippets of Ben Whishaw's 19-year-old poet, an incarnation of Arthur Rimbaud, cut in.Give credit to Mr. Haynes, he's transformed the heretical style of Dylan's ever-evolving lyricism into a poetical cinematic experience as unconventional as I've ever seen. I'm Not There is considerably admirablethough perhaps too conceptual to be considered an overwhelmingly enjoyable timeand, in addition to its artsy, detailed go-about-things, bursts charismatic tunes of Dylan's hailed career and Dylan-inspired songs from some of today's most stimulated artists (including Eddie Vedder, Jack Johnson, Iron & Wine and Calexico) that stress a case to further its likability. If you areor ever have beena fan of Bob Dylan, his music, his story, or any of the superstar actors that play him, I'm Not There is worth your time and money, and may just turn out a well-made choice at the movies.",7,4,10,25 November 2007
Superbad," Perhaps the most crude, vulgar, profane movie of all time... and one of the funniest, too.
","We've all been there  'there' being high school  and we've all encountered that certain awkwardness when dealing with such things as partying and, well, girls. 'Superbad' is a movie about that uncomfortable space  the space between cool and un-cool, fun and sex, and, essentially, friendship and all that comes after. The team that brought us 2005's '40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' back in June has again raised the bar for future R-rated comedies with this raunchy teen sex romp that immerses itself in crudity and profanity, so much even, it surpasses the level of vulgarity and reaches an impossible gauche nirvana. The film's dialogue is shocking, shameful, outrageous and offensive, and comes at an alarming rate, never-before seen and you know what? It's hilarious! 'Superbad,' written by 'Knocked Up''s own Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who executive-produced 'KU,' makes 'Fargo' seem like a daycare nap time movie and turns Borat into a boy scout, with its aggressive, foul-mouthed approach. Yet despite its obnoxious script, it somehow manages to win over its audience with its genuine portrayal of high school life and the sincerity of its two main characters, Seth and Evan.Jonah Hill plays Seth, Evan's dirty-minded best friend who used to have a condition, 'shared by 8% of all kids' we're told, which caused him to draw unlimited pictures of the male sex organ. Evan, played by 'Arrested Development''s Michael Cera, is the straight-faced good-hearted guy whose sarcasm mediates Seth's smuttiness. Seth and Evan are socially inept high school seniors with the looming days of college initiating their separation. All Seth wants to do is hook up with a girl before he goes to college, whereas Evan has his eyes, and hopes, set on a relationship with his longtime crush. When the two boys are invited to the biggest party of the year, at which Evan's crush and Seth's target will be 'wasted,' their world takes a turn for the lucky. That is until, in their mindless attempt to be 'cool,' they're stuck with the responsibility of providing the party with its alcohol. That presents a huge problem. Insert: McLovin. The '25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor,' known to his classmates as Fogell (played by riotous newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), offers to do his only two friends, Seth and Evan, the favor of their life by buying the alcohol with his brand-new false ID.The movie is sharply filmed, for a comedy or otherwise, and its unadulterated editing makes its subject matter feel fresh and authentic. Much like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad' is laden with pop culture references and rings the bell of high school renditions in the vein of Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused.' The insight of producer Judd Apatow, director Greg Mottola's appetite for a retro-80's feel, Jonah Hill's potty-mouth, Michael Cera's deadpan sarcasm, and, well, McLovin, make 'Superbad' the funniest movie of the year and an instant classic for the coming ages. For the 18 to mid-thirties male demographic, there's perhaps no funnier, more vulgar movie ever. However, those who don't fit that demographic might want to take their earmuffs, or maybe even skip this one altogether.",9,3,8,19 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," Here come the Fuzz!
","'Hot Fuzz,' 'a new comedy from the guys that created 'Shaun of the Dead,'' is a side-splitting entry to the buddy-cop action-com genre, which last saw its box office peak with 2003's 'Bad Boys II.' The film works as both an homage to past cop actioners  including 'Dirty Harry,' 'Lethal Weapon,' and most notably 'Point Break' and the aforementioned 'BBII'  and as its own intelligible whodunit account, packed with well-written characters, constant laughs, witty dialogue, and a non-stop twenty-minute gun-slinging finale that'll leave you salivating for more.Pegg is dealt the role of Nicholas Angel, a London Metropolitan Police Officer, whose dedication and hard work have led to his transfer to London's quite, crime-free countryside village of Sandford. After expressing his displeasure, regarding the transfer, to the Metro Police Service's Chief of Police (Bill Nighy), Angel learns that his reassignment has already been finalized, and finds himself in Sandford by nightfall. Upon arrival, Angel quickly establishes his seriousness about eradicating any and all criminal activity, including the under-aged consumption of alcohol  which has otherwise gone unnoticed or ignored by the village's populace.Time slowly ticks away for Angel as he finds his most thrilling assignment yet to be the pursuit of a winged escapee (a swan), which he tracks alongside partnered police constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, 'Shaun of the Dead'). Over the course of his brief, couple week stint as a Sandford police officer, Angel finds his only friend to be, in reality, Danny, son of Sandford's Chief Inspector Frank Butterman. Though Danny's good intentions seem outweigh his clumsiness as an officer, Nicholas finds him to be quite the annoyance and relishes the moments in which Danny is not bombarding him with silly questions about things that are often insignificant. Nonetheless, after a few beers, the two bond over Nick's past field-action experiences as one of London's finest, and, of course, action movies from Danny's wall-covering collection.Soon enough, the two movie buddies and partnering officers, along with the whole village of Sandford, are beset by a string of sequential 'accidents' which have claimed the lives of a handful of its inhabitants. Convinced that these incidents are, in fact, more than just accidents, Sergeant Angel catches much ridicule from the townspeople and colleagues, most noticeably the 'Andys,' detectives Andrew Cartwright (Rafe Spall) and Andrew Wainwright ('The Bourne Ultimatum''s Paddy Considine). When Angel's most promising suspect, Sandford's local Somerfield supermarket owner, Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), arises, the Sergeant does everything in his power to bring him down. But when Angel is proved to be unsure about his prime suspect, and without any facts or evidence to support his theory, he puts his own safety, and that of his fellow officer, Danny, at risk.Written by Pegg and director Edgar Wright (both of 2004's 'Shaun'), 'Fuzz' capitalizes on its assumption that any film -even one as absurd as 'HF' - can find monstrous success riding on the back of a dexterously constructed line of characters and a simple, yet brainy script. However, this film surpassed just any level of cleverness, integrating small fixtures within its deftly-crafted main story. Guided by the direction and crafty hand of Wright, and propelled by the hysterical performances of previous collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, 'Hot Fuzz' makes for this year's biggest surprise and pre-summer's most enjoyable film. Brace yourself, 'here come the Fuzz.'",9,0,0,21 August 2007
The Prestige," 'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome!
","Christopher Nolan has been on the brink of penetrating Hollywood's elite silver circle of directors since his second feature-film, 'Memento,' which caught the attention of audiences and critics alike and became an instant cult classic. After the tremendous success that was 'Batman Begins,' he assured movie-fanatics across the nation that he was for real. 'The Prestige,' a marvelously directed era extravaganza with top-notch acting and a beguiling script, tells one of the fiercest tales of jealousy, obsession and loathsome rivalry. Christian Bale delivers a tantalizing performance as Alfred Borden, the stories superior magician that lacks the showmanship to be the greatest. Jackman's performance is the perfect counterpoint as he plays the envious adversary who's willing to do anything to uncover his foe's methods. From a technical standpoint, this thriller is nearly faultless, and Nolan magically keeps his audience guessing until the final shot. 'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome! Are you watching closely?",9,2,4,22 October 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity.
","Bravo Guillermo! From the brilliantly perturbed visionary who shared his eerily morose tale of abhorrent warfare and infringed adolescent innocence in 'The Devil's Backbone,' comes the gorgeously sadistic fantasy, 'Pan's Labyrinth.' As quality fantasies seem to do, Del Toro's elegantly haunting 'Labyrinth' infiltrates the mind by way of its intrigue's fantastic visions; in this case, he does so with an alarming tale of Spanish tyranny, disquieting violence and superfluous gore. Not since the likes of Argento's 'Deep Red' and 'Suspiria' has carnage been so immeasurably beautiful. This poignant saga shadows the dreamy adventures of Ofelia, an imaginative young girl who creates the fanciful world of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' in which remarkable creatures of various sorts dwell. As the repressed nation of Spain witnesses its peak in post-war violence, Ofelia's adoptive father is given the responsibility of eradicating any rebellious alliances from the vicinity. While he and his wife struggle with the troublesome happenings outside their home, Ofelia escapes to her favorite place; one rich with wondrous landscapes and unknown fortune. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film of exceptionally rare caliber. Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity. Del Toro's 'Pan's' could very well be this year's 'Fellowship of the Ring,' snagging Oscar nods in the departments of makeup, costume design, set decoration, sound, editing, and art direction; heck, maybe it'll even win a few.",10,7,14,22 October 2006
Hot Rod," Brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy.
","When viewing a movie as silly as 'Hot Rod,' one must sit back, relax, and alter one's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is, in this case, a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy. With a brief runtime of 88 minutes, this film was long past drawn-out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place. 'Hot Rod''s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004's cult hit 'Napoleon Dynamite,' though it's much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter. In fact, the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to 'Napoleon Dynamite' is scornful and offensive, and left me ticked off, instead of just being annoyed.The movie, if one were compelled enough to call it such, poses a paltry story that puts self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us, with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses (one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped, so we're told by Rod) and raising $50,000 dollars for his stepfather's impending life-saving heart operation; all so that he can fight his stepfather, once recovered, and gain his respect because in order to gain one's respect, one must first fight them. Huh? Whatever. Each character is no more interesting than Rod's stick-on mustache, and from the film's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion, each scene played like a nonsensical, and terribly unfunny, SNL skit  which, with the addition of an extra 85 minutes, is, essentially, what 'Hot Rod' strives to be.The film's star, Andy Samberg, contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip-drop of his comedic capabilities. Unfortunately  rather, realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five-year-old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee-pee gags. And if that's disappointing, pull a chair, hide your face in your hands, and brace yourself for the real blow: he IS the film's humor! To rescue them of their mortification, I'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg's co-stars' roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team, director Akiva Schaffer, to his non-existent talent as a director or a comedian. Basically, every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash-course comedy is perfectly portrayed here; and done so arrogantly, as though the film would be funnier that way. Trick yourself into believing that there's even a single laugh in this heap, or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie.",1,12,45,2 August 2007
28 Weeks Later," '28 Weeks Later' is a refined horror in its own, let alone as a sequel.
","Oh, the terror! '28 Weeks Later,' the long-awaited follow-up to 2002's British horror, '28 Days Later,' which was met with much acclamation from critics and horror-hounds the same, was scowled upon by dubious skeptics in its early days of production. The first film was delivered smartly and bluntly, with loads of gory fun; and was at the sure hands of one of Britain's finest, Danny Boyle. So what of '28 Weeks Later?''28 Weeks Later' seems to steer clear of this summer's pack of dimwitted horror sequels (led by Fox Atomic's other release, 'The Hills Have Eyes 2'), with its increased budget and the addition of semi-well-knowns, Robert Carlyle and Jeremy Renner. However, why the change of directors? It's hard enough to transition from a familiar cast to a completely new one, while at the same time maintaining the interest of potential viewers. Though, for a film to change directors, typically suggests a new style  one different from Boyle's shaky under-lit method that brought '28 Days Later' its believable atmosphere; and a dissimilar technique could potentially lose a good part of the first film's fanbase.Well, a very much deserved kudos to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who welcomed the challenge and left not only victorious, but neck-and-neck with Boyle's insight into one of horror's best one-two punches of all time. In fact, Fresnadillo's techniques appear to have been crafted by Boyle himself, who took on the role of executive producer, alongside Alex Garland, for the franchise's second offering. Everything that was seen in Boyle's first chapter is seen here. However, in the sequel, everything's been magnified. There's more terror, more gore and more rage-infested zombies than in the first film; the excitement's been heightened, the panic's been intensified, and this year has found its most clever horror since its own predecessor!The film opens with a husband and his wife (played respectively by Robert Carlyle and the terrific Catherine McCormack), shacked up in a cottage with a four others in rural London. When the cottage is overrun by the infected, Don (Carlyle) escapes to the countryside, leaving his wife and all others for his own safety. After twenty-eight weeks of reconstruction, a secured district guarded by American army forces becomes the temporary home for Don and other estranged refugees, including Don's two children, Tammy and Andy. All's well until the two rascals escape the guarded boundaries, only to return with the virus's passage back into the film.'28 Weeks Later' is reflective of the war in Iraq, and gives wonder to how our troops are keeping containment. The adroitness of Fresnadillo's craft behind the lens is scary in its own. As the panic in the film ensues, it is captured with grave detail by Fresnadillo's mix of sporadic and monotone shots. The acting is anything but what one would expect from any horror film, and is pushed forth by the perfectly cast Jeremy Renner and Catherine McCormack as Alice, who gives a horrifying performance. If I could say one thing about this film, I'd scream to all of the fear, and the fearlessness in which it portrays. It'll bite you and bite you hard, and it won't let go until your heart's skipped twenty-eight beats!",8,2,6,19 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," By film's end, the moral is simple and clear: no matter your troubles, family can help one overcome all broken hopes and delicate fears, with the love only a family can give.
","Little Miss Sunshine is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after it's over. It arouses every smidgen of happiness within you, causing an incessant smirk that never cramps. The sharply-written script by first-time writer Michael Arndt brings a literal meaning to the term 'laugh-out-loud funny,' and mixes wonderfully with Dayton's vision. Never before have I seen a film that had me laughing so relentlessly and wanting to cry at the same time. Beneath the dark and raunchy, sometimes crude humor of Sunshine, awaits a heart-warming treasure of a story, offered with smiles to those who see through to it. There are no standout performances here, though each is precisely portrayed and is done so necessarily. Steve Carell comes out of his short-lived goofy-funny character typecast to deliver the only suiting performance as Frank, the suicidal genius uncle, who so happens to be gay as well. Little Olive is as cute and lovable as any character in recent years and Collette and Kinnear pass well as the feuding parents. Dwayne, Olive's older brother, played lawfully by The Girl Next Door's Paul Dano, is an anger-ridden teen who has pledged a vow of silence until he's achieved his goal of becoming an Air Force test pilot. The funniest, and most vulgar, moments, however, come by way of the foul-mouthed Grandpa, who moved in with his son and daughter-in-law after being kicked out of his retirement home for snorting heroin. This bundle of misfits we know as the Hoover family travel cross-country to enter Olive in a pre-pubescent beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine, though on the way are plagued by hilarious misfortune and tragic loss. By film's end, the moral is simple and clear: no matter your troubles, family - even the weirdos that construct the Hoovers - can help one overcome all broken hopes and delicate fears, with the love only a family can give.",9,2,6,22 October 2006
No Country for Old Men," The best of the Coens since 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo'
","Joel and Ethan Coen created one of American cinema's landmark films in 1996the superbly atmospheric, very bloody, and painfully hilarious 'Fargo', which cemented their elevated status in Hollywood. Sinceaside from 'The Big Lebowski' and their characteristically moody noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There'the two have danced around their obvious forte with films like 'O Brother', 'Intolerable Cruelty', and 'The Ladykillers'. As you'll hear or read all too much about No Country, it's truly a reflection of their greatest works, and it's perhaps their most engrossing and dangerous one yet.In the Coens' guileless and forthright screen version of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 acclaimed novel, Josh Brolin puts in another great performance in his second of two films released within a month of each other ('American Gangster' was released on November 2) as Llewelyn Moss, a welder and inhabitant of a small Texas town who stumbles across an apparent drug-deal gone sournearly a half-dozen bodies, an equal number of bullet-sprayed pick-ups, a truck bed-full of unclaimed drugs, $2 million in cash, and a near-death Mexican who begs him for aquawhile out hunting. He claims the money for himself (as anyone would) and heads back to his humdrum trailer, where he's bombarded with inquiries by his concerned wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald).Later that night, he returns to the bloody site with a jug of water, wherein addition to learning that the only left survivor is now deadhe is shot at and chased by a vicious canine into a streaming river close by. When he staggers to safety, drenched, exhausted and wounded, unbeknownst to him he is now the subject of a plethora of pursuers, most notably Sheriff Bell (played very well by the baggy-eyed Tommy Lee Jones) and a mysterious and terrifying killer named Anton Chigurh, whose murders are provoked by anything from pre-designated assignments to random encounters tothis is greata coin flip (in which case he asks unaware civilians to 'call it' for their right to live).Javier Bardem ('The Sea Inside') is given the part of Chigurh, an unyielding psychopath whose moral principles rival Hitler's. He is the epitome of evilemotionless, nonnegotiableand is absolutely horrifying to even think about. Chigurh is so ominous on his own, in fact, that the Coens don't even bother telling us his name until the last half of the film's final actand by then we've learned why: because any who knew it are already dead. Bardem's portrayal of the murderous villain is as dark and scrupulous as his character (it could garner an Oscar nod), and is one of the most memorable of any in Hollywood history. With the support of his accompanying cast (which also includes Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, a smug conciliator for the drug cartel from which the payoff slips away), Bardem drives this film far past one of the best offerings of recent years and qualifies it as an all-time classic and one of the Coen brothers' best, alongside 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo'.I'm not saying 'No Country' is the greatest movie everit's not, at allbut it does to viewers what few films can: it makes them wary and fearful of the world's very darkest realities. Through the desolate presentation of the Old West (captured impeccably by veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins), and an ingeniously sparse score by Carter Burwell, viewers are given the opportunity to live in the story itself. Though, upon sight of Anton Chigurh, they quickly appreciate their existence as it is: in a movie theater, frozen still and blown away.",Null,1,6,19 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An absolute must-see for fans of the America's longest-standing iconic figure
","Andrew Dominik's 'Jesse James' is a picture of grand scales and grave tales that is as intoxicating as it is disquieting, and as tranquil as it is beautiful. Dominik's scrupulous study of the two title characters never digresses throughout the film's lengthy showcase and permeates the grounded minds and hearts of its viewers, whose once sturdy estimation of Jesse James is demolished in light of the classic outlaw's truest depiction.The explicit detail of Hansen's novel is evident in each scene of 'James' and is transmitted sinuously by Dominik, leaving little difference between the original text and its ensuing screenplay  which unfolds into an exercise on photographed literature that skips from scene to scene poetically and fluidly. In fact, Jesse James is one of the few films I've ever seen in which the dialogue is so cleanly delivered (whether it's in the first person or narrated in the third person) that if one were to close their eyes, they could just as easily visualize the happenings of the film as they could if they were watching it. Yet, the transposed script by Andrew Dominik could undoubtedly have fallen to failure had it not been for his outstanding cast. Fortunately, the cast succeeded, and did so by following the lead of its stars, Pitt and Affleck, who both bid phenomenal performances.Brad Pitt's portrayal of the Missouri bandit will corrupt every molecule of its onlookers through simple, yet inimitable glares and gestures that indicate the brutality of James that rested behind his sunken blue eyes and charming guise. The famed persona could have been offered to no one else, for Pitt becomes every glitch of James, from his ticks to his truths to the long-dismissed turmoil that had pitted itself deep within his soul.Additionally, Casey Affleck, whose depiction of the young, admiring, obsessive Robert Ford is tremendous, conquers the challenge of displaying the most notable hero anti-hero in American history. Affleck's Ford character speaks words that indicate admiration and wonder, yet his body glimmers of dissolved self-assurance. As the film progresses, we see Ford's approving eyes grow dark with disdain for the story's main character, as he approaches the unsettling disposition that gives the film (and, previously, Hansen's book) its gruesome title.In addition to the stellar supporting cast (which includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, and Sam Shepard as Jesse's older brother, Frank), Dominik sets a suitable pace, while also instituting large-scale tension, most apparent in the film's two climactic scenes (the train robbery towards the film's beginning and the assassination, which comes near the film's conclusion). However, the tension in both of these scenes (and for the duration of the picture) is catapulted by Nick Cave's truly haunting score, which is the very best of the year and corresponds impeccably with the desolate scenery and grabbing visuals of Dominik's absorbing motion picture. Directed with tact and tone, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' is an absolute must-see for fans of movies and of the timeless legend of Jesse James, America's longest-standing iconic figure.",8,0,1,17 October 2007
City of God," With an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.
","One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell.The film follows a boy named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), whose dream is to become an accomplished photographer. Growing up, Rocket was raised in a lower-class quarter of Rio's Ciudad de Deus (City of God), in which most of his peers had aspirations of becoming the City of God's next big thing  whether the path they led was bright or familiar. Among them was Lil' Dice, a young boy who ran with a gang of hoodlums whose main intention was stealing, though had killed before.As years progressed, both Rocket and Lil' Dice meandered down very different corridors; Rocket found fulfillment in honesty and kindness, whereas Lil' Dice eventually found himself the city's most infamous drug-runner, Ze Pequeno, or Lil' Ze. Soon before long, the City of God is ravaged by unseen violence, led by Lil' Ze, and Rocket is capturing the horrific footage via his hand-held camera. While Rocket's intentions focus on keeping down an honest, clean path, he finds that he can make amends with both Lil' Ze and the local police, by submitting photos of Ze and his entourage to the tabloids. Win-win for both, eh? Not quite. Even those who find success, struggle in the City of God, and by film's end that fact is recognized by all  and it's not soon forgotten either.The screenplay, adapted by Braulio Mantovani from Paulo Lins' novel of the same name, allows viewers to relate and reside with its characters and surrender their absolute emotion to a film that exhausts each and every emotion imaginable. Retrospectively, Meirelles' demand for the viewer's attention, through unwavering brutality and almost dizzying camera-work, makes for intense movie-viewing and enthralling entertainment. Additionally, the film carries a surrealistic beauty  and is shot with an overexposed lens that brightens the photography and implies perfectly the authenticity of the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro  that elevates the heart when the movie reaches burrowing depths. All in all, 'City of God' is flawless; and with an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.",10,3,7,7 August 2007
I Am Legend," Smith holds the film together almost single-handedly
","In his sophomore offering, director Francis Lawrence (who debuted with 2005's Constantine) successfully turns Richard Matheson's half-century old sci-fi/horror novel into an enjoyable, truly memorable motion picture. Previously twice undertaken (once in 1964 and again in 1971), and both times ineffectively, Matheson's 1954 classic, I Am Legend, proved to be more than a difficult project. Though I'm sure it was no easier this time around (Warner Bros. has been working on this film for 13 years), Lawrence and his superstar, Will Smith, make strong efforts to hide it.Smith plays the lead to Matheson's story (a role formerly played by Vincent Price in '64's The Last Man on Earth and Charles Laughton in '71's The Omega Man), a scientist named Robert Neville, perhaps the last human on earth, who roams the desolation that is New York City with his German shepherd three years following the apocalyptic release of a man-made virus.After losing his family (which includes Smith's real-life daughter, Willow) to the hellish pandemic, Neville sets forth, resilient to find the curehe combines the knowledge and state of his 'immunity' with slab-top experiments he conducts on its mutated victims. Nevertheless, he's a man tortured by the absence of human life, which is brought to the forefront of his psyche by horrible flashbacks (which are beyond disturbing in their plausibility and wrenching in their effect), and recollections of it. And as the film progresses, we watch as the man's burden takes its toll on him, gradually dragging him into madnessa show that is as saddening as it is well done.Set in a not-so-distant future world, in which gas prices are nearly $7 per gallon and the 'cure for cancer' is actually the culprit of the widespread sickness, the film opens with Neville ripping through the Big Apple's vacant streets in his red, white-striped Shelby GT 500, circa 2007, hunting a flock of deer. Subsequently, we learn his strict daily routineexercise, recreation, research, and sleepwhich he maintains for the sake of his sanity and survival.But what would the last man in the world have to survive from? How about unremitting hordes of veiny, hairless mutantsthe products of the virus that decimated the world's population? Understandably, these villains make for the movie's weakest contribution. They feed into prominent horror-movie zombie clichés (super-human speed and strength) and exhibit abysmal CGI, while thrusting the film into action that undermines its initial intelligence.But I Am Legend endures its dreadful flaws by staying closer to the original novel than any other cinematic version, by creating an incredible, eerie scene of desertion in the U.S.'s most lively mega-city (perfectly done with grassy, weed-plagued corners and streams of abandoned vehicles), and by casting the inimitable Will Smith to play its focused study Smith delivers an achingly good performance as the lone man, capturing our favor by allowing us into his predicament through delicate expressions of his own fear and yearning for human life. He probably won't be nominated for an Oscar for his role as Neville, but maybe he should. After all, Tom Hanks was for his part in Cast Away, and the only difference between Hanks' Chuck Nolan and Smith's Robert Neville is that Neville is considerably smarter and defies insanity with proactive rituals and physical conditioning (of course, it's to Neville's benefit that he, unlike Nolan, has an abundance of food and spends all of his time with a wonderful pooch, rather than a volleyball). Regardless, Smith does what few actors can: he holds the film together almost single-handedly and manages to keep viewers' attention for close to two hours.The fact that I Am Legend swings back and forth between two genres is ultimately an advantageous trait, for, though the sci-fi portion is far better, the horror facets instill enough suspense and distribute enough scares to affirm Lawrence's film as one of good quality and massive entertainment.",7,1,4,15 December 2007
The Game," Brilliant directing, flawless acting, fine point-at-hand, yet so unsatisfying.
","Well... what can I say? The movie gets a stellar grade of 7 out of 10, because the acting, directing, editing, music, and cinematography were all very well done. However, despite a genuinely suspenseful thriller that was 'The Game,' I can't help but feel frustrated at the conclusion to the whole ordeal. There are countless instances in which the main character, and the subject of the deadly 'game,' acts abruptly upon whatever trouble finds him, yet is lead to believe that the game-makers, a company called CRS, knew exactly what his actions would be. When viewing the film, one is almost certain to, at some point in the movie, ask themselves: how could they REALLY have known Nick (the main character) was going to do that. I can only suggest to see it for yourself, though I can, and will, do so with a high recommendation.",7,0,0,1 July 2005
The Fountain," An inspired article in an over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema.
","Darren Aronofsky, through his long and tedious struggle to bring his most cherished script to the screen, had accumulated some serious hype around what would eventually become 'The Fountain.' Just under seven years from its conception in the mind of the film's young leader, Aronofsky's richly imaginative story of everlasting love, biblical symbolism, mortality, and boundless metaphysical possibilities hit the Cannes Film Festival with divided acclaim.'The Fountain' starts with a 16th century Spanish conquistador named Tomas (Jackman), who appears to have come across a hidden temple, which rightfully rests amidst the thick ripe foliage of the jungle's core. Subsequent to the slaughter of his miniature battalion, Tomas fights his way through a heavy pack of temple guards, then climbs a steep slope of stairs to reach his desired pyramid's peak. Upon scaling the tall side of the lost temple, the film takes a spontaneous turn into a world of wondrous nothing, where we find a clean-shaven Hugh Jackman in an ecospheric-like bubble, floating toward a golden nebula in the vast realm of outer space.Just before the film could possibly become any more confusing, it swings back to a present day world, where oncologist, Dr. Tommy Creo, has been sleeplessly perusing the potential effects of the contents of a tree in Guatemala, which could stop the continuation of cancerous tumors and rejuvenate their victims. Of course, what would this 'love story' be without the dying, cancer-stricken wife to motivate the tormented scientist-husband? The premise of the flick, being as dubious as would potentially seem, never reaches a melodramatic staleness; in fact, it prospers from its simple, yet intricate, story of undying love. In little time, 'The Fountain' saves itself from disaster, as it finally comes together, piece by piece, and finishes an open-minded work of art, rather than another box-office blunder. Aronofsky's intentions envelope in the thoughts of each viewer, as the journey closes with doors that remain open; and do so in a semi-satisfying quest to provoke questions and lengthy discussions with all movie-goers who shared its viewing.The positives of the picture bask in their gorgeous surrealism, and flow through viewers with poetical sage. Captained by its veteran actor, Hugh Jackman, and supported well enough by Academy Award-winning actress Rachel Weisz, the ostentatious ship of visual wonders that was 'The Fountain,' succeeds as a summer trip to the movies with its unmatched creativity and fine direction; from the only director who could have pulled off such an inspired article in our over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema. To unleash one's intellectual inventiveness is to see 'The Fountain;' dismissing any flaws in film-conception and appreciating where it all came from.",7,1,2,16 July 2007
The Departed," As Frank Costello says so humorously, 'No tickey, no laundry!' To that I say bring all the loads you can muster, 'cause this movie can't fail to wash you to the core.
","Martin Scorcese is among the most influential, masterfully-gifted film directors of all time. He's contributed countless movie classics from his under-the-radar classic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore to his beautifully violent Taxi Driver; his graceful docu-masterpiece The Last Waltz to the unprecedented bio-pic Raging Bull; The King of Comedy, The Last Temptation of Christ, The Color of Money, GoodFellas, his daunting and haunting re-make Cape Fear, Casino, Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, The Aviator. All of these timeless trend-setting genre spectacles amass to a resume in American cinema outdone only by Hitchcock, Ford and Huston. Despite his triumphs in moving pictures, Scorcese has yet to attain his due recognition as Best Director and none of his Academy Award-nominated films have won the prestigious Oscar for Best Picture of the Year. Well, this year's chances are as good as any for his drought to catch some rain. The Departed, an Americanized adaptation of Japan's hugely successful crime-drama, Infernal Affairs, is already being considered a crime-classic for time to come and is Leonardo DiCaprio's most concrete Oscar-prone vessel to date. Each and every performance is teeth-shatteringly good with strong leads from Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone and eight-time nominee, three-time Academy Award-winner, Jack Nicholson. However, outshined are all of these phenomenal actors; and by one I figured least likely to do the deed. Leonardo DiCaprio truly delves into Billy Costigan's persona, becoming the young lad from South Boston. Along with Costigan, Colin Sullivan (Damon) is leading an excessively dangerous double-life. While Colin is moving up the hierarchy at the city's law enforcement branch, Billy's mischievous past and family reputation keep him from staying on the task force. The careers of these two young gentlemen, and their addressing captains (Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen) each amount to the reign of South Boston's organized-crime leader, Frank Costello (Nicholson). Scorcese's expert knowledge on the industry's does and don'ts, leave The Departed the crafty modern masterpiece that it is, and without any splotches. As Frank Costello says so humorously, 'No tickey, no laundry!' To that I say bring all the loads you can muster, 'cause this movie can't fail to wash you to the core.",10,1,2,22 October 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Shot with precision and detailed with informative dialogue, viewers have the opportunity to dwell in the mind of one of the world's most vicious fiends.
","Forest Whitaker inhabits the heartless monster of Idi Amin, Uganda's President from 1971-1979, with ease as he leads a cast of stellar performances in this true story of corruption in a country so hopeless its residents would follow any leader who rose to the opportunity. Subsequently, in 1971, Idi Amin was elected the Ugandan President for some years to come. In the eight years following his initiation, his unflinching thirst for power would lead to deaths of more than 300,000 Hindus, Christians, and Lango tribes. The number of deaths by persecution that Uganda witnessed during Amin's tenure as President stands as one of the highest death tolls one nation's leader has been responsible for since Adolf Hitler. The Last King of Scotland recounts the terrifying story of Amin's rule through the view-point of a young Scottish doctor, who travels to Uganda to aid the fight against disease that the population was succumbing to. James McAvoy, in his most prominent role to date, is fit for the role at hand. We watch his character, Nick Garrigan, as he is adopted into Amin's regime as the President's personal physician. As young Nick realizes the corruption and willful malevolence of the leader, he begins to scheme an overthrow of the reigning dictator; to save his life and the life of thousands of Ugandans. Kevin McDonald goes about his depiction of the events that took place in a fashion reminiscent of 2004's Downfall, which told the story of the last days of Hitler's reign through the eyes of his private secretary. Shot with precision and detailed with informative dialogue, viewers have the opportunity to dwell in the mind of one of the world's most vicious fiends.",8,1,2,22 October 2006
Beowulf," Entertaining...nothing more.
","We've all heard about the stunning visual stimuli: the motion-capture effects used in Zemeckis' 2004 adaptation of the child book favorite, The Polar Express; we've, too, heard and seen plenty of Angelina Jolie's sensual portrayal of the hunted monster's mother; and we've all certainlyor at least hopefullyheard of the tale itself: the sweeping, grand Old English epic of Beowulf, the demon slayer who tore through foes like he ripped through Grendel, ever-slowly luring him towards a fateful end. However, what you might not know is that the praised visuals in Beowulf are no more impressive than that of a next-generation video game console, that Angelina Jolie's screen-time is minimal (lesser even than in the text from which the screenplay was adapted), and that, though Gaiman and Avery's adaptation is fair for a 3D-intended blockbuster spectacle, it lacks what made the historic poem so true: the sullenness of the main character, who hid behind a façade of heroism and prestige, only to be poisoned by his own secrecy and hollowness, and the knowledge that his glory came birthed from the lies he'd told. Don't get me wrong, Beowulf is entertainingpretty darn entertaining, in factand contains enough blood and eroticism to gratify a young boy's lust for such things, but its aspirations seem to end there. What could have been a condensed LOTR-esquire experience falls far short of anything close, and ends up where our supposed hero did, lost between what it tries to be and what it actually is.",6,3,11,16 November 2007
