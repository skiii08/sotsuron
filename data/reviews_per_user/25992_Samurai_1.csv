The Blair Witch Project," Terrifying, unsettling and a must-see
","This movie terrified me. Most horror movies don't do that. You can look around you, or even on the screen, and a million clues will tell you 'This is not real.' Blair Witch Project, however, has none of those clues, and the viewer is left wondering during the movie, 'Is this a movie?' It is an amazing example of what terror can be.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
