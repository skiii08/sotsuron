Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," the Saga Strikes Back
","I went to the premiere of Episode 2 and all I have  to say is, Wow!  This Is one of the best Star Wars movies and is not too light-hearted.  So many images are flying towards you. I love Arena.  You find out the origins of Boba Fett and, in some cases, how Anakin turns to the dark side. Be ready for the best of the movie when Yoda has a little surprise. the trade Federation is back and much cooler than in the Phantom Menace.  I love the insect dudes.  All of Camino is great.  Finding ou t the origens of the Storm Troopers is a pleasure and Christopher Lee plays a great villain. It is fun to unravel the building of the Death Star.  jango Fett is almost as good as Boba.  Mace Windu kicks butt.  Get ready for the Clone Wars have begun.",10,0,0,16 May 2002

","Yet Lilo and Stitch is different than other disney movies, it ranks with the best.  The movie was very touching and made me very happy.
