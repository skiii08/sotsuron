Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Fever
","John Travolta and The Bee Gees team up, and the result is the biggest selling soundtrack in history. Travolta's feverish dancing put a face on the Gibb Brothers' disco beat. We still imitate him in his white suit, our fingers pointing to the sky. For awhile, I thought The Bee Gees were singing 'Bald Headed Woman.' I was informed that it was 'More Than A Woman.' It is unlikely that the movie would have gone far without The Bee Gees music. Songs like Stayin' Alive and Night Fever echo today. I particularly like Yvonne Elliman's rendition of If I Can't Have You. It was painful to watch The Bee Gees renounce the disco era a few years later. The characters and storyline of SNF are downers. A sequel called Staying Alive was released in 1983. It was so bad that it killed Travolta's career for a decade.",7,0,1,6 October 2007
Love and Death," Love and Death
","This is Woody Allen's spoof of War and Peace. He plays Boris, a farmer's son. in love with his cousin Sonja. When France invades Russia, he reluctantly joins the the army and becomes part of a plan to assassinate Napoleon. Funny scenes are Boris flirting with the Countess at the Opera, hitting his cousin over the head with a bottle until she finally passes out and dancing with the Grim Reaper. Woody is always searching for the meaning of life. He wanted to call the movie, 'Sex and Death,' but United Artists disapproved. It might have had more impact as this is one of his least known films. Diane Keaton is the perfect foil for his one-liners. For pure laughs, this is Woody's best.",9,2,2,15 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace
","The Phantom Menace was ripped to shreds by the generation that waited 16 years for another chapter in their beloved Star Wars. Fortunately for me, I am not in that generation. Indeed, the film seemed to have little to do with the original trilogy. Devoted fans may have learned a lesson, not to expect too much from a middle-age writer who has made his fortune. Hype will always outweigh end results. The acting here is lame. The kid who plays Anakin has no personality. He exhibits no signs of being fated to become Darth Vader. There is a disconnect. Special effects dominate. Darth Maul's potential is never realized. Jar Jar Binks was criticized as a racial stereotype. What I saw was a duckbill dinosaur crashing into Star Wars from Jurassic Park. Phantom Menace is easy to forget.",4,2,4,4 October 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark
","America entered a conservative period after the Iranian hostage crisis. Ronald Reagan became president, and Raiders of the Lost Ark became the big movie. It was set in 1936, a throwback to the serials and politics of that day. Harrison Ford is archaeologist Indiana Jones. The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses the Ark will be invincible. Indy's comedic instincts save the movie. The scene where he shoots the sword-wielding Arab is funny and unexpected. The close calls, narrow escapes and nonstop action is mind-numbing. The face melting is a bit much. I wanted to shut my eyes like Karen Allen.",8,0,1,6 October 2007
Troy," Troy
","My son and I watched Troy on TV from our hotel room in New York City. I tried to explain the story to him and to myself. It is from the Iliad written by the ancient Greek poet Homer. Ilium is another word for the city of Troy. Trojan Paris seduced the beautiful Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Greece. The Greeks sacked Troy, using a huge wooden horse to enter the city. Brad Pitt plays Achilles, the Greek warrior who kills Trojan hero Hector. Achilles dies when Paris shoots an arrow into his heel. My son asked if the part about the Trojan horse was true. I said half the story is true and half is made up. The war took place on the coast of Turkey around 1200BC.",Null,0,1,31 August 2005
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
","This offbeat western stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two guys who acted with their good looks. Newman is Butch Cassidy, and Redford is the Kid. Butch is the leader of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang. They are train robbers. I think we met them earlier in Cat Ballou. Butch and the Kid end up in Bolivia, and that is why I resurrected this movie, because I am going to Bolivia for a star party in the Andes. Katherine Ross (a Natalie Wood look-alike) is the Kid's girl. Of course, both men want her. The bicycle scene is memorable, and the gambling scene is cool. The story is set in 1910. Burt Bacharach's song, 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' is showcased and takes us back to an era when Top 40 was king.",9,1,2,1 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return of the Jedi
","Star Wars #6 rounds out the story. Jabba the Hutt joins the cast. I thought Return of the Jedi was better than The Empire Strikes back. Luke, Leia and company are faced with having to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt who has encased him in carbonite. I can hardly think of a worse situation to be in. Luke battles his father, Darth Vader. In 1977, Darth Vader was the epitome of evil, the devil himself. We accepted Luke, Leia and Han Solo as the focus of the story. As the story progressed, we see that the story is really about Anakin, that Vader is really a nice guy who made some bad choices. I had a problem with this. I think Anakin/Vader's redemption took something away. I also fail to see where John Williams' music is special.The second trilogy began 16 years later as a prequel.",7,0,1,7 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones
","Star Wars #2. Roger Ebert accused Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme of being the real clones. They speak in monotones. Ebert said they sound like lawyers. By now, character and spirited dialogue were taking a back seat to Lucas' fascination with computers. Lucas gave mixed signals as to how many stories he had. At different times, he reported 6, 9 and 12, as if he were trying to be conservative on one hand and losing control of the series on the other. The films ultimately became anti-climactic, playing second fiddle to advance publicity and merchandising. Mark Hamil may have been ugly, but he did have personality. Hayden Christensen has none. Christopher Lee brings some dignity to the film.",7,0,2,10 October 2007
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump
","I hated this movie when I first saw it. I felt it was about my life. I had to go out in the lobby during the Vietnam combat scene. Even though I did not go to Nam, I was affected by it. Forrest goes from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I took my son to D.C. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential baby boomer life unfold was painful. Seeing Sally Field's transition from a 70s babe to a maternal type was also disconcerting.",9,0,2,28 March 2006
Grease," Grease
","John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John star in this '70s version of the '50s. Olivia came from Australia and won the hearts of music fans. 'You're The One That I Want' is the hot number from the film. The pair dress in black. 'Tell me about it, stud!' she coos. Grease appeals to younger generations. Male/female duos perform Summer Nights to karaoke tracks. The film also exaggerates. There were no T-Birds or Pink Ladies in my school. Or maybe I was too young and naive to know what was happening. The cast of Grease was long out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 35. Barry Gibb composed the title song. Oddly enough, it is closer to disco than to rock 'n' roll.",8,1,3,24 July 2007
Doctor Zhivago," Doctor Zhivago
","Lavish film about the Russian Revolution of 1917. Russia pulled out of World War I when it went Communist. Omar Sharif is Zhivago, an idealistic doctor torn between his wife and Julie Christie. His ambiguity is mirrored in his poetry, deemed too personal in the new order. We see the paradox of science and art. Zhivago's half-brother tells the story in flashbacks to a girl thought to be the offspring of the illicit romance. It is the formula for historical fiction, made up characters living their lives against sweeping events. There are hauntingly beautiful scenes, snow and springtime flowers. 'Somewhere My Love' leaves us aching.",9,4,7,20 October 2006
Gone with the Wind," Gone With The Wind
","Not only is the Old South gone with the wind but so is the era in which this movie reigned. Its reputation lives on. Its most lingering moment is when Clark Gable turns to Scarlett and blurts out, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!' Bold dialogue in 1939. This story of the American Civil War comes from the only novel written by Margaret Mitchell. I tried to read the novel years ago but was unable to crack it. I have seen the film. After learning of the 65th Anniversary DVD, I want to see it again. I was in Atlanta recently and haunted by the thought of Tara, Scarlett's plantation. I want to pay attention to Scarlett. Was she merely spoiled and selfish or was she a complicated woman? Gone With The Wind won 8 Academy Awards. It is worth revisiting.",9,0,1,29 January 2006
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","The world's biggest stage musical became a major motion picture produced by Tom Hanks. It was released July 18, and features the songs of ABBA. The plot is thin yet relevant to the songs. Sophie is getting married and wants to know who her father is. She gets into her mother's diary and narrows it down to three men. She invites all three to the Greek island where the wedding is taking place. Sophie's mother is played by Meryl Streep. Streep never quite got over Sam who is played by Pierce Brosnan. The singing is adequate. Mamma Mia! is ultimately another excuse for reviving the ABBA catalog. The reason the soundtrack is so good is that Benny Andersson used the original musicians who played with ABBA: Lasse Wellander and Rutgar Gunnarsson.",10,1,4,1 August 2008
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","Woody Allen and Diane Keaton play themselves and get the Academy Award for best picture. The setting is Woody's beloved Manhattan. There is memorable dialogue. Woody is the intellectual Jew forever questioning himself. Much was made of Keaton's mannish outfit. It was a mark of women's liberation but out of step with current disco fashion. I liked the scene where they talk with their thoughts being shown at the bottom of the screen. Christopher Walken is Keaton's weirdo brother who imagines himself in a head-on collision with an oncoming car. Walken was on the boat the night Natalie Wood drowned. Rumors flew that they were having an affair. I drove into Nashville from Lebanon to see this film and parked along the river. When I came out, my car had been towed. I understood Woody's contempt for authority. All his films come together here.",8,1,2,30 October 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey
","This is Stanley Kubrick's vision based on the work of Arthur C. Clarke. A scientific background is helpful in seeing the point. We are presented with the idea that human intelligence was jump-started by aliens. When man reaches into space, he is reaching back to his source. This is consistent with the Panspermia theory, that life did not evolve on Earth but grew from spores brought to our planet by comets. The film confuses more than clarifies at the end. It degenerates into a semblance of an LSD trip. No one knows what it means, if anything. 2001 proved to be nothing like Kubrick's prophecy. It is remembered most for 9/11.",Null,1,3,31 August 2005
Titanic," Titanic
","The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York in 1912. About 700 people drowned. About 1500 survived. The Titanic was part of the White Star Line. It was believed to be unsinkable. Its passenger list was a microcosm of society, and the tragedy has fascinated each succeeding generation. Robert Ballard discovered it on the ocean floor in 1985 and recovered some of its contents. Ballad's effort inspired James Cameron to write and direct this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Jack and Rose. Movies do not get more romantic than this. Who can forget the image of Jack and Rose at the front of the ship? Or Jack supporting Rose in the icy water as his own life ebbs? Posters of Leonardo DiCaprio graced the walls of teenage girls. Titanic won 11 Academy Awards. It is the biggest box office success of all-time, pulling in over $600 million.",Null,0,3,4 September 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Life
","This movie, which I may or may not hate, became a Christmas classic, shown every year. Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey. Donna Reed is his wife. The idea is that George wants to travel the world and do great things but can never escape the small town he grew up in. It takes an angel named Clarence to make him appreciate what he has, which is an army of friends because of all the people he helped. 'Auld Lang Syne' is sung at the end, a poem written by Robert Burns. This is classic America! The story is sappy and overly sentimental at time. I avoided it as long as I could, but finally gave in to it. My Guardian Angel called Agnetha saved me from drowning in the Baltic Sea.",8,0,0,27 December 2019
A Hard Day's Night," A Hard Day's Night
","The first Beatle song I heard was 'From Me To You' in the summer of 1963. I thought they were black. By October, I knew something big was going on in England. In January, 1964, I saw a clip on the Jack Paar show. It was unbelievable! The Beatles were going wild! Girls were screaming and throwing jelly beans! It was The Beatles' sound. It was the long hair! I started letting my hair grow that night. Beatle records flowed into America. The Beatles revived the rock & roll of the late 1950s, the fire. John Lennon sang Chuck Berry. Paul McCartney sang Little Richard. They took it to a new level. They had their own songs, incredible songs! They filled albums! Cousin Larry and I saw A Hard Day's Night in August, 1964. The theater was packed with teenage girls. They screamed for 90 minutes! We could not hear one word of the dialogue. It did not matter. This was Beatlemania, and there would never be anything like it again! 'You Can't Do That' was cut from the film. It was my favorite. John Lennon's jealousy and possessiveness were too potent for the young audience. His primal scream at the start of the solo says it all.",Null,5,7,30 August 2005
Jaws," Jaws
","I was reprimanded for comparing Peter Benchley's novel to 'Moby Dick.' Jaws may not be the world in microcosm, but it did well at the box office. The main characters are strong. Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert. Robert Shaw is the seasoned fisherman. Both complement and contrast with ex-cop Roy Schieder. The shark almost takes on a supernatural quality as he menaces the three men in their boat. Great whites grow up to 20 feet. They are killing machines despite the claims of environmentalists. Australian waters have the most shark attacks. The sequels definitely took away from the original. Hollywood needs to quit while it is ahead.",9,0,2,2 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Sith
","Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars movies. Ewan McGregor rises up to do a strong Obi-Wan, and Hayden Christensen is quite sinister as he slowly sinks into Darth Vader. Episode 3 links the two trilogies. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader by signing a pact with the devil in hell, a planet made of volcanoes. Anakin marries Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their kids are Luke and Princess Leia. The younger Portman plays the mother of the older Carrie Fisher. Wookies appear in Revenge of the Sith. We see C3PO, R2D2, Yoda and Jar Jar Binks. George Lucas swears this is the last Star Wars despite originally saying there were 9 stories. Someone in the next generation will carry the franchise forward.",Null,1,2,31 August 2005
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman - great movie!
","Wonder Woman opens with Diana Prince in Paris, probably in 1980. We see the Eiffel Tower, the Seine and the Pyramid in front of the Louvre. A vehicle from (Bruce) Wayne Enterprises delivers a picture taken during World War I. Then, we flash back to Diana's childhood on the island of Themyscira. Diana is an Amazon, intrigued by combat and training. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielson) is protective of her daughter and hopes she never has to fight. Hippolyta sculpted Diana from clay, and Zeus brought her to life. Hippolyta recounts how Ares, the god of war, rebelled and killed all the gods except Zeus. Hippolyta takes young Diana to a tower and shows her the sword known as the God Killer. Time passes, and Antiope (Robin Wright) begins to train Diana. Antiope knows Ares is alive and will return. Grown-up Diana (Gal Gadot) stands on a cliff looking into the Aegean Sea. Steve Trevor's (Chris Pine) plane crashes into the water, and Diana dives in to save him. She drags him to the beach. She has never seen a man! The German's are pursuing Trevor because he is a spy and has stolen Dr. Isabel Maru's (Dr. Poison) book of formulas. There is a battle on the beach, and the Germans are no match for the Amazons. But Antiope is killed with her final word being 'God Killer!' Hippolyta thinks Trevor is a German and wants to kill him. Diana assures her mother that he fought on her side. The Lasso of Truth compels Trevor to tell his story. He infiltrated the Germans, grabbed Dr. Poison's book and ran. Trevor tells the women about the war to end all wars, and Diana is certain that Ares is behind the conflict. Trevor bathes in healing water. Diana climbs the tower to get the God Killer. No easy task even for her! Gal Gadot looks like Wonder Woman! She and Steve leave the island by boat after a touching goodbye scene with her mother. Hippolyta gives her Antiope's tiera, and it is off to the war! Diana and Steve have some sex talk on the boat while sailing to London. They pass under the Tower Bridge, which I crossed on foot in 1994. Enter Erich Ludendorff (a real general in World War I) and his deadly chemist. Dr. Poison creates the mustard gas for which the war is famous. We meet Etta Candy, Steve's secretary and a comic character, who helps Diana choose appropriate clothes. Gal Gadot is charming as she tries on various outfits. She is stunning in her hat and glasses. Steve and Diana are followed and have to fight off assailants. Thank goodness for 'bullets and bracelets!' The couple deliver the stolen notebook to Steve's superiors, and we encounter Sir Patrick Morgan (who is actually Ares). Diana translates the formulas written in Sumerian. Amazons know hundreds of languages! Diana is still convinced Ares is behind the war. She and Steve head for the front after Steve enlists the help of 3 oddballs. These are Sammy (a womanizer), Charlie (a marksman) and the Chief (a smuggler). Sammy likes women and when Wonder Woman does her thing, he is 'both frightened and aroused.' Steve wants to destroy a second weapons facility. At the front, Diana confronts the horrors of war! It is trench warfare. Frustrated by the lack of progress, she transforms herself into Wonder Woman and leads the charge across 'no man's land.' It is an inspiring scene with Wonder Woman taking all the fire, deflecting it with her shield. Goddess Gadot! She has that look! We stare into Gal's eyes! Or does she stare into ours? She uses her lasso, tossing Germans left and right. That eerie music from the soundtrack starts, and Wonder Woman demonstrates her strength. The Belgium town of Veld is liberated, and a period of calm follows. A picture is taken, the same one we saw at the beginning of the movie. Sammy says he wanted to be an actor but is the wrong color. Charlie sings and plays the piano. It starts snowing as Steve and Diana get romantic. They dance, then retire to an upstairs room where they make love. Diana now believes Ludendorff is Ares and sets out to kill him. She thinks it will stop the war. They crash the German high command's party. Gal is gorgeous in the blue dress! Diana and Ludendorff dance. Steve and Dr. Poison talk. Steve wants to find and destroy the gas. Diana realizes that all men are to blame for war, not just the Germans and not just Ares. As Wonder Woman, she follows Ludendorff and kills him. But the war continues! Great quote: 'It's not about what you deserve. It's about what you believe.' Suddenly, Sir Patrick shows! He is Ares! An epic fight ensues: Wonder Woman versus Sir Patrick! The God Killer proves useless, and Ares says only a god can kill another god. Steve hijacks the plane carrying mustard gas to London. He blows it up while sacrificing his own life. Ares is a formidable foe, even for Wonder Woman, providing the comic book violence so prevalent in modern movies. Steve gives Diana his watch to remember him by before running down the plane. She watches the plane explode and Steve die, and this gives her the adrenaline to defeat Ares. Gadot expresses emotions well. She was born to play Wonder Woman! She conveys her passion! Steve tells Diana he can save the day, but she can save the world. 'I love you!' are his last words. With Ares' demise, the war ends. Should our history books give Wonder Woman credit for stopping World War I? We cut to celebrations and flag-waving in London. Diana touches a picture of Steve next to his plane. It is 1980 again, and she confides that only love can save the world. She has found her mission! Forever!",10,6,16,9 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice
","It was a novel idea pitting Batman against Superman in a test to determine humanity's real superhero and champion. Both have a downside. Henry Cavill became this generation's Superman, while 43-year-old Ben Affleck assumed the role of an aging Batman. Batman is human, and it is his movie. Superman, although not a god, has godlike powers because he is from the the planet Krypton, where the chemistry and gravity differ greatly from those on Earth. It would seem that Batman would be no match for Superman. Lex Luthor, who is more Joker-like than previous Lexes, adds to the chaos. My real interest in this movie is Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is skinny as a rail, although she does have a look. Lynda Carter is impossible to top, and I suppose Warner Brothers decided to take a different approach. The Amazon teams up with Batman and Superman to battle Doomsday and form the Justice League. Batman (Bruce Wayne) lives in Gotham. Superman (Clark Kent) lives in Metropolis. Both cities are really New York. Wonder Woman (Diana Prince) is from the island of Themyscira. Some say Paradise Island.",5,1,4,26 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens
","The prequel sucked! Then Disney bought the rights from George Lucas for $4 billion. The third trilogy involves the original actors and is a sequel to the 1977-83 stories. Of course, it is more than 30 years later, and everybody is old. The Force Awakens is close to the 1977 film. Harrison Ford returning gave it credibility. The audience applauded. The interracial thing between Rey and Finn would not have cut it in 1977. Modern audiences seem to desire that kind of thing. Han Solo will not be back, and neither will Finn unless he is somehow magically restored. I thought the film had good energy and lots of humor. I am glad I saw it.",9,3,16,20 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars
","George Lucas could have done the world a favor and let Darth Vader die at the end of A New Hope. I was 31 in 1977 and, though I thought the film was okay, I was not swept away like the kids. I thought much of the dialogue was stiff and unemotional. Carrie Fisher had little if any charisma. Harrison Ford was the only one who did. The weird names and bizarre creatures are hard to digest after a while. Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. My favorite may be Obi-Wan. He is the one with perseverance, the one who waits years to set things right. Ultimately, he sacrifices himself for the cause.",8,0,2,3 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back
","Yoda adds his name to the list of Star Wars characters. He starts out as a puppet and ends up as a computer generated image. I never liked the venerable Yoda. He is self-righteous. His wisdom is inscrutable. At 900 years old, he is not quite as old as Methuselah who made it to 969. The exotic names and grotesque creatures become hard to digest after a while. Lightsaber duels afford opportunities to doze. I saw this movie because I saw the one before it. Lucas made it because he made the one before it. His franchise was becoming a money-making trap. The dark, confusing scenes bothered me. A lot of the action felt contrived, as opposed to being something which occurred naturally.",7,2,6,10 October 2007
Contact," Contact
","Carl Sagan's novel about contact with extraterrestrial intelligence was made into a movie starring Jodie Foster. Foster as Ellie gets into astronomy as a young girl. She pursues her passion into adulthood, working for SETI. Contact is made, and a machine is built according to instructions sent by aliens. Ellie is transported through wormholes. She has an encounter with an alien whom she perceives as her deceased father. The ending is inconclusive which only shows we can not seek reality in science fiction. Foster achieved notoriety when John Hinckley, the man who shot Ronald Reagan in 1981, said he did it to get her attention. Sagan got famous appearing on the Johnny Carson show. He did his Cosmos series for TV. From there, he got into dinosaurs and politics.",8,0,2,10 April 2006
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park
","Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divided into the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. 'Jurassic Park' brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept in a park on an island off Costa Rica with plans of making them a public attraction. The dinosaurs get loose. T. Rex goes on a rampage. The velociraptors are fierce. I feel like there are not enough species represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurs? Duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme is that man should not tamper with nature which is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie-makers generally lean toward the negative. Both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas employ dark, confusing scenes. Watching their movies is like taking a beating. Still, we learn from them.",Null,0,1,21 September 2005
