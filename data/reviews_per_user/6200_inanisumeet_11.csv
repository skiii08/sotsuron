The Equalizer," simple story , happy ending , action packed
","the production values are high . literally lot of money has been put in the movie . Sony gadgets on display as mobile , laptop etc. denzel's clever remarks and binding with Chloe is touching . why does he clock the fights he enters into . vigilante by night and retail store worker by day . never shows off in public . neither revengeful , nor expecting appreciation after helping . warns before handing retribution . helps the weak secretly. tells girl very nicely without offending . psychoanalyses the villain sharply . asks probing questions from thugs disguised as police . anticipated reaction & sets trap accordingly . blows up buildings & steps out in fiery background . we love him for his good nature & swift justice .",8,0,3,22 March 2015
Se7en," serious real , not for light mood , well acted
","this is of 1995 and yet scenes are so realistic . it seems they really killed a person to show believable autopsy . Morgan freeman as about to retire detective plays the part very well while brad Pitt is young guy who partners him in last case . gwyneth paltrow looks charming . story is depressing . notice how the credits roll at ending , then you will know the idea of director . there is a chase scene in which cop is alert & determined , committed to his duty , uncaring of his scars , yet evil sneaks up on him . the picture of life painted is quite bleak . the limitations of law rule book are shown . the apathy of human beings to each other makes situation grim and hopeless for viewer .",8,2,3,22 March 2015
Unbreakable," thriller and slow paced
","background music underscores the moment . the pace is slow . movie is not dazzling or light hearted but serious and real . audience will stay on the edge of seat as events happen because movie connects . Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis have acted well . shyamalan is real good at suspense . issues in an ordinary person's life come up signifying attention to detail by filmmaker . it has been my experience that ending of a great movie usually raises its level by a notch . twist in story makes it really cool . director has kept it tense throughout . actually , i have liked Samuel Jackson since his dialogue at the end of pulp fiction . so bias is possible . apart from this , Bruce Willis has done badass kind of rules like die hard series . atmosphere usually implies the event . there are so many minute things you can observe regarding behaviour of people .",8,0,3,21 November 2015
Begin Again," must see this musical funny trip with a bit of everything good
","this is great . mark ruffalo was good in avengers , particularly at the end after credits when iron man narrates him as if he is a shrink . in this movie , he talks crazy ideas like free music , open recording. his relationship with daughter changes when he gets involved with music he seeked. keira knightly looks exactly normal with a lovable face not by looks but once you see her experiences . music industry working for money and degrading (popularising) artist's idea. there are people who steal songs and are incurable . music heals human relationships . keira breaks up in an innovative way . the pace of movie is wonderful . all conversations are so natural . there are good guys who are supportive . a series of events which trigger a meeting between stagnant music producer and unambitious singer . there is lot to think . most of all , keira with her natural smile makes scene adorable .",10,0,2,22 March 2015
Interstellar," where no man has gone before Nolan does
","firstly , i like murph as a girl because she looks normal & curious . a joy which only parents can get by watching a spark in their children's eyes . a black hole scientist became executive producer of this movie so scenes are reconciled as much as possible with facts . three dimensional black hole is hard to imagine . the hopeful planets shown are breathtaking . of course , love is central premise in this space journey . time dilation , multi dimensional situations have been explained in simple terms . Michael Caine's poem does not enthuse me . anne Hathaway looks beautiful . as children we were eager for one way trip in space but now we know dangers like loneliness and survival . similar ideas were introduced in a movie about one way journey to sun . the movie is a bit long and taxing on mind if you dive into details . it was not as publicised as batman trilogy . spaceships and multi stage separation of rocket is so real .",10,5,9,4 April 2015
21 Jump Street," below average , funny in parts , rubbish throughout
","this is miserable . I was hoping for some high school interesting situations . It starts OK with swear words comedy . As the plot progresses , it gets dull . No bonding between lead characters . Churlish fights in serious situations. Production cost is high as props , background etc. look nice . Sometimes scenes are vulgar without fun which is irritating . No connect between emotions enacted & situation of any character. it is waste of time . At some places , it becomes unbearable as things go awry & actors seem to have forgotten their role . What more , they will make a sequel . Audience ain't fool to watch anything on similar lines again . a series of unconnected events with no basis of silly behaviour leaves audience fooled .",5,1,1,2 February 2015
Inside Out," highly colorful ,emotional ,joyride ,funny ,riveting even while credits roll
","Every scene is really pleasing to the eye . This is full use of RGB spectrum rendered by current display screens .The content is great and so is the presentation . Suitable for all age groups . The analogy with internal working of mind is very creative . The good thing about animation is that it allows perfection . you can create thing of any shape , size , color as long as you can imagine it . You will be surely overwhelmed . Pixar began their journey with 'toy story' (which was good too) and have improved with every venture . It will tickle you and even touch you . It is an adventure from beginning to end , not a moment is dull . Animation really blows away any A-star movie in entertainment aspect . It is a must watch . Don't miss it at any cost .",10,3,27,21 November 2015
Gone Girl," unusual ending , lot of secrets , suspenseful till the end
","the story has revenge , meticulous planning , cruel manipulation and lies everywhere . the lost lady looks very charming in first meeting . i would blame husband for disappearance of his wife . the news hungry media tears apart husband under investigation . the message is - it is human nature to take advantage and nobody is a saint . also laws are in women's favour who can frame their husband or lover if they don't obey . example - consensual sex can be reported as abuse and alleged offender has nowhere to go . there are some marriage lessons here - first, don't take your partner for granted . second , stay faithful . parents should give little freedom to children lest they feel burdened under ideal behaviour expectations .",8,5,8,4 April 2015
Big Hero 6," funny , sentimental , lovable , huggable for everyone
","You will fall in love with the main character . The story is simple . In great movies , I have often seen use of a normal phrase apt to a defining moment which gets overlooked in normal situations . The duration is a bit short . The feelings of revenge , love , mindless enthusiasm are shown vividly in different contexts . The first half has more laughs . There is some similiarity with iron man but the original look of protagonist is far more entertaining . Everybody likes happy ending . This is not comparable to wall-E which had deeper meaning . Seems , animation movies are now being created in bulk . A few years ago , all animation movies had revolutionizing ideas with great fun , Nowadays it is less funny and more formulaic for commercial success . Still , this movie is good . I will call 'lego' as far more intense in graphics due to its unique presentation . You can watch this lightly without analysing .",9,33,48,10 March 2015
The Imitation Game," heartbreaking , wonderfully described
","Alan Turing is a mathematician dedicated to his work who has no sense of humour . keira knightley is lovely as Joan Clarke , the only woman cryptanalyst in highly male dominated field . the sacrifices Alan made for his country are indescribable and cruel treatment by society makes it worse . his actions are hard to judge . this movie will leave you in tears . it is hard to believe that British society was so narrow minded in sexual matters during period around second world war . Alan does things by logic not emotion . the way he decides to propose is apt . not no jargon about breaking codes , focus is on team work to solve practically impossible puzzle . narration is solid . the ending is unpleasant and pitiful . it is tragic . scenes from war are appropriate , i wonder how did they get such archived footage . inferior treatment to women in intellectual matters is highlighted . secrets ruin lives , nobody should ever be in such an unenviable position . had second world war not occurred , alan could have made lot of contribution .",7,1,2,4 April 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," visually entertaining
","Pieces borrowed from great movie like 'source code' are okay . Movie is funny , sometimes touching & fast-paced elsewhere . Emily blunt got to act with another superstar after matt damon . Scenes are highly detailed , thus dazzling . Some dialogues are witty . Realism combined with future technology is believable . Tom cruise looks smart as always . You can watch with family . Transformation of protagonist is inspiring . Worth your ticket . This big budget movie surely hits the mark in action . Audience can not anticipate the next scene . It gathers pace after intermission . CGI is amazing . There is lot of mental battle other than physical one .",8,0,2,23 September 2014
