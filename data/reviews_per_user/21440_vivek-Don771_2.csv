The Avengers," AVENGERS:A spectacular superhero showdown
","Expectations were sky high because of the excellent reviews for Avengers flooding the internet during last week.It forced me to watch the first show and it was worth the price of the ticket.Truly amazing,thats what you can call this film in terms of entertainment.Film doesn't fall short of entertainment and actors.This is a genuine multistarrer and the fans of superhero movies cant afford to miss this one.There is no point in going into the story of the movie.Its just regular stuff-A villain trying to take over the world and a superhero fighting him and saving the world.But in this movie,There is not one but 5-6 of them trying to save the world including Black widow and Hawkeye.The film begins with attack from Loki,The villain on a lab and stealing the power source.Loki also takes control of the Doctor and Hawk eye.Nick fury goes to assemble the superheroes Ironman,Black widow,Captain America,Hulk and together they fight Loki to stop his plan of raking over the world.Though there is an unexpected visit from Thor during the first hour.The rest of the movie is full of guns,shootouts,missiles and breathtaking action scenes which will hold your attention.The last 40-50 min is full of action and entertainment.The film also leaves a chance for a sequel.The first hour is somewhat slow in the middle.Many dialogues were not much audible but the movie later picks up.The introduction of characters took a long time.Indeed there are many to introduce,still that hampers the pace of the movie.The dialogues of Iron man to Captain America was great.There are comic scenes here and there.The 2nd hour is the unlimited action,full of thrills and fights.The special effects are awesome.3D was really effective,I found myself blinking on approaching missiles,Ironman and all.That is something I really miss nowadays in 3D films.3D was worth after all in a pathetic theater.On going to the performances,everyone did their part perfectly but the show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as Hulk.His intro was welcomed with tremendous applause.He rocked in the 2nd hour and his confrontation with Loki was hilarious and one of the best scenes of the movie.I didn't like the incredible Hulk but in this one,Hulk was excellent.After Hulk,credit goes to none other than one of my favourite actors Robert Downey Jr.His dialogues were cool and his performance was super cool as always.My pick is his scene with Loki.I am not adding spoilers,But Just watch out for that scene when Loki tries to take control of him and next one.That was the best scene in the movie.Chris Hemsworth as Thor did his part well.His intro was good than the others and also fight scenes.Chris Evans as Captain America was OK,nothing much to perform though.Samuel Jackson as Nick fury was good.Scarlett Johnson as Black widow looked great and performed well.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was convincing as the routine villain and Jereme Renner as Hawkeye was OK.Direction was slow in the middle but later picked up and the 2nd hour was entertaining with comic and action scenes.Dialogues were good and funny.Fight scenes are well shot and blended in the movie and even though 2nd half is full of fights,Its does not become tiresome and boring.Special applause for that.All together,Avengers is a spectacular Superhero Showdown that should not be missed for fans of Superhero movies and also for regular audience.In the box office,This one is sure to break collection records.As I said,a sequel can be expected as the film gives hints about it in the end credits.I go with a 4/5 for Avengers and it really is worth the price of the ticket.Rating 4/5:Entertainer",8,2,6,5 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises:A stunning conclusion to the series
","The most anticipated movie of 2012 is none another than The Dark knight rises.He has certainly gained a great number of fans after the 2008 superhero film The Dark knight.which was not only a superhero movie but also an excellent crime thriller with the fantastic performance of Heath Ledger as Joker.Nolan returns with another batman movie which is termed as 'An Epic Conclusion'.Expectations were Sky high and as usual Nolan delivers an exciting and power packed thriller which concludes the series with a Stunning and Brilliant conclusion.After all,he doesn't have the habit of disappointing people.Coming to the movie,The events of the film happens after 8 years from Dark knight when Batman takes responsibility for Harvey Dent's crimes and disappears to the dark.But he is forced to return from exile because of a new threat to Gotham namely Bane,a mercenary planning to destroy Gotham.With the help of his armed thugs,Bane is able to snatch a nuclear reactor to blow up the city.Eventually he encounters the Dark knight.But with his superior muscle power,Bane is able to thrash the dark knight and leaves him for dead.How the Dark knight will rise to save Gotham city and defeats Bane forms the rest of the story.There are also a good amount of supporting characters like Catwoman,Commissioner Gordon,A rookie Cop John Blake,Lucius fox,Miranda Tate,Alfred who plays key roles in the film Christian Bale returns as the billionaire Bruce Wayne and also as the Caped crusader.He is excellent as the protagonist unlike the previous film The dark knight where Heath ledger as Joker stole the show.This is his best performance as Batman in the trilogy.He performed well in the action scenes and his dialogue delivery was cool.Tom Hardy as Bane is a plotting and tough villain but no where near Heath ledger's Joker.Yet,he manages to be a powerful adversary for the Caped Crusader.His fight scene with Batman at the beginning and the end provides some much required thrills.His dialogue delivery was not much audible because of the mask he wears but it was not much of a problem because of the subtitles that were provided.Anne Hathway as Catwoman was cool.She has a key role in the movie and she does well.Marion Cotillard as Bruce Wayne's love interest Miranda tate was convincing.Joseph Gordon Levitt was good as the rookie Cop John Blake in a major role.He had more screen space than expected and doesn't disappoint.Others were Batman films regulars Miachel Caine,Morgan freeman,Gary Oldman does justice to their roles..Liam Neeson and Cicilan Murphy plays brief roles as Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow/Dr Crane respectively.Music by Hans Ziemmer moved the movie to the next level.Made the movie more thrilling.The star of the film is director Christopher Nolan.He delivers the necessary goods as usual.Some of the one liners were awesome but not as that of the predecessor.The scene at which Batman produces the Bat signal using fire was brilliant.1st hour was merely a build up and was moving at a slow pace.The return of the Batman was the turning point of the movie.From there on the movie becomes exciting and leads to a explosive climax with planes,bombs and fights.The twist at the end was totally unexpected.In the end,the film delivers what was expected or even more.Crisp dialogues were always a part of Nolan's Batman series and it present here too.The climax of the film may not sound impressuve to some.Yet,as a Batman fan,I liked the climax despite the mixed opinions.There was a standing ovation after the movie which again proves that Nolan is one of best in Hollywood.Looking forward to his next film.This trilogy will be a cult classic in the coming years and will remain an entertaining and realistic portrayal of the caped crusader.Comparisons to the predecessors can be made But The Dark knight rises stands up to the level of Dark knight and Batman Begins.The series itself is a must watch to all Batman fans.Overall,The Dark night rises was worth the wait and a movie that finally stands up to its hype.Must watch for all Batman Fans and Nolan fans.As for me,I am going once again as this might be the last Batman movie I will be watching in theater.Rating 9/10",9,1,4,20 July 2012
