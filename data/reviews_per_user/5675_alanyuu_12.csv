Black Swan," Natalie Portman, light and dark, black and white swan
","The art world is a challenge. The overall scenery put on for this particular film, the theme is too strong for the lighthearted. At the beginning you get the impression that Nina will probably be second to another dancer. This changes when she puts the director of the ballet in is place. And suddenly, she's the top dancer with all that implies. This proves completely that personalities have dark and light sides. The first act is a disaster and this proves now to a challenge. In a battle of positive and negative, in a show of light and dark, you get involved. And for the final performance, you get the impression that someone dies, but then the ballet dancer kills her dark side and ends apparently bleeding perfection. Strongly recommend this film, if you want to leave the theatre with awe and disbelief.",9,1,3,13 February 2011
The Hunger Games," An interesting mixture of survival, originality and action
","First of all, when I got to see the movie, I was aware that there was only one book out. You understand why the main character has a strong caliber to be able to go into a huge challenge and come out strong. There is a need to probably watch this movie more than once. This is because the first time, you get involved but there are probably more details which one can ignore. It keeps you glued to the screen, there are good things overall. The only thing, which probably sets it apart, is the reality adaptation of the violent nature of human beings.I highly recommend this movie if you've nothing to do. Go with friends, you will get worth your while.",10,5,15,6 April 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Power up folks, don't get so exited...
","The imagination of the makers of the movie is always limited when you make sequels. This particular movie has a bad habit of repeating many of the past movie gimmicks. But now you see some of the cast get back, I guess some innovative comedy, some technological innovation. And to bring the score down, I guess the makers of this movie love their Physics class from high school. I guess no blackouts this time, now the Earth is going to do the justice... And it comes down in a jolt...Being far from true, I guess the portrayal of the working conditions of the Mexico factory, is the other thing that took the movie off two points. I guess the authors simply filmed and did not have a cultural backdrop as to know what really goes south of the Border. Some of it is true however, and the conditions are brought out as worse. I don't know if that would be the image I would want for my country. But that's how it is.Its not that bad but its not the best. The past movie was down, and there's nothing like the first. You go ahead and enjoy, it won't bore you at least.",7,0,2,6 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Darkness, losses of heart and faith prior to the last moment
","Bill Nighy is a perfect introductory character. He's the perfect vampire, although they could have touched his factions more like described in the book. Really prepares you for what is about to burst in.The plot of the book is reproduced 80/20 leading the 20 to be more creative regarding what is to happen. Some things not included would have shown how JK Rowling conceived the true Harry Potter not as a kid but as a mature man now aware of his destiny. And its great to see our favorite trio of wizards now truly in a fight. Liked the action, liked the romance, but did not like the character deaths. I would recommend that the other movies be watched before you even consider watching this one. Information is knowledge and this is a perfect preparation so that you're not confused or out of touch.Finally, I must recommend the book to be fully, completely and finally read. This is because you're likely to expect more changes to the other film yet to come. As if this wasn't enough for the book fans.",8,0,1,13 February 2011
Transformers," Simply awestruck and agape, claps for Mr. Bay and Mr. Spielberg
","As a hardcore fan of the Transformers G1 era, I guess the first thing I expected was to see some relation either in the content or in the making. Pretty much to say that it is not the case, this movie has what you could say its own sort of phenomena. It is a 2007 generation of Transformers, not G1. The plot itself is a mixture of a romance in the making, a battle for power and greatness, which at the end gets the viewer a fascinating enjoyment. It sure has modernity pasted all over, you expect an amazing effect for the transformations. It left me awestruck and agape when I saw the Autobots come in, I really imagined myself going into the screen and wanting to blow up Megatron. And when you know what happens at the end, you wish it was another ending but hey, its great as it is.To sum it all up, as one of my personal favorites I recommend you get your favorite popcorn or chocolates, and enjoy Transformers. It's worth Ten out of Ten.",10,2,5,6 August 2007
Avatar," Movie to watch, see and learn
","Avatar is a movie about two races, usually covering both the human and another race on another planet. Its simply outstanding, it has a plot, it has a structure, it has effects that are done so excellently, you'd definitely imagine yourself in the movie. Learning how to talk, learning how to feel nature, learning how to fly and heroic love, all of these are all present.Loved it, loved it, simply loved it.The cast is simply mixed but appropriate. The lady from aliens plus some new talents add to the already excellent finished product.The musical score is simply beholding. You get into the music and it rocks the whole time you are in the theater.Overall, and for all of the above facts, I give it a 10 vote!",10,17,25,28 December 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Actors wasted, movie-goer's time wasted
","You know, I remember way back when in the 80's there was Conan and Rambo. They are not what you could call a typical couple and they had their own particular traits and ways to do things. And I think mixing prospects where you have a good looking gal and a stud are not what you would expect, and this movie does good in bringing down a promising spectacle. Angelina Jolie mixes her action roles in Tomb Raider with her innocent looking aspects that she hides in Original Sin. She is way better and has had better performances. She might have considered the pairing with Brad Pitt as something worthwhile, but in this movie, it just does not do good to have her star in a bad parody of the 'Odd Couple'. I liked some scenes and some action, but it only fills the eye, nothing more.Brad Pitt has sometimes taken himself to be a better actor but to go and think he is a cool 'Angels of Charlie' sort of assassin makes this a lackluster role for him. He might have fallen in love with Jolie and killed the bad guys, but what more. No real acting, just point & shoot.Action begins and the action dies. I think the counseling sessions where out of the question. For what its worth, look at the movie for its eye candor and leave any serious movie-watching for another day...",5,2,4,1 July 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Good action sequences, excellent plot but...
","A Transformers movie needs action!This movie gets more bashing and trashing in the action scenes. You get to see your favorite characters and new ones who really come to do more comedy.The particular thing which makes me not give it a 10 is making some specific parts more R rated than usual. I guess there was a need to show an additional talent but some people deserved to return. This specific part let me down because you put a mediocre actor like the so-called Presidential adviser. Jon Voight did not return, the Australian actress who was the hacker team head did not return and the black comedian who shouted to his grandma to drink her prune juice neither. You added more simple characters and they made the movie not go well.The other part is that there was more improvisation. But you had Bumblebee talk then not... among other quirks. Megan Fox did OK acting, but Shia did better. Overall you're entertained but don't expect a big hit.",8,10,17,1 January 2010
War of the Worlds," A movie that mixes terror, gore and aliens with a lack of substance
","You would usually expect a Spielberg movie to be more exciting and to have a very intriguing and growing plot. I found myself at first amazed, then started to see how the movie went from shallow to extreme and then just to go out being overly simplistic.You would want to know how the Martians (they are Martians as the novel reads) came to be and how they would go about their business. You begin getting questions which some are answered but some are left for your own conclusions. There are too many similarities with other movies that I think should have been avoided. I also think the scenes tend to be repetitive at times. I really disliked the little girl in the movie, she doesn't quite fit in. I for one prefer Independence Day, its more animated and has far much more substance.",6,1,5,1 July 2005
Burlesque," Starring three octaves and a legend.
","On the actresses:Cher as usual has her own. I think the songs put on for her allow to produce a great involvement. She shows she's got a voice, dancing moves and positive attitude. Overall, she does what's needed for her role in the film.Christina Aguilera is given too much light. It tends to make her look like an over-prized luminaire which almost blinds the viewer. Good features and a powerful voice. Seeing a singer without singing lets her hide her voice somewhat, but this could have been handled better. Overall, she gives it her best and it shows.On the movie: This tends to make it look like a musical but the rags-to-riches plot is too much. The actor who is paired with Christina seems more the puppet to cover a role, yet the small romantic scenery does the movie good by changing the theme. There should have been more role development, other talent displays and maybe that would have given it a better change.",7,4,4,13 February 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter will surely be missed, Thank You JK Rowling
","Taking the wand sealed the villain's fate. You know it begins, you see it as part of his ignorance towards what is to come.The journey, the trip, the flight to the country. Going to the place where it all begins. There is too many actions, words go mute. Impressive scenes, innovation from the original text kept to it still very close. Moments of great emotion, silence. Taking the last of the bad cretin's lives makes it happen. You're driven onto the perfect climax, and like it's said it all ends. And new beginnings are written...Future writers and literature makers will have a huge creativity challenge. Harry Potter's generational legacy is still in its infancy. Not bad to also recommend to read the books, it will make a very interesting cultural plight. Loved it, simply loved it.",10,0,0,16 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Shoot, crush, originality needed, eyes closed, boom...
","Transformers I was truly original, made a breakthrough and created an opening. Transformers II expanded and changed more, but still plot seems similar. And Transformers III, looks to take advantage of big special effects, and the former female lead blatantly deleted and changed for a Victoria Secret's model.You are taken down a similar route. There is something that happened many years ago. Involve the cold war and a historic event, like the Soviets don't have enough of being reminded of being the bad guys. And again, a city where huge action sequences come to happen. The couple of Shia and Ms. Huntington-Whiteley looks like the little kid is dating the big girl. Parents are the comedy pill needed to improve. New Transformers, but some still seem to be probably out of place. Laserbeak looked more than a dragon than its eagle-like namesake from G1. Others come back, a at the least there is more finesse to where Ms. Huntington-Whiteley is concerned, she acted more than simply show her figure.Seems a repeat of the other two. I thought all the Primes were dead. Anyhow, the action is the only part which will not disappoint. The rest, more of the same.",Null,1,4,16 July 2011
