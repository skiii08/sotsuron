Hereditary," Hereditary
","The film starts out a little slow but ends at the pace of a wrecking train. A very complete horror film that is not only there to cause chills and screams, but it is a story that has everything. Wonderful acting by the cast which also elevated the film to a new status. As the movie progresses, audiences is drawn to the picture waiting how every scene unfolds, to me that is the definition of a great film. Let's just hope we can sleep tonight",8,1,3,25 October 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born
","A music that is about music and carried by its music. The songs are truly beautiful and never knew Cooper had such a good voice. The most charismatic and powerful performance by him and not too shabby from Gaga as well, but the true star of the film is still Cooper. A very predictable and old school story line that works very well with the plot in this case, given the film's background and history, but also one that is powered by great acting. Very romantic to bring your other half. Also one of the best ending I've seen from any movie in quite a while.",8,1,3,1 December 2018
Gravity," Gravity
","A short but energizing escape, Gravity is a powerful film even though it features only two characters and pretty much one setting with very little sound. Sandra Bullock delivers a dynamite of a performance that is worthy of her Academy Award nomination. The film is largely driven by Ryan's determination, desperation, will and sense of loss. Gravity is also perhaps one of, if not the most gorgeous space movie I have ever seen, it's use of color and just the overall cinematography is truly unforgettable. In the end, whether or not the character survives or how realistic the science is behind it doesn't matter a bit, as we have been taken through a hell of a ride.",8,2,3,19 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel
","Captain Marvel follows the 'Avenger Formula' to the T. Nothing really creative, but still an enjoyable ride with a new character in a plot with a 'been there, done that feeling'. Larson as Carol is not the greatest fit, as her performance emits awkwardness and the rest of the characters, except for Nick Fury and the cat lacks any sort of chemistry or is memorable. The movie also amplifies what the Marvel universe does so well. Even though the movie offers nothing substantially important, it fills out the canon history of Marvel characters here and there, and connects with other movie, both past and present that makes this movie a must-watch.",6,3,6,23 March 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out
","Knives out seems like unflappable plot; a tested formula in creating a successful suspense film, but it never reaches the height of movies like Murder on the Orient Express. While the icing is still left towards the end, too much of the suspense was gradually peeled away, so did most of the glitter and interest along the way. This type of film, you either leave everything towards the end to be revealed and until then you keep leaving bread crumbs for audiences to pick up, which may take a long time, or you keep revealing plots until the finale, so Rian Johnson was left in a tough spot, and the end product is less than satisfying, not saying he made the wrong decision. A group of interesting characters were created, unfortunately Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas' characters were way too stereotypical and the least interesting of them all. The death of iconic mystery novelist like Harlan deserved a more suspenseful and creative story, but unfortunately in this case, it is less than satisfying.",5,2,3,5 May 2020
Aquaman," Aquaman
","I think Wan's Aquaman portrays the character and stays loyal to the story as well as it can. It's impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology, a true dream come true for comic book fans. The story is a great standalone movie but doesn't feel like it serves any greater purpose like those Marvel films, I guess for both better and for worse. Also unlike Marvel movies or previous DC films, I think the movie finds a good balance between being dark/deep and comical. The build-up is a little long, but the content within doesn't feel like filler and makes the world of Atlantis more interesting, it's impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated. The biggest problem with the film are the dialogues. They are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward, someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues!",7,1,1,2 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2
","Deadpool 2's jokes are as crude as ever, thats why the film feels weird when the story and the plot is something so mundane. Deadpool also feels out of character for a good portion of the film and was criminally not funny. The biggest bright spot is the new and returning supporting cast. Firefist and the introduction of cable and juggernaut are great additions and brings a jolt to an otherwise unspectacular movie.",4,1,3,1 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody
","A biopic fitting for such an amazing individual and iconic singer. Rami Malek delivers an eerily great performance as Freddie Mercury that is more than deserving for the Oscars, and it is even better that the film does not feel carried by him, but carried by the aura of Mercury and his music. You could just see in Rami's eyes that this is not just another role for him, but he truly embodies another individual. The beginning portion of the film does feel a bit loose, but with so much to tell in such a short period of time, it is hard to place the blame on anyone, especially with such an emotional and surprisingly uplifting ending. Not a traditional rendition of a biopic, as it feels more cheerful and more... Mercury.",9,2,2,27 February 2019
Bird Box," Bird Box
","Call me a sucker for almost any post apocalyptic film, Bird Box definitely won't be on any of my top ten lists. Sandra Bullock's acting is the only thing that keeps the movie afloat. While the movie is certainly gripping and nerve-wrecking, it is strictly attributed to the premise, a premise that we have actually seen many times over the years (you can't move, can't see, can't hear, can't touch, is can't smell coming up next or has that been done before?). Nothing is explained in the film, and the plot feels driven by convenience and not for cinematic purposes, the crazies, the voices, the birds, almost everything is there so the movie could keep going with no reasoning or logic. The ending is also extremely anti-climatic and convenient with a familiar face there to greet them.",4,1,1,7 April 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
","One of the most stylish movie I've ever seen, from a pop culture and stylistic standpoint Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a home run. From the fashion to the music and the tremendous artwork, the team got everything right. Unfortunately, being the comic geek that I used to be, the first half of the movie was very dull for me as it was straight up taken from the pages of the Amazing Spiderman and The Ultimate Spiderman. Although it is a storyline worth adapting into a movie, nothing extra was added to make it interesting for me. The story does get better for me personally, but it never reaches the height of nowadays Marvel Studio works in terms of its scale and overall significance. Still, a visual masterpiece, and a work that is worth being remembered for years to come.",6,0,1,27 July 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The 40 Year Old Virgin
","A hilarious cast of characters and wonderfully talented comedians makes The 40 Year Old Virgin a comedic classic, but watching it in 2020 again the film and the jokes does seem dated. The movie would have done so much better if it tried beyond that 'R' rating and went for the extra notch in raunchiness. The story itself is very linear and standard to what we would expect from this time period and this cast, but it is the standard of the actors that made the film so memorable for so many film lovers.",6,0,0,5 July 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame
","The best word to describe the film is 'epic'. If you rewind time back to ten years ago and tell me a superhero movie can be this grandiose, this emotional and this impactful I wouldn't believe a word you say. Endgame does everything any Marvel fan could want, it serves as a tearful, emotional goodbye to some of the staples of The Universe and as a wonderful way to look forward to what is yet to come. It serves each and every single character from the past ten years justice and allows all of their personalities to flow out. The amount of work the team has put into this, the respect it has to this wondrous world of imagination is unfathomable to me, and the tribute it pays to past works deserves the utmost respect. This is truly the epitome of modern cinema, it doesn't need a killer plot (which it isn't), it is the fruit of ten years of hard work and pent-up emotion all unleashed in one single blow. Endgame is dare I say the perfect way wrap up phase one of Marvel Cinema, and makes me truly look forward to phase two.",10,1,7,24 April 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel
","A masterpiece of a film that is striking in every sense. Memorable characters, a delightful plot and most impressively, it is absolutely gorgeous of a film. Grand Budapest Hotel contains everything a movie lover can ask for. It's visual and pace is distinctively Wes Anderson while paying homage to films from the past. It has a sense of mystery found in movies from 60s and 70s, complete with delightful foreign names and a quirky mystery. Despite all this, there is also something so pure and true behind the film, it tells the story and journey of men. While not always glamorous, these special men remains loyal to themselves and their beliefs, and this is what coats the entire movie into the masterpiece that it is. A special movie that can be seen as the masterpiece of one of the most imaginative director of our time, Grand Budapest will also live in my memory for a long time.",10,1,1,23 January 2019
Foxcatcher," Foxcatcher
","A quietly powerful movie about a very sad bit of American sports history. Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum offers mesmerizing performances that makes Foxcatcher a pleasurable watch. At the end of the day, the film revolves around the character John Du Post, however interesting and troubling of a character he is, the overall film rides too much on his erratic personality and behaviour that it fails to reveal either more of this past or the inner workings of the Schultz Brothers. The way the film explores the idea of mental fragility feels honest and believable. Carell projects himself onto Mark, a malleable young men in need of direction, but once he sees failure, John immediately discards him for immediate gratification in Dave.",7,0,1,21 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Infinity War
","Marvel studio outdoes itself once again in the Avengers series. How is it that a film of this nature could be so grandiose and powerful? Can be so heroic yet funny at the same time? The malleability of the team is simply incredible and you just feel the culmination of years of hard work paying off in this masterpiece. The antagonist's ambition and motive may be simple, but it feels realistic and most important asks questions about humanity and mankind, making him one of the best villain the series has showcased. The film is also a treat to the eye, and perhaps the best showcase of modern cinema. The only negative is perhaps the lack of closure, the feeling of yearning for more. There is no doubt that the film is a cash cow for Disney, but if anything it is a gorgeous golden cow, just keep milking it please.",9,0,3,17 September 2018
Aladdin," Aladdin
","A faithful remake of a childhood classic that could easily be seen as cannon just like all the other remakes they have made so far. Naomi Scott and Mena Massoud's performance does the characters justice and sang their hearts out with conviction. Will Smith's inclusion, however questionable, it is also hard to come up with anyone more suitable for the role. The costumes and exotic settings makes the film more authentic and awe-inspiring than ever before. The film doesn't really do anything new, so perhaps the film is more suitable for the younger generation who is approaching these stories for the first time. But we can rest easy know that the kids of our next generation is still absorbing these wondrous stories, just through different mediums.",7,1,2,7 June 2019
The Lion King," Lion King 2019
","Undoubtedly gorgeous, filled with a memorable story, song and characters, but definitely not as magical as the original. Watching the newest Lion King feels like I'm watching the Discovery Channel, as the scene and animals are incredibly lifelike, but that is also the problem, all the silliness of the original was taken out just so the film could be more of a visual masterpiece. In the end, this iteration is simply a CGI masterpiece featuring a great story, and not one of the greatest movie of all time.",6,2,2,16 November 2019
1917," 1917
","A true gem of a war film, perhaps one of the best. 1917 deserves to be immortalized for its jaw-dropping cinematography, but the story and characters are near flawless too, the amount of coordination is unbelievable. The journey taken by Will is one that is imbued with artistic value, yet it is entirely grizzly and gruesome, showing the true colours of war. The film skims over so many aspects of life, courage, and one's growth and fear around death, and in the face of it, how one is able to overcome by a sense of purpose. Will is by no means an embodiment of heroism, as he didn't even seem like the protagonist in the beginning, he didn't even want any of it, we don't even know if he would be commemorated for what he did, but seemingly realistic stories like this exemplifies what it means to be a human being. As for the Oscar debate, the film does not lose out to Parasite in any way, though I would still prefer the eventual winner as it felt more relevant and ringing to me personally.Wish we would never have to witness another tragedy like the WWs.",9,1,3,4 April 2020
Joker," Joker
","Unquestionably the most sensational autobiography on a villain I've seen to date. Joker is masterful in almost every aspect, but most importantly, able to truly focus on the inner workings of perhaps the most well-known in the superhero realm. The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little.",10,6,11,13 December 2019
It Chapter Two," It Chapter Two
","Although in itself an entertaining horror flick, it doesnt get anywhere close to the height of the first movie. The sequel feels forced, as if film was constructed just to fulfill the promise of the characters from the first film. What made the first It so good was not just the plot, but the setting, the mood and the teenage characters, as if we were transported back to our younger days and were forced to face our darkest fears, but now that the characters grew older, it just stopped feeling special. The sequel's plot is also way too straightforward and fails to tell any backstories of Pennywise. The bulk of the film still relies heavily on the goodwill from the first film which is really a shame considering It was one of my favorite films of that year. Really enjoy the Stephen King Easter eggs scattered throughout the film, at least that made it a little more special.",6,0,0,14 February 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Kong: Skull Island
","Kong: Skull Island is my first encounter with a King Kong film and it has certainly exceeded my expectations. Not the most nuanced or interesting plot, but unlike the Godzilla film which is in the same universe, the film has much better character development, featuring characters we can associate and feel with. The more memorable scenes largely rely on CGI and the scale and battle sequences just doesn't get old. Perhaps most surprisingly about the film is the cinematography, the color of some of the scenes is simply beautiful. However, the very forced inclusion of Jing Tian to add a little Chinese flavour feels forced and very disappointing as it directly damages the artistic value of these works.",7,0,1,16 June 2019
Parasite," Parasite
","Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale.",10,8,26,25 July 2019
Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","An Uber-realistic take on a subject that is so personal to so many people in so many ways. It doesn't deliberately dramatize any element, but instead focuses on the two lead characters, which comes back and reflects on how a divorce can have an impact. The film carries a strong sense of melancholy, yet you still feel this connection as if they are drawn apart by circumstances but not because of love. But isn't how most people are? Most people don't actually know what they want and just get carried away by the waves. By the time you wake up, you realize so many things could have been avoided but you are so far gone already that there is no turning back. Both Charlie and Nicole are so unique yet so representative on couples and parents, it is both a testament to the script and the performance of the characters that they were portrayed by.",7,4,5,11 February 2020
Godzilla," Godzilla
","A pure and simple action thriller, Godzilla does not get into the nitty gritty science and lores, which in a sense is a tribute to the original Godzilla movies. The film is thrilling with some very memorable scenes involving Godzilla and the MUTOs. It's use of CGI and monster designs are on a scale that is fitting to the stature of Godzilla. However, the human element of the film really drags the entire movie down. The lines are too cheesy, characters aren't introduced properly nor do they have significant motive or character development, leaving me to wonder at times a whole lot of 'why' and 'how'. From Bryan Cranston to Elizabeth Olsen, everyone feels a little awkward and forced in the film.",5,1,2,15 June 2019
