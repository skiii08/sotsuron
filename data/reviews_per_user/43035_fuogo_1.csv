Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Violence, boring endless talking and more violence
","This is the most over-appreciated movie of the year. Mister Quarantino just rips off his own favorite movies and puts them all together into something that is too long; too much boring conversations and one clichÃ© after the other. If you have seen all the movies he has (like Once upon a time in the west; Peckinpah-movies; Hong Kong-movies etc etc), there is no surprise at all. The ending is a anti-climax. Of course, he has a very good cameraman and good actors. But let him try to make a film without guns, swords, fast cars and violence. A Dogma-film for example. A real story, about real people. I don't think he is capable too make something out of that. The thing what I dislike most about Quarantino's movies is the senseless use of violence. It gives you nothing to think about. It has no social relevance at all. Compare this with Peckinpah or Kubrick, to name a few real masters. Just violence and endless talking; it is not enough.",6,2,4,11 January 2005
