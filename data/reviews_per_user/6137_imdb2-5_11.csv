Blade Runner 2049," Great visuals, not so great movie
","While you don't need to see the previous movie to be able to make it through this one, you will need someone involved to explain the big plot holes that exist so that the story can conclude the way it does. And that is really the biggest problem with this film - some characters acting very much out of the character from what you've been shown.In short, K is a replicant himself, who is of a model supposed to obey his master humans (this is not explained well) and as a police officer blade runner is supposed to hunt down and kill all the old models that could actually think for themselves. And when retiring one at the beginning of the film, K discovers something that leads him to believe some connection with the replicants he is retiring and the need to investigate.Is the film beautiful, yes. Does it feel dystopian... somewhat. Everything is too clean to actually be gritty. What the original got right was everything felt run down. This version felt like everything is depressed in a very visually beautiful way, which is a trademark of this film - gorgeous visuals. In that you can enjoy for 2.5 hours.The story plods along although it is not boring. I looked at my watch a few times, very surprised. Part of it was because they tried to fit in pieces of the original but it just didn't work. It happens a few times such as the forced 'skin jobs' term, a denigrating way to say 'replicant' but it's forced and there only for the audience. As if K's long time boss forgot he was in the room and it never happened before? But what really bothered me were the huge plot holes I will not reveal which existed solely to move on the story. The characters just didn't act the way you were shown at times. And this happens more than once, more critically a few times in the second half of the film. And they are done because there is no way the film can reach the next parts it needs without these huge departures in conduct that we are supposed to believe.Some characters could have been cut out of the movie entirely, including the silliness that is K's companion, whom you'll be introduced to early on. The explanation about how she exists is also preposterous, and which later turns out to be a key point in the film. Some of these notions, like a relationship with an artificial, robot life form were better explored elsewhere as is a very critical plot point in this film - the most critical of them all. And when it is revealed, you'll known what film I am talking about.In short, it is an interesting, overly long ride. It's very pleasing on the eyes but do not expect the masterpiece you're being led to believe. By the end of the film, you'll be wondering about Hollywood's inability to end anything and hoping to create yet another franchise. Wait for the director's cut if you must see this film, which is definitely not needed for those who appreciated the original for the statement it was.",7,20,51,7 October 2017
First Man," Languid pacing, shaky cam, forgettable melodramatic Oscar push
","This is a depressing, slog of a film about what many thought was a great achievement. I'm not sure what the point of this film was supposed to be. So the First Man wasn't very nice, wasn't a good family man, was consumed by his mission... then what's the real need to see his story and for a long time covering it? You don't learn very much about the other characters and family members either and you can dispose of them after the credits roll and forget about them and this film.The ending felt very rushed. Too much time was spent chasing the Oscar winning family interchange with long emotional stares to capture 'a special moment of contemplation.' Imagine creating a Michael Jordan biography and it taking an hour of middling exposition about someone not very interesting to finally get to the part where the basketball begins to be the primary focus of the story. And then when it comes times to watch the games, it's done on shaky cam to make the experience 'feel real.'The super close up camerawork felt obnoxious and unsettling. I'm at a loss to understand why this was done and so often. I'm also sure Buzz Aldrin wasn't too thrilled about he was portrayed.The cinematography is fine and there were redeeming moments. But paying $20 to see this film and on the IMAX (which actually made watching this film and especially the CLOSE UPS look worse) was not a good experience at all.An easily forgettable film.",1,13,21,19 October 2018
The Hateful Eight," Same actors, same shtick - call it longer, angrier and bloodier
","Filmed in ultra wide screen so that all the unimportant things that would ordinarily be out of the viewers field of view are now in view. And right from the start, the dialogue comes out choppier than a one legged heroine from a Grindhouse movie. And the pace of this film is 'molasses like'. This should give you a good idea of what to expect:<ul><li>How many times can Quentin get the N-word into a 3 hour film? - When will Quentin awkwardly insert himself into the film in a style that greatly resembles the late career of M. Night Shyalaman? - How much ultra smart talky dialogue can we fit into one film and was Quentin paid by the word?</li></ul>To give you an idea of how amateurish this film feels, the score opens as if it were a spaghetti western - which you'd expect given who scored the music. And just 15 minutes later, some awkward song blurts in and abruptly out. And then comes a scene so ridiculous and predictable concerning a letter that you're not sure whether this movie is made for MST3K. And just when you think it's ridiculous, the plot gets even more ridiculous as Chapter Two opens, using the same font used in previous movies in Tarantino font that sticks out like old typewriter amidst a laser print out.The very, very long opening of this film takes place in a stagecoach as the characters yap and yap and yap about... well.... nothing interesting. Just Quentin creatin' memorable witty conversation and flashing Samuel L. Jackson's white teeth and phony looking beard and speaking in way over the top exaggerations you'd find on Broadway. And everyone looks so nice and neat after being left out in the wilderness. Ladies and Gents, I believe we have the makins of The Hateful Eight - The Musical.Quentin can't decide whether it's a parody of westerns and tries to also insert serious conversations about war, black vs. white history and more deep moments that seem more appropriate for discussion after a good long toke. And it's so meandering that a narrator is needed to tidy up this rambling wreck of a film / stage play. The IMDb has this film rated an 8. But if you look you'll see so many reviews just like mine. Hundreds of them from real people who took out the time to say what a horrible film this is. Quentin says he'll only make 10 films and this one... is proudly presented as '#8' in the QT series. The studio couldn't let this film bomb the way it is in theaters. They must have paid thousands of third world people to storm the IMDb and vote this film a 10 rating. That's how bad this film is.",1,16,31,31 January 2016
Split," Massive PR efforts from India boost this film's ratings
","It looks like India backs its Indian American director hero and has stuffed the ballot boxes here with high votes.What's sad is that M. Night's scripts are getting worse, if that is possible. I'll sum up this stinker in a nutshell. Crazy person with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 women for reasons that are unclear other than his being crazy. Then over the course of time you're told about how there really can be multiple people inhabiting the same body. And tales of the supernatural. And really, really, really bad and stupid dialogue. Victims acting stupidly as is needed for these films to work. And then of course the story of 'the beast' within. Is it a really bad personality? Is it something else? Stay tuned while the pretty young ladies begin to slowly take off their clothing, which is par for the course for these films. There is very little reason to like any of the characters, which you don't get to know anyway. And some of the 'explanations' are completely inconsistent with any type of logic or reason in the way people act.The only way I can understand Macavoy doing this film is someone stroking his ego about the tour de force performance it would require. And he does his usual excellent, intense job in trying to bring this stinker of a film to life as he plays about 2 different personalities that come off as prepared monologues that appear in random parts of the film. And it gets weirder and stupider as time marches along. Don't say you weren't warned.",1,97,238,31 March 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Pretty stupid if you think about it for a moment
","Entertaining? Reasonably and never completely dull. If you're a big fan of lots of CGI and battles upon battles and displays of 'power' where one party wins and other loses arbitrarily, you'll have plenty of those. But unlike Thor Ragnarok which just created a fun arcade like environment that didn't take it's material very seriously, understanding it for what it is, this movie does take itself seriously and that's part of the problem. Thanos is scary. Brolin is a great voice and the CGI is better than good, even if you're reminded in a few places. The problems begin with far too many forced jokes and product placement. It was noticeably awkward at times.Without ruining the film, I will briefly tell you the premise, which in itself was silly and is an example of how the film is reduced to a plot that only kids would buy into if you really want to think about it. The villain wishes to kill half the people in the galaxy to control the population problem in contrast to available resources. Well isn't that brilliant because it will only solve issues for a short time since if 2 beings have 3 children then you've got the same problem all over again. At first I ran with it but, in towards the end, the silliness became apparent.The other glaring weakness. This did not need to be two movies. And it is OBVIOUS what the sequel will contain and how it will resolve. Why? Because it has to in order to generate $$$$$$$$$. Bad move.",5,1,5,29 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Hilariously bad, perhaps effective if you can suspend disbelief of everything
","No spoilers here as there isn't much to miss. The premise is simple. The earth has been invaded by something which is blind and kills people who make sounds loud enough to be detected. Or at least that's sort of the way it works because nothing is consistent within this film. Wearing shoes is apparently a problem. But running in open areas while barefoot is undetectable. There aren't really any hard and fast rules except if you scream you're a goner. That's what you get. So there is an extra small plot device but nothing much really happens. The movie is mostly about will this small family survive... or not. Somehow electricity works quite well on the planet. The evenings are lit up like Christmas. This is why if you're really thinking anything beyond 'OMG are they gonna live?' you're not going to be able to enjoy this film. Half the theater was laughing while a handful were on the edge of their seat. I'm guessing a lot of the high votes were from deaf people, as virtually all the dialogue is in sign language with subtitles on the screen for most of the running time. Good for them. A higher budget film which they can identify in this special way. That doesn't make this a good film, which it isn't. The big joke is that this film is still rated an 8.0 and is probably the biggest waste of time I recall ever. And then there is the ending. Truly hysterical. The joke is on us.",1,3,5,11 May 2018
Logan," Predictable, weak plot, excuse to end the Wolverine franchise
","Hugh Jackman was made for the role of Wolverine, even though he is a tremendous actor in his own right. However this swan song was one of the weakest X-Men film and it suffered from numerous obvious plot holes that made the audience go 'what?' At the end of the movie, someone in the audience yelled out 'that ending sucked!!!' and the entire audience laughed heartily - because most did feel that this was a mediocre tearjerker that wasted some great performances and superb CGI.I won't give away too much in this review, just enough for you to set expectations. It sucks when characters do stupid things which you know occur solely to continue the plot. For example, if you know someone is coming after you to kill you and it will be worse then next go round, you don't just let them hang around as if you're just a little careless - especially after a bloodbath. And it happens too often.What was truly terrible about the ending, without giving it away, was that it seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to figure out how to work in the ensemble shot reminiscent of a stage play that Hollywood cannot seem to stop itself from doing. It's phony and ludicrous. And I won't even describe the action, which basically happens throughout the movie. Characters will 'forget' their abilities to do something smart or dangerous because if they do what you expect, it will ruin the scene from going where the directors want it to go.The other aspect I didn't like about this movie was that Logan's character doesn't really get developed at all. It is manipulated and you'll appreciate what I'm saying when you finally get there. Please... we're all pretty smart. Don't insult our intelligence with yet another breathtaking spectacular moment where you can feel the director just praising himself endlessly for creating an emotional moment that is right up there on par with, oh... the climax of Saving Private Ryan. After taking forever to get to the ending, they rush right through it, as if they blew too much of the budget drawing out the first 2 hours and 10 minutes. It's all watchable although completely unnecessary and milked for one last haul of cash. The young girl is very good but they seem to have kept the mystique for absolutely no reason whatsoever but to... well... make it super mysterious. It's OK but don't expect anything near the 8.4 on the IMDb ratings. This is another X-Men B-Movie, not really worth multiple viewings but something you might catch on cable. Farewell to two of the great actors who graced the screen with some great moments in cinematic history.",6,13,29,13 March 2017
This Is Spinal Tap," Insanely funny and clever, even better on repeat viewings
","It might even be better to watch this film with closed captions because the lyrics to the songs are just hilarious and brilliant.If you've never been in a band you may not get all the nuances. But even if you aren't, it's a very funny parody mock 'documentary' of a fictional English classic rock band from the 60s that thinks it can bring the same raw image and message of sexuality to a more 'mature' 80s. And they are, musically and lyrically, passe for the new generation. But these artists, who take themselves very seriously, come apart as time moves on leading to tension between the band members in a tragically funny story line.What probably made this so terrific is that it was the first, an experiment by which numerous others (including themselves) have tried to reproduce - making a fake documentary about a real subject. And with some topics, especially artists and even moreso hard rock musicians, it's primed for satire. Remarkably, the actors are all skilled musicians and the music is fun, more than listenable and the lyrics are brilliant and clever.If you notice, this is the only movie rated out of 11. And there is a reason for that, ROFLMAO. A great trend setter that I think most can enjoy.",10,1,1,19 August 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Must disengage brain entirely to enjoy
","With so much talent in this film, it's so disappointing that the writers were right . Don't waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.On the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I've seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn't be honest if I didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I'd have to say that I've about had enough with this series. We've heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it's clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. Without giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I'll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:(1) Repeated jokes as if we're supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.(4) The explanation of the villain's plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It's one thing to have a 'special moment' and another to believe we're too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)",5,247,432,28 May 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," All style, no substance, no brains, yet watchable
","The fact that this movie has hit the IMDb's Top 250 shows what a joke film ratings have become. Let's be honest as to what this is - it's a wet dream for those into comic book like murder and violence. The story doesn't have to make sense. All that is required is a high body count, enough fast car chases and plenty of over the top weaponry.The plot is pretty simple. Reeves is a former hit man who is retired. The man who is a ghost, unseen when he wants and has a will to survive that surpasses all. No one can stop him. In enters someone powerful who requires him to come out of retirement to make a hit. The problem is that he's dead if he says no and he's dead if he does the hit as he'll become a revenge target.Problem that is not really a spoiler: Now if John Wick can be the Mechanic (Jason Statham) then no one need know Wick did the killing. And even if Wick does assassinate the victim, there is no need to leave a calling card. But this movie wouldn't continue in its plot unless a stupid twist is entered so that a massive shootout can occur and carry the movie to its next set of scenes.I will admit that the film is completely watchable and far better than it could have been. But most of the lines are comic book stupid, the action is so over the top that it's clearly comic book fantasy and the body count goes into ludicrous mode - as does Wick's ability to nurse injuries that would have felled lesser Greek gods.There is zero repeat value for this film. The actors all play their parts well. The sets are all that there are in this film, with very detailed choreographed fights, a stunning end set piece, eye popping saturated colors and imagery during the film and some style points. But this is a brain dead film. Don't say you weren't prepared going in.",6,5,11,26 February 2017
Annihilation," When the director is to full of art...
","This is an intense gripping film on a number of levels as well as being empty. It balances questions about a relationship and the nature of people on one end and the future of human existence on the other. Unfortunately while it reveals answers to the first, non -Scifi part, the remainder is a muddy mess that is meant to show layers of depth and symbolism. And it comes off as another pretentious attempt to do just that with little explanations and questions of shock and horror that has been done before many times and in different forms.I confess that I hadn't read the book and perhaps the science is better spelled out there. But in the movie version I'm at a loss. Basic logic is completely lost. Simple questions of 'why didn't they just do this instead?' seem to have evaded everyone in movieland. Perhaps the only question that is answered is that a sequel will be needed to explain what happened and where all of this pointlessness is really going.This is a 5 because the movie is gripping and interesting and beautiful to watch, even if a good part of it doesn't make too much sense and is pseudo-science. While others may wish to watch this one over repeatedly for deeper meanings, my thought it is to save your time. I liked the tale but was left unsatisfied at the end.",5,1,3,16 March 2018
