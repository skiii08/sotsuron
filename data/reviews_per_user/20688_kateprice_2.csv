Black Swan," A patronising and hysterical treatment of a sensitive subject
","I have just come back from seeing this over-rated movie. Unsubtle is the kindest thing I can say about it. I am furious at the way that we the audience have been patronised by this hysterical trash. Mental breakdown in anyone is a harrowing subject. Yet to portray it as a horror movie so malevolently and in such an exaggerated manner misses the point. At times one did not know when one was watching reality and when fantasy. It would have been much more interesting to have shown the pressures on the Nina the dancer in a more truthful way. It would have forced more acting ability from the actors; it would have been more harrowing to watch. It would have induced compassion. (The giggling of the 2 young women next to us at the end was a very apt and perceptive critique in its own right.) The pressures of the over domineering mother, the sexually rampant choreographer, the evil intentions of Lily, the rival dancer, the fact that Nina's sheltered upbringing resulted in an emotionally and sexually virginal and immature young woman, the challenges of the first night, the tragedy of the previous prima ballerina laid off, the envy of the other dancers -- all these make for conflict and drama. Yet the opportunity for a subtle and absorbing drama was thrown away by the director who substituted instead cheap thrills (of a horrifying and harrowing kind). I repeat. Please do not patronise us, the audience. We all live with our own pressures. We know what fear and guilt feel like. You don't have to 'simplify' it for us with Gothic and corny images. Grow up please and make us a grown up movie.",3,5,9,20 February 2011
The Favourite," Burlesque at best
","The play QUEEN ANNE* enjoyed a successful 4 week run on the London fringe during July and August 2014. It coincided with the 300th anniversary of the death of Queen Anne. She died on 1st August 1714. Since then, various organisations have jumped on the Queen Anne bandwagon including the makers of the film THE FAVOURITE.
I saw THE FAVOURITE a couple of nights ago. Much of the acting was excellent. The settings and costume were splendid and elegant. One recognised Hampton Court. The dialogue was, at times, witty.
It is normal in historical movies and plays to focus on one or two aspects of the real history and ignore the rest. This is spectacularly the case in THE FAVOURITE. No-one really knows whether Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill and Mrs Masham were bi-sexual. In a way, this is unimportant. Anne was very lonely especially after the death of her much loved husband George of Denmark. She was vulnerable. Male friendships were tricky for a queen; hence female friendships were more intense.
The sadness is that the success of Anne's reign has been passed over. She transformed herself from a person with an under confident dependency on the wily but beautiful Sarah Churchill to a queen, worthy of being the final incumbent of the house of Stuart. She saved England from yet another civil war by helping to guarantee the Protestant succession in the persona of George I of Hanover. While he may not have been the most charismatic of kings, he was a far better choice than the 'Old Pretender - James Stuart -father of the more famous Bonnie Prince Charlie of later years. If he had succeeded Anne, civil war would have followed. The English Civil war finished in 1660 a mere 5 years before Anne's birth, so it was still much in everyone's minds. People were still talking about it and suffering the damage done in its aftermath to society and family and economy.
In comparison with this giant omission, fictitious fabrications such as Anne's keeping of seventeen rabbits to represent her seventeen dead children or the attempted poisoning/ murder of Sarah Churchill by Mrs Masham are mere banalities. But it leaves one saddened; saddened that the character of a courageous woman should be so travestied: she cannot fight back. She is dead. People knew little about her before THE FAVOURITE was aired. I am not sure that they have been appropriately enlightened.
