Black Swan," really didn't like it
","The making of the movie is great, but i didn't like it at all. Its noises and flashing it constantly exposes you to stressed me, I suspect such setting could provoke epileptic seizure :P.i went from being relaxed before the movie to burned out(of flashing and noises and frightening scenes)when going home from cinema. I really don't think that watching a movie should be as draining and exhausting - it should be more about having FUN. Like the real life, full of stressful situations, isn't enough.All actors made a great effort and were realistic in their performances. If you could handle the darkness and creepiness of the movie then you should give it a try.",1,9,17,5 February 2011
Horrible Bosses," US humor
","In last few years i've watched a handful of comedies and this one is similar to Hangover in its comedy style. Sadly i didn't find this movie one single bit funny nor amusing, but i guess it's just because it's strongly localized US humor which isn't compatible with me. Scenes are loaded with sexual implications and too linear script with simple, cheap and predictable gag setup. By the time the final punch line scene is landed you just expect the very same outcome as served. There is no surprise factor needed to make a good comedy.If you liked The Hangover you'll probably like this one, others could find it boring.",1,29,62,19 August 2011
The Hurt Locker," boring
","i watched this in a cinema and i was BORED beyond beliefEverything is black&white, omnipotent US troops, main character behaving like a cowboy, playing with odds even when it doesn't make sensecan't deny there were few interesting moments like when they found the Iraqi boy who got killed in the process of surgical insertion of a bomb and all the drama in the beginning of a movie with cell phone activation of a bomb, but those interesting moments were too rare to make this movie interesting.I'm quite surprised with the movie's IMDb score, as well as it's Oscar awards.If i knew what i know now about the movie i wouldn't have watched it.",5,11,18,10 March 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Very good, but...
","TDKR is a very good fun movie indeed, but not as nearly as good as TDK. In the matter of quality it is quite close/comparable to the Batman Begins. The plot is raw and not as multi-layered as you would expect from Nolan. There are few unexpected twists but also a handful of clich√©s and plot holes that counter them. The storytelling during those 164mins doesn't transcendent into something that could occupy anything other than your perceptory senses. Bane is nowhere near to be as charismatic as the Joker was, in fact no one in the movie is and that is the main weakness of the movie, really. Catwoman is good, but Michelle Pfeiffer's was better. This Catwoman version has some advantages but also many flaws - and this is not Anne Hathaway's fault, who by the way did a great job, but due to the Nolan character concept which is much simplified wrt. Burton's version. Although I've mainly pointed out the weaknesses of the movie, don't be fooled - I liked the movie and had fun watching it but after the TDK I had high expectations and those expectations weren't fulfilled.Action scenes and the special effects are really good (and loud!) and as I've pointed out there are few plot twists which keep the suspense high till the very end of the movie. All in all, this is a high quality Hollywood action movie, but only that. And I must add I liked the Avengers more due to the greater charisma of the characters.",7,3,7,22 July 2012
