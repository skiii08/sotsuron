The Blair Witch Project," Almost perfect...
","I like to be scared. It is much better to be scared without gore, which is why I enjoyed Exorcist III and Silence of the Lambs. I had high expectations for Blair Witch. I wasn't disappointed! I enjoyed it quite a bit. The scares build slowly and the ending stuck in my mind for weeks. But, why oh why did they need the excessive profanity? Some one told me 'People talk like that.' Yeah, and some people don't! It got to be comical after a while! To me, it destroyed the integrity of the film. That aside, this movie will scare you if you have a great imagination and are willing to let your mind do the scaring for you.I give this film a B.",Null,0,1,2 October 1999
The Mummy," Fun!
","I went into 'The Mummy' wanting to have fun and to be entertained and I was surprised that had A LOT of fun and it was very entertaining. I really can't pick this movie apart. There is so much going on and it moves quite fast, that I was never bored! The special effects were top rate, the acting was fine and the story was interesting. It has the same spirit as 'Indiana Jones,' but by all means, do not compare it to those movies. This movie is a little more comic book style than the Indy movies. It has a few scary moments, but most of it is the 'idea' of what is going on (like when the mummy comes back to take the remaining body parts of a man whom he had already taken is eyes and tongue. You could feel his terror!) I was very impressed that the profanity and gore was light and there was no full nudity (there was a woman wearing revealing mesh, but that is the extent of it.) If you have kids, it may too intense for younger ones, but 10 and above should really get a kick out of it. I give it a B+.",8,1,1,8 May 1999
Alien," A movie event.
","I was too young to go see Alien in the theaters, so I bought the novel and the rare photo novel and read them over and over again. I finally caught the movie on HBO in 1981 and it took me by surprise. All I dwelled on (I was 11 years old) was the stomach scene being so scary, but as the years went by, I started to appreciate the characters in the movie and the way the film was directed. I will say this: Hollywood has never been able to create another creature like Alien and they may never do it again. Alien gets an 'A.'",8,0,1,26 May 1999
Armageddon," Worst Movie of 1998
","I skipped this one in the theaters, not on purpose, but because of Bruce Willis. I have never liked any of his movies. So, in one night, I watched this one and Deep Impact. I enjoyed Deep Impact because it was more about how we as humans, prepare for the 'end.'
Armageddon on a whole is simply terrible. Everything feels artificial and forced. Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love who fornicate. Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth. All of the emotion in this film was so staged and fake, that it was hard to feel for these characters. I have to wonder about people who said they cried when watching this film. I also never felt a sense of doom like I did when watching movies like Independence Day or Deep Impact.I give this film an F.",2,0,3,2 October 1999
Aliens," Thrilling!
","Aliens is one of the most thrilling movies ever made. While it is scarier than other thrill films (Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc) it balances well with the humor and dramatic scenes.The actual aliens were a little different looking than in the original movie, but they were still a frightening sight!The drama was intense and the special effects were excellent. And holding this all together is Sigourney Weaver, who, in my opinion, was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar that year. 'Nuff said!While I enjoy watching the other 2 sequels that followed, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in them, because this movie had a more 'human' quality to it, rather than set an alien or aliens loose and watch them escape! I don't think they will be able to top this one.I give this film an A.",9,0,1,7 July 1999
Event Horizon," Very scary but useless profanity and gore.
","I found the idea behind Event Horizon to be pretty scary and the scenes where they play back the tapes of the former crew entering 'hell' to be terrifying. But why or why was there so much profanity and gore? For me it ruined the movie, especially the quick nude scene. What purpose did it serve?The special effects were excellent and I found the acting to be solid.All in all, it did provide scares and it left a lingering dread feeling like no other has since the bad, but scary Amityville Horror. I give Event Horizon a B-.",7,0,1,9 May 1999
The Mummy Returns," Extremely Disappointing.
","THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likeable and the dialogue was extremely witty.  This year, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a booby trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be `more powerful.' Confused? I sure was.The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II.  The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, `It'll be OK.' The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the `dog' army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over. It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself. I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film.",4,0,0,5 May 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Why, oh, why...
","Why does a director feel that he needs to be as realistic as possible with sex scenes? The nudity and the 'sculpture' ruined this film for me. It really wasn't needed to further the story. If you get past those things, you will find a good film about poetic justice and brainwashing. If it is ever shown on regular TV, see it. Otherwise, it is immoral garbage. I give this film a D+",2,7,16,5 June 1999
Titanic," Nude scene and drawings ruin Titanic.
","With a movie making as much money as it did and winning several awards, it was a surprise to me that this film, which was widely seen, had a subplot about a guy who drew partially nude women. Why was this subplot needed? Could the film been made without it? I believe so! When it comes on network TV, it will be missing that subplot almost completely. Take that part of it out, and you have a well made almost completely historical account of the voyage. I give Titanic a C-.",Null,1,3,5 June 1999
