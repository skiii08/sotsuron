The Blair Witch Project," Cheap and totally empty
","I was so disappointed... critic was good but the movie awfully not frightening, not anything at all.
I still cannot understand how a such movie could gain so much positive critic.
Probably one of the worse movie I have ever seen (but the positive side is that I remember it, not like all the medium quality ones I have seen that would have deserved not to be forgotten).",1,1,3,29 July 2019
Climax," Argh, nothing to retain from it
","Seen in July 2019 when it had 7,2/10 on IMDb... I trusted it was a good movie.
Well not really.
If you are a fan of street dance, you can enjoy some scenes and stop watching the movie after 25mins.
Lots of stereotypes, falsely provocative with mainstream and empty matter.
Probably one of the worse movie I have ever seen.",1,4,10,29 July 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A full good movie
","Funny, romantic, nice characters, great OST, superb landscapes.
One could argue it is a too much well fabricated movie (precisely adding every ingredient to make sure to maximize viewer adoption).",8,0,0,29 July 2019
Prisoners," Take your breath !
","A really good movie where suspense and pressure are so strong.
Actors are great, subject is heavy, story not too simple.
Typically the kind of movie where you can see yourself in a 'what would I do' situation, which makes it even more personal/touching.",9,2,3,29 July 2019
