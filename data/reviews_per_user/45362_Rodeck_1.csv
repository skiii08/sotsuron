Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," one of my favorites in the series..after the original
","Sure there has been a lot of disappointment among 'Phantom Menace'.There was this major challenge of making a highly anticipated film and delivering. The special effects were great and i actually enjoyed the acting more than Empire and Jedi..jar Jar was a wasted character,not because he wasnt funny..he just wasnt needed for comic relief.we had c3po and r2-d2 for that..Jar jar would have been a lot cooler if he spoke another language(chewie).. Highlights: The beginning with Obi wan and Qui Gon fighting the droids(viceroys'we are no match for the jedi!!') Darth Maul was an awesome character This film would have been awesome if it wasnt a Star Wars movie..but maybe i would feel cheated if i waited outside a theater for months.",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
