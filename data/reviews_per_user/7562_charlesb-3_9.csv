Minority Report," Very good ... nearly
","An unusual film, it started so-so, had a horrible downhill period, and then, when all of the modern chase nonsense was out of the way, it became very good. But boy, did they bottle out of the ending! There was a perfectly set up distopian ending beautifully engineered ... and they blew it!Once it gets going, this is a spelendidly manipulative film, most perspectives are wrong, most character evaluations are wrong, I think all of my assumptions were wrong (there might have been something minor I got right, I just can't remember it) ... if they'd had the nerve to stick to the genuinely unsettling tenor of the middle to later part of the film this could have been great. A few lacunae (these aren't spoilers, since they don't make sense outside the context of the film and don't have any bearing on the outcome or plot) - how did Cruise not get hit with the car seat? why wasn't he taken off the access database? why was there a plug in the bathtub and why didn't anyone know where it went (they could have asked Neo ...)? How come the pre-cogs ability was limited to DC? Why didn't any of the police hit Cruise with their non-lethal weapons? Why did the police always have to come through the window when the front door was open (but then they do that in real life, don't they)? I haven't read Dick's original, but I understand that the protagonist is an overweight slob druggy type; I think if Spielberg had kept that in mind we wouldn't have had the unconvincing chase near the beginning which didn't lend anything to the story, and made Cruise seem like some kind of proto-Batman... unnecessary and distracting and irrelevant, maybe it was there for some putative teen audience who don't think its a movie without someone hanging by his fingernails from some high place.
And some great incidentals: the ultimate Siebel CRM system - and just as ineffective as its 2002 version - personalisation taken to useless perfection; the spiders, which certainly had more character than the cops; the roads.",8,0,0,30 July 2002
Citizen Kane," Someone shoot the bloody zither player
","Another dull film, built around a second rate artist. I wonder whether Kenneth Branagh built his Harry Potter, 'Gilderoy Lockheart' performance around Orson Welles in this movie. Arrogant, incompetent, hammy, self-fancying ... yes that's Welles. Lighting which would be embarassing in an 11-year olds' school play, dialogue which George Lucas would have found cheesy and a badly mixed musical soundtrack.If you care what happens after 30 minutes, you must be involved in the illegal drugs business, because no one else does.A dreary film from a pompous 'actor'.",4,4,13,21 November 2002
No Country for Old Men," Gruyere!
","Gruyere! Maybe it was meant to be humorous. Some kind of post-modern skit on dim Americans as seen from, perhaps, a French point of view.****************SPOILERS*********************Maybe it was just rubbish.Otherwise, let's do a bit of Fisking:1. Why did Llewellyn go back to the scene of a massacre where he knew that a) 2 million dollars had been left lying around b) a huge quantity of drugs had been left on the back of a pickup c) when the drug gang member he'd left some 10 hours earlier was practically dead anyway 2. Why did he hide the money in the air-conditioning system just so he could take it out by going into another room? 3. Why did he tie the rope to the case with the money in it when he was going to improvise some silly device made from coat hangers which didn't use the rope? 4. Why did the killer know that Llewellyn would go to Del Rio? Not, say, El Paso, Houston, LA, Seven Lakes North Carolina or Disneyworld? Let alone, Australia, Borneo, Malaysia, Scotland, the Faeroes, Tierra del Fuego...5. Del Rio, TX 'has a population of 33,867 with 11,895 housing units', but the killer managed to drive past the one location where his transponder detection device would notice? That was jolly lucky! 6. Why were the Mexicans at the motel virtually unarmed and why were there three of them in a room? (I've never been there, but I get the impression that all Mexicans must be murderers and gangsters, I wonder who runs the restaurants) 7. How did the killer know where to find Llewellyn in the second town (I've forgotten its name, was it El Paso?), and at which hotel (most American towns, even small ones, have lots of places to stay, perhaps you get a discount for staying at the 'Hotel for Potential Murder Victims', or 'Hotel Feeble Plot Device') 8. Why was the transponder a) so poorly hidden, surely a decent drug gang would have hidden it in the fabric of the case rather than sticking it between a few notes on the top layer. 9. Why was the transponder flashing? Surely you'd want to keep the power consumption to a minimum - I was surprised it wasn't going BEEP BEEP too. 10. What kind of idiot sits right behind the door than an armed murderer is coming through? (Hint - Llewellyn), a smart murderer with a silenced gun might even put a couple of bullets through first in case there's someone sitting etc.11. As others have remarked, do the Texas police regard the murder of one of their colleagues as of no more significance than a parking offence? 12. Why was there only one policeman in the whole of Texas? (I suppose there were two deputies as well, but both of these were certifiable idiots and there was a fat guy late on, but what he was for is a mystery), have the FBI / DEA etc been closed down while no-one was looking? 13. Can you just walk over the border into Mexico, are all Mexican border guards permanently asleep or is this just another witty racial slur (surely he should have had a sombrero and a big moustache and have a radio playing 'La Cucaracha'))? 14. Do the nice Mexicans always wake up American bums with a nice Mariachi band in the morning? (Is this what the non-gang members do?) 15. Are Mexican hospitals all free for Americans? Someone should tell Obama so he could sort out US health care by just saying 'Go South, the Mexicans will fix you up for no charge.' Didn't anyone tell the US consulate in Juarez that one of their citizens was all shot up and in hospital - obviously the 'Murderers and stupid Gunmen's' news service is much better than the US government can manage. 16. I suppose it proves that Mexicans really are stupid by the fact that we all know (from watching this film) that all you have to do to get into the USA is to say 'I was in Vietnam'(Point of information - would this have worked for ex-Viet Cong too?) and check out when some unit was there - you even get a lift into town... Why do they all try to go through the desert? Silly people. 17. How did Carson Wells and Chigurh both work out where Llewellyn had gone? He'd told no-one, even his girlfriend had no idea and there was no compelling or even uncompelling reason given, and it seemed as though he was just trying to find the most difficult place to move around unconstrained? Given that a) all the dead people in the initial scene were Mexican, b) he knew that people were after him, and that c) they were Mexican, why not go, oh I don't know, north, to somewhere like, I don't know Fargo, North Dakota, where there aren't many Mexicans and the local police might take some interest at a van full of men in sombreros waving guns and no doubt shouting 'Arriba arriba!' while dancing on their hats and beating up a toy donkey. Besides a pregnant Frances McDormand is a much better bet than a mumbling Tommy Lee Jones if you want protection. 18. In fact, why wait anywhere? A 48 hour drive will take you a long way (say 16 hours a day at 60-65 mph - that's 1000 miles a day - Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, etc), and you don't really need to stay in a nice unsafe motel overnight. OK, I've decided. It was rubbish.",3,7,14,11 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Why are there two versions
","I have just finished watching the extended DVD version of this film. When I first saw it - in the mutilated form at a cinema - I found it impressive but unsatifying. There were non sequiturs, misplaced emphasis, deviations from Tolkein which made no sense.Having seen the film as it ought to have been, I am now of the view that this is the amongst the best few films ever made. The changes are improvements and make the structure more logical- the story has been improved, something just about unique in cinema history; the cinematography is a higher standard than has ever been seen in any film.
This is a film Orson Welles would have made if he hadn't been a bad actor and a worse director.",10,0,0,19 November 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An inspired compromise!
","I have read some 200 of the reviews, and apart from the religious nutter who thinks that JK Rowling is a supporter of the Beelzebub-Moloch fan club (I sincerely hope that Ms Rowling puts a few barbs into her later books about this sort of character, perhaps a Professor Waco, visiting expert in Defence against Nonexistent Things in volume 6 would be appropriate), it seems to me that this movie has managed to achieve a remarkable compromise.Leaving aside the slightly uneven quality of the CGI (and the centaur in particular), relevant criticism seems rare (Harry isn't Indiana Jones, he's something of an Everyman who has wound up somewhere where there are many wonderful things, and he's the only one who doesn't understand them; but then 11 year olds aren't like that are they?). There seems to be almost no criticism of the cast - in my opinion this is probably the best cast film I have seen since Casablanca (and I thought Paul Henreid/Victor Laszlo was pretty doubtful - who would get killed for a wimp like him?). Similarly, there has been, as far as I can see, none at all of the visualization of the train, Hogwart's school, Hagrid's hut or any of the other locations. In fact, King's Cross station platforms 9 and 10 are much less interesting than the film version. OK Harry's cubby-hole was less grim than I had imagined, and the Dursleys less wicked and malevolent, but I suspect more literal visual versions of the book would begin to raise questions about why Harry hadn't been carted off by social workers.The filmmakers have managed to:1) Satisfy the primary target audience of the books, viz. children from 8 to 142) Satisfy the adult readers of the series who find the books a witty and compelling read3) Satisfy some of the adult non-readers, and after all, if you haven't been persuaded to read Harry Potter by the sheer magnitude of the interest, then you probably aren't very susceptible to this kind of thing4) Capture enough of the essence of a fairly anarchic English boarding school to make it into a place which is in fact dominated by a society of children, even if the adults are nominally in charge.The film had to be a massive compromise; it could not contain every detail. I should have liked more Snape, more Scabbers and more Hermione being clever, and being lonely, more Weasleys Â… but then I usually manage to sit through Seven Samurai in  one go, few 8 years olds have the bladder capacity to manage that.JK Rowling's style is, in many ways, very 'flat'; she tells you just what you need to know- though you don't always realize it-  with sharp wit, so there was only a very limited scope for interpreting the story without distorting it. This is, perhaps, the exact opposite of Shakespeare where the richness of the language allows all kinds of distortion of the presentation without any harm at all being done to the play, indeed the most basic production can sometime bring out the genius of the language better than large amounts of 'reality' can.Chris Columbus was on a hiding to nothing. A darker film would have had parents complaining that their 8 year old needed therapy after seeing Voldemort, a more slapstick film would have infuriated the adult readers, a more 'adult' version would have debased the underlying insecurity and humanity of Harry, and a Hollywood brat version would have had UK audiences setting fire to the cinema.I both enjoyed the film enormously, and on reflection consider that, although it was a very easy box office success, it was actually, I suspect, a very difficult project.",Null,0,0,26 November 2001
War of the Worlds," A contender for 'Worst of all Time'
","Tom Cruise seems to have taken on the role of 'worst articulating actor of our times' after the pathetic ham Brando finally checked out. Cruise plays the part of a semi-retarded dock worker with a screaming brat of a daughter and a glum moron of a son. Mumbling and shouting seem to be the limits of Cruise's performance, where the screenplay writers seem to have read the version of Wells' book which was translated to Korean, Welsh, Basque and Hungarian before being rendered in English by monoglot illiterate Siberians armed only with dictionaries. I'm sure they did their best, but the didn't really understand the book at all. Within minutes of the staggeringly unconvincing start I was on the side of the Martians. The screaming brat of a daughter - she must be a cert for the Razzies for a shallow, irrelevant, pointless, but somehow infuriating performance - burbles some drivel about 'her own space' or some such garbage whenever there is a life-threatening event. The son runs up a hill to where the entire US army (which seems to have a acquired a collective IQ of about 12 and the dimmest officers in history) is wiped out with him in the middle. His entire justification for this totally obvious suicide is: 'I've got to see what happens!' It is, I think the pathetic excuse for setting up a silly reunion at the end. Several hilarious points of irrelevance stand out:1) Why is Cruise heading for a major populations centre (Boston) knowing that the Martians are engaged in a war of annihilation? 2) OK, it's to find the wife who sensibly has left this retard in a dump in New Jersey for someone who looks a bit sinister but at least doesn't say 'Gwarlf gworg, hbif, mmmunghf, gurdtle' for most of the soundtrack. So still, why is Cruise dragging his children to see his ex-wife? 3) The best of all, how come Cruise is the ONLY person in a large crowd in New Jersey with a gun??? If this were Woking or Chobham (i.e. where the intelligent version was set) then this would be reasonable, but do we really believe that in the slums of New Jersey there is only one gun? 4) Why does the ferry have ALL of its lights on? Is this just in case a couple of Martians are particularly dim and haven't noticed? 5) Having wiped out all electrical equipment with an electromagnetic pulse (which if I remember involves a low yield nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere - and only affects hardware with small scale electrical contacts) why did all of the electrical equipment recover?Essentially this is an exceptionally bad film, badly acted, cretinously adapted from a book which 100 years earlier had a sounder scientific foundation.",1,2,4,28 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," Bad film, worse acting
","First. Daniel Day-Lewis is a ham of the first order. This man has about as much acting ability as my goldfish. Many years ago, an English journalist called Michael Green wrote a great comedy series which included 'The Art of Coarse Acting', which described the ludicrously inept activities of amateur actors in local companies who mostly acted in church halls or tents. On the basis of this bit of grimacing and wholly unconvincing twaddle. Day-Lewis would be lucky to get the part of Fifth Attendant Lord in Henry VI Part III in the Acton Player. From a reasonable start in 'Last of the Mohicans', he has had a Tarantino like vertical descent from good to garbage. Someone should explain that gurning and mugging are not actually acting. Goggling at the camera and talking in an accent no human has ever had do not constitute 'great acting'. Great acting is what goes on at the National Theatre on London's South Bank when Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren or Derek Jacobi turn up. It's what goes on frequently at other London theatres or Stratford when Vanessa Redgrave, Tamsin Greig, Julian Bleach and dozens of others go on stage. Second, this film is so ludicrously full of itself that it is an almost Ibsenesque parody. It opens up with a long, dull, 'who cares' sequence when no-one speaks. You are totally certain that something untoward is about to happen that you simply speculate as to what it is, and then laugh when you get it right. Instead of building tension, developing a feeling of otherworldliness, it simple draws attention to the fact that the useless director is trying very hard (and very unsuccessfully) to 'make a point'. Unfortunately, no-one cares what the point might be, the device is as unconvincing as a Henry VIII codpiece and deservedly draws as much despising humour. After about 40 minutes of this drivel, I gave up and wrote this. The DVD cost me GBP3. That was about GBP5 too much.",1,4,11,5 March 2010
Shrek," Dull, dull, dull
","I fell asleep after 10 minutes, woke up after around 20 minutes, discovered that Eddie Murphy was still involved and left.This is a desperately feeble movie, crude, humourless and without any redeeming features apart from the quality of the graphics, which are excellent.I suppose all that I can drag from it is that at least it's better than Wild Wild West, which I now consider the worst film I have ever seen; but this piece of dross is running it close. A pattern is emerging however... and Mr Murphy appears to be it.",Null,0,0,25 December 2001
