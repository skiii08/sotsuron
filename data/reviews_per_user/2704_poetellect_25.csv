Requiem for a Dream," In addiction
","Folks, chances are, if you're sitting there somewhere, reading this review- chances are you have it pretty good.  There's a lot of misfortune in this world.  If you think you have it bad, and you watch this film, you see- you FEEL- that others have it bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, worse.  I have never seen a film capture with such brutal intensity, and tear jerking honesty, what addiction does- whether it be alcohol, drugs, meat, sugar, TV...whatever. We all have are addictions, our compulsive behaviors, and this film lets you see where that kind of lifestyle can lead.  It captures, quite accurately, the angst of a drug-addict lifestyle, without a false note struck anywhere. Mark my words- March 25th will be Ellen Burstyn's night, guarenteed, practically- and I wouldn't be surprised if it was Darren Afronsky's either, for Best Director.  Absolutely unforgettable.",10,0,0,11 November 2000
Requiem for a Dream," VISCERAL, EXCRUCIATING BEAUTY
","Cannot even begin to say how I feel- this is the kind of movie that you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever forget- ever- oustanding, overpowering, quite literally life-changing, amazing, graphic, hardcore, poignant, so much, so much, so much, so beautiful...ASTOUNDING- if this movie doesn't win any recognition at this year's Oscar ceremony, one really, really must wonder what the Academy's all about...Violent, excruciating.Sucks you in, like a care wreck, must watch, must watch, but you care, and you flinch...and it doesn't end...so amazing- picture Last Exit to Brooklyn meets Magnolia meets Christine F- OVERPOWERING.And the thing is...the thing is...movies that have this much to say aren't usually done in such the visually stunning, highly technical, graphically intense, immersion-oriented method that this is filmed in.  To quote an earlier review-Go.  Go see this movie.  Now.  It's an experience you won't soon forget. Out of ten stars, twelve.  All the way.",10,0,0,9 November 2000
Star Trek," Kinetic, Subtle, Multi-Layered Masterpiece
","Bravo and kudos all around- J.J. Abrams has taken the fetid clay of a rotting entertainment franchise and fashioned a breathtaking, stand-alone, beautiful film.It is not only the visual, non-stop cinematic intrepidness of this enterprise, but the glorious production value, the actors who you truly feel researched and understood the nuances of the Star Trek story as well as their individual character(s), and the experienced editing/sound quality that contribute to this film's greatness.It will be very hard to top. Hopefully this isn't the capstone of Roddenberry's intellectual brainchild, but it certainly may be...ROUNDS OF LOUD, LOUD APPLAUSE! The creators and visionaries and consumers of science fictional exploration would be, and are, very proud.",10,6,22,1 May 2009
Memento," SLAM-DUNK Oscar knab for Pearce, though it's early
","WOW- talk about going through the proverbial looking-glass...jeez, this movie is breathtaking.  The sheer ambiguity of each scene, each character, each protagonist and each line of dialouge is so beautifully and intricately pieced together- if films are judged, as I judge them, based on how much you think about them after first viewing them- well, this one sticks with you for months.  It's still with me.  Pearce gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a man with short-term memory loss, who needs a polaroid camera and the written word to constantly remind himself of what and who he is.  Themes of revenge, of guilt, and of hatred are so beautifully intermeshed with some of the most under-appreciated actors in Hollywood today- Carrie-Anne Moss, anyone?- that one leaves the theatre THINKING- this is a THINKING movie (don't get scared), that makes you question every memory you ever had, every experience you ever experienced, and the very life, the reality, you live in.  In that way, I guess, it's like The Matrix, besides the fact that two of the actors who are in that film are also in this one.I also equate this movie to 'Gladiator', in the sense that, despite it's early February-2001 release, Pearce's performance is so astoundingly thought-provoking and well-acted that an Oscar-nomination is most likely a SLAM-DUNK for next year's Oscars.",10,0,0,24 February 2001
Memento," a 'Crime and Punishment' for our times, timed backwards.
","'A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.  Recalling that period long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till the final catastrophe.  He was convicned that he had been mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him.  He had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed on in his imagination.'-Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and PunishmentThis film is brilliant.  We choose what we choose what we condition ourselves to remember what we remember.  It's a perfect metaphor for Nazi Germany.  It's a sly and intelligent emulation and manifestation of the Raskolnikov archetype in literature, the man lost in his world, in his thoughts, in his life which is spiraling out of control, and what he must do...You'll want to see this twice.",10,0,1,19 August 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," very funny and well-made
","This movie is just a lot of fun!  Johnny Depp is a stand-out in a performace that reminds one of how talented this guy really is.  The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and scenery and cinematography are fresh and the dialogue is very humorous.  Possibly one of the summer's best.",10,0,1,13 July 2003
The English Patient," extreme passion + seductive, time-fractured plot + hauntingly gorgeous cinematography = spellbinding movie
","Incredible film- I love how the intracicies of the dialogue and plot linger on well after the last reel- you find yourself thinking about the layered-ness of what people say, and how you can apply it to more than one meanings that reveal themselves throughout the film.Also, there's this continuous theme of 'movement', of being in 'planes', or 'cars', of one person connecting with another, in vehicles- it's very subtly, provacativally done.All in all, well-deserving of Best Picture Oscar.",10,1,3,16 September 2001
The Others," absolutely exquisite
","Rarely have I been so impressed with a movie's wry, knowing, and uncanny ability to produce a story of such wry, intellectual, spiritual, and haunting power.  There is much and many things going on in this flick- and it will surely tapped for a few Oscars, especially Cinematography, Set Design (check out those props and chairs and house lights- they're the real 40s stuff!), and even perhaps Best Original Screenplay.  On an even more impressive note is the emotional scope and raw energy with which Nicole imbues her portayal of Grace, as well as the uncannily adult and responsive acting ability shown by the supporting characters. (Check out those child actors!  what are they, adults in kid suits?  I've never seen anything like it!  Haley Joel doesn't hold a candle to these kids' ability)*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Let me first start off by addressing some of this film's many themes.  The whole idea of Nicole having to 'lock' each individual room's door when entering and exiting creates the whole idea of barrier and isolation, as well as emotional barrenness.The whole idea of 'lighting' takes on a surreal effect in this film, not only in its importance to Nicole's children and the exquisite, special cinematography to be found here, but also in the creation myth that begins the film and the idea of 'light' and 'darkness', of 'other' and 'us'.Exquisite is a hard word not to use when writing about this one.  It's the real thing- 'The Others' is a movie at once brilliant without drifting into the land of the quasi-pretentious, as Memento has a tendency to do, (being so 'smart' that it's oftentimes impossible to follow and understand).  'The Others' is at last an emotional look of the bonds of a three-membered family, of human interaction, of spiritual explanation of death and the paranormal, and a wry inquest into what 'ghosts' in of themselves have to say about us the living, us the dead, or, as this film may have us believe, the very thin lines that separates the two.All in all, will definitely garner some Oscar recognition, as I stated before, and even (who knows?) get Nicole that Best Actress nod she's deserved for some time now.",10,0,0,5 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not only epic, exquisite film-making, but HISTORICAL- this one'll go down in the books (no pun intended)
","Holy *$#t.  Mind-blowing is a word that comes to mind.  Think the intensity of Requiem for a Dream meets the epic story of Braveheart meets the eye-popping cinematography and visuals of the Terminator movies and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Then sprinkle in a few acting lessons that bring to mind the ablilites of Brando and Olivier and a novel-to-film adaptation that rivals Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter' and you'll have, maybe, a FRACTION of an idea of what this movie accomplishes- and, having only read the Hobbit, it still manages to astound and mind-boggle myself, who am not a 'hardcore' LOTR fan.  Best-Picture material.",10,1,1,9 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," violent, excruciating beauty- why this film will win Best Picture
","As I begin to read more and more of the reviews and opinions people seem to be forming about this film, I cannot help but think how anyone who detracts from this masterpiece (which, sorry to say y'all- it very much IS), is missing a crucial point- that LoTR, despite its length, merges so effectively and so beautifully every aspect of film and overcomes so much that could of screwed the film-makers up, that one simply must stand in awe because of the sheer obstacles one knows must have been lept over, and are lept over, with such grace and wonder.Who knows what gives some films that sense of I HAVE TO SEE THAT AGAIN and others that sense of 'geeze, that sucked.'  This film just has it...it has everything...Elijah Wood, whom we've seen mature and come of age into an incredible and formidable acting power, McClellan, Holm, and Blanchett, all Academy-Award Nominees who bring an indelible European flare to their characters, fight scenes with that blend of passion and violence that give movie-goers adrenaline rushes, and some of the most unique and fascinating cinematography that I've seen in quite a while.  One may really loose oneself in this film, in the realm of Middle-Earth.As for the ending, I like it- at first it seemed too abrupt, too episodic- but it grows on you; I like the fact that it ends so abruptly, because it just reminds me that there're two more coming...and I'm not a die-hard Tolkein fan.  I just like epic, gorgeous film-making, which this most certainly is.",10,0,0,27 December 2001
The Pianist," what can I say?
","Seek out this film.  That's all; anything else seems unimportant. Superlatives would simply debase, compliments reify, flattery insult- this is a film that needs to be seen to be believed, appreciated, understood, cried over.  It will touch the bottommost recesses of your heart.",10,0,1,9 November 2002
28 Days Later...," A beautiful, harrowing, and well-made allegorical fable...but more importantly, scary AND extremely intelligent
","I have not written a review for IMDB in many months.  This movie has moved me to do so.  Rarely have I been so frightened and made to think, not only in a cheesy horror-night-of-living-dead type way, but in a very visceral and scary commentary about where the future of humanity is headed.  There is much symbolism here, namely referencing anthrax, HIV, SARS, ebola, and countless other biological diseases.  I feel this movie is almost an allegorical warning.  Extremely well acted, especially by once-tomorrow-person Naomie Harris, this film does what all great movies do- provokes thought, provokes discussion.  It held me at the edge of my seat. I want to see it again.From a strict film-making standpoint, the shots are extremely well placed, the cinematography is gorgeous and very appropriate, and overall it's just a really, really beautiful film, if in a very dark, morbid way.  It builds and builds into an almost Hitchcockian climax.  Pay attention to how the Academy reacts to this very unique British film.",10,0,1,9 July 2003
Moulin Rouge!," gotta love the vision- 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return'
","Alright, so as hoaky, somewhat pretentious, and kind of unoriginal the dialouge becomes at some points in this movie (hear Kidman, 'I can't pretend anymore!!!', etc.), it still manages to soar to inspirational, perhaps even oscar-worthy greatness at many beautiful heights.  Ewen's performance is masterful- Nicole was somewhat weird, but still amazing.  Ultimately, slam-dunk Set Design, Cinematography, Sound, and Lighting Oscar nods for this film- perhaps even a best supporting actor nod to Ewen.  All in all a great film- you gotta love the bohemian salutes to freedom, truth, beauty, and, of course, love.",10,0,1,2 June 2001
Million Dollar Baby," Intoxicating, Brilliant, Inspirational, and Multi-Layered- what films are meant 2 B
","Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film, one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it every time. I loved first and foremost its message that we create ourselves through our drive, loyalty, ambition, dedication, and work. Secondly, I love its insistence in the good of the American Dream, and I loved its excitement and beautiful, touching message toward the end. A movie about violence and ambition that evolves into a movie about love, hard-earned sacrifice, and doing something meaningful with one's life. Grade A entertainment with a beautiful message to boot! Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood should both win their second Oscars for their contribution to cinema.",10,179,277,30 January 2005
Garden State," Genuinely hilarious and moving- but more than that, the dialogue is some of the most realistic I've ever heard
","What I love most about this movie was its accurate and funny and nuanced observations of life in suburbia, but more than that, life itself.  You really get to know Andrew very well.  If Braff doesn't garner at least a Best Original Screenplay nod for this, the Academy'll miss the mark.  The story is really touching, beautiful, and moving as it encapsulates all the awkward and real and bizarre moments of those happily trapped in suburbia. It shows the transcending and liberating power of finding love.  How love can be accidental.  How love inspires you to improve yourself, have fun, and live in the present instead of ascribing all your hope to the future, and thus missing out on your entire life.  That's what I think this movie's message was- enjoy every moment, and love every friend and every person that comes into your life and touches you with their love.",10,0,1,20 August 2004
Paranormal Activity," Guidelines for Building Aura and Feeling: Excellence
","Truly good film- very anti-much of what Hollywood spews out nowadays; truly creative and innovative in many, many ways, but mostly in the way the camera and actors interact and decide what and which ways to see and not see what is going on- truly brilliantly done film. I feel having a scene with the demonologist would have added a great deal to the overall knowledge and eeriness of the film... This work vacillates between suspenseful and frightening, however some moments are not so much scary as they are comical- a true panoply of emotions here. All in all, well worth your time and money.I found myself wanting to converse with the actors at different points in the film, which doesn't always happen in explicit Hollywood-produced fare, which I think attests to the naturalism and reality inherent to how this was done.",9,3,6,29 October 2009
World Trade Center," Terrifying and Beautiful, Stone's Cinematic Tribute is A Bold and Exacting Momument to Heroism...In Every Form
","I loved this movie- I have to say, and it wasn't because I wanted to love it. Rather, I went into the theater with very low expectations, thinking Hollywood, thinking exploitation, thinking miscast and misdirected intentions, but still wanting to see how it all turned out. And I was very, very surprised and very, very happy I did, because Mr. Stone has redeemed what has been (of late) an extremely disappointing and dissipating career. With bold cinematic candor and haunting artistic eloquence, Stone reminds us of the evil in our world, and what we can do about fighting it and replacing it with love. By remembering heroes and courage, Stone has crafted what just may be the finest film released this summer. And most importantly, 'World Trade Center' reminds us how art- especially film- can create lasting testaments to the power of the human spirit to overcome obstacles and ultimately triumph.",10,3,12,10 August 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," beautiful and funny- a genuinely touching movie that reminds you to embrace your experiences
","What a @W#(*# movie.  'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' isabout so many things- but mostly, I think it's about cherishingevery moment, even if it ends up in pain- to not squander anyrelationship or regret ANYTHING- because it's all about growth-and to forget is to lose the moments that make life everything it is.This movie far surpasses many of the films I have seen in the pastfew years.  It is intimate and real.  It taught me something, orperhaps reminded me of something- that no matter how painfulany memory can be, one should not regret it, because pain is howwe become who we are- pain is how we learn- pain is a huge partof the joy of life.  For every unpleasant memory, there is a blissfull,ecstatic experience attached, and this film reminds you toembrace every moment and love every mistake.And isn't Jim Carrey incredible?  And Kate Winslet impeccable?10/10- a heart-felt ride.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
Pretty Woman," live with levity, love without restraint, do good- a nuanced, beautiful film often mistaken for a 'formulaic' pattern
","There is something about this movie that is so captivating and sobeautiful and so very truly genuinely moving that no matter howmany times I watch it, last night in particular, I am left speechlessand struck by the beauty of its simple story, the directness of itsmessage, and the sagacity and nuanced scenes between Roberts and Gere.  Many might see this movie as frivolous fluff,but there are some very deeply psychological scenes in here,brilliantly portrayed by a gorgeous and talented Roberts (who,throughout her career, does play only variations of this onecharacter- but hey, what an amazing character)- namely, thescenes in the dimly lighted hotel dining room when Gere andRoberts attempt to make out.  See this movie if you want a greatstory that cuts to the meaning of relationships, kindness, self- improvement and love as transcending all societal boundariesand taboos.  Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,13 May 2004
Inside Man," Compelling, Quality Film-making (CAUTION- spoiler within)
","All in all great film. Spike Lee navigates the waters of mainstream film-making and unique, quirky, innovative scripts with great ease. Perhaps the most smooth, enjoyable, thought-provoking, flawless Lee film I've yet seen. Jodie Foster is a stand-out. Only two slight flaws: (WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD) 1) Clive Owen's accent- woh there boy- are you American or British or Australian? Choose your nationality and stick with it- highly distracting. Not a sign of good acting here.2) If Case was so ashamed of his dark past, why did he keep the HIGHLY INCRIMINATING paper document in the safety deposit box? Why didn't he just destroy it and keep the diamonds? It makes no sense.",10,3,6,26 March 2006
Mystic River," A sparse, intricately crafted, deeply affecting, all-together breathtaking film
","Wow- what a movie!  Clint Eastwood has gifted us with the magnum opus of his film career- everything seems to just click with this movie- the acting is vibrant with intensity and truthfulness, the cinematography is beautiful to behold, and the thematic development, ties between present and past, and personal histories haunting each character leave you spellbound.  Grade A. Oscar-contender.  One of the best films this year!",10,1,1,28 September 2003
A Beautiful Mind," a very, very touching movie- I get choked up even now
","I am very thankful to have seen this film with my family.  Ron Howard's directing is formidably impeccable, really allowing you to understand schizophrenia as if you yourself were afflicted.  Jennifer Connelly proves once and for all that she is an acting force to be contended with, which we saw last year with Requiem for a Dream.  And, finally, Russel Crowe's performance imbues not only the complex physicality and verbal mannerisms of an obviously well-researched role, but an incredibly empathetic understanding of someone who struggles to simply relate to people.  An awesome movie.  Well worth your time.  I still get choked up thinking about the last scene.",10,0,1,12 January 2002
Ray," one of the most intense, inspiring, and beautiful films I have ever seen
","Sometimes I watch a movie and I'm reminded of how the word 'inspiration' isderived- namely, in-spiriting, or evocative of the human spirit. This is definitely such a film, with Jamie Foxx delivering a mind-blowingly real and harrowingand moving performance. Kudos all around to everyone involved with this film, from the cinematography to the smooth and concise directorial feel. Hackford has definitely moved my heart, and I plan on seeing it again. I rememberfeeling that way about 'What's Love Got to Do With It?'",10,0,1,25 October 2004
The Blind Side," Film: All-Around Excellence; Bullock: An Understated, Powerful Masterpiece
","Everyone involved in this film's production must have been at the very peak of their game- no pun intended- because the movie fires on all cylinders and continues to do so after every genuinely earned laugh, genuinely earned tear, and genuinely earned ear-to-ear smile. In fact, that is a better 'Summary' for this film- genuine. The adjective works. I found myself entranced by the humor the writer injected into the dialogue and banter interspersed between a poignant biographical drama. I found myself astounded at what great cinema can achieve- a panoramic, lyrical look at race at an individual level, and what one individual's kindness and love can transform in another's life. All in all, a film that reminds you how the truest stories are the ones that leave you speechless, with eyes watering.Above all, Bullock absolutely won me over. She takes the film not only to another level, but to a Best Actress nomination for herself, and perhaps even a Best Picture nod. Her acting is subtle, understated brilliance, yet hard and powerful when she needs to be. Actresses like Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore could even- WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT!?- take a lesson here- in places where Bullock could have cried, could have shouted, could have done any number of Hollywoodized set pieces, she restrains herself and lets the story, and the life of her character, tell this story. I will be very surprised if she doesn't get, at the very least, a nomination. She certainly deserves it. Kudos!",10,2,5,7 December 2009
300," Heart-Rendingly Beautiful & Unusually Resonant for Modern Times
","It has been a while since a movie's moved me enough to write about it on IMDb.com, but this movie takes the cake. And while, as you will hear from every reviewer, its visuals are staggering, its acting fierce, its battle scenes unprecedented in movie history, and its graphic effects and story polyglot and stunning, what resonated with me the most about this film- surprising, since the visuals can punch you and leave you forgetting everything else- is the history and story behind it all.For, in today's world, we battle terrorism and those who would seek to destroy freedom, democracy, knowledge, and the right to earn one's way in a lawful society. This film speaks to an age-old battle between what is good and what is evil. Truly timeless.",7,4,19,24 February 2007
