Marie Antoinette," do no miss this movie
","You've made another enchanting movie and it's not an easy one ... love the way you take your time and let the camera linger. Some might say your story doesn't contain enough action and it's all just a visual smörgåsbord ... entirely untrue. Most everyone knows MA's true story and that's why your decision to stay completely away from the inevitability of their tragic fates makes every moment so increasingly charged with tension. Simply marvelously done. Less is More. My impression is that your movie didn't get the attention it deserved. Viewed an Academy Screener (shame on me this movie needs a big big screen) and thought I'd be watching the Paris Hilton take on being Marie Antoinette, which was hardly the case. Maybe the advertising campaign went a bit astray. Love the bookends of beginning and ending with Versailles. Keep up the good work.",10,3,6,26 November 2006
