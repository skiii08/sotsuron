Requiem for a Dream," Disturbingly Fascinating
","It has taken me awhile to put Requiem For A Dream into words. Everything about this movie flows so perfectly. For once heroin abuse is not glamorized like in Trainspotting or Basketball Diaries. There are no mellow-dramatic withdraw scenes or extravagant scenes of the characters shooting up. Its in your face but collectively. Some of the other themes that transpire are deeply touching. Such as a lonely Ellen Burstyn sitting in front of her television wishing for a call from her son, and so perfectly phrased in one scene she tells him 'I no longer live my life but endure it.' (Something along those lines) The direction I venture to say is groundbreaking and gives the film flair. Jennifer Connelly was amazing. Ellen Burstyn deserved that Oscar! The final 15 minutes of this film shook me up and are some of the most disturbing sequences in cinema history. The film starts out with a depressing atmosphere and goes even further down until its crashed and the credits role. A must see for any film buff. I give it a 10.",Null,0,0,13 April 2001
Memento," Was it really that great?
","I saw Memento last night and although I thought it was an original way of telling a story it carried no deeper meaning that floored me.  By the end of the film I was still very confused.  Remember Sammy Jankis?  Who was on the phone? Even with the finale, or the beginning I guess I should say, it did not tie all the loose ends together.  And with the explanation the audience is fed at the beginning of the chaos it gives the film even less emotion.It definitely is not one of the top ten films of all time.  The plot was original as well as the story telling but it lacked any emotional charge or underlying meaning to really make an impact on me.",Null,1,2,29 May 2001
The Others," More than just 'Scary Stuff'
","To write my review I would like to rebuttal the comments that continually compare this film to that of the Sixth Sense.  The major difference between The Others and The Sixth Sense is that The Sixth Sense is a psychological drama with supernatural elements.  The Others is a psychological MYSTERY, with possible supernatural elements.  Two different genre's of film-making, two different ways of telling a story.  The surprise ending is usually a mandatory constituent of a mystery film.  The surprise ending to The Sixth Sense was interesting but raised question to possible plot holes.  The other remarkable device The Others presents is theory and conception.  The Sixth Sense lays out exactly what is trying to be achieved and the 'surprise' ending is not out of character of the whole plot.  The Others ending may not have been a surprise to a select few audience members, but that's the point of a mystery, combining clues to theorize a climax ending; figure it out, congrats, to the rest of us who didn't, surprise!  In the end what is important is how you leave the theater, and while my friends and I left the The Others talking about possible theories the ending presents and what parts made us jump completely out of our chair,  leaving The Sixth Sense we were questioning the obvious plot holes that the ending left us with.   Everything about The Others is chilling.  Cliché?  Perhaps, but what is more satisfying than an old English mansion, surrounded by fog, with child inhabitants who fear seeing the sun at the medical risk of death? Especially when telling a horror story.  Not one drop of blood is shed in order to scare.  No CGI monsters, no running through the house as the floorboards are lifted from beneath them.  Noises, voices, mystery and psychological drama are the tricks to create fear.  The performances were creepy and admirable.  The sets were perfect.  The story was masterful, is this really a haunted house or haunted minds? Who are the caretakers, whats up with the husband, what happened to Grace to make her children more afraid of her than the possible ghosts?  So much mystery and all answered wonderfully.   Bone chilling, thought provoking entertainment.",10,0,1,16 August 2001
Big Fish," Visually stunning is just the beginning
","Big Fish really has been one of the best movies I have seen this year.  The story is simple, so anyone who cannot put a cap on the constant search to watch something absolutely original should probably avoid Big Fish.  However while the story is simple the way it is told is original in its own right.  Fairytale like touches through out a variety of embellished life stories bring an enchanting feeling to the entire movie.  Admittedly slower paced, I do not feel that Big Fish is so void of substance that its unbearable, but rather the pacing allows us as an audience to become completely engaged with the movie. I did not notice any poor performances from the fantastic cast.  Reviews in which people have picked out time line flaws and swaying accents only prove that they walked into this movie to find flaws and not to enjoy themselves.  Big Fish is a love story in part but mostly a life story at heart.  If you cannot appreciate what simple story elements Tim Burton has successfully brought to life, then you quite simply have not lived life enough to find beauty in Big Fish.",Null,0,0,26 December 2003
Saw," See Saw? DON'T!
","I am quite impressed with the amount of good reviews on this website in regards to SAW. Usually people are much more cynical with their opinions on a horror movie.... Those reviewers who say SAW is a psychological movie are half right. Psychologically there's a lot to discuss, like how stupid would someone have to be to look over the obvious plot holes to say this movie is 'good' entertainment. How A.D.D. are we as an audience that instead of a movie moment with true suspense we instead get a Nine Inch Nails music video interlude inappropriately thrown in. First things first: the acting is beyond terrible. Even for Danny Glover, but to his credit is working with a cheesy and laughable dialogue. Cary Elwes is downright terrible, the worst acting I have seen this year. An evil bad guy who broods about saying in dark cartoon voices 'I AM SICK OF THE DISEASE OF THE WORLD' is scary? The actions of nearly all the characters are flat out illogical, even with a hearty amount of suspension of disbelief. I find it amusing that people justify this flick by accusing bad reviewers of being brainwashed by constant eye candy from high budget studio pictures, when clearly 'SAW' tries to disguise a bad movie with exactly that, loads of technical eye candy. This movie would have been much better had it just stuck to a simple story. It was an original idea that went to waste with complicated & unnecessary 'plot twists' and poor execution from a freshman writer and director. Its a shame that such a promising movie became such a complete waste of time & money.",1,3,5,30 October 2004
Vanilla Sky," Captivating Drama Wait no, far fetched Science-Fiction
","Vanilla Sky really had a shot at being interesting.  What went so wrong; the last half-hour or so.  Many comments have said this is `not for the easily entertained.'  Which is funny because the last couple film roles starring Cameron Diaz or Tom Cruise, or had direction by Cameron Crowe was quite simply that, easy entertainment.   Tom Cruise was at his `peak' in his most common role, big shot, and successful stud that all the chicks want.  He has a fall from grace, some shabby depression, and a re-awakening by the end of the movie.  Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz stole the show but with nearly identical performances of witty cute girls. Of course until Cameron Diaz drives a car off a bridge in a jealous rage.  This would be the Vanilla Sky's first `twist.'  Not really that enthralling.  What happens next is a dry build up of a love story that starts to go somewhere till the next twist.  This next twist really opens up the movie to many possibilities, realistic possibilities.  Things start to go haywire, and it gets confusing but still is interesting.  By the final twist I was saying out loud `what the' What could really have been something got slammed fast by that really annoying guy with the big eyes.  If there is one thing I hate about movies, it is those characters that come out of nowhere and have all the answers. In Vanilla Sky's climax, the film has strayed far away from psychological drama and turned into science-fiction boo-ha.  Flashbacks to what really happened are visited to help the audience figure it out, if this wasn't easy entertainment then the flashbacks would be completely unnecessary, because an audience not subdued by easy entertainment could have figured it out. Vanilla Sky was basically a huge waste of time.  Better luck next time for Tom Cruise in his next typecast role.",Null,0,0,19 December 2001
Amélie," Rare Film Magic
","The one thing about Amelie that really sticks with me is the magic I felt after viewing it.  Warm hearted and clever this film does not come off as 'cute' like many of the droids of American 'chic-flicks' that come across major viewing screens a year.  One major difference between this film and those American flicks we love to hate, is Amelie is not afraid of being bold.  Don't expect a baby head coming out of a womb in the first few scenes of any Julia Roberts movie.  Amelie takes different directions with texture, writing, and style never cutting out what may be considered taboo. Wonderfully funny and amusing it never runs out of steam to keep the audience entertained.  Audrey Tautou performance is memorable, the rest of the cast is dead on, sometimes a little cliché but not overboard.   Amelie is worthwhile to anyone who wants to leave the theater smiling.",Null,0,1,19 December 2001
