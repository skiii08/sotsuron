Vertigo," Nostalgic, nothing more
","It was after I heard that Vertigo had replaced Citizen Kane as 'Best Movie of all Time' that I pondered as to whether I had actually seen this film. This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.It's purely personal of course.",6,5,11,7 August 2012
Midnight in Paris," Bravo Woody! Welcome back.
",I have always been a Woody Allen fan but let's face it his decade-long European sabbatical has hardly produced anything remotely memorable until now. The switch in genre from those uninspiring melodramas to romantic fantasy works perfectly. It can be no coincidence that Owen Wilson was chosen to play the leading man for a part that Allen clearly wrote with himself in mind. Without ever consciously mimicking Allen Wilson manages to put across that same angst and self-doubt in an amusing and totally charming performance. Indeed it is difficult to think of another actor attempting it without resorting to impersonation. Marion Cotillard lit up the screen as usual. Has that woman ever appeared in a bad film? The photography was also worthy of comment. Paris was made to look the centre of the universe and even in pouring rain it looked completely irresistible.Woody Allen should receive the freedom of the city for his contribution to French tourism.,Null,3,6,14 October 2011
The Last Song," Pleasant chick-flick
",I can't understand why people hate this film so much. Perhaps maybe that the absence of bad language and writhing bodies allied to a half-decent story was too much for some viewers. The film was dominated as it so often is by the performance of Greg Kinnear who was totally convincing as the estranged and dying father of his brattish daughter played by Miley Cyrus. Miss Cyrus was pleasant enough but I fear her film opportunities will recede as she lacks that screen presence so important for a leading lady.The scenery was gorgeous and photography could not be faulted. The film had both a sad and happy ending which pleased my wife - what more could you wish for!,7,1,7,5 September 2010
Burn After Reading," ... I'll give it another ten minutes ...
","What a disappointing film from such an ensemble of acting talent. What on earth were Clooney,Malkovich and Pitt doing in this meaningless piece of drivel? MacDormand was the only one to come out of it with any credit but then again this lady always shines. This was one of those films when you start to shuffle and glance around to find other members of the audience doing exactly the same thing. It's not just me! I'll give it another ten minutes,then another ten ... it just must get better! Then the credit starts to roll,half the audience have already left and you think to yourself about all the other things that you could have been doing if you hadn't wasted your time sitting here.",2,10,21,8 November 2008
Mr. Nobody," A visual experience. Let's leave it there.
","I came across this film quite by chance and as an avid film fan I was puzzled as to how I had missed such a big-budgeted production back in 2009. Well, after sitting through the extended version, all two hours and thirty seven minutes some questions were answered. It was an art film. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing but it did at least explain the anonymity. What I do find inexplicable however, particularly during such austere times, is that nearly $50M can be raised for a project which had no realistic prospect of ever bringing a return. Extraordinary - a labour of love perhaps? Anyway to the film itself. I sat, without fidgeting or clock-watching, through the entire film without being able to explain to anybody at its conclusion what had in fact happened. You kind of felt you knew but didn't feel confident enough to make your thoughts public. The film had sufficient visual impact to keep you attentive while mentally you were in a complete flux! What has been interesting is reading the comments of others. One said that there was humour and LOL scenes, really? I don't recall any. Many used the year 2092 as a reference point as if it were the only solid foundation on which to hang the story but as we see at the conclusion even the year is a facade which comes crashing down. Somebody even said that any production that included 'Mr.Sandman' in its soundtrack was good enough for him. Clearly some people are easily pleased. Overall the film could be said to be an experience but then again 'experience' is often used as an euphemism for a mistake.",6,7,15,3 January 2012
Drive," Compensatory violence.
",I am sorry that I don't share everybody else's apparent appreciation of the film. In my opinion Hollywood doesn't do the 'Film Noir' genre particular well but with one notable exception and it is no coincidence that DRIVE takes it inspiration from the 1978 classic THE DRIVER. If you believe that the vacant enigmatic stares and irritatingly long pauses in dialogue are more than balanced out by the unnecessarily strong violence then this film is for you.The 1978 film did not require excessive bloodletting to capture the audience attention which was more fascinated by the chemistry of Ryan O'Neill and Isabelle Adjani. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan simply failed to ignite and I do not see the former as a new Hollywood heavy.He has no charisma.,Null,0,2,26 September 2011
Unknown," Implausible maybe, exciting most definitely!
",Irrespective of a movie's subject matter if you can honestly say that you did not fidget or glance at your watch but sat intrigued for the duration then you have been entertained and what more can a film offer than that? Unknown is that kind of offering. The film has some very implausible moments the most memorable being the notion that you could somehow 'prep' a terrorist will sufficient knowledge in a highly technical subject to enable him to blend in with the other eggheads at a convention.However this is not an immediate distraction and represents the kind of flaws you talk about AFTER a film's conclusion. Someone said this was a typical Liam Neeson film and their probably right.Matt Damon is the only other actor that immediately comes to mind who embodies that look of both confusion and resilience to adversity. Neeson's ally in his battle against evil forces is the beautiful Diane Kruger who plays a rather unlikely looking immigrant taxi driver but then again there's nothing like an attractive woman to divert your mind from impossible scenarios. Enough criticism .... enjoy!,8,1,3,15 March 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Stunning and beguiling
","It has been a long time since I sat through a movie of such length and became so beguiled.The film could have continued for a further hour with no complaint from me. Hollywood has shown an understandable reluctance in recent years to produce slow action motion pictures of such duration for fear of them being shunned as European-style art house. That this movie works so well is down to the brilliant and sensitive interpretation of an intriguing story. The direction,script and acting are first class. The wonderful 'aging' of the Brad Pitt character is riveting and presumably one reason why no studio has attempted to film this Fitzgerald book earlier. Brad Pitt should win an Oscar for his performance. Cate Blanchett similarly although I fear 2009 could be Brangelina year",9,1,3,2 January 2009
Three Colors: Blue," Binoche glows ..... just as well there isn't much else!
","''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.",6,3,7,21 November 2012
