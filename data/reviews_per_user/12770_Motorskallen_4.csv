Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pretty good
","I expected a fairly good action/adventure with some good special effects, a fairly good story without any more depths than any other pirate story in the world, some laughs, and as always a new villain - and I got exactly what I wanted. Besides from bringing back that feeling of being a classic matiné/pirate story (even got mermaids and the old concept of the obedient zombie), it is also so far the best sequel. No confusing detours in the story, no uncalled-for action scenes (come on! that tornado in the end of the third installment, where did that come from??) ... even though I have to admit some of the action scenes with a drunk Jack stumbling around could have been shorten down a bit. But yeah ... on the hole, a pretty good pirate movie. I love the new villain, to me he was the best and most 'trustworthy' so far. Just a guy who happens to be unusually cruel (and with the ability to control weather, but that's beside the point). I could actually bare some of the plot holes, because the rest was good enough for me ... I remember when we stepped out of the theater, and one of my friends said: 'I didn't believe in the story, there were too many holes', and I replied: 'Come on, you just saw a guy get eaten by a mermaid. If you want something realistic, read Vilhelm Moberg, and leave my pirate movie alone.' And I'm gonna stick to that. I remember when I was ten and read 'Treasure Island' for the first time. It wasn't exactly the same feeling, but something close enough.",7,0,2,24 June 2011
Hostel," For Americans by Americans ...
","... and not in a good way (could anything every be with that headline?). This movie is like they have taken all clichés from all bad American horror movies, and put it in one single super bad movie. The acting is bad, the directing is crap, the dialogs are brain-dead. And the entire story is like ... I mean, come on?? Is that the way Americans really are, or is it just bad propaganda? Rich, 'cool' brat kids going to Europe, which they consider as their own personal play ground with brain-dead horny European chicks and cheap drugs and alcohol. Come on, USA, is that all we are to you? And from time to time they put in a line like 'That's the way things work in Europe', like a bad attempt to show a bit of understanding of how things work in Europe. Fail! And all European guys over fifty are of course murderous psychopaths. I felt a bit generous, and gave the movie 2/10. The special effects are okay. Too bad everything else failed.And yeah, before I forget ... did I tell you the movie sucked?",2,2,4,22 December 2011
Titanic," Sure I cried ...
","But NOT because the movie is an oh, so tragic story about two young lovers and a boat sinking in the sea. But because of one person - ONE PERSON ONLY - spent about a billion dollars on this movie (while about a billion human beings can't get food for the day, a house to sleep in or clean clothes) and didn't succeed to make a great movie. Three hours is how long this was. That's at least about two and a half hour too much. One thing if it they spent the money on a documentary on the subject, or at least spent the money on better boats, but not on this awful movie. The silly plot, ridiculous jokes, bad actors, an unoriginal subject ... What more can I say? O yeah - it has great special effects! 'But that's at least something!' you might say! NO - IT'S - NOT! It's just another problem. Because special effects are not all, and if they had to spend money on special effects, they could at least have made a greater movie. I hope the producers and the director will spend the rest of eternity in hell, watching this movie. Over and over again.",1,9,19,14 July 2005
Rock Star," I LOVE this movie!!!
","Well, let me put it this way - I have always been one of the 'hardcore brothers'; I've always loved rock music, and especially heavy metal!! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies ever (well, except from Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics, like 'Long live rock and roll' (DIO), 'Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands. Heavenly! Absolutely gorgeous! WONDERFUL!!! I hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movies, like that 'AC in da USA' or what they call it, and '8 miles'. Bulls***!). Well, I strongly recommend this anyway! Everything I'm missing is a couple of Stratovarius-songs! But except from that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!",10,0,2,12 February 2004
