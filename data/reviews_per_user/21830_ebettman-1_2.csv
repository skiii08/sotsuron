",but seriously folks pretty good yarn.But I wonder if the REAL Von Trapp opposed the Nazis? 95% of Austrians were Super Nazis!unless he was just a miserable conservative who hated ANY change!The songs were good if cornyI saw part of it again last weekend. They always play it around Christmas.Julie Andrews sings great. Showed her 'assets' in SOB years later. 'Family Guy' had a great parody on the movie. I missed the musical when I was young b/c I had chickenpox at the time. Mom never forgave me. LOL The Austrian Alps are beautiful. You should see it as a double header with 'Cabaret' to see how madness takes hold of a nation. Sort of like the Tea Baggers,7,2,10,29 December 2010

","What starts out as a portrayal of Teen Mental Illness, turns into a twisted narrative of the Stephen King/Dean Koontz strain. I give them their props for showing a fuller spectrum of Schizophrenia. Movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' are very good, but only show the Delusions and Hallucinations. This movie also shows the disorganized, incoherent thought processes with which they suffer. But, then again, we find out at the end that things aren't really as simple as Donnie being 'Crazy.'
