The Blair Witch Project," A film with the guts to be real
","I have been lucky to get a chance to see a video tape of this, soon to be, cult phenomena.  Is it a documentary or a movie.  Is it real or not? Let's not ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet but suffice it to say it is one of the most interesting experiences I have ever had watching anything.  I still feel chills when I think about what happened out there.",Null,1,2,7 May 1999
