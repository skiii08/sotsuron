Hereditary," Awful movie
","The acting was totally unbelievable, the story was slow, the ending was weird.
Yes, the (dead?) people in the dark corners of a room were somewhat unsettling, and the decapitation of Charlie was surprising, but that doesn't make it a horror movie. Let alone a good horror movie.
Please don't waste your time on this movie.
I hope more people will downvote the movie, so nobody will make the mistake to think it might be actually worth watching if so many people voted and still it has a 7.5 rating. That's pretty high for any genre and most good horror movies don't get rated above a 7, so a 7.5 for a horror movie would be a 9 for a more popular genre.",1,0,3,24 August 2018
