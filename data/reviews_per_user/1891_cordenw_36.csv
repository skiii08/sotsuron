The Monuments Men," It was a workmanlike effort
","Before we go any further, the use of the word 'tasked' to describe something that one has been asked to do, did not come into popular culture until the Harvard types invented it in the '70's. Its use is as bad as 'these athletes are expected to medal'. Phew!, now that I've got that off my chest I feel better. Apart from that minor script lapse,this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't anything that would blow you away and there were really no memorable scenes but I didn't feel the need to storm out like some of the reviewers. I like George Clooney and he seems seems like a nice guy but he ain't no soldier. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchette played pretty good roles. John Goodman and Bill Murray were right on the edge of producing something fabulous but this story didn't allow them room. As for the guy who played Preston, well he is just the best , from the T.V executive on Seinfeld to just about any part I've seen him in since, Balaban has been superb. I kept getting Sam Epstein mixed up with the star of Inside Llewyn Davies so I was dissing him in my mind, but he put in a solid performance. Like so many of the movies these days this was just a good TV show without the ads. TV shows from the cable companies are much better than anything that Hollywood turns out lately. To summarize, I think that Cate is showing what a superb actress she is in every new movie she appears in and she was the bright spot in this effort. I'm very hard to please, so don't stay home because of me, it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. Oh one more thing before I go .. I would love to know how many stars were on the US flag that's above the entrance to the mine. I'm asking because Hawaii and Alaska weren't admitted 'til the late '50s.",Null,3,4,12 February 2014
Gravity," No Atmosphere
","If this is academy award stuff we're in big trouble.It's better left to those Imax guys, at least they don't have to worry themselves about character development. There you are , hurtling through space, seconds away from death, attached by a fragile cord, and you say 'is there a Mister Stone?' give me a brucking fake. Nobody has the right to be called Kowalski in a movie except Clint Eastwood, he's the only one who can carry off a name like that. In my world, which is firmly rooted here on Earth,there wouldn't be a chance of this movie making it out of the production lab. But it seems that in the world of Hollywood nobody in quality control looks at the final product.I know movies are supposed to stretch your credibility but this one stretched you to snapping point. It should have been classified as a still birth, d.o.a. or whatever description they have for life's disappointments.If you still insist on going to see it , amuse yourself by trying to figure out what vast swaths of land and sea the ship is travelling over. There'll be little else of interest to hold your attention.",2,0,3,28 February 2014
Wind River," The second amendment where it's needed
","Out in the wilderness of Wyoming you need a gun to keep you safe from predators, in the city you need a gun to help you rob banks,shoot cops, shoot co-workers and shoot innocent schoolkids. In both environments lots of people end up dead because of the hair trigger mentality of American Culture. The major scene in this movie validates that mentality. Jeremy Renner is a perfect fit for his role as the Fish and Wildlife officer, he has to carry a gun to deal with those predators I mentioned. All of the others carry weapons to deal with the human predators that tend to inhabit remote, cold,snowy places. And so the story of murder and mayhem unfolds in front of a glorious backdrop of white snow and black mountains , a metaphor for the good and the bad in the world. It's not a particularly gripping story but it's fleshed out with depictions of the harsh life of Indian Reserves and the total hopelessness of the reserve system. Violence booze, drugs, the three main food groups for trouble are present in everyone's lives in sparsely populated communities it seems, moreso than the big city. Gil Birmingham is the Indian given the task of trying to absorb, explain and deal with these hardships but in the end it is the fish and wildlife guy who helps him manage the journey.It's a movie that's got me thinking and that's a good way to assess it. The scenery is, of course, glorious and the cast is up to the job but they don't have a knockout punch. Like somebody else mentioned, I had trouble with the sound quality, I first thought it was because of my declining faculties but having someone else mention it has cancelled my appointment with the hearing specialist. You'll watch it, enjoy it and then forget it , it's that kind of movie Cheers BillC",7,0,4,14 September 2017
The Death of Stalin," Consider yourself very lucky
","That you weren't walking the halls of power in Uncle Joe's day.
One wrong look, one mistaken arched eyebrow, one accidental meeting with a lightly suspected enemy of The State and you were toast.Stalin was the figurehead of that particular Ship of State, where a murderous communist bureaucracy just grew out of the ashes of the murderous Tsarist bureaucracy. You can't blame just Stalin himself for it all, it was a runaway train.This, though, is Russia's fate; intrigue, suspicion, doublecross and murder are baked into the DNA of the nation ( All nations have these problems, but the penalty for getting caught in Russia has a nasty finality to it.)And so what would you expect upon the death of leader who ran the country with a flawed ideological rule book, where death or exile was the punishment for any form of disagreement? Refer to the paragraph above and add in a bit of chaos!Well this film shows pretty much what happened and to my mind it's brilliantly portrayed.The members of the politbureau who stood in all their resplendent power on the balcony at Red Square proved, with one or two exceptions, that they were just Stalin's lackeys and hopelessly out of their depth when they actually had to make decisions for themselves. 
Steve Buscemi plays a wonderful part as Khrushchev who is portrayed as one of the stronger members of the schemers after the Boss dies.Simon Russell Beale is superb as Beria, the ultimate hatchet man for the system.Jason Isaacs as General Zhukov has the best part in the whole movie. A tough no-nonsense, do what's got to be done type of individual.I thought that Molotov was unfairly cast as a bit of a bumbler when real history shows that he was a mulish, ruthless messenger who would not give up a blade of grass in negotiations.All the rest of the cast do a fabulous job and I love the way they all have cockney type accents, especially Joe in the opening scenes.Of course there's two routes you can go with making a movie like this, one is to tell the story as the tragedy it was with all of the emotive Russian Music that's available. Or you can satirize it as the absolute travesty that it was. If you take the second option, you can poke fun at the ineptitude and blind obedience. Poke fun at any crazy interpretation of the concept of communism that happened to be in favour on any particular day. 
Interpretations that to most of today's enlightened minds are just ludicrous!I like Iannucci's approach to telling the story, with just the right amount of humour injected to take the real edge off what happened and yet educate us as to the horrible and easily repeatable reality.",10,13,28,5 March 2018
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," It's official, Will Ferrell ain't funny any more
","This movie is a spoof about a band from Iceland trying to win the Eurovision Song Contest. It's a kitschy and camp annual event that is roundly ridiculed by just about everyone in Europe and is never even heard of by the great unwashed in AmericaIt's such a fine line between a funny movie and a dud. 'Blades of Glory' had me rolling in the aisles but this one had me hitting the fast forward button every couple of minutes , trying in vain to get a chuckle. None!Almost as bad as 'The House' but really nothing could get as bad as that one, and the problem lands squarely in the lap of Ferrell.He co-wrote the script (with another ex SNL alumni) and it's heavily borrowed from The House.A very similar plot to 'Blades of Glory' but it missed the mark by a wide margin.Ferrell's penchant for showing us severed limbs and hacked up faces just doesn't come across as funny any more and he seems to want to use these tricks when the plot dips into a deep valley.It's a pretty good premise to spoof the Eurovision Song contest but you've got to have some good satire and parody to pull it off and this just don't cut the mustard. The scriptwriters just ain't talented enough to draw the humour out.I've said it before about other movies and I'll say it again about this one.It's like watching a horse plowing a potato field, you know there's something happening but you're not interested enough to see what's going on.Some of the scenes are so embarrassingly 'unfunny' that they must have given the colorists extra pay to take out the red faces... just cringingly bad.Netflix never listens to me ( or at least they haven't so far) but let me give the executive some advice.
Have someone check on the project during the process, someone to look at the rushes .. because it's obvious that nobody did .
If they had a quality control system then the plug would have been pulled on this bathtub of cold water, or somebody, somewhere would have said 'hit the reset button'I know comedy films are very very hard to get right , it involves a lot of luck , a funny cast and a spoofable subject. This one only has one out of the three and you can guess which one it is.Dan Stevens is pretty good , showing that he can shuffle off the typecasting from Downton Abbey, Rachel Mcadams is sometimes very difficult to look at.
As for Will Ferrell, well his SNL type humour is a thing of the past.This movie comes across as one of those lame sketches on SNL , sketches that have you wondering how they made it on the screen.(and there's lots of 'em)I just can't watch that show any more and I wouldn't be the first in line to re-watch this movie, that's for sure.",1,21,57,28 June 2020
The Irishman," why didn't you use younger actors to portray them in their youth?
","OK , so you'd have to pay them more than it cost you to do the CGI but it would have given some younger actors a break and we wouldn't have had to suffer through the 'avatar' type cartoon scenes.
I don't know how Scorsese was convinced that this was the best route to go because he must have been given samplers at the outset.
The real weakness in this technology is that it only really alters the faces and it is very obvious in parts of the action that there's creaking old bones underneath a young visage.
When DeNiro is beating up a shopowner it looks like an outtake from the old people's home, you half expect him to fall over after the effort. In many other situations it looks like the old age walkers have been edited out .
But if you can get past these shortcomings it's not too bad of a movie. Any time you've got the Mob and the Irish involved in fighting with Unions and Politicians then you've got me interested.It's a great portrayal of the Union thuggery and bullying, contrasted against the Mob's respect for hierarchy. Both of them of course find it easy to get politicians in their pockets and both of them too have no hesitation in getting rid of the ones that go rogue on them.
What is missing is the raw energy of headstrong youth and power that we saw in the Godfather series.
The menace is still there but it somehow seems old hat in these days of billionaires, oligarchs, tax havens and global corruption.Some of those guys in countries like Malaysia, The Ukraine and uncountable African crapholes make more in a day than the entire crime system in the USA makes in a year.
Fun to watch though, you have to break it up into a couple or three viewings as it's a very very long movie.",7,3,7,19 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," buckets of blood
","And we wonder why there are so many mass shootings in America!Tarantino takes the unlimited pursuit of freedom of expression beyond sanity in this brutal gorefest. No matter how many times Mr Obama gets up and says that the killing must stop, it will never end as long as this sort of stuff is produced as entertainment. In a normal, sane world, Tarantino would be identified as a psychopath for having written and produced such murderous mayhem, but America is not such a place. They lionize him and march him triumphantly down Hollywood Boulevard, with as good a chance as anyone of picking up a golden statue at the end of the route. The theatre should have provided vomit bags because there are so many anti-peristaltic scenes that it's inevitable that someone's gonna upchuck before the show is over. The strange thing is that there were NO gasps of revulsion from the audience through the whole length of the screening. Are we inured to such violence as a society? So why do I rate it a ten? Well, it is a perfect and excellent example of what is wrong with a society where guns and violence are glorified. Once you accept the film for what it is and get over the fact that you're actually watching it instead of volunteering at the food bank, you realize that it is tour de force of acting and production. All of the main characters are powerhouses of evil,with the secondary roles the personification of wholesomeness. Tarantino engineers a very clever juxtaposition of these human qualities with the way he structures the story, and the scriptwriting is just superb underneath the bloody and horrific mess. It is amazing that Mr T manages to weave some of the most politically incorrect language and culturally unacceptable behaviour into characters and make them almost endearing to the audience. Kurt Russell, Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Jennifer Jason Leigh give fantastic performances but everyone in the cast is excellent. If I ruled the world, stuff like this would never make the screen but I don't and so I have to understand that the aforementioned freedom of expression trumps everything else. Nutcases believe that guns and violence solve problems and as long as we keep feeding them fodder like this there will be repeat episodes.",10,6,17,15 January 2016
Lost in Translation," I've sorta been through this
","Although not through the romance tension I hasten to add. I have a very happy relationship with my golden treasure of a wife.I've been to China a few times now and they have a social etiquette structure very similar to the Japanese when it comes to dealing with Westerners.Not many of them speak English and those that do always give you a very condensed version of what's been said in the local language. The problem is that they always leave out any social nuances.You never really know what they think of you as a person because they generally see you as a strange other species, or as a novelty. They will talk about you as if you weren't in the same room and have no hesitation in excluding you from conversations with their friends.
Westerners consider that rude but it's been explained to me many times that you don't have to be included if the conversation's not about you... go figure!And so you are... 'lost'.You get no clue from the written language as to where you are, or what kind of establishment you're in, because it's not something you can voice and you have no idea as to how their alphabet works. They carry on talking to you in their own language because they assume that you can understand.It's not all a bad experience, as they are unfailingly polite, generous and hospitable but it can be very frustrating to feel like you're the main act in a circus.In this movie that aspect is displayed very realistically and the karaoke scenes could have been filmed in any of the social gatherings I attended during my visits. If you don't participate they just carry on as if you weren't there and assume that you must be enjoying yourself because everyone else is having a hoot.I really like the way they capture the essence of the style of the American chain hotels in the Orient.
They are chrome, glass and velvet with low light chandeliers. They are executive themed, they always have someone on the piano throwing out muzak and each and every one that I've visited reminded me of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.So the director caught every subtle cultural difference and every nexus.If I had any issue with the film at all, it's that it does leave you feeling unresolved, but I think that's Sofia's point.Murray and Johansson put in excellent performances, they are like air bubbles floating in a champagne glass, which is how I felt most of the time I was in that part of the world.
The story will mean much more to people who have already travelled to countries with completely different symbols for writing and expressing ideas.",7,1,3,13 September 2019
American Sniper," actually it's a pretty good war movie
","I wasn't that keen on Bradley Cooper's acting chops (I got turned off in American Hustle) but he redeemed himself in this movie and was very believable in this role. Elise Robertson put in a good effort but it wasn't one of those transcendent performances like we saw from Ahney Her in Gran Torino or Sandra Oh in Sideways... it was okay but a little shallow in my book.As I said, it was a pretty good war movie and, you know, the good guys won on the battlefield but lost in regular society.The theme of PTSD has been dealt with in a whole bunch of other movies, this one didn't give us any more clues as to how to recognise or deal with it.The simple truth is that you can't put a man straight back into the normal world without some sort of formal training, just as you can't put him into the world of blood and guts without preparation. Nevertheless they continue to do it at both ends of the seesaw.Whenever I watch these types of movies I'm always appalled at the stupidity of men (either soldiers or cops) walking into buildings thinking that a gun in their hands can save them from a guy waiting on the other side of the door with a bucking big fazooka. Not only that, but what are they doing in these crap hole cities where there's nothing but crumbling buildings and garbage strewn across every street, why not wait outside the city gates until they've all polished each other off? They don't seem to care who they kill, as long as it's someone. From the aerial shots they give you, the cities are usually in some sandy wasteland with only a couple of roads in and out. Why not just lay siege and wait for them to surrender. Geez if you did that in Vancouver they'd give up in a couple of hours 'cos they couldn't get their Lattes... but I digress. It's good Clint Eastwood stuff and he hasn't failed to entertain me so far. This is on the far edge of entertainment,pushing into unsettlement, therefore a movie that makes you think .....and movies like that are worth watching. cheers Billc",7,12,28,22 January 2015
American Hustle," boring.. Bradley Cooper terrible
","This movie dragged anchor from the getgo, saved from total disaster by Mr Bale and his co-star Jennifer Lawrence. The believability of Bradley Cooper as an FBI agent was destroyed firstly by his 'too fast' delivery of lines, secondly by his SNL type expressions and finally by a script that took exaggeration beyond comedy. I'm getting to the point where it's a fifty/fifty chance of either being entertained or being bored out of my tree when I go to see movies these days. I fell out of the tree on this one. I hate to say it, but you're better off staying home and watching shows like 'Breaking Bad' or 'House of Cards' on Netflix , these are much more thoughtful and feature infinitely better acting. Not exactly a waste of time to see this movie, but you don't come out feeling better than you went in.",4,8,14,9 January 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," are you kucking fidding me?
","Let's face it , Queen's music was (and is) fantastic and Freddy Mercury's voice was astounding.
Any film about them is bound to be a spellbinding musical experience and just to find a guy with Rami Malek's moves is a wonder of its own.( Although I'm suspicious as to whether it's his voice they use!)Such a pity then that the storyline is a little waxen and the acting very wooden.
Rami does not a bad job of playing Freddy but Lucy Boynton is just terrible and the guy from Downton Abbey isn't too far behind (he should go back to being a chauffeur).It's like the script was written by a 10 year old and the most unwittingly hilarious line is when Freddy says
'I think I'm bisexual'..
No! Say it ain't so...
nobody's noticed until now?Even his dumb girlfriend didn't cotton on? There he is prancing and preening around like he's a founding member of the LBGTQ movement and she didn't notice? Come on, you lazy- assed scriptwriters!
In fact all of the bit parts give the impression of someone being corralled on the street and asked to take on the role.Hence the movie outside of the electrifying songs comes across dull and cheap...... sorta like dress rehearsal before the proper guys come in.The only redemption is the absolutely overwhelming quality of their music coming through unspoiled. You cannot help but gasp at the range of the voice and the talent of the musicians.
For me it was worth the ten bucks just for that, but I wouldn't recommend it very highly to other moviegoersupdate Jan6

Dallas Buyers Club," Not bad, a little thin on interest level but watchable.
","Talking about thin, Matthew did go to the limit with his method acting here. I've seen more meat on a jockey's whip... but that's what he had to do to make an essentially weak film hold your attention. I thought Jennifer Garner was a bit of a cardboard cut out, as were all of the medical staff, but the guys at the bar were pretty convincing. Anytime they show Texas in a movie I'm hooked, so I'm going to watch 'til the end, even if the dust turns to mud as it did in the latter parts of this show. The casting guys in Hollywood have drawn a big blank with Feds lately and this gang are just as hollow as the other big movies. Mind you I did work with a lot of them in my time and a lot of them were ungulates like these characters. Could be they did it on purpose. Is it just me or are the movies replacing cigarettes with cocaine these days and promoting it as a lifestyle? There must be some sort of policy change going on to legalize it (and collect taxes), as the last three movies I've seen have the protagonists snorting it through garden hoses; American Hustle, The Wolf of Wall Street etc. It seems to be an essential part of any plot if you want it to get on the screen. I must live a very sheltered life because none of the people I know do it... mind you I live in an old people's home! So before they bring me my pills I should summarize; Pretty lightweight stuff, we all know that the FDA is a tainted organization but the script could have done a better job with the material at hand. I prefer Matthew in his lawyer or handsome brute roles, this was straying too far from his paydirt. The rest of the cast could have come from one of those CSI shows that I never watch.",5,18,37,18 January 2014
Now You See Me," I'd sooner have watched a couple of episodes of the Kardashians
","Give me a couple of forks to poke out my own eyes. It's really hard for me to see the good name of New York City pulled through the mud like this, with Michael Caine on a rope behind it. I know it's about magic and illusion but give me a break, next time stick to sawing women in half, it's more believable than this stream of effluent. The only thing that kept me from hurling a cup of confetti at the screen were the scenes of the Big Apple, from whence I'd just returned after a wonderful 2 month stay. If I'd have known that they were making a movie this bad while I was there, a movie which has now tainted my memories, I would have tried to find the set and get the police to close it down. Acting; terrible. Romance angle; filmed in a refrigerator. Plot; a piece of hanging macramé, more holes than string. Foisting this on the public should be classified as a crime against humanity",1,13,23,8 September 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Great entertainment
","At last! A movie that has some quality . After all of the crap I've been tricked into watching lately I was a bit wary going in, but it turned out that I was being too pessimistic. Everybody in the cast gave us our money's worth and the storyline moved along at a perfect pace. Great scriptwriting with intelligent jokes that kept you on your listening toes throughout the film. Fiennes was fantastic and Dafoe wasn't too far behind (even though he didn't say much) Cameo appearances by just about everybody only added to the enjoyment but it did have me asking the question 'How do these guys find the time, with all of the other projects they have on the go?' Anybody with a half decent sense of humour and a quick wit will find that the time flies by as you chuckle in your seat. Go see it and come out feeling like you've just seen one of the better shows around. Enjoy BillC",8,2,11,19 March 2014
Legend," Well, they had me fooled!
","I never realized that Hardy was playing the both of them!
Good London Gangland style material, the British version of the Mafia is much more vicious, and this movie portrays it in all of its torturous, maiming methods. The Mafia usually 'off' their victims, but for some reason the brutes back home seem to prefer scarring and maiming . In their minds it's probably a better method to have a living reminder to potential enemies of what can happen to you if you don't toe the line ( and cutting off a toe is a common device)I'm sure glad I never came into contact with them, 'cos I've got a big mouth and I tend to stand up to people . If you stood up to these boys then you ended up seriously injured or dead.
That reign of terror is over now only to be replaced by some other kingpins who have much the same way of doing things as their predecessors. One good thing that I take out of the Gangland Life is that if you don't mess with them then they don't bother you.And so to the movie, it's realistic and reflects the culture of the times very well.
The Krays liked to show off their power with fancy cars and night clubs but strangely enough they didn't seem to go for the flash palaces, swimming pools and the overt displays of wealth that happens in America.They were happy with those night clubs and booze and they didn't seem to need much more. Their motivation was spreading fear and protecting home turf from nasty invaders
You don't have to look far when you're casting for Cockney type movies and they always seem to get a crew that you think they've dragged in off the street.Just super characterizations in every role. No pretty boys wiv' perfick teeth, just the usual battered, broken nosed ugly thugs on the men's side, and normal Mum's and girls on the female side.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Let me tell you why
","I'll tell you why this movie didn't even come close to being 'Best Picture' at the Oscars.It wasn't very good, that's why.Although the acting by Leo was just great and Brad Pitt was his usual brutally handsome presence, that wasn't enough to carry the project to its 'long time a- comin'' finale.Most of the Tarantino movies I have seen, even though they are gruesome blood fests, have good plot development , good tension and good soundtracks but this one had none of the above.The music was too loud and Tarantino relied on it too much to set the 70's scenes rather than trying to pull more out of the characters .Those characters, other than Leo and Brad, were just empty vessels and the whole set up echoed with the sound of one hand clapping.As for tension, well, because he was keeping the twist of the ending a secret (and a very well kept secret at that) he wasn't able to build anything in unfolding the story.
A few good fight episodes eased the tedium but overall it was a travelogue type movie, which is very unusual for QT.The bottom line is that there was something less than gripping with this project, showing that you only have to be slightly off your best to turn out a mediocre product...... and this is definitely not his best.For all that negative stuff, it's still a movie that holds your attention and entertains, so I would recommend watching it ... just temper your expectations.",4,0,4,10 March 2020
Million Dollar Baby," I don't like to watch women fighting
","I just watched it 'cos it was one of the DVDs in a place we were staying at. If it won an Oscar it should be OK was my thinking. Well , that's all it was... OK , much ado about nothing I would say.The characters were fairly predictable and we've seen the plot a million times, the producers just thought that they could wring some more bucks out of a story because it was a woman in what is traditionally a Man's role.I can't say I get any pleasure from seeing a girl bashed to a pulp, although, strangely, it causes me no problems when the same thing happens to a guy ... but that's just me I guess.In the end I managed to look past that issue and what I saw was an ordinary movie with a bit of good acting but nothing that delivered a KO punch. If it's raining outside or if you've done all you have to do in the day, then this movie will pass those final hours before bedtime much more pleasantly than watching the usual menu of crap on the TV.",5,1,2,4 June 2015
Hotel Mumbai," How fragile is a carefree life
","There you are, enjoying the success of your pathway through life and suddenly it turns into the horror of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.This is just a brutal picture portraying the absolute mercilessness of fanaticism.Let's face it, you can't plead for your life or argue your case for being allowed to live when you're dealing with maniacs like this, only luck and a little bit of self preservation instinct will get you out alive.The acting is just about as good as it can get for this sort of bloodbath movie, you're actually locked in a room with them and it's a very harrowing experience.I don't know how true it is to the actual events but if it's anywhere close then I don't want to travel anywhere near these countries where a terrorist attack could happen at any time. I guess that rules out just about everywhere in the world these days.It's a movie that had to be made and one that should be watched if only to get a glimmer of understanding as to what terrorists are capable of.You can't really blame anyone but the terrorists themselves and there's no doubt in my mind that they should be summarily executed if taken alive, just like you would a mad dog.Very well put together with high tension from the getgo. Worth watching for trying to get insight as to what all of this butchery is about...... which is usually nothing more than the pursuit of power.",8,3,30,27 March 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," One of the best
","I watched this back in '84 and decided to watch it again last night.It's still just as funny because it's a parody of human nature and you don't need special effects or iphones to make it work in today's culture. The biting satire and the 'hauteur' quality that Rob Reiner gives to the Spinal Tap mockumentary is right on the money. What, with this and The Rutles, you've got the entire music industry of the time speared like a fish.( it's probably still the same!) I love the way they were changed from flower people to heavy metal and I love how inept the Manager is... pure genius. Could they ever do one like this for Britney Spears or Kanye West or are we just seeing that played out in real life? I wish there were movies of this quality out today instead of trash like Anchorman2 or The Big Wedding but I guess most of the talented writers and directors have moved on to Cable TV. Spinal Tap and The Rutles .. now there's a two pack for a night in front of the TV. Enjoy",10,1,3,6 March 2014
The King," Another failure
","With a Netflix production you have only a fifty fifty chance of getting anything decent and even those odds are diminishing with the newer projects.
First of all....... no one , not one single person, was 'tasked' with doing a job back in the late 1300s . They were ordered, or told, or commissioned to do the job but never tasked. That's because task is a noun, you buffoons! What are they teaching in film school these days?As a movie covering an epic tale, this one is about as thin as a sheet of graphene, more like the 'Holy Grail' made serious.A few have commented that there is no character development (or very little at the most) and I have to agree.
They must hire their producers from Hallmark cards because it has all the feel of 'The Gift of the Magi' but maybe I'm just too demanding.On the good side it does have great costuming and evil looking and scheming courtiers. If some of the supporting cast had been brought in a bit more it could have been much better production.
I'm beginning to think that I myself could come up with much better stuff than most of the latest from netflix, but they won't let me out of the old people's home for fear I'll get lost.

","The lifestyles that we used to be so jealous of when we were in our youth, have proved on so many occasions to be unhappy , shallow and tortured.It seems that the gift of so called 'genius' requires that some other aspect of your existence is taken away... like the ability to live a sane and orderly life.Once you become rich and famous your chance of meeting anybody 'normal' is similarly taken away from you and you become surrounded by charlatans and opportunists.From that point on, you no longer control your own schedule and it's no wonder that so many pop stars, business execs and artists, develop mental illnesses and can no longer cope with the world.'Genius' is a very narrow talent and doesn't often spill over into dealing with day to day affairs.So it was (and probably still is) with Brian Wilson, truly gifted but equally messed up in the head. He turned out some fabulous songs, my favourite being 'Good Vibrations' but he turned out just as much garbage.It's only once you've had a few hit songs that you are allowed the indulgence of top quality professional musicians in your recording sessions and these musicians are the ones who were able to put his ideas into sounds.This is the unbroken thread in all success stories, a gifted but troubled individual who gets a break by way of synchronicity.All the right people come together at just the right time.... and then the aforementioned crepuscular charlatans and opportunists move in and wreck the train.A good movie for one with a pop star as the subject, John Cusack is really good as the older Brian, Paul Dano not as good as Brian the younger (but still OK) and of course Giamatti, as the rogue opportunist, is just superb.There's something missing with Elizabeth Banks' performance but it could be that it's hard to sympathise with a character that goes headlong into a relationship knowing that the partner is not much more than a zombie.",6,0,1,17 May 2019
Sicario," What's it all about?
","Emily Blunt is kept in the dark... so are we. Very very weak reasons for her entanglement in this drug cartel movie. 6 American SUV's barrelling down the Juarez highway in a super- coordinated prisoner pickup, and then that convoy being held up by a vehicle broken down in the border line up is a bit hard to believe. But .. it's great scenery and it does have Josh Brolin in it so it must be good,right?Well let's put it this way, he's good because he slots into these type of roles easily and pulls it off. The movie is well shot and is a typical portrayal of the American perception of the best way to deal with those nasty purveyors of pollution. Shoot'em dead with no mercy is their answer and so they happily employ goons and psychos to slaughter people in the mistaken belief that the more you get rid of, the less there are to deal with.It's like stamping on ants at the entrance to their nest! In my innocent mind and in my little world, in my little circle of friends, I don't know any drug takers or dealers and the problem I have with the theme of this movie is the level of society's resources committed to stamp out the use of narcotics by maybe 3% of the population. Blowing the suppliers to smithereens doesn't make one iota of difference to the production line, it makes for good movie scenes, it makes for rough justice but it doesn't solve any problems at all. Even with these prejudices I got absorbed by Del Toro's ruthless character, I wasn't that impressed by Emily Blunt and it seemed to me that she spent most of the movie with her mouth open, gobsmacked by the stuff unfolding in front of her, not much in the way of building any empathy. I still can't get over the way these goons and thugs (the good guys I might add) wander into buildings , flit round a corner and think they're safe with a gun in their hand, I suppose it's necessary theatre but it's really stupid . To sum up , I was disappointed with a lazy script and a sub par performance from the cast, the scenery constantly outshines the rest of the project.",5,4,7,18 September 2017
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant
","It's gory , the plot is chopped up like a lot of the bodies, but it's a masterpiece of acting and storytelling.
Travolta, Jackson and Roth are so believable in their roles that you wouldn't want to run into them in the real world.
Tarantino, with his penchant for bloody scenes, has us walking through puddles of it throughout the movie but somehow it just consolidates the nature of these thugs and killers. They shoot someone and then go for a burger, don't give it a second thought!
Keitel is also brilliant in his portrayal of the 'fixer' and makes it look like cleaning up a horrible mess is no more difficult than buying groceries. Tarantino himself has a great part and he too is just spot on.
It's difficult to praise a plot where most of the cast goes out shot in the face or blasted with a machine gun volley but if that's what the story must be, then this one's well done.
The sub plot with Rhames and Bruce Willis just makes the entire production that much better.
Once again I have to say that if there's really people like that in everyday life, then I don't want to leave the house any more!",9,0,1,9 September 2019
The Departed," Here I go again
","Can you say 'piss poor' in a review?
Here we have an infiltrator into a gang organisation on one side and the plant in the police department on the other.
Not a bad premise, but so ineptly put together that neither side could discover the villain without the help of audience.
Phony Boston accents, ham acting, very poor plot line and too much reliance on expletives. I usually like swearing in a movie but in this one it was just used to cover script deficiencies.
To say that it is a mediocre film is being too free with compliments.Put up a few big names and you've got a hit right?Wrong.This was a bummer right from the getgo ; Nicholson mailed in his performance, Winstone completely miscast, DeCaprio OK and what'sisface Damon only marginally better.
The trouble with Mr Wahlberg is that you can't tell whether or not it's actually him, a cardboard cutout or a CGI. It doesn't really matter because none of the three do anything to improve the project.
Sheen was pathetic and his Boston accent was like a cinder caught under a door.(the other attempts at Boston accents weren't much better, only Matt Damon's was real .. and even though he grew up there it was exaggerated to match the other speech-coached 'Siri' effect)As for the plot, gimme a freakin' break will ya. If either side couldn't find the rat in the first five minutes, then neither the police nor the gangsters deserved to hold down their jobs.A waste of time and money, you could make a better movie with your iphoneAt least it's a new genre... crime mush",2,3,12,15 August 2019
12 Years a Slave," Pretty good but mediocre directorship in some scenes
","Better than most of the movies I've seen lately and the acting was superb from just about everyone. When big names like Brad Pitt and Paul Giamatti give you some of their best stuff, even though they're in minor parts, you know you're watching something good. It's hard to get your head around the fact that this is pretty recent history and it's still an open sore in America. The acceptance by the majority of white society at the time, of the concept of ownership of a human being , is something that still mystifies me. Mind you if you watch a few episodes of Downton Abbey and see how the staff were treated even up to the 1940s you will get a good idea where it came from. Can you believe that a Naval Architect from Liverpool was given an award for a design that allowed for more slaves to be jammed in at the prow of a slave ship? But I digress. This is raw and emotional stuff and it hits you right in the solar plexus. With that in mind, you don't really need to linger with shots of extreme anguish such as the scene with the rope, or the close up of Solomon Northup's despairing face. It's only a minor flaw but you would think that somebody would have whispered in the director's ear that these key scenes could have been shortened for more effect.To say you enjoyed a movie like this doesn't seem right but there's redemption in the thought that those days are behind us in North America (only to be replaced by wage slavery in many cases.) It's important to remember too that real slavery still exists in many other countries and we shouldn't get too smug when we point out the shortcomings of other nations... we've still got a big bill to pay!",7,1,3,8 March 2014
Whiplash," Like my old gym school teacher
","The bullying nature of the bandmaster had me reliving those horrible days at school where a gym teacher had much the same approach to bringing out the best in his charges. Fifty five years on and I have grudging respect for the tactics of achievement by fear, but I still recall him as a rectal aperture who could have used more tender methods. J.K. Simmons plays the 'rear exit' role to perfection, totally uncompromising in his almost unattainable standards (and a person who would be doing jail time under today's parameters). It's a real debate as to whether a genius needs to be pushed or whether their natural talents will emerge from some internal drive. My old gym teacher certainly brought out some qualities in me that would still be latent if it hadn't been for the fear and humiliation factor. Miles Teller plays a wonderful part as a driven/obsessed youth, it seems that all of the great musicians excluded everything else from their lives until they became masters. After that most of them make up for lost time by piling headlong into booze drugs and women.. but that wasn't part of this story. I enjoyed the pace and tension of the movie , all of the parts were well cast and the dinner table scene was a wonderful display of the contrast between hero worship of Football Jocks and the dismissal of musical talent. But that's America , at least until the musician gets famous. I would have given the movie a 10 if it wasn't for the actual music itself ; Jazz to me is like a cinder caught under a door, I'm sure they're all magic musicians but I'd sooner hear three cats howling on the back fence at night than spend any time listening to this tuneless crap. Go ahead and hang me if you can find me, it should be easy, I'll be at any country/rock concert. Enjoy the movie in Cmajor7b5 cheers Billc",7,2,4,18 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Good movie.... but too long
","Decaprio is at his ruthless best in this realistic Wall Street con story. You would think that this horse has been flogged to death over the past few years but every time they find another villain we are powerless to ignore the well worn plot. You would also think that the great unwashed would have cottoned on to the brokerage scam that is the engine of the industry but it's not so. There's still a sucker waiting to step over the body of the previous victim and hand over their money to a good conman.Suckers don't have to be working class either , they come from all levels of society and every one of them has the same motivation... they all want something for nothing. This movie homes right in on this motivation and portrays the sleazebags who take advantage of it perfectly (although it leaves the blue chip guys unscathed) I was disappointed in the acting of Jonah Hill and felt they overdid it with the coke,the ludes and the chicks, simply because a business wouldn't last that long with so many screw ups running things. I've worked with many of these types of characters so I can speak with a little bit of authority. At about two hours you start to fidget in your seat and wish they'd cut to the chase, but they string it out for another hour with meaningless fill, fill which dilutes some good performances. It's always fun to watch such displays of excess end up with razor wire in the final scenes. The Trump Tower in the background of one of the scenes confirms that there's many more plot lines to be mined.",5,3,8,2 January 2014
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," surface tension
","When you're dealing with a story about the German occupation of the Channel Islands it's almost a sin to gloss over the effects the way this film does.By way of disclosure I used to live in the Channel Island of Jersey many years ago and I saw bits and pieces of the legacy of the Occupation. There were underground hospitals, even an aborted railway system.... all built by slave labour .Simply having a few troops walk through the centre of town leaves a dearth of stories to be told.
How did they implement their takeover? How did they let the administration run the island? How did they treat the islanders?All of these plotline motherlodes were sacrificed for the love story
(which was quite well done, although telegraphed from the start).On reflection, the morning after viewing it, I would say that it's a typical U.K. picture, well acted with the usual overdoing it with kids and twanging of the heartstrings........ but not really my cup of tea.It still gets my back up after all these years, to see the way the class system was entrenched (and by all accounts it still is!)I would have preferred a bit more exploration of the Island culture itself and a bit more depth in the way they dealt with the occupation but.... Hey! I wasn't on the crew!But if I look at it as a work of entertainment then it's done its job , there's a lot of acting talent on display and boy those guys are convincing in their snooty roles.",7,0,1,17 October 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Welcome Back- a brilliant effort!
","I was knocked off kilter by the last Coen Bros movie I saw, which was 'Inside Llewyn Davis' . I panned it , even though the hipsters and the intelligentsia seemed to love it. Then I thought to myself 'It's probably because you're not as smart as those guys, you shouldn't get above your station in life'.Now the hipsters and the pundits are lukewarm about this one and I think it's just a cracker of a show.Because of this I've realized that I AM smarter than most of the other reviewers.Llewyn Davis was an aimless movie about an aimless character and if there were any subtleties in the plot they were buried so deeply that you had to be the writer to get them.This one, though, was a full blown satirical masterpiece, capturing perfectly the manipulative nature of the studios and the media of the day.Cheating, lies, and the aforementioned manipulation, have always been the order of the day in entertainment and politics. This film sends those traits up to perfection, managing at the same time to make hilarious fun of the political altruists of the time.(To think that some of us believed in that stuff back then).Brolin was fantastic in his role, the best performance I've seen him in since 'No country for Old Men'. Clooney too was brilliant and just as captivating as he was in 'Oh Brother'. Alden Ehrenreich is just too good to describe as he plays so brilliantly off Ralph Fiennes. Scarlett Johansson is also fabulous, milking the Hollywood star role for all it's worth. I could single everyone out but suffice to say that there isn't a bad performance.Tie together all of this stellar acting with a brilliant script and perfect cinematography and you have one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I must mention the music before I go, it is used very sparingly in this story but when it is used it fits so well that you appreciate the genius of the Director. Not to spoil anything, but there is a musical type song and dance scene that matches ANY scene from Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly, you will be enthralled by it! If you're as smart as I am (as I said already) you'll laugh and chuckle your way through the best couple of hours of entertainment you could wish for.",10,2,5,9 March 2016
Parasite," you'll enjoy this
","Surprise surprise, they have poor people in South Korea too!Every news story from South Korea carried by our Western Media shows glittering highrises , gleaming, if crowded, cities and fabulous transportation systems.Everyone is slim and good looking, everyone has a great job in the electronics industry and it's capitalism at its best, or so they would have us believe.Underneath this glamour is the same societal structure as there is in the West.... fabulously rich people and the wretched poor.The story, and we've seen it many times before, is that the wretched poor want to even things up by stealing from, or conning, the rich. It's just human nature at work.If only the socialists studied that same human nature, instead of being angry at the rich, they would be able to come up with workable solutions to the injustice, but I digress, let's move back to the job at hand.With the backdrop of South Korea as our tableau we get into a pretty good plot with the underclass pulling a scam on a rich but naive family.The scammer protagonists, Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, are living in squalor in a slum, with no real hope of getting out, when they have a stroke of luck by scoring an introduction to a wealthy family.They use their devious talents to infiltrate the family and before you know it they have all been hired by them to look after their domestic needs, with well paid, luxury jobs.From there on in we have the wonderful juxtaposition of the wealthy family living a Kardashian type lifestyle (only much more refined) against the 'we've hit the jackpot' mentality of the slum dwellers.Of course there's no 'off' switch for scammers and the beauty of this film is the way they manage the story as it spirals out of control.......... it is really well done.The acting is superb and the mise en scène is just fabulous. The pacing is right on the button and it's no wonder the film attracted so much attention.Even with the subtitles it is a very absorbing movie and although I wouldn't put it in the 'classic' category (as I would with 'A Separation') it's one I could easily watch again and enjoy it just as much.I have no doubt that it must have been the best picture from the choices that the Academy had.It's head and shoulders above 'The Irishman' and head and shoulders above any other Hollywood movie I watched this past year.Well worth watching!",8,4,6,8 March 2020
The Big Short," zzzzzzzzzzz
","Well, If I were you I'd sell Sominex shares short, this production is a much better way of putting people to sleep than any known medication. How can you take an event like the crash of 2008 and make it look like a day at the offices of Dunder Mifflin?Steve Carell, one the mysteries of the universe, like cold fusion, like atomic entanglement,like the make up of quarks... nobody can understand these phenomena, just like nobody can explain the success of Mr Carell. I'm sure he's a very nice guy, but he happens to be a cosmic coincidence where someone gets paid for just being who they are. They could have just cut and pasted a couple of scenes from that very same 'Office' series mentioned above, and nobody would have noticed the difference.As for the plot of the movie itself there's nothing new here, even though the real event was earthshaking, the bad guys lose and the bad guys win. There is a half hearted attempt to portray one side sympathetically but in this sleazy business they're all greedy and they're all big time gamblers so there's no redemption when one of them cashes in.In the end the man in the street has to pay for it all.They use the 'House of Cards' trick where the actors speak directly to the camera but there's an emptiness to it that makes you beg for Kevin Spacey to be talking. I think that emptiness is conveyed because the actors themselves (and maybe even the Director) don't have any understanding of how the finance business works and particularly didn't have any idea as to how the collapse came about.To be honest, there was more tension and emotion in the PBS documentary on the crash of 2008 than this film. You know that feeling you get when you have a flat tire and you're stuck at the side of the freeway? Well that's how I felt when I got out of the cinema.I should say though that Marisa Tomei has matured just beautifully and I could overlook the bad parts of this clunker just for the pleasure of seeing her on the big screen.Sorry but me no like",3,13,33,6 January 2016
Blow," Piece o' crap
","What's the opposite of a star?
there should be an option to use some other icon to rate films because it besmirches the star icon for other good movies.
I know that this was done back in 2001, which seems like a technological ice age away, but even measured by the standards of the day it was the equivalent of one of Elvis's movies from the 60's.As for the framework, well they took the commentary premise from Goodfellas to keep things moving along but while it worked really well in that movie, it stunk in this one.Liotta must have needed the money and Rachel Griffiths was flatter than a plate of pancakes at IHOP.Depp was Depp, even back in 2001, why pay him for an appearance in a movie when you could have bought snips of previous films he'd made and splice them in?
With a bit of digital sleight-of-hand you wouldn't have noticed the difference and it would only have cost a couple of bucks.No character development, no detail, just a spool unrolling.Don't waste your time",1,1,7,7 September 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," It's certainly no classic
","It's not a piece of schlock either but it's a fair to middling story about culture clash and more importantly about the magical abilities of Walt Disney. Let's face it, writers are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.... just visit your local library if you need confirmation. Disney knew that, but he also knew that once in a while one of them comes along with a special talent or idea that only exists in that particular person. You could try to plagiarize it but the end product would be missing the spark. The story is not really about the making of Mary Poppins, it is a story about the exceptional interpersonal skills, patience and persistence of Walt Disney. This film shows that the man didn't build one of the most celebrated companies in the world because he was lucky or because he was a ruthless businessman, he got there because he also had a gift of looking inside people and finding out what made them happy.And so we see how he used these qualities to handle even the most difficult individual and get what he wanted too.Tom Hanks is really very good as Walt himself, Emma is pretty good in her role even though she doesn't have to step too much out of what we see in her real life persona (To be fair I'm sure she's a wonderful person outside of the glitz). Paul G is excellent as the driver, but then again he is excellent in any part he plays.The nebulous scenes from Australia were a little too shallow for my liking, although I did enjoy the part where they move to the new town. I enjoyed it for totally selfish reasons,as my own parents emigrated to Australia with me as a babe-in-arms in 1948, so it was nice to see a reconstructed scene similar to what they would have seen back then.(No wonder we turned right around and went back to England!) The characters in these flashbacks didn't add a lot to the plot and really could have been played by anybody.All in all it's a movie that you would have rented from the video store (if they still existed) when the one you really wanted had been snapped up.",5,4,9,13 January 2014
Unbroken," When you get the job just because you're famous
","I'm getting desperate!
The last four or five movies I've seen on Netflix have been very thin gruel and this one doesn't thicken it up at all.The Terracotta Warriors could have done a better job than the entire cast, who admittedly have to handle a story that's been done a million times, 999,999 of which were better than this one.Jolie obviously doesn't have a clue when it comes to directing and this movie has all the hallmarks of the boss being surrounded by yes men who are scared to call out lousy work.OK , so the hero is an Olympian and knows how to suffer.. so do riders in the Tour-de- France, so did Arctic explorers (although they're volunteers)
His story is no different than all of the other POW's who had to endure those sadistic Japanese camps so why him?This stinks of somebody waking up in the morning and saying to themselves ' I want to make a movie.. doesn't matter what it's about, I just want to do it'There's absolutely no plot or message, so it wanders aimlessly to an ending that looks like a New Year's review on the TVI don't want to denigrate the terrible experiences that prisoners of the Japanese went through but this isn't the vehicle to show what incredible hardships these men suffered.",2,2,3,10 May 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," Are you kucking fidding me?
","Fresh from re-seeing Fargo the other night and atingle with anticipation I heads out into the boonies to watch the movie on half price Tuesdays. What can go wrong, it's a Coen Bros movie ?Lots can go wrong, even at half price this was a complete failure.I am a great admirer of Coen Bros films but this one has gaping holes in many categories.It moves along almost as aimlessly as the main character, with the weakest of scripts taking it to a collapse at the finish line. In fact there is no finish line, just an empty street where all the spectators have gone home. What mucking fovie are the people watching who have given it such a stellar rating? Maybe I'm out of synch with the times because the other movies I've been to see lately have been built up with great reviews, only to disappoint at viewing time, The Wolf of Wall Street and American Hustle to name but two of them. Bad as those movies were at least they had some memorable moments........ this film had none. It's a dud and whoever thinks it's a contender for an Oscar should be thinking about signing up for that one way trip to Mars and start their own society there, they're out of touch in this one.",3,10,16,14 January 2014
Law Abiding Citizen," OK so it's 10 years old now
","Hmm...Let me see.An electronics and weapons expert who wants vengeance against the principals in a trial of a guy who murdered his family.
Not a bad plotline in the great scheme of ideas, but in true Hollywood fashion it is taken to ridiculous extremes and in the end falls flat on its face.The entire U.S. military couldn't come up with the logistics that this guy seems to manage before breakfast, but that doesn't stop the screenplay from attempting to get us to believe this crap.We're also expected to believe that the D.A. (Jamie Foxx) has almost all of the Philadelphia police department at his immediate disposal; helicopters, swat teams and legal eagles, all there to do what he says, when he says it.What a crock.Then we have the mandatory scenes with Foxx's adorable daughter playing the effing cello for goodness sake, while the audience watches rapt with pleasure. It's like a scene stolen from Airplane!Like I said, it's 10 years old now, but stupid is stupid no matter what the age. I don't know how they got the money together for this but I'd sure like to meet the guy who doles it out.
