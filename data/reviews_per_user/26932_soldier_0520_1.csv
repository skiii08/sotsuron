United 93," no big stars=great movie
","as a soldier in the united states army having been deployed for a year in Iraqi i almost forgot what i was over there for. watching this movie helped me realize that heroes do not only exist in the movies and the military, they exist in those that display it in time of need. i do not not hate the people in which we are at war with i do however share a small feeling of pity towards those who attempt to destroy the country in which i live. this movie went in the direction of few great movies. there were no big names like nick cage or Ben affleck. and that is why i gave this movie a 9 out of 10. i think that many people are going to be surprised at how Hollywood is handling this subject.",9,3,6,30 April 2006
