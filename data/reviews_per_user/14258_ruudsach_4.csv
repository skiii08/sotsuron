The Expendables 2," Nostalgia Comedy go hand-in-hand ?
","This movie sucks.I went to watch it after seeing the high ratings here on IMDb.Looks like this movie is for celebration of 80's actions stars. Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, John Claude van Damme, Dolph Lundgren & Arnold Schwarzenegger. Why was Mickey Rourke left out?....Anyway, my point is the IMDb score does not reflect the movie.Oh, wait a minute before you stop reading this complete review and spit mouthful for me, there was a story and a potential to implement it in a classy way. I mean to say the script was sucky. In middle of the action I felt like not watching it anymore. The script was that sucky.Enough about the script, the movie had one thing different; whenever we see some movie that brings feeling of nostalgia within, it generally is heart-warming. In this movie they experimented with that feeling too by mixing, should I say intertwining, Nostalgia with Comedy.",1,12,22,25 August 2012
Quantum of Solace," Bond series sinking with economy....
","6 Reasons why NOT to watch this movie: 1. Length is approx 100mins but to explain such in depth political movie one has to go slow (Bad mistake Craig for recommending your director for this movie.) 2. Who is the cinematographer, man? Action was extraordinary, its just that you cannot see it. (What do I mean by that? Action was so close that one could hardly understand. Anyone who watched Casino Royale and Die Hard 4.0 would tell its mindless action in this movie, really. The one thing people would if ever want to buy to see the action will be severely disappointed.) 3. Why would our Villain be interested in water than oil? Really why? Does acquiring water sources fetch more money than oil? (That really did it for me. Its OK if action is one-on-one, I can tolerate that but no sensibility?)And yeah, even if you acquire water sources to terrorize people (resource terrorism), why would our villain terrorize already exploited country (In our case Bolivia, which was in shortage of water).I know that makes no sense at all. Although, how Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) was compromised and how our big secret villain network works (Quantum) was the only sensible part.4. No Comedy. Zero Comedy. i.e. no entertainment with any kind of punches.5. Its more like a sequel to Casino Royale, than being an individual case for Bond. There is nothing wrong with that only that it will take more than 5 movies for our current Bond to end this 'Quantum cartel', which will take more than 10 years. Are you ready to wait that long???6. Comedy 0, Gadgets 0, Punches 0, alright. But no Bond sex, no Bond hitting on girls, no sexual romance (unique in Bond movies). What the hell? I guess it was done to please (huge) Asian audience. But as of now they lost a real Bond movie fan in me (and many thousands more I assume).",4,3,5,8 November 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," I'm NINE year old - This is the Greatest Hyped ever Movie
","Action is not there.The action you see in the trailer is what is there in the whole movie.I must say though I loved the Bike.I remember as a young kid myself, I used to watch Giant Robot series and how easily Giant Robot used to kill/beat his enemies, even though the hype surrounding his enemies were that they were 100 or maybe 1000 times stronger than Giant Robot. I confess I used to love it.This movie made me feel nostalgic about Giant Robot (full marks goes to Kevin Nolan), even Michael Bay shows amazing actions scenes in his movies though their scripts would be entirely stupid and hardly believable.Look at what this movie did to me, I am somewhat praising Michael Bay.This is a stinker of a movie. No doubt this movie will break all box- Office record just like POTC - 3 & 4, Transformers - 1,2,3 etc... you get the idea.I liked The Dark Knight, it was intelligent movie; but this is different - This is child intelligent movie.One parting question though, What happened to Bane in the end, or should just start guessing and find the intelligent quotient in this movie...",6,2,16,26 July 2012
Gangs of New York," Great Movie!!!
","This is the first movie of M.S. I saw. And of course I became instant one in his long list of fans, really. And after that I saw 3 of his other movies namely 'Aviator', 'Cape Fear' and lately 'The Departed'.After seeing those movies I can infer that Martin Scorcese is the best director I have ever known. You may not see much or should I say no comedy in his movies but still you will enjoy it. I am amazed by this man's vision and the intensity most of his movies depicts.Gangs of New York is a movie with a backdrop of 1860s and the problems of that era. Immigration issues, various gangs operating for and against various race. As an unknown I knew nothing about American history but now many things are known without reading books, thanks to M.S.Leo & Cameron were very good but I was really impressed of the character Bill Cutting 'The Butcher' (performed by Daniel-Day Lewis), just like most of us were impressed of the character 'Captain Jack Sparrow' i.e. Johnny Depp. I bet you will be impressed too. Daniel-Day Lewis was not just amazing but extra-ordinary.It also shows how New York City was born leaving that era of violence behind. Of course thats the ending. That part is very touching.Only complain I have about this movie is amount of sexual content shown which I think is unnecessary. Thats why I gave 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,4 November 2006
