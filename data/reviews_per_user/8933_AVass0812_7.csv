Ali," Fell asleep, not once, not twice, but three times
","What could've been a very interesting story and possibly a great movie with some very good acting, turned out to be a movie that was had to stay awake through. Ali's movie has the pace of a snail. I was totally bored within the first 30 minutes of the film. I fell asleep 3 times while watching this snore fest. I think the film editor and director have done a little too much boxing themselves and have begun to 'slow down' in their mental skills. I cannot see why everyone thought that Will Smith should've won an Academy Award for this. He played Ali as a flat 2D character, should've thrown in Billy Dee Williams, at least he would have played him with more flare. Smith had more intensity in playing Jim West in Wild Wild West than he did in this film, and that character and movie really sucked. And Jon Voight...come on, as Howard Cosell? I know that Hollywood likes to get on these 'kiss their butt' type of deals, but Voight's acting at Cosell was not the best. Jon Tuturo playing the great ABC sportscaster had more depth than Voight's pathetic attempt. Between Smith and Voight, I think you had both ends of a book shelf. Hopefully they'll come out with a Director's Edition of this film, or better yet...a 'Here's a better version' edition of it. If you haven't seen it yet....DON'T...save yourself the rental. And you have, you should be demanding your money back for it. I'm so sorry they decided to wreck another 20th century icon of sports with a poor movie based on his life. And Smith is not the end all, be all of actors out there. Ok bud, you used to be the Fresh Prince, now we should call you the Fresh Snore.",4,0,1,7 June 2002
Spider-Man 2," Excellent Sequel - A definite must see for the summer
","I just returned from seeing Spider Man 2. This is an excellent adaptation of the classic comic book series. The sequel builds off the success and introduces the new villain of 'Doc Ock'. Each of the characters in the movie have grown and become more 3 dimensional in the second movie. Peter's struggle to come to terms with what he is has been well handled by Toby Maguire. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco both put in great performances. Dunst character has evolved to be more of an adult, while Franco's obsession with finding out who Spider Man, builds to a climatic end that I will not spoil for the readers of these comments. Spiderman had a balance of comedy, action and seriousness that made the 2 hours, plus of a movie go by well. I totally recommend anyone to see this film. Please note that this movie does have an elevated amount of violence that may scare younger children. Fans of the comicbook will be happily pleased with the overall results and Director Raimi's vision of staying true to the characters. Doctor Octopus is wonderfully played and the special effects are better this time around than in the first. One small 'spoiler', look for the cameos in the film.Please go and see this film. You will not be disappointed at all.",10,0,0,30 June 2004
No Country for Old Men," Should've been called 'No Country for showing this film'
","This film could have been a very very good film. The characters were good. I'm not a fan of Brolin, but he did a great job in this. As did the main villain of the film. Heck for the 10 minutes of the film that Woody Harrelson was in, he was a good character. It's starts off very interesting and has a good main character driving the story with the antagonist character closely pursuing his prey. The premise was believable and the way the story evolved, you knew that there was going to be some sort of apex that would happen, the ultimate showdown between the hero and the villain. WHAT A LET DOWN. It didn't play out that way at all. Not to mention a lot of mumbled dialogue and misqueued direction that the film eventually took for the last 45 minutes. I would recommend avoiding this film. I wish I could've gotten my money back and my time for seeing this. Do not watch on DVD because it will be NO BETTER.",1,33,105,27 December 2007
Men in Black II," I wish I could use a neuralizer on myself after seeing it!
","Ok,I just got back from watching MIB II and all I can say is, why did I waste my time? I should've waited for it to come on DVD. MIB 2 picks up 5 years after the first. This time around Lara Flynn Boyle is the baddie, who's acting was truly worse than her character. Each of the characters seemed lost within a world that both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith created in the first movie. I felt that it was totally rushed and there was no continuity throughout the picture.It was nice to see Peter Graves in the film. I honestly thought that he'd passed on, but lord and behold, he's alive and well. There were elements within this film that I thought were good. Frank the dog was great comic relief, and the 'worm guys' were cool for a chuckle or two.
The dissapointment came from the main characters, Jones and Smith. Each seemed to be trying to find more than the 'light', they were trying to find the characters. Jones truly was not in character as 'K' and Smith was trying to hard to be 'J'.I truly felt that the story could've been better. The whole idea that K was in love with someone else just doesn't fit with his whole 'view his love from a distant' in the first. Barry Sonnefeld shouldn't be blamed for the directing, the film editor should've been fed to the worm in the sewer.Don't go and see this in the theatre, and if you have, build yourself a neuarlizer and zap yourself to forget this dissapointment.",5,0,0,18 July 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Science Fiction Excellence: 30 years ahead of its time!
","This film is truly an exceptional piece of entertainment history. A film based on a story by a science fiction writer that actually thought about what life would be like in the 21st century.Stanley Kubrick was an exceptional individual with a vision and accuracy of what outerspace was truly like. Now remember this film was made almost 10 years before Star Wars was released. The films story was exceptionally well crafted. Here is a ancient unexplainable monolith that is discovered on the moon which is calling out to the universe as some sort of 'homeing beacon'. Humans, being truly arrogrant, believing that they've figured out the meaning of the monolith go to Jupiter to unlock this secret.
Along the way, the pressures of deepspace travel and an artificial intelligence that has a 'nervous breakdown' makes the story very interesting and entertaining to see if humanity can survive within the vacuum of space and far from its evloutionary nest.I highly recommend this film for all to see, sci fi lovers and the non, alike to watch. You'll at least come away from the film with an appreciation of what accuracy Kubrick was trying to obtain, or make you believe that 'we are truly not alone' in the universe.",10,0,1,16 February 2002
X2: X-Men United," X2: Good Strong Sequel / Great Adaptation
","I recently saw X2 and was extremely happy with the results. I think it is a great sequel, especially with the on-slaught of comic book adaptations and sequels that the movie studios has been 'pumping out' over the last 2 years.
X2 picks up were the first left off and with a great story plot. The introduction of Night Crawler was great and Alan Cummings portrayal of the teleporting mutant is great. Overall the development of each character was fantastic and the (spoiler) the sacrifice of Jeanne Grey's character at the end was good for the movie storyline. Granted I thought the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jeanne is a little dry, I understand the intention and design to entice those who like romance in the movie stories. Overall a great movie and will be an excellent movie to add to the DVD collection.",9,0,0,23 July 2003
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas should have stayed in the clouds....
","There is no simpler way of stating this. This movie was terrible. I lost 3 hours of my life watching this expecting something that was put together by the same group that handled the Matrix trilogy would be good, not great, but good. Nope, nada, nothing. Everything was wrong from the way the different time line stories were told, to the casting (who ever thought that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry would work together well on screen was high as the clouds). I honestly heard several people groan aloud and mumble 'where is this going?'. To my amusement, I shared in the same feeling...where was this going? I was awaiting for some sort of pivotal reconciling of all the different stories but nothing. Each ended as ridiculously has they began. It would've been better if it was like the Matrix and a 're-set' was done by the Oracle and the Director. Don't waste your time to see this. The acting was sub-par. In some instances it was quite comical to see Tom Hanks playing different parodies of himself. I honestly thought I'd see his character from Bosom Buddies showing up, but that was left to the antagonist character (aka Mr. Smith from the Matrix). Sad, just sad.",1,93,186,29 October 2012
