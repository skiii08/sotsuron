Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Prequel that Failed...
","Poor Phantom Menace! People really hate this film. Over the years I've heard people complain about the dialogue, the story, the acting, well pretty much everything really, and I can agree with almost all of these complaints. The hype for this film back in 1999 was enormous and when the film finally released, well...The whole idea of the prequel trilogy was to tell the story of Anakin Skywalker and how he went from a small boy on Tattooine to becoming Darth Vader. This whole premise sounds awesome and as a kid, I was really excited for this. I was always very interested in Darth Vader's backstory so getting a whole trilogy based around that was super exciting. When I saw the Phantom Menace, all my hopes were dashed...When the evil Trade Federation organise a blockade around the peaceful planet of Naboo, jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to confront the leaders of the federation, however the leader of the federation Nute Gunray is ordered to kill the jedi knights forcing them to flee down to the planet of Naboo where they must find and warn the queen who has already been captured by the federation...So this is basically the plot for the entire film, and what doesn't help is the constant political discussions and the dull senate scenes. May I remind you that this film is aimed primarily at kids, what kid is gonna sit through this? I sure as hell didn't, I always avoided this film because I didn't want to sit through this political bullshit.The underlying plot of the emperor trying to convince the queen to move for a vote of no-confidence on Chancellor Valorum so he can replace him and take emergency powers to do all his evil stuff behind the scenes and... I don't really know what's going on, this film does a lousy job in explaining the plot, which is a problem when you're setting the foundations for a whole new trilogy.You just want the plot to end so we can get to some awesome action scenes, but no we have to mess around on Tattooine for 40 minutes first. One of the big problems I have with this film is how much time it spends on Tattooing doing absolutely nothing. We meet Anakin Skywalker, the main focus of the trilogy, on this planet, and he's a child-slave who... no actually that's it he's a child-slave, I have nothing else. This kid has no character whatsoever, he has a crush on Padme and he's good a building things, we have nothing else on this kid, and yet Qui-Gon spends the next half an hour obsessing over him, taking samples and discussing exactly what he is and what his skills mean, why?When we finally leave Tattooine, Qui-Gon heads to the Jedi council to get Anakin approved for training, and the incredibly dull jedi council featuring an irritating CGI Yoda and a dull and incredibly flat Mace Windu, turn him down saying: 'he's too old', that's it! This council is absolute crap. They do nothing, they are constantly fretting about what this blockade could mean for the jedi and yet not one of them do a god damn thing! Seriously, get off your arses and do something!The climax consists of an awesome lightsaber fight, a team of separatists shooting through a castle, an underwhelming space attack on the Gunray's control ship, and a ridiculous invasion from the pathetic Gunguns, Wow! Anakin destroys the Gunray's control ship, the separatists confront Viceroy Gunray, and Darth Maul kills Qui-Gon before Obi-Wan kills Darth Maul. Obi-Wan decides to train Anakin, there's a big celebration, and the credits begin rolling!The lightsaber fight may be the best thing about this film, but the scenes with Anakin destroying the control ship are just daft. It's not the premise as such, I think it's more Jake Lloyd's performance with his constant 'Woah's and 'Wooo's which get on my nerves so I can't take it seriously.The film's acting is a major problem. I don't think it's the actors themselves as Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are both brilliant actors, but I feel it's a combination of flat dialogue and an over- reliance on bluescreen and CGI, both of which look dreadful. The actors are usually talking to something they can't see which means there's no emotion in their performances because acting emotively to an empty space is quite difficult.Also Lucas's script is full of flat lines and uninteresting dialogue, never at any point did I find myself thinking 'what an awesome line', instead I was usually thinking 'what the hell does that actually mean?'.Another problem with this cast is the film never uses them. Liam Neeson just walks around delivering incredibly flat lines, Ewan McGregor spends most of his time in the background, Natalie Portman is just there and Samuel L. Jackson sits in a chair fretting about stuff. Boring! I don't think it's really possible to review this film without talking about the infamous Jar Jar Binks, while I think he's visually impressive, it's the personality and the voice that get on my nerves. Maybe Lucas was trying to overcompensate for the endless political talk, but here we have the stereotypical, irritating cartoon character that's obviously trying too hard to appeal to kids.So... The Phantom Menace is the dullest of the Star Wars films and my personal least favourite. Anything cool that happens is overshadowed by something dull. Even the awesome lightsaber battles don't redeem the disaster that is the Phantom Menace. After this disaster, it took three years before we got the second part of the Prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones, would it be as bad as the first, well, fans will have you believe so...",2,1,6,16 February 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Claustrophobic and Creepy
","Knowing absolutely nothing about it and having not seen it's spiritual predecessor Cloverfield, I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane. I was impressed!There's already a Spoiler notice on this review, but still if you haven't seen this film I will spoil it rotten so watch out!After being run off the road by a truck, Michelle played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead finds herself chained to a wall alone in a stone cell. A man named Howard played by John Goodman tells her he's locked her up in the bunker to keep her safe against a nuclear holocaust as the air outside has been contaminated and is fatal to humans. But as she and fellow survivor Emmett played by John Gallagher, Jr. get used to living in the bunker, they begin to suspect Howard is not all that he seems.The mystery element of this film is brilliant, when you think Howard is up to something he appears extremely creepy, but when you realise he may be telling the truth he still doesn't sit right with you and something seems odd about him.The scene where Michelle and Emmett are having a laugh over dinner and Howard flips out smashing his hand against the table scared the absolute life out of me. I have never jumped so far out of a chair in my life. This film is full of jump-scares, and they all work perfectly. I was always on the edge of my seat, expecting something to happen that will make me jump out of my chair.This film manages to unnerve you within the first five minutes which is awesome. Before the titles have even appeared, you are nervous and loving the suspense.The most bizarre portion of the film is the final 15 minutes.After Howard has killed Emmett and Michelle has made a biohazard suit, she escapes to find the air is completely breathable, making you think that everything Howard has said was false and she had been imprisoned in the bunker by him. Just as she realises this, taa- daaa, Aliens!Aliens attack Michelle and attempt to exterminate her with toxic gas and an alien being that attacks her. She manages to destroy the ship and drives away where over the radio she hears the world has been overridden by Aliens.This shock ending has been met differently by many people, personally I love it, I love how one of Howard's theories that has been laughed at by the characters and is played as a joke throughout the course of the film, turns out to be what's really happening. The aliens aren't the main focus of the film, they're just there for an awesome shock ending, which I love.This films direction is amazing. It's so perfectly claustrophobic and tense and conveys the nightmare of being trapped in a bunker with a madman really well.If I had one complaint, it would be the characters who are so dull that I struggled to remember their names after I'd walked out of the cinema.The acting is amazing, simple as. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is perfect for every scene, John Goodman is creepy, funny and scary at the same time, and John Gallagher Jr. is perfect for this type of role.So... Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an amazing film that will have you laughing one minute, jumping out of your seat the next, intrigued the next minute, and surprised the next minute.The acting and direction are amazing and convey perfectly what these characters are going through. The jump scares work perfectly and the story is fascinating, oh, and that ending! Overall, this film was awesome!",9,0,2,3 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Prequel that Suffered...
","So after the critical disaster that was the Phantom Menace, George Lucas was very hesitant to return to the writing desk, when he did, we got Attack of the Clones, the most underrated film in the series.10 years after the Phantom Menace, Padme Amadala returns to Coruscant where she is almost killed by an assassin. The Jedi council decide that Padme should be hidden on Naboo while they investigate who is after her, so they recruit Obi-wan Kenobi, now a Jedi master, and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, now a Jedi Padawan, to help. Anakin is sent to protect Padme on Naboo, where they begin to fall in love, but Anakin's nightmares about his mother force him on his own mission to his home planet where his journey to the dark side begins, and Obi-wan is sent to find the assassin who tried to kill Padme, but instead he finds a clone army being built for the republic...The plot for Attack of the Clones is less political that the Phantom Menace which is nice, but it instead puts a lot of its focus on Anakin and Padme's relationship which results in a lot of awkward dialogue and forced romance, which is why a lot of people consider this film the worst of the saga, I feel there's not enough of this to overshadow the good points. The love plot isn't even that long. Half-way through the story, Anakin decides to head to Tattoine to see his mother after he has a nightmare about her, when he arrives he finds her having been tortured by the sandpeople and she dies in his arms, so he kills all the sandpeople in a fit of rage. The next scene is really cool but spoiled mostly by Hayden Christensen's acting, where he proclaims his hatred for the sandpeople, this is the first glimpse we get of Darth Vader.The other storyline is that of Obi-wan trying to find out who tried to assassinate Padme. I really like this storyline, it has a real element of mystery about it. We also visit many imaginative worlds throughout this storyline, and while there's too much CGI, it at least looks better than the previous film.Let's talk about the cast, Hayden Christensen gives a very forced performance as Anakin Skywalker. Jake Lloyd wasn't exactly Oscar standard but he was competent and knew how to act the lines he was reading, Christensen just reads the lines and hopes for the best, which makes things feel very forced. Natalie Portman is OK but she doesn't do the romantic dialogue too well, almost as if she doesn't know how to act these lines, which makes me think it's George Lucas' writing rather than the acting.Ewan McGregor is naturally the best actor in this film, but his character just isn't there. As for the others, Samuel L. Jackson is great when he's being given things to do, Ian MacDiarmid is suitably mysterious in the role of Palpatine, and Jimmy Smitt does a great job with his small role as Bail Organa. Newcomers include Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett who has a great mysterious presence on screen, and even Daniel Logan as the young Boba Fett isn't that bad, despite being a nothing character. And then there's the main star of the Dark Side, Christopher Lee, as the wonderful Count Dooku, my favourite villain from the prequel trilogy. This guy is so awesomely creepy and gives off this powerful screen presence whenever he's in the shot. This film is heavier on the action than its predecessors, and it's very cool. The hover-car scene at the beginning of the film looks awesome even if I am always thinking of Mega Man X8, and Anakin jumping off the car and skydiving down to the car of the assassin is freaking awesome. I also love the droid factory scene and Obi-wan's fight with bounty hunter Jango Fett on Kamino, it's so fun. The space battle that follows is also really cool, although it lacks the tension of the asteroid scene in the Empire Strikes Back. But it's the Jedi battle on Geonosis that really seals it for me, seeing so many Jedi fighting is awesome, and I admit, I rather like C-3PO's one-liners during this scene.The finale contains a three part lightsaber battle between Anakin, Obi-wan and Yoda against Count Dooku. The Swordplay is really cool, although it lacks the super fast fun of the Phantom Menace battle, but it's very well choreographed. There is however this one awkward scene with Anakin and Count Dooku just sort of waving their lightsabers above their heads, not even hitting each other, it's really awkward, but Anakin fighting with two sabers is pretty cool. Yoda fighting with a lightsaber is really cool too. His constant jumping around make an incredibly fearsome opponent, although the fight is incredibly quick and doesn't last long! The score during this battle is amazing, seriously, watch this with the volume up, the score makes this scene so epic. So... Overall, I really like this film. It's not quite the original trilogy but it's still really cool. It has a better plot that the Phantom Menace, as well as being more interesting and less dull. This is a film that I can actually watch and have a really good time with, unlike the Phantom Menace which I just want to turn off as soon as we reach Tattooine. This film is heavily criticised because of its awkward love scenes, people seem to overlook the really awesome moments this film has to offer, and I don't consider the love scenes to be something that's impossible to sit through, I've seen worse.The only thing left to do was to finish Anakin's story, so in 2005 we got Revenge of the Sith, which is considered by many to be the best of the prequels...",7,1,1,16 February 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Entertaining, but mostly forgettable!
","I loved Days of Future Past, despite the puzzled narrative and cloudy second half it was still a hugely entertaining film that I could return to any day. X-Men: Apocalypse however, feels more dull than awesome.There are some truly great concepts that I'll get to later, but I constantly got this feeling that this film was just padding for this series. They wanted one more film, and so tacked on another unnecessary concept and storyline.Now, it's great seeing Nightcrawler back after his last appearance in X2, and he once again makes for a cool character, but just like most of the cool characters in this film, he does very little.That's one of the big problems with this film, the plot is on autopilot. No-one needs to really do anything because the plot's moving along by itself. Mystique spends the first half of the film running around doing... something that has little relevance to anything really, and Nightcrawler just tags along for most of the story.Cyclops makes a return, only to again do very little. He only becomes important during the film's climax where he joins the fight against Apocalypse.Oh boy, let's talk about Apocalypse. He's the bad guy, that's about it. This has to be one of the most boring villains in the series. He wants to destroy everything, simple as. There's no struggle, there's no character whatsoever. He's little more than a plot device.However there is one character I would like to talk about, and that's the legendary Quicksilver. His introduction at Xavier's academy beats the classic kitchen scene from Days of Future Past 100 times over. It's such an awesome scene.And I guess I kinder like Jean Grey as well as her telekinetic powers make for some nice scenes. But everyone else feels like they're just along for the ride, and that extends to the villains to.Apocalypse barely even has to try to convince Angel and Storm to join him, two characters who should've been awesome but just spend their time standing in the background while the real antagonist makes his demands.Visually, this is a good looking film. The GCI is OK although I dare say they could've been a little more imaginative but it works so I won't go too deep. The make up effects are highly impressive most of the time and nothing stands out to me as looking cheap or unconvincing.The acting is the best thing about this film. Sophie Turner and Evan Peters are my favourites but everyone is doing their best with what they've been given. Even Lana Condor who, considering this was her first ever acting role, is doing a great job.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse isn't bad, but it could've been so much more. Unlike most of it's predecessors, the imagination just isn't there. The characters are little more than plot devices, the villains are uninteresting and most of it just feels like the film trying to keep itself going under the weight of strong but badly constructed themes.The plot is thin, the characters are weak and the whole thing is entirely forgettable, but at least we'll always have the Quicksilver scene.",6,2,6,8 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Prequel that Rocked...
","In 2005, it was time to end the Star Wars Prequel trilogy! The previous two films in the Prequel trilogy have over the years been considered cinematic disappointments in the Star Wars saga, so it's a surprise that the final film in the trilogy would be considered one of the best in the series. The film begins with Anakin and Obi-Wan invading General Grievous' battleship to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, but first they encounter Count Dooku and cue the awesome lightsaber fight. This fight is super awesome and really fun, although watching Dooku get his head cut off is really sad as Count Dooku is the best.After rescuing the Chancellor they crash-land Grievous' battleship on Coruscant as Grievous makes his escape. After this awesome opening, the story focuses on Anakin. There are scenes that are quite powerful such as Anakin and Padme looking at each other across a city, and there are less powerful ones like Anakin having a childish tantrum in the middle of a senate meeting to the head- shaking disapproval of Obi-wan.Obi-Wan has a sub-plot too, as does Yoda, Mace Windu gets some awesome screen time, and Padme has some truly emotional scenes. Unlike the previous two prequels, Revenge of the Sith does a brilliant job in utilising its cast to create some truly tense and memorable moments.Obi-Wan's journey involves him trying to find and defeat General Grievous, it's very straight forward and does a better job than his assassination plot from Attack of the Clones which felt cloudy at times.Yoda's sub-plot is pure fan service. He visits Kashyyyk which is the home planet of the Wookies and we meet Chewbacca. But apart from that, there's nothing notable about this.Mace Windu does his usual political talk until he's alerted by Anakin to the fact that Chancellor Palpatine may be the Sith Lord they've been looking for, at which point he whips out his purple lightsaber and attempts to arrest him, but the arrest turns into a lightsaber duel between Palpatine and Windu which is, kinder awful! This fight is rather awkward as Ian McDiarmid, the actor who plays Palpatine, does not know how to use this lightsaber. He's swinging it around aimlessly and you can't take him seriously as the ultimate leader of the dark side.This is the turning point in the film where Anakin cuts off Windu's hand to stop him killing Palpatine, and Palpatine uses his force lighting to shoot Windu out of the window to his death, finally completing Anakin's turn to the Dark Side, as Palpatine crowns him 'Darth Vader', now we're getting somewhere.Palpatine gives the Clones 'Order 66', causing the troops to kill all the Jedi, with the exception of Obi-Wan and Yoda who manage to escape their detection. With most of the Jedi dead, Obi-Wan is sent to confront Anakin, and Yoda goes to confront Palpatine. Cue Lightsabers!First of all, we have Yoda vs Palpatine. This fight starts off similar to the Yoda vs Count Dooku fight from the previous film but soon changes to a force battle in the senate. I really like this fight, the scenes with Palpatine throwing the senate platforms at Yoda is very cool, and good use of the CGI. But then there's the big fight of the series, the pivotal battle that sets up the Original trilogy. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is really fast and really epic, I love how intense this fight is and even though we know who the victor will be, we really want to see how this turns out. When you imagined what the final fight between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader looked like, this is probably what you wanted it to be.Obi-Wan eventually gets 'the High Ground', but Anakin charges against him anyway leading Obi-Wan to severe Anakin's legs and arms, and due to the fiery heat of the lava, his body is burnt alive. While Obi-Wan takes Padme to have her baby in a safe place, the Emperor takes Anakin's body and fits it into a life suit to keep him alive, enter Darth Vader! After giving birth to her two children, Luke and Leia, Padme dies because she's 'lost the will to live' or something. Leia is taken to live with the Organas while Luke is taken to live with Owen and Peru on Tattooine, leading us straight into the Original Trilogy, finally! Ewan McGregor once again rocks his performance as Obi-Wan. Hayden Christensen is still not Oscar standard but he's better than he was in Attack of the Clones. Natalie Portman is more emotive here, and Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz and Ian MacDiarmid are once again great.The writing is better than the previous two films but it still suffers from some very awkward off-the-wall dialogue that is either really awkward because it was unnecessary, or so forced that the actors don't know how to say the lines effectively.So... Overall, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars Prequels. It's dark and awesome and shows what George Lucas can do when he's just trying to create a solid story and not trying to juggle continuity and love stories, endless comic relief and off- the-wall dialogue. We get something worthy of his original masterpieces, something that's truly enjoyable...The Prequel trilogy is widely regarded as a great cinematic disappointment, but I feel that while not as good as the originals, they do get too much hate. While it's a wide opinion that the Phantom Menace really does suck, people are still divided on Attack of the Clones and fans really like Revenge of the Sith. They'll never be as good as the originals, but they're not as bad as most fans will have you believe...",9,4,6,26 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 150 Minutes of my life I'll never get back!
","I've never seen a Superman movie. I never saw Man of Steel, I never saw Superman Returns, I never saw The Quest for Peace (thankfully), but I know enough about Superman's backstory to get a feel for the character. I absolutely love Batman, I've seen all of the 80/90s film and I love them all, with one obvious exception. After seeing a pretty impressive trailer for the film, I decided to head up to the local cinema to see the latest work of DC Comics, I really wish I hadn't bothered.I don't understand who looked at this script and said, 'yeah, that's a good idea'. Batman vs Superman for me was 150 minutes of guessing the plot, cringing at the horrible CGI, shaking my head at the terrible dialogue and waiting impatiently for that beautiful moment where the list of names began scrolling up on the screen.So, the big spectacle we all wanted to see, the rivalry between Batman and Superman, is only there because the name of the film is Batman vs. Superman. I have no idea exactly why these guys have a disliking of each other, but at some point within the first 15 minutes of the film Superman effectively says 'I'm gonna fight Batman', 80 minutes later they fight, that's it.As well as this we have a ridiculous amount of other sub-plots that aren't even remotely coherent, such as a character called Diana Prince who we never learn anything about until the final 40 minutes at which point she turns into a main character, doing some kind of spy work which we never really learn about, we're just meant to accept that she's a spy doing secret things that we're not meant to care about.We also have Lex Luther who is trying to get his hands on some Kryptonite so he can do... something. I'm actually not sure, I think it has something to do with his dislike of Superman, which I don't understand because we're never given any clear explanation as to why he hates him, and then he decides to send Superman to kill Batman, for some other reason we're never given an answer too.For most of the film, every character goes on about how Superman is a menace and should be tried for what he has done, and the first scene of this film shows him killing a terrorist threatening Lois Lane's life in Africa. I'm honestly sure not many people would care about this death, but they keep going on about other things he has supposedly done that are never shown or even explained in the film, so what exactly did he do to make the world hate him so much?This film is meant to be a launch-pad movie for a new series of super-hero movies, and yet nothing is ever expanded on. What does Lex Luther's company actually do? What exactly is Wayne Industries? What happened in the 18 months between this film and Man of Steel? No-one ever bothers to answer these simple questions that could've been cleared up in a single line, which is irritating because we're supposed to care about this world that will be the base of a new universe.Lex Luther kidnaps Superman's mother and uses her as a threat to force him to fight Batman, this is where we get the long awaited fight between Batman and Superman, and it's OK, but it's nothing spectacular. It goes on for a while until Superman reveals his mother's name is Martha, and as Batman's mother's name is Martha they decide to become friends, you know, after knocking the hell out of each other.Batman goes to save Superman's mother, and Superman goes to stop Lex Luther, this is where we get a pretty awesome fight scene. Batman's attack on Lex Luther's guards is really cool, it's an exciting a fast paced scene that provides one of the few thrills of the film.Meanwhile, Superman confronts Lex Luther who retaliates by unleashing a giant freaking monster, what the hell? This monster comes out of nowhere just to extend the movie out for another 30 minutes. The monster itself looks absolutely dreadful, a horrible looking CGI creation that rips the awesome from the film.During this fight scene, Wonder Woman shows up out of absolutely nowhere to join the fight. At this point, I had lost the will to live, I just wanted the film to end. The action scenes here were mindless and uninteresting, and I couldn't care less about what was going to happen.As for the acting, Ben Affleck is great a Batman and Henry Cavill is brilliant as Superman so no complaints there, Amy Adams makes the best of Lois Lane and Jesse Eisenberg is superbly crazy as Lex Luther, at least we have a good cast.I think I'll just sum up here. Batman vs. Superman is a mess, a mess on every creative level, which is a shame because trailers made this film look really good, I saw the first trailer for this film in the previews for 10 Cloverfield Lane, and it looked awesome, when I saw the film, I just didn't understand what the hell the aim of this film was. The plot was incoherent, it was far too long, there was never any consistency with the narrative, it just didn't work.Batman vs. Superman is one of DC Comics biggest failures, and a big misstep for the start of this new series.There's 150 Minutes of my life I'll never get back!",2,38,71,2 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Excels as a Thrill Ride, but that's about it!
","If you haven't seen The Force Awakens yet, then go now, this is your last chance. The Force Awakens is a film everyone wants to spoil, and they've done a good job, I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum, but you can't review this film without some getting through.As we all know the original Star Wars films were without a doubt the best, they were fun and easy to watch, even if Episode VI was a little silly, then the prequels came along and divided the fanbase with their endless political talk and drab acting, but then again, they brought impressive lightsaber battles and admittedly rather nice looking CGI, and while you can bash the hell out of Episode I as much as you like, Episode II and III were still pretty strong instalments.Now Episode VII is here to show us that Star Wars still has enough originality to make a worthy sequel to the original trilogy, did it succeed?, well, um, not really!Don't get me wrong, I like Episode VII, but where originality goes, there's barely any here at all, this film's plot is a mash-up of the plots from Episodes IV, V and VI. There are new characters sure, and new set pieces, but the plot, the action scenes and even the climax all transmit that seen-it-all-before feeling.These new characters are rather unmemorable too, Finn is a very shallow character who gives up in one shot and then fights for justice in the next. Rey accomplishes what Luke and Anakin took two films to do in half the running time, and the old characters have lost the appeal that made them classic characters in the first place. Positively Shocking!But there are actually things I enjoyed about the Force Awakens, for example, this film is full of brilliant action sequences such as the falcon being chased by the first order, and the films rather brilliant climax, but there are moments that I rather dislike however, such as the scene with the Rathtar which not only manages to be a directional mess as well as introducing a pointless creature for the sake of it, but is also just not Star Wars.While the plot is very unoriginal, it does have that sense of epicness that was missing from Return of the Jedi, as well as the first two prequels, but it's strong with this film, you feel the epicness of the plot and you know when the climax has begun because you feel the tension rise extremely quickly. The climax is the best thing about this film, even if it is completely unoriginal.One thing I feel I must mention, and I don't want to say any more bad stuff about this film, but this needs to be mentioned, is just how poorly this film establishes what happened during the 30 year gap between Return of the Jedi and the Force Awakens. The film mentions why Luke ran away and abandoned where ever the hell he was, and we're given an explanation as to why, but it's not explained well at all leading to a lot of plot holes which didn't need to be there if the writing was just a little better.But if I can say one thing, I feel this film sets up Episode VIII really well. I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of this trilogy because it looks like they're going to do something really awesome with it, it certainly doesn't look like another prequel trilogy.So Overall... The Force Awakens is good for a thrill, but that's it. The characters new and old come across as rather dull and uninteresting, the plot is almost completely unoriginal and the continuity is either absent or baffling. But because of it's action scenes, lightsaber battles, and impressive direction, not to mention a great cast, I can't say I dislike this film, but if I had to rank it with all the others, I'd put it in-between Episode II and Episode VI. The Force Awaken does a good job as a thrill ride, but not really as much else. (7/10)*Final Spoilery Note: Where the hell was Lando Calrissian during this film, and why did R2-D2 only appear during the final 5 minutes? disappointing!",7,5,13,19 January 2016
