Spartacus," UK Imperialism Endures despite the evidence
","Peter Morrison writes in a recent review of Spartacus 'Only the ending lets the film down. Do we really believe it was worth all the suffering to free one woman and a baby?'In light of this opinion,  it is no surprise the UK continues to suffer from the 'The Troubles'.  It is amazing that the bulk of the UK continues to be governed in part by a landed gentry whose claim to legitimacy is attributable to an accident of birth. How are the excesses portrayed in Spartacus all that  different than the well documented history of 'The Empire'?Fortunately,  my forefathers 200 and 3000 miles due west of Nottingham believed that 'the suffering to free one woman and one baby'  was indeed a noble cause.  'Spartacus' remains relevant, at least for the sentient bits of the free world, nearly 40 years hence.",Null,5,9,19 March 1999
