Despicable Me 2," A barrel of laughs
","I loved the first movie a lot, so when I heard they were making a sequel I was worried it would follow the faith of so many before it. Thankfully, Im happy to say it didn't. Not only did it keep in spirit with the first one, they didn't spoil all the jokes in the trailers and I couldn't stop laughing all the way. True, it's easy to guess the ending, but honestly, how else were they going to the moment we saw Lucy. The minions were great, Agnes was great, Gruu was great... a lot of it was great. Only complaint would be that Edith didn't play a very big role in this one either as it focused more on the love fracture and the fatherly relationship between Gruu and the girls. Regardless it was a great movie, worth supporting and worth watching.",10,1,2,10 July 2013
