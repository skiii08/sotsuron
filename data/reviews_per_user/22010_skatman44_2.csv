The Incredible Hulk," Insight to the Incredible Hulk ten minutes after viewing the film
","Chances are if you are looking at ratings or comments of the release of the The Incredible Hulk then you have seen the film or are thinking about it. Well if you are the later then spend the eight or nine bucks on the ticket to go see it, it will be well worth it.I had heard many reasons of why some people did not want to go see this film and many of them reverted back to the 2003 film The Hulk, I unlike what seems to be many other people have this film and enjoyed seeing it many times. I do understand though that many people were not impressed with fight scene time or with the C.G. of the time but overall I still think it is a decent way to spend a rainy night.If you had some concerns about The Incredible Hulk based on some let down after viewing the 2003 film, DON'T! The fight scenes are longer, the Hulk looks more realistic, and he is still a bad ass. Marvel in my opinion is 2-for-2 this summer and that is what they are going to need going up against the July 18th release of The Dark Knight by D.C.",9,5,8,16 June 2008
Atonement," Disappointed
","The film had great potential, but when you leave a theater and a mist the talk you hear that people were disappointed just like you then you know the film was not good. Knightley and McAvoy are only together in the movie for 10 minutes, and have but a moment together. The film starts off in a interesting manner but becomes confusing as the timecontinues on. When compared to movies like the Notebook or Titanic as the commercials state, Atonement is not the best since. When in fact it is noteven entertaining. If you have to see this movie then go when it is cheap, because you will regret paying 8 dollars for something that is less quality then a movie at a rental store.",3,6,13,3 January 2008
