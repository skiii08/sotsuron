The Blair Witch Project," oh wait, it was a horror movie
","This has really been the summer of the overhyped-but-failed-to-deliver film. And the Blair Witch Project is a fine example.  With almost no budget, two student filmmakers turn a neat idea into a painfully hard to watch film, in the process wasting some amazing acting talent.  (I'm actually a little curious as to how they spent $35 000 on it!) I'm not surprised that people caught on to it as they did, but just because something is indie doesn't make it good. (And how indie is it when you're on the cover of Time, People, etc??)  The rants and the raves came too much too quickly, and no movie could be expected to fulfill that hype, but still, Blair Witch is contrived, boring, and not at all scary.  I've heard too many comments like 'this is what Hollywood needs to learn' yada yada yada.  Whatever happened to judging films by what they are not what they aren't.  Blair Witch is just a bad example of two promising fimmakers making an early mistake.  Hopefully, they'll scare us next time.",1,1,3,3 September 1999
La Grande Illusion," Powerful and Unforgettable
","WWI changed everything, and Renoir's masterpiece carefully reveals the eroding social structure of the early 20th Century. The classes are melting into each other, and the new world emerging is seen with both hope and reservation.  Banned by by both Hitler and Mussolini, the film nevertheless was brought to the Venice film festival where it won top honours.  La Grande Illusion has managed to stay with me every day since I first saw it over a year ago.  One of (if not THE) best anti-war film(s)ever made, the futility of battle has never been so well expressed on screen.",10,1,3,16 February 1999
