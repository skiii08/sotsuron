Hereditary," WOW
","This movie is incredible. I love the horror genre due to its versatility. There's infinite ways you can scare or creep out your audience and the beauty of it is that the most effective type of horror isn't the 'in your face-ghost-vampire-zombie-guts-blood' type of horror. And this movie does nothing but prove it. It's suspenseful where it needs to be, gory in the right places, tense, moody, macabre, dark, scary, creepy and sad, all perfectly timed.
The acting is incredible, the score is outstanding, the script is impecable. It's a beautiful piece of cinematography, don't miss it just because it's not what people expect from a horror movie.",9,3,8,11 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Not perfect but still pretty good
","It chapter 2 is a good movie. Not perfect by any means but still stands up on it's own. It's not a sequel, it's the second part of a whole story which is too long and complex (as is the book) to fit into one continuous film, hence the 3 hr running time. A lot of bad reviews derive from this fact so let me tell you something. We are watching a movie based on a 1200 page book with 8 main characters (It+losers club), and I'm not counting Derry which is a main character in of its own. You have to develop 8 main stories, not once (Childhood), not twice (Adulthood) but three times (Flashbacks). You have to intertwine them and elaborate on a lot of detail. Granted, there is A LOT of dragging in some parts but you can't tell a story that has so many details and it's so complex in less than two hours. It just wouldn't stand.The casting and acting are both outstanding. The under-use of Skarsgard as Pennywise is criminal, this movie needed more of him on screen. King's cameo is genius. Very tasteful and surprising not to mention well deserved.They definitely went overboard with the CGI and poorly timed comedy. It takes away from the dark and ominous mood of some scenes. Also, Too many CGI loaded jump scares, it desensitizes the audience and turns horror into comedy.But despite its flaws, I welcome this movie to my list of top horror movies of the last 20 years. It's a very well crafted, adapted, produced, acted and shot piece of cinematography that does absolute justice to the book that birthed it.",8,8,13,11 September 2019
