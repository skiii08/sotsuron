First Man," Stunning direction... poor characterization... mediocre production
","I attended the premiere of the movie in Salt Lake City with my friends, whom I brought to the cinema with a promise of a great movie, staring Ryan Gosling, and they were not disappointed. Most of them liked the movie but it was not what is expected from an admired movie about Apollo mission to the Moon.
The pace of the film is reasonable. It starts at the right place, where it shows how Neil Armstrong joins NASA and it does not jump forward. Everything is on the track. It TRIES to keep a balance between showing Neil's domestic relations with his family and his achievements and struggles at work until he makes it to the moon. That is good directing and somehow good script.The problem with the characters is that after the movie you cannot tell what kind of person each on of them are. Neil himself does not talk much and he's always down and blue, apparently because her daughter dies of cancer many years ago. What we see is that he is a silent person who does not care much about his family and is too much into his work. There is a strong presence of apathy in his reactions which is rooted in directing, screen writing and the acting altogether. It kinda ruins your notion of a successful person and not like non-perfectionist realism, but more like why that guy acts this way. Other characters are not developed any better. Neil's interaction with his wife, children or even his colleagues are always vague and ambiguous at best.And just because it is an admired movie, don't expect a production quality like Gravity or Interstellar. There are too much camera zoom and too much camera shaking. A large portion of the movie shows thrilling moments of launching rockets or when rockets are in trouble, and all you can see is the camera shaking like crazy for too long while it is zoomed on faces or spaceship walls. That along with the loud sound of cinemas you get a small dizziness by the end of the movie.For most of the part I focused on drawbacks, but it is still a relatively good movie that shows the chronicles and history of the most important (claimed!) space travel, with good production design.
It is worthy to watch. Go and see it. But lower your exceptions!",6,49,113,4 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Stunning directing and acting from people you wouldn't think
","I went to see this film in Salt Lake City without knowing Lady Gaga plays a role in it, as I like to know nothing about what I'm about to see. When the movie started I noticed the resemblance but refused to believe it (Heck, we never see her without makeup). That was a professional critically prominent performance and could not be from a singer. I took that stance until the midst of the movie when I was doubtful enough to verify online it was indeed her. And WOW! she is brilliant, entitled to claim awards, able to compete experienced actresses, and obviously not just a pretty face but full of talents.
I have not seen the original Star is born, but I know the movie is very similar to Lady Gaga's life story, though not the same. I hate to spoil the details, I just mention that a romantic relation sparks when Jack, another famous signer (played by Bradley Cooper) saw Alley (Lady Gaga) in a trans bar and then push her to perform on the big stage. The movie, with a wonderful pace, shows how Alley grow and grasp opportunities on the way to become a star, while Jack hopelessly wreck all what he has and eventually destroy himself. However, they maintain their love throughout this and present a realistic touchable persuasive romantic relationship that does not bore you in this 140 minute marathon. It also ends in a romantic tragedy that brought tears to eyes of everyone (I deny crying).
Bradley Cooper presents one of his best performances, probably because he got to direct himself! He is calm and confident, and yet vulnerable and weak-kneed. And hats off to this directing and screen writing! Characters are patiently developed and well-defined. A challenging romance along with a sophisticated yet cruel relation between Jack and his father is masterfully illustrated. All of this in a coherent mixture of drama and music is presented to you and regardless of how demanding and stern audience you are, it will stun you, Guaranteed!
Don't miss this movie as it will definitely win many nominations in the coming festivals.",9,4,8,10 October 2018
