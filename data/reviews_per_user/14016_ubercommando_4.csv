Come and See," Watch this movie and 'The Ascent'
","This is probably the most harrowing war movie ever made...I can't think of any other war film that hits you over the head and stomps on your guts as much.  It is a very Russian movie, I can't think of another part of the world where a movie like this would be made in that style.For me, some scenes stand out because I have never seen anything like them. The boy in the woods concussed from the explosions as the German paratroopers arrive.  The soundtrack goes to a high pitched ringing.  The two children running through a deserted village, they stop at a house to eat a cake left in the kitchen.  All around are flies, but where do they come from?  They run out of the house and out of the village; in the background, you see why there are so many flies; the bodies of the villagers are just piled high against a building, but the children don't notice them.  The Germans herding the villagers into a barn and burning it.  Later, the Nazis are herded themselves by Russians and douse themselves with petrol as they go mad.  The effigy of Hitler made out of mud and grass.
Apparently, this movie was originally planned to have been directed by Klimov's wife; the brilliant Larissa Shepitko (who directed 'The Ascent') who died in a car crash before the project got going.  'The Ascent' deals with a lot of similar themes and shares the same premise of partisans struggling to survive under Nazi invasion, but goes into the human side a lot more.",8,7,13,23 December 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I can't believe people are slating this movie!
","OK, for those of you who aren't sure whether 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid' is a good, or even great movie, just do the following:Scroll up to 'memorable quotes'.  Go on, do it and then read what follows. I'll be right here when you get back.Finished?  Did you read those lines?  THAT, my friends, that and the fact they are spoken by some great actors is what makes this film so wonderful. They are perfectly balanced between being funny, endearing and also revealing about the characters.  There's genuine emotion and warmth in a lot of that.Conrad Hall, George Roy Hill, Burt Bacharach et al all contributed marvelously but I love the cast; such quality and for some of them, in small, but memorable roles:  George Furth, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, Strother Martin, Katherine Ross and the stars at the top; Newman and Redford who did perfect justice to Goldman's script.",8,130,193,31 August 2004
Cross of Iron," Forget 'Saving Private Ryan'
","I saw some of the comments on this movie, and I shook my head in disbelief...this is perhaps the best WW2 movie ever made, and I'm in good company in recommending this film; Orson Welles said 'Cross Of Iron' was the best film about fighting men ever made.'Saving Private Ryan' may get tons of plaudits, but apart from a diligent art department getting hold of the proper uniforms and equipment, and the docu-drama camera-work, Spielberg's work is just another one of his cheesefests with a visceral opening scene. 'Cross Of Iron' captures the cynicism, the inner conflicts and the bleakness of war on the Eastern Front. Peckinpah's style of slow motion cross cutting works excellently here and for history buffs, the uniforms and equipment are spot on (real T-34 tanks, not American Shermans or Pattons painted up). Top Hollywood actors such as Coburn and Mason blend in very well with a great German supporting cast (Klaus Lowitsch as the unit slob, Corporal Kruger, is particularly good) but it's the ever excellent David Warner who steals every scene.Those who say 'this isn't a good film' really need their tastes re-examining.",9,11,13,15 February 2005
Heat," Michael Mann is THE crime movie director of the last 20 years
","Mann wrote and directed a tv movie called 'LA Takedown' in the early 1980's and for those people who don't like complexity, character developement and want straight A-B storytelling which doesn't challenge them, then see that version.  For those who like movies, of whatever genre, to challenge, dazzle, involve and intrigue, then plump for 'Heat' in all its 3 hour glory. Mann is on top of his form in the crime genre; building up from 'Thief', 'Miami Vice', 'Camarena: The Drug Wars' this is his magnum opus.  It's not enough that we have cop versus robber, this delves into the character's souls.  Pacino and DeNiro are men who want to connect with a partner, but ultimately are loners incapable of supressing their drive to make a relationship work.  Kilmer has a dysfunctional relationship, but ultimately his wife's loyalty wins through to save his life, Sizemore is portrayed as a family man (despite his criminal job) but is prepared to use a child as a hostage.  Everyone sacrifices something in this movie.  And what makes 'Heat' a great movie is that a) it has an excellent script which is b) backed up by brilliant set pieces.  The gun battle has been talked about as one of the best ever in movies.  It's not just the action, or the amount of lead fired; it borders on documentary style photography and it uses sound brilliantly.  The shots echo off the buildings, giving the fight a sense of scale and depth.  I saw the film with an ex-army officer who said that was the most realistic depiction of a gun fight he'd ever seen on film.  But a review of 'Heat' cannot go without mentioning the two stars.  For me, there are two moments which sum up why casting Pacino and DeNiro isn't for the headline value.  First is where the cops are staking out the bank at night whilst DeNiro's crew fiddle with the electronics.  A cop makes a noise in the surveillance van; DeNiro spins around and stares at the source of the noise.  Look at his eyes, it's chilling.  The second is the part where Pacino's team are lured to the docks, he realises that he's not the hunter, but the hunted.  Again, notice Pacino's eyes and his body language.  As for the bit in the cafe, I think it's clever that Mann never shows them together in the same shot.  Forget the conspiracy theory that the two actors hated each other and refused to be present on set with one another.  If Mann had showed us the two in the same shot, the audience would all be going 'whooo, look at them, two greatest method actors of their generation sitting together!'  Instead, we are drawn into the scene and we can concentrate better on the dialogue.",9,0,0,23 December 2003
