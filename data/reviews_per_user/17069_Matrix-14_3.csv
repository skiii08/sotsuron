The Blair Witch Project," Not Scary
","i thought this movie was good but i wasn't scared by it. when i saw the movie after seeing those trailer where the reviewers called it 'Scary as Hell,' etc. i was wondering if they saw the same movie. sure it was suspenseful at parts but it wasn't scary. and even 'sixth sense' was creepier than this. More people were screaming in the theater anyways. this movie wasn't that originial if you've seen 'The Last Broadcast.' the similarities are almost identical. I wouldn't expect any oscar noms or anything except maybe for acting. and come on, how much really did those two guys direct? and what original screenplay?  the actors held the cameras and made up dialogue while the directors were hiding out in the woods.",1,0,3,27 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Mouth Wide Open. Excellent Masterpiece.
","This movie was amazing. Excellent, excellent film. One of the best movies I've ever seen. I would have known it was film of Kubrick's if I knew nothing about it before seeing it. Halfway through the film at the orgy sequence It was very intense and haunting. The film just drew me in. Something that probably won't happen for most commercial audiences. It is too weird for most people. Most commercial audiences will either love it or just not get it. But people who love Kubrick will love this.The digital mask placing wasn't as bad or as comical as critics say. It would have been nice to see it how it was intended though. And it is a shame that Warner Bros. is more concerned with making money. I'm 17 and I don't think that most people my age or under would want to see this film anyway. It's far too complex.Nicole Kidman was EXCELLENT. Especially in the pot smoking scene. I wouldn't be suprised if she got an Oscar nomination or even an Oscar. Another standout was Alan Cummings as the desk clerk.EYES WIDE SHUT probably won't be nominated for anything else if you go by the Academy's history with Kubrick films.Don't listen to critics. Kubrick's films always got some bad response from critics. You have to see it for yourself.

The Matrix," Just One Word: Wow!!!
","I thought this movie was great. I loved it. Younger viewers might not like its involving story but will be blown away by its inventive action sequences. Its the best action/sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time, and liked it better than Dark City. The special effects blew me away, and it had a story to match. Something you don't see with most Hollywood shoot em' up action movies. I like Keanu Reeves (not a huge fan) but I just thought he just didn't look comfortable on the screen like he did in other movies like Speed. Laurence Fishburn was good as the mysterious Morpheus, and the woman who played Trinity.The Matrix - * * * 1/2",7,0,0,5 April 1999
