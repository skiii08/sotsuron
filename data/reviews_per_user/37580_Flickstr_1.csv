Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is Digital Projection (DLP in this case)
","Movie history was made June 18th when TPM (The Phantom Menace) opened in 4 theaters with Digital Projection, bringing us closer than ever to screening perfection! The show was teriffic, a must see for real fans!On July 5th I drove from Philly to Secaucus, NJ and saw my third screening of TPM. It was actually the first time I saw much of the fine detail in many facial expressions, the matts, and the animations. There are fine lines in Yoda's face, streaks in his hair, and highlights/shadows everywhere that were not noticeable in the film screenings.The tour de core (of the Naboo planet) is a wonderful tribute to Jules Verne ('20K Leagues' and 'Journey to the Center of the Earth' all in one scene.) The digital version is much deeper and darker than the film. The range of luminousity seemed much wider and the contrast much sharper than the film.The pod race really blew me away. The digital projection system appears to preserve much more detail as the background or foreground fly by. I found myself trying to fly the course as we followed Anakin around. It was wonderful.The digital cut has an extra set of credits for its preparation. I wonder if the DVD release is the same cut. It is awesome to realize that this cut will look the same EVERY time, from the time Rick McCallum approved it to the time my great grandkids see it.If you have the opportunity to get to North Jersey or to L.A. before the trial is over I highly recommend it as worth while. If not, don't miss the digital version next time around.DON'T MISS THE LAST SOUND AFTER THE CREDITS.-F-",9,0,0,7 July 1999
