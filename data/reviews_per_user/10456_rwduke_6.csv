The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant and Scary...An Instant Horror Classic
",Blair Witch is an excellent and very original horror film. I have not felt this way about a horror movie since the first time that I saw Halloween. Blair is the type of horror movie that gets under your skin and stays with you days after the movie is over. I'm glad I don't live near the woods!,10,1,2,31 July 1999
Monster," Truly Outstanding. Can't Get This Movie Out Of My Head
",Monster has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. And Charlize Theron blew me away as the lead character. She was totally believable throughout the entire movie. This movie is riveting. It will hold your attention from beginning to end. I left this film feeling very sad that a person's life could be such hell and then to have it end by being put to death. This is a very honest film that such shows the ugly side of humanity in so many ways. This movie will stick in my head for a long time to come. It is truly outstanding.Charlize Theron deserves every accolade for her wonderful performance in this film. And Christina Ricci was no slouch. I thought they were both so real they popped off the screen. I felt like I was right there experiencing everything with them.,10,1,1,12 March 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Very Cool Movie
","This was a very cool movie. The colors were really interesting, each house being a different solid color. Each car being a different solid color but not matching the house color of it's owner.I really cared about Edward. This movie highlights how stupid the average Joe is and how ignorant they are to people that are different. I found myself getting angry at the residents of this town. This is an accurate depiction of the ignorance of people.",7,0,0,10 July 2002
Mystic River," Outstanding
",This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is one of those movies that stick in your head and you have to talk about it. Sean Penn should get a best actor award for this movie. His performance is incredible. The best ever. Tim Robbins was also exceptional. This movie is a must see.,10,1,2,2 November 2003
Army of Darkness," A Movie For 5-Year-Olds
","This movie is so bad there is very little to say. This movie should not even be rented unless you're soused out of your mind! Army of Darkness should not be billed as a horror movie at all, it should be in the 'mindless' section.",1,14,36,8 August 1999
Halloween," Simply The Best Horror Movie Of All-Time
","Halloween is a movie that I have never forgot. Back in 1978 when I first saw this movie at the theater I was terrified. I had a paper route and I made sure to get it done before dark every day! Halloween is a class act compared to modern day horror movies like Scream. Halloween is not a gore-fest, it is a suspenseful and truly scary movie that uses masterful film-making to haunt you forever. I have yet to see a horror movie that could compare to this movie. Today's horror movies are more comedy mixed with gore which is a stupid combination. Halloween is serious about scaring you and making you believe in what you are seeing. This movie is a perfect 10!",10,0,1,6 August 1999
