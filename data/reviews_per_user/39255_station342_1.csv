The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," booo twilight
","As sat and watched Breaking Dawn part 1, I came to the realization that I'm watching poop in film form. If they were to make a movie about human fesses it would be called the Twilight saga. How is it possible that is horrible films are so profitable? Did the writer sell her soul? I mean I just can't explain it. They are by far the worst series of film I've bare witness to. What has happened to our youth, why are they so dumb now. Could it be global warming? In one scene the wolf boy falls in love with a new born cg baby. Yes in love ready to marry the baby. Hell has a special place for all who took part in the Twilight saga.",1,9,12,6 December 2011
