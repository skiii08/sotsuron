The Avengers," A $250 million dollar wrestling match!
","This is a good movie, not great, not awesome! Which is a shame because the first 30 minutes are fantastic. Edgy, good jokes. I love the way they bring the team together.This movie is Black Widow's. She's the best written character and has the best scenes.My issue with the movie is how safe it gets. After such a great setup the movie goes flat and goes into safe blockbuster happy meal territory. Explosions and giant aliens and no one seems to get killed.Same issues with HULK. Great setup, Mark does a great job of playing Bruce Banner. Outside of the first five seconds of the transformation scene we get lame looking CGI Hulk. That moves with the reality of a 50's Warner Bros cartoon! I wanted to see Thor and Captain America and Iron Man really kick some major hind in this movie.They don't! A good movie yet the worst of the Marvel produced films! Once was enough.",6,22,76,24 April 2012
Iron Man 2," Is it as good as Iron Man?
",To give a quick answer. No!The film starts off way too cocky. Tony Stark is a smart ass. He's up himself. He's giving attitude at a senate committee. Then he's off to Monaco.The film for me gets cooking after about twenty minutes. There are a lot of good things about Iron Man 2. There is just some stuff in there that doesn't go over to well.The good. War Machine. I just wish Terence Howard was back. Mickey Rourke - underplayed and great accent. The finale - great action.The not so good. A stressed Pepper Potts. Tony Stark - not as engaging. Too little of Iron Man kicking A$$ The Easter egg at the end of the credits being nowhere as good as the original Iron man. Only two AC/DC songs used in the film.,7,3,12,29 April 2010
The Expendables," Amazing
","Hi.While Sylvester Stallone had his career downturn in the late 90's and 2000's he must have been watching a lot of wrestling because his film borrows a lot of their strategy. Stallone has aimed his film for every Southern American male under thirty to go and see it.The good guys have feelings and regrets over their kills while the bad guys are unapologetic and channel eighties wall street corporate greed.I am still coming down from the intense gun fire and explosions.My ears are still ringing from the sound of the automatic shotgun causing mayhem.The one on one fights are the best seen in film since Rocky IV. No boring special effects heavy fights in this film.Dolph Lundgren ( The Nordic Frankenstein) picks up Jet Li over his head and smashes him into an overhead walkway.Stone Cold Steve Austin puts Stallone in a headlock and gives him an elbow to the back that would bring down a biblical city wall.I have to give credibility to Jet Li. It was obviously him who had to be the team player in the this film because he takes a physical pounding.I saw two people walk out of this film. I was shocked. The ninety percent of people who stayed cheered like a Parramatta fan winning a football game.I haven't heard cheering in a cinema for years.The soundtrack goes straight to the heart of the NASCAR racing crowd. Georgia Satellites, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Guitar Hero classic Mississippi Queen by Mountain.Stallone is now in his early sixties, when he runs he's so creaky and stiff that he's a shoe in for the role of the tin man in any future Wizard of Oz adaption.Stallone has mellowed. While in the eighties he took out a whole battalion personally, now it's Stallone and five others that take out a battalion.",8,2,9,25 August 2010
Watchmen," Disappointed yet not gutted
","I have a lot of issues with this film. Very wooden acting. Very bland, cardboard film. I have read the graphic novel. I regard the comic as the greatest comic ever written. I don't think in this medium Watchmen can be topped.The film just leaves a lot to be desired. It should have been left alone. Yet that is waving a red flag to a film maker. Saying to them that is unfilmable.So now we have a Watchmen film.Boring, bad action. Too much slo mo. Unnecessarily gory. Slo mo of bullets smashing through legs. That type of thing.I rate Zack Snyder. I don't rate this film. 4/10. This movie has no feeling to it. It's just bland.",4,10,23,5 March 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A crushing disappointment
","How much internet/film critic buzz was on this film? Heaps! I was really looking forward to this. I like M.Cera. I like Edgar Wright's films. For me this movie sucked.Loud, constant phone ringing. Shot for a ten year old with ADD. Always something going on on screen very distracting. Basic film plot. Not funny.I won't be watching this again.The movie is well cast. One or two songs in the soundtrack do work well. The fight scenes are just standard. One or two jokes are amusing. That's it. It should of stayed an indie comic.",2,24,51,19 August 2010
Kick-Ass," Gretest soundtrack since Top Gun
","I just got back from seeing KICK ASS.One thing i have to get out of the way. KICK ASS has the best soundtrack since Top Gun. Fantastic use of music. You will never see an Elvis track used better.It used drum and bass, Ennio Morricone, Glam Rock etc.Kick Ass is so well directed. There are a lot of nods to the Dark Knight and Miami Vice.The casting is spot on.This director should be signed up for the AVENGERS.The lead actor. Aaron Johnson. Would make a great Peter Parker/Spiderman.Hit Girl is the greatest comic book FILM sidekick i've seen in.It's not a comedy, while there are still laughs. It's a comic book film. Over the top - doesn't take itself too seriously, yet handled with a lot of respect.I really had a good time seeing this.",7,3,12,9 April 2010
Transformers," Blockbuster Garbage
",I like Hollywood movies. Yet this is the worst film I have seen since Assassins with Sly Stallone. Absolute Garbage. Action scenes are these shaky camera bits where you don't have a clue with what's going on. Script - Rubbish. Optimus Prime saying 'My Bad '. They try to do this evil voice for Megatron. You can't understand what he is saying. I almost walked out of this movie. The acting is very bad. Shia - tipped to be the next big thing in Hollywood - terrible. The Sector Seven guy trying to knock off Al Pacino - terrible.I thought this movie would be Michael Bay proof. I was terribly wrong. I will never ever see another Michael Bay movie for the rest of my life.The lines in this movie are so corny I laughed.Now I like Transformers. This movie is woeful.,2,4,9,14 July 2007
Avatar," Effects great - Story - ho hum.
","When James Cameron gets the synergy right between special effects and story his films make billions.With AVATAR he has the special effects at such an amazing level it's like the difference between colour and black and white.The story though is what lets down AVATAR.The moon Pandora has an amazing biodiversity. The creatures, the plants, the fluroscent colours that appear in it's nature.The 3D has such fantastic depth you are looking one hundred feet down a waterfall.The movie does play as a nature documentary of Pandora.If you are expecting a movie that is full of action. AVATAR is not an action film. Outside of twenty minutes at the end. Very little action.The characters - forgettable.The wildlife and fauna - memorable.The best movie i saw this year was Star Trek. AVATAR is not better than Star Trek.How will go go at the box office? It will go okay - it will make a small profit. It won't do Titanic business.Where does this rate with James Camerons' previous films.1. Titanic. 2. Aliens. 3. Terminator 2 4. Terminator. 5. AVATAR. 6. True Lies<ul><li>---------------------------------------------------------------------</li></ul>",5,15,34,17 December 2009
Thor," By hammer of the Gods I declare THOR awesome!
","Coming into this movie and seeing the previews. I thought this movie would be comic book movie 101.This is a lot better than that.Superb casting, directing, costumes and sets.This movie is a fantasy and comic book film rolled into one.Think MARVEL meeting up with a LORD OF THE RINGS type fantasy film.It's a great story, there is a splattering of well timed humor. The support acting is great.I couldn't think of a better way to kick off the THOR films than with this one.Please get everyone involved with this back again.And remember stay to the end credit scenes.The CGI is fantastic and not over used. They've used miniatures to.Great work team MARVEL.",8,9,18,22 April 2011
Dark Shadows," I love Dark Shadows
",I saw the film after it's been ripped apart by the internet crowd and film critics.What's everyone's problem? Johnny Depp is charming and does such a good job in this role.It's got ghosts and vampires and a fantastic soundtrack.I'm still blown away my the opening sequence done to the Moody Blues classic Nights in White Satin.I love the look and the vibe of this movie. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's not meant to be a hard boiled horror movie.Relax and have some fun!,8,4,10,15 May 2012
