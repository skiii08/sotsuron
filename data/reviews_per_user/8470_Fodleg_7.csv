Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Was this supposed to be a comedy?
","Please tell me this was supposed to be a comedy and not another Tarrantino 'homage' to crap films of the seventies.. The old Chinese master was clearly a young Asian with dark hair poorly covered up with cheap, halloween store, pure white hair. I kept waiting for him to yank it off as it was so obvious. And all the ripping off of films that were crappy in the first place was over the top. Hey Mr. Tarrantino: you used these with some effect in Pulp Fiction, here you are simply relying on them and it shows A LOT. Don't get me started on the dialog, OMG how lame. Was Carradine's character supposed to be uber cool or just a moron with long, trying to be sophisticated, lines of junk dialog? HACK, cough, HACK. Bloody terrible.",Null,1,3,13 September 2004
Closer," Pretentious waste of time
","This movie was such an obvious attempt to try and be a dramatic, heart-wrenching, tale of the human soul.. but it just found itself a pile of pretentious humility. I think what this film could have been with the actors, budget etc..Personally I don't care about the sexual content, I don't believe in censorship, my beef with the film is that it's characters invoke no empathy for the viewer.Do I care about these people? NO. Do I care about this story? NO. Was this film a waste of four extraordinary actors? YES. The only thing I will ever remember about 'Closer' is how many times I looked at the clock to see how 'Closer' the ending was..",3,2,4,20 January 2005
Collateral," Mann still suffers from 'happy ending' syndrome
","Great film just like Heat, lame ending. Mr. Mann if you truly know LA how about a realistic ending where the bad guy doesn't die and the good guy get the girl.. What a let down. I disliked Pacino taking out De Niro (and then resolving his impending divorce at the very end)and I dislike the unbelievable demise of Vincent by Max(and Max going of into the sunrise with a beautiful attorney..) LAME.",Null,0,0,1 September 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Donnie Darko rip-off
","The director of The Butterfly Effect must have watched Donnie Darko one too many times. The alternate reality, if certain decisions dictate a happier future, was Richard Kelly's beautiful creation with Darko.This film ripped the idea and cast a pretty boy to make a quick buck. Shame on these filmmakers. To anyone who has seen this film and not DD, please go watch it and you'll understand what I mean.",Null,3,6,7 July 2004
Mulholland Drive," Yeah... Whatever
","I'll keep it short. The film was meaningless. There is no resolution. It didn't make me 'think' of anything other than the fact that I won't waste my time on another Lynch film. Those of you who praise the film.. I don't want to even guess what else is on your top 10 list. If you want to go the abstract route with a script check out Chris Nolan (Memento, Insomnia), or go catch Donnie Darko. These films are abstract WITH an actual resolution.Lynch could take notes..",Null,0,0,30 April 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This was a comedy, right?
","Umm.. was this supposed to be serious? This film was so full offiller filler filler filler filler filler filler cheese, I couldn't help but laugh all the way through it. Please tell me it was a comedy..",Null,1,2,15 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," An Over the Top Disappointment
","Unfortunately not many great films can be succeeded by sequels of equal stature. Some have, but most simply turn out to be Hollywood's answer to generating a big pile of money. Matrix Reloaded is no different. I wanted to be surprised and engaged by this film but all it really amounted to was a snazzy action flick (can there be too much action folks?) that attempts to wrap up neatly with a four minute explanation by 'the source' at the end. A very unengaged plot as far as what one may expect from the stellar script of the original. On it's own it is probably a competent action film, but it simply tries, but cannot reach the complexity and originality of the first. Example: In the original 'Deja-Vu is simply a glitch in the system' (very cool). Reloaded: 'people's stories of Vampires and Werewolves are computer programs that have gone bad'. Kinda lame. The character development was obviously not as important as the over-the-top freeway scene, and it shows. I thought the Wachowski bros. (sp?) had complete control of this project, but it has all the markings of a film that has been disciplined by greedy producers and studio heads. The only thing Re-loaded about this film is Keanu and companies bank accounts.",3,0,0,15 May 2003
