Gremlins," A deeply beloved all time favorite
","I remember the first time I ever saw this great film was at an old drive in theater in my area when I was very young and to this very day, it remains one of my favorite films of all time.  This movie was so very well written and acted and is a dynamic mix of horror and laughs.  This is one film that I could watch over and over again!",10,0,1,11 March 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Splendid all time classic
","I remember seeing this film twice during its original theatrical run in 1982 and even now, I am very happy to have had the opportunity to see it.  It's very easily one of the best films of all time and very well deserving of its status as a classic.  This film has awesome special effects and a very eloquently written story which has moments that are heart warming and some that are very cute.  I think it's very appropriate that this movie has received a 20th anniversary re release.  Very good for the whole family.",10,1,2,19 March 2002
Training Day," Awesome cop thriller
","I truly must say that this film is one of the most exciting action thrillers I've seen in quite some time.  It was so very well written, directed and acted and keeps a tight grip on your interest from beginning to end.  I think that Denzel Washington won a very well deserved Best Actor Oscar for his role as the villainous narcotics officer and Ethan Hawke did an equally splendid job as the rookie cop that works with him.  Watching this film is two hours very well spent.",Null,1,11,19 April 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Deeply beloved in every sense
",I truly must say that this is one of Disney's best animated films ever.  It has the awesome animation so typical of Disney and the story is so very deeply touching and heart warming.

Spice World," A fun and entertaining musical romp

This is one movie that I never get tired of watching and is most definitely an all time favorite on my list.,10,1,2,6 November 2002
Lilo & Stitch," One of the greatest animated films ever made
","I truly loved watching this film and found it to be very well worth my time. The animation is superb and the story is very funny and delightful.  It's also great to watch as the alien Stitch forms such a close relationship with the little girl Lilo and the way she teaches him to go from being a mean, nasty monster to acting more like a model citizen.  This one comes very highly recommended on my list.",10,0,1,6 December 2002

",I think that this film is very easily one of the greatest horror films ever made because there is much creepy fun and excitement to be had as you watch. The film is full of excellent performances by a cast who was given an excellent script to work with.  Linda Blair does an especially fine job as the girl possessed by the Devil.
