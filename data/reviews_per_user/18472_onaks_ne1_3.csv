Captain Phillips," Intense, thrilling film
","This is my first review here on IMDb and i will honestly say that I'm not that good in writing English. Director Paul Greengrass create again another thrilling film based on a true story. Before this, he made films like United 93 which is also intense and thrilling. Other projects of him is the Bourne series (excluding Bournce Legacy) which is indeed another action thriller movie with so many intense sceneIn this film he show us another great film based on a true story about the real life Captain Richard Phillips starring Tom Hanks. From start to finish the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Great cinematography, well written script and great cast especially those pirates. I've seen the film so many times and still not get me bored. Worth watching every minute of this film. Great acting by Tom Hanks and the pirates. Can't wait to see another Greengrass film based on a true story after this great movie.By the way, I just read some post about the way Greengrass shake his camera others don't like it because they feel dizzy but for me it's cool, feels like you're in the middle of something action sequence.Sorry for my English",10,0,1,13 November 2015
Bridge of Spies," Another Spielberg-Hanks epic drama film
","I've been a fan of this duo since Saving Private Ryan, Catvh Me if You Can and also The Terminal. Steven Spielberg always makes the audience keep on the edge of their seats. Like me while watching this i am really excited on what will gonna happen next. The movie is based on a real life lawyer James Donovan portrayed by Tom Hanks. As usual Tom Hanks gives another well acted performance just like in any other movies of him. Another actor that give great performance was Mark Rylance. I never heard of him only in this film and i am blown away with his portrayal of Rudolf Abel, his facial expression is great the acting of him really from the heart. The movies is more on drama but it's thrilling. Some may say it's boring because of the lack of action scene. This is a drama film not an action film but you can feel intense the way the connection of the characters and the story about it. Great acting, I love the cinematography, the atmospheric effect really feels like i was there on that certain period of time. Great directing by Steven Spielberg. Well written by the Coen brothers. I really love the way the movie was written there are some funny lines which i love the most. Like talking seriously and suddenly it changes from a little comedy. I will not spoil you about it. This film will be nominated in some Oscar awards and it is indeed well deserve for this film.",10,0,2,13 November 2015
Sully," Best of 2016 so Far
","I'm gonna go straight to the review without telling its plot. In this film.Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart performance were great. Clint Eastwood did a great job stretching the story from the Plane scene, court scene and Sully's little background story. I love the editing of the film and the screenplay. It's not a linear storytelling but it works well showing some flashbacks and visions. I like also how they add some humor in this film. Cinematography was good. I didn't experience it on IMAX because there's no IMAX theater nearby do i watch it on 2D they said that the plane scene was good in IMAX in 2D looks good. Overall it is a worth watching movie. If you love drama films you're gonna love this but if you love films with explosions and a non-stop action this film is not for you. It's about human, human who makes decisions. This films is not just about Sully but also the other people involved in the rescue in the Hudson River.Can't wait to watch it again in DVD or Blu-ray If you haven't seen it go watch it and you're gonna love it too. 9/10",10,3,7,8 September 2016
