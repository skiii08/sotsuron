The Finest Hours," An interesting story
","The Finest Hours recounts the story of four brave men, who against all odds, went out to sea to save the life of some good 30 others in the midst of a treacherous storm. Though the events are based on reality the plot feels heavily scripted and the characters blown out of proportion. This, however, does not by any means hurt the film. Truth be told nothing in this movie, apart from maybe the score, actually under performs enough to make the film bad or mediocre. The actors play their parts well, certain shots are quite interesting and the film has a certain visual charm once you get used to the rain and darkness. It's just that nothing is truly... great.The rescue of the survivors of the SS Pendleton is an interesting story and the movie is a nice homage to the heroes and their actions. That's what the film set out to be and that's what it is.",7,1,1,17 October 2017
Ocean's Eleven," Simple fun
","Ocean's Eleven features an all star cast pulling off a classic Las Vegas heist with a modern twist. The plot makes sense and the pacing moves the story along with ease, if not for the only flaw : a Hollywood attempt at integrating romance in a movie where none is needed. The Great actors bring their characters to life with energy and passion even though each protagonist is more clich√© than the last. If not for the ridiculously Sci-Fi looking 'blackout machine' the film manages to pull off a classy vibe in a very money and stripper themed decor. The music compliments each scene and correctly translates the emotion of the moment though it never really transcends to into anything greater.Time. Time was, and will be, this films greatest enemy. Some scenes drag out too long in the moment and as years pass new viewers will most likely not quite capture the importance of the originality of the twist. Ocean's Eleven, to be honest, seems quite basic. But it pulls off every aspect of cinematography as well as it needs to. Put simply, the movie is fun. It manages to surprise without unnecessary complication and can be re watched with ease.",7,1,2,11 April 2017
