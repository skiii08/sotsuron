The Ring," Scarred me for life
","Saw this as a kid and it scarred me for life. Couldn't sleep alone, scared of tv static, had nightmares. I love horror movies but I just can't watch this movie ever again. I'm still giving it a good rating cause it did what every horror movie should do and scared the crap outta me. The plot is also pretty good but I know my limit and this is it.",8,0,1,16 January 2020
