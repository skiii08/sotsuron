Your Name.," It was really great movie
","This movie got in my top chart favorite animeIt was really absolutely great! First movie than make me shouting in my head like 'COME ON!!' but its still good movie even i didn't understand the trailer obvious.I think you will like those melodic OSTs . If you guys aren't Japanese ,I recommended to watch this in Japanese with your language sub ---- (it probably not have another language voice i think) and it actually on currently modernity. It wasn't in Edo-jidai or Muromachi-jidai. I hopefully u'll love this like me . This guarantee if you like uhh... like a drama romance and little comedy it would be absolutely great movie.",10,4,8,18 September 2016
