Walk the Line," Outstanding Performance of Johnny Cash
","This performance could win Mr. Phoenix an Oscar for Best Actor. He has done an outstanding job of portraying Johnny Cash. His singing and the way Cash stood on the stage when performing couldn't have been better. And Reese, what a delight she was! She was bubbly, feisty, and her singing as June Carter- well who would have thought she could do that! One thing I learned is how far back Johnny and June goes. He first heard sing on the radio in 1944.It's too bad that Elvis wasn't around people who REALLY cared about him. Johnny Cash was very lucky from that standpoint. His life could ended very early on had it not been for June Carter and her family.Anyone who's a fan of Johnny Cash or country music will not be disappointed.",8,1,3,21 November 2005
