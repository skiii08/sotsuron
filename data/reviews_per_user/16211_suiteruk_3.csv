The Avengers," Absolute must watch
","This eagerly awaited epic blockbuster didn't disappoint in the slightest. The big budget $220m movie directed by the relatively inexperienced director Joss Whedon (Buffy the vampire slayer and Serenity) incorporates the personal motives of every character in fighting a war that can only be won by the super powers that be.The film oozes coolness and the futuristic technology with leave the viewer smiling and connecting with each character. The plot of the movie revolves very much around fantasy with aspects of sci-fi which works well to ensure the hero's really are up against a challenge. There were areas which could have been better explained with regard to the villainous characters and where the portal came from. However, with a running time of 144 minutes you can certainly understand why it wasn't. The movie is rated 12A as it should be with no real violent scenes or swearing and a lot more humorous that initially expected. A film made for an extremely diverse audience families, groups of friends, Marvel readers and even couples. Good acting, good effects, good soundtrack, great film!",9,2,6,1 May 2012
21 Jump Street," Hilarious
","If you like Superbad, The Sitter, Knocked up, anchorman or any other type of easy to follow comedy then this really is for you. Jonah Hill (Superbad and Moneyball) and Channing Tatum (Step up) are a perfect match and compliment each other really well. Laughing scenes throughout the film make the 109 minute movie easily bearable. Some good cameo roles keeps the viewer on their feet and shows off just how versatile some actors are. Good plot and easy to tell story, far funnier than I thought it would be and great acting duo between Hill and Tatum. I think the 15 rating is right as there are references to drugs and swearing but ultimately anyone between 16-25 is going to enjoy this film.",8,8,16,1 May 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," A fresh take on horror
","Horror films today have been very predictable and and often a little too concentrated on making people jump than having a unique storyline. Paranormal activity 1,2 and 3 are all the same with exception of a different house, scream is a bunch of bad acting teenagers running away from a man in a black bed sheet not to mention the upcoming far fetched film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the man abolished slavery not hunt vampires. The Cabin in The Woods however, takes the typical scary horror of high school kids being attacked in the woods and adds to it a technological aspect. This is in fact Drew Goddard's (Writter of Lost and Cloverfield)first ever directed film and I for one really enjoyed it.The outcome and reasoning of what happens in the end doesn't make much sense and could have been far better written. It feels like its quickly been finished. A clever horror will leave the viewer thinking it may happen to them but cabin in the woods is too out there to believe.Overall a great film, something you can watch and really not know what will happen next.",8,2,9,1 May 2012
