Requiem for a Dream," Suicidal
","Well, I´ve seen 'Pi' and was fascinated. Now, there´s 'Requiem for a dream' and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a 'bigger' movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: 'RFAD' is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in 'Dancer in the dark'. Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in 'Pi' and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",9,264,341,25 July 2001
Donnie Darko," Lost Highway meets Jacob´s Ladder meets Breakfast Club
","A wonderful, complex movie about a boy who gets depressed by the hipocrisy in everyday-life. In his loneliness he creates himself a friend, who foresees the future. While Donnie Darko tries to find out what these prophecies are all about, he learns about love, life and... time-travelling. 'Donnie Darko' is a very complex movie, which not only deals with social and psychological issues, but also touches on philosophical questions. Many movies have failed in trying to deal with such 'heavy' topics, but 'Donnie Darko' succeeds in every one of them. Instead of creating a non-consistent patchwork, the great thing about 'Donnie Darko' is, that it melts all these different plots into one homogenic movie. The story keeps you glued to the screen, guessing where it will go next. But those of you who expect a straight suspense-movie, watch out: It will take some concentration and maybe some time until all the pieces come together. But if you´ve solved the puzzle, you´ll find that 'Donnie Darko' is a very rewarding movie, which you will want to see again and again.",8,1,2,9 August 2001
