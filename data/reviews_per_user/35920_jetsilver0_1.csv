Skyfall," So disappointing
",Felt compelled to sign up and write this like others as this movie just does not do what it says on the tin. All the critics reviews pointed to this film being fantastic the best Bond ever.Well its not ! Far from it i don't know if other movie watchers are saying its good because the critics say its wonderful so it must be good isn't it ? This is not a Bond movie its not even a good action/drama movie.I've heard the reviews for Taken 2 it sounds awful but i think i might go and see it the critics have got this so wrong. Skyfall has a poor script and plot that is sidelined half way through the film.No gadgets no bond girls no exotic locations the whole film looked like it was shot in SD quality it was so grey and murky. This was the first Bond movie I've seen at the Cinema since Thunderball (yes that years ago) i usually watch movies on DVD/bluray but felt because of all the hype that Skyfall would be worth going to see. Well its not save your money and wait till its on TV at least you can record it and FF the boring parts.,1,68,129,4 November 2012
