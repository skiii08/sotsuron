Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An absolute travesty
","This film was eagerly awaited by millions of people who have been brought up on Star Wars across the world, and I'm afraid to say that a vast majority of these people have been sadly let down.It is plainly obvious from this film that George Lucas is not a director but can now and then have a good idea. He manages to extract the poorest performances from a pretty renowned set of actors (which I suppose is a difficult task in itself) and relies far to heavily on the special effects to carry the film.The film does not warrant any lengthy explanation of why it is so bad as it is plain to see for anyone who has actually had the mis-pleasure of sitting through it.All I can say is for gods sake don't let Lucas near the final film in the series!",1,1,3,25 February 2004
