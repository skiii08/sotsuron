The Blair Witch Project," What future horror films should follow
","I had been waiting over a month before finally seeing this master piece. TBWP is by far the creepiest, most frightening film to come out in a real long time. Those that didn't appreciate this truly great film are either lacking in imagination, or too young to remember classic horror films like The Shining. This film isn't like Scream, which makes you jump a number of times throughout the movie. No, this is much more. The unique camera views make you feel like you are there with them. Rather than use fake looking monsters, the film makers force the audience to use their imagination. Assuming you have one, the worst possible images will invade your mind. The simple sounds are so effective because the feeling of being in the woods at night is freaky alone. When the film was over, my original reaction was that it lacked some truly frightening effects. However, as my girlfriend and I talked about the film, I continued to relive the experience, each time creating a more terrifying image to go with the experience. I am still reliving the final scene, constantly inventing new ideas about what happened. I now see that this is the scariest movie I've seen, because I can't get it out of my head.",8,1,1,2 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The funniest movie to come out in years!
","If you're looking for a movie full of surprises, but still knocks you out of your chair, then go see South Park. I made the mistake of trying to eat popcorn during the movie, and paid the price. Save your money when it comes to food, because you will be laughing the entire time.Those that are regular South Park viewers will be shocked when the movie begins. Once you realize that nothing will be censored, it dawns on you that this will be one hilarious film. You can almost view this as a musical, because Parker and Stone have many different characters singing songs, including Terrance and Philip!Finally, make sure you stay until the very end of the movie, including the credits. There is a little surprise at the very end of the movie, and only a few of us stayed throughout to see it. Enjoy!",10,0,0,26 July 1999
