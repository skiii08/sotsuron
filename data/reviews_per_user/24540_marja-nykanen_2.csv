The Ring," One of the best horror movies I have ever seen....
","I was so freaked out after watching this movie that I couldn't sleep for a month. There was tension in the film from start to finish with only a two minute bit of comic relief and then right back into it. I liked the story line and how they wrap it all together. I really liked the ending. It wasn't what I was expecting, I don't think anyone was expecting that, so it just made the movie that much greater. It doesn't have (and doesn't need) the gore of most horror movies these days. It is all in the mind. And let me tell you- some of the images they show you in the film are so disturbing that they stick with you for a very long time. Like I said, I couldn't sleep for a month after seeing this movie in theaters. Some people may laugh at me for that and say, 'It's just a movie!' You think I don't know that?! Even still, those images haunted my dreams and stuck with me for a long time. In my mind- that makes a really great horror film, when it sticks with you and you just can't shake it off or forget it. And I will never forget The Ring. 10/10",10,1,1,3 July 2013
Sinister," A good movie if you aren't hung up on the details.
","So yes, makeup could have been better, but who cares? It had me feeling that tightness in my chest and my heart picking up the pace that I love about horror movies. It has some really good scares in it, and I loved the ending! So many people found in lacking and I'm not sure why. The films were freaky and during some scenes of the movie I was holding my breath. And, OK, yes, there were a few scares that you could see coming thanks to the trailers, but overall it left me feeling unsettled and at times uncomfortable. A horror film isn't doing its job if you are relaxed and enjoying. The suspense lasted throughout the whole film. For the hardcore horror fans whom need everything to be plausible and realistic- not the film for you. But if you enjoy creepy films and tense scenes, you may enjoy this movie. Overall I thought it was good. Not the best horror movie ever, but good for what it claims to be.",7,1,2,2 July 2013
