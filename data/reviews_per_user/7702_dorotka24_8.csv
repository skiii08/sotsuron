The New World," For film aficionados only
","I sat through 'Thin Red Line' and couldn't wait to get out of the theater and get on with my day. In fact, it is one of the few films I've seen in which I had a nearly irresistible urge to walk out on. I saw 'New World' at Family Video in the 2 for $1 section, and being a lover of historical drama, wanted to give it a shot. I failed to notice, however, that it was directed by Terrence Malick, which is unfortunate since it would have remained on the shelf had I realized.The film is, like Thin Red Line, high art and light substance. It is dreamy, trippy, and filled to overflowing with the internal monologue of the main character. Now that's not in itself a bad situation. However, when the character has almost nothing poignant or interesting to comment on and his delivery is a droning monotone, then the film rapidly becomes a bore.But that, in my opinion is not even the biggest flaw in the movie. The thing that baffles me is why Malick would choose as a backdrop such moments in history as World War II and the English colonization of North America. I suppose that's the point - taking existentialism quite deliberately in contrasting the internal solitude of one man with the terrifying realism of his external environment in very trying times. Still, it seems the same point could have been made in his own home with no name actors instead of in a different time period with A list actors and all the costumes, props, and other challenges involved.I always try to look for some good even in movies I dislike. I can say that the scenery was very beautiful and the time period otherwise seemed well represented with seemingly authentic costumes for both natives and colonists alike. And it did make me think a bit to compile this review. I've read many of the glowing reviews and can appreciate some of the points made.But in the end, I was so bored and otherwise unstimulated that I couldn't finish the movie. I cannot recommend it, and will never see another Malick film again.",3,3,5,6 November 2007
Forrest Gump," Fascinating story from beginning to end
","Forrest Gump is a film that I could watch over and over again and still be moved, entertained, and inspired. It is the story of a simple man that inexplicably becomes embroiled in extraordinary events. It is a tale of remarkable coincidences and great emotional loss.Hanks is at his cinematic best here, creating a highly believable character that one cannot help but love, despite his flaws. And how about the supporting actors! Gary Sinise is brilliant as the often reluctant friend to Gump. Robin Wright perfectly captures the love interest that is a close yet very different person than Gump. Sally Field is likable and endearing as the mother with boundless love for her only child.The story is never boring, with events flowing seamlessly. There is a story telling angle here with a narrative overlay is unique and serves to accentuate major plot points. Most characters are recurring parts of Gump's life, and they come and go throughout the film.Perhaps the most inspirational part of the film is the character of Gump himself. Although simple, he has an astounding realization of right and wrong, yet remains non-judgemental to those around him. He suffers great emotional loss at several points throughout the film, yet remains strong and carries on because he knows that he still has obligations and that there are others whom might depend upon him in some way.I have few criticisms about the movie. There were a few times where Hanks slipped out of character a bit and reminded me more of his typical comedic personality, but they were few and far between. I'm striving to think of more, but I just can't come up with any.Forrest Gump truly is an inspiring, heartwarming story that will undoubteldy stand the test of time. It has a wide appeal, but this is well deserved. Enjoy with my recommendations.",9,1,3,2 April 2008
The Patriot," It's a movie, not a history lesson
","I will never cease to be amazed by the criticisms leveled at films for their historical inaccuracy. To this I have two suggestions: go read a history book on the time and place depicted in a film or sign up for a history class! I love history, but have never watched movies to get a history lesson.Movies exist for one reason and one reason only - to entertain. In this regard, The Patriot does a fine job. The acting is excellent, and all the characters were well cast. The pacing was good, and I was never bored. The battle scenes were exceptionally brutal, which must be typical of combat situations throughout the ages. Most war films depicting the American Revolution are fairly sanitized or rely upon drama and acting to carry the story. Not so with Patriot - I'm surprised they didn't try to depict the carnage that undoubtedly resulted from firing grapeshot or cannister shot.Although realism is not typically a word I would choose for any film, I felt that the depiction of combat here was probably much more realistic than most such movies. Many history books will try to teach us that warfare in the 18th century was a bit of a 'gentleman's' competition of sorts, where quarter was given if asked, and honor was observed in such matters as the beginning and end of conflict, prisoner exchanges, and the like. This may have sometimes been the case between fully professional forces like those of England and France, but such countries seem to have held a different opinion entirely of rebel forces. These were apparently regarded not only with disdain, but outright contempt. Afterall, those guilty of treason have traditionally been treated much more harshly than other enemies.Patriot seems to take this probability and run with it. The colonists who fought against England in the American Revolution were regarded as traitors, and were likely treated very harshly if captured or engaged in battle. The British in general were portrayed as pompous and at times villainous, but this is certainly not out of line for the way they undoubtedly felt about the rebels. Concurrently, I'm certain that the colonists who took part in the rebellion had a great deal of contempt for the British as well, but particularly for the Loyalists, or those colonists who remained loyal to and fought for Great Britain. My criticisms revolve around the flow of the movie. There are many, many tragic scenes that were obviously a plot device to hammer home the horrors of war. I felt that one or two would have sufficed to make such a point, but instead we receive multiple such scenes. Some chopping would have definitely been appreciated.Overall, Patriot is an intense, interesting take on a theater of the American Revolution that is not often depicted in film. I would recommend it to those who appreciate the genre of historical drama.",7,2,4,5 February 2008
Aliens," Best of Sci-Fi Action
","Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a man's movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them, and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films, but provides enough here to satisfy.The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that, even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines, not all of them were completely gung-ho about their adventures. In fact, a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat - something I'm certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved, the stakes were very high. When they start dropping, we feel the loss.Movies like this just don't come around very often. The pacing is very tight, even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough - when the action hits, it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself.",10,31,41,14 January 2008
The Princess Bride," All time classic
","Among my favorite movies. This has it all - action, romance, and comedy rolled into one masterfully woven package. All of the performances are exceptional and this certainly ranks among the few movies in the last 30 years that is perfectly cast. It has the feel of a spoof, which is no surprise with Rob Reiner at the helm. Yet at the same time it is very genuine and sincere.No other picture for me has such a plethora of infinitely quotable lines, and I still use many of them to this day. They always bring a smile to my face. I don't have anything negative to say about the Princess Bride - it has a wide appeal and with good reason. Enjoy with my warmest recommendations.",10,1,2,25 October 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Bleak, horrific, magnificent
","There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like 'Patton,' 'The Longest Day,' 'Midway,' and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience.",10,4,7,20 November 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very silly yet brilliant
","Like so many pleasures in life, the typical Monty Python fare is a bit of an acquired taste. Their comedy series, 'Flying Circus,' had many funny moments, but I would estimate that 70% of it was just very silly stuff that was so outlandish and off the wall that it didn't have much of a wide appeal.Holy Grail had more than its share of silliness as well, but it seemed that the troupe really had outdone themselves here with clever and original material. Some of the bits were so outrageously funny that I must have nearly split my sides laughing at the first viewing with a few friends. And they hurt afterwards as well, so I was apparently not the only one who loved this type of humor.In typical Pythonesque fashion, much of the humor here is black comedy, with bits of gore sprinkled throughout. There was no swearing or nudity that I recall, which is odd for a comedy, instead there was a great deal of violence. It's almost a bit of a satire on the tendency for media outlets to be bastardized for nudity or sexuality, while extreme violence is often viewed as fine for all audiences.What it really amounted to was the Pythons making light of the oft untouchable British legend of the immortal King Arthur. There are so many quotable lines and bits of clever dialog that I could probably see the movie a hundred more times and still be heartily amused. This is a true comedy classic and should not be missed.",10,6,11,1 February 2008
Braveheart," May always be my favorite
","I cannot provide an unbiased opinion of this movie, since for over ten years it has been, and perhaps always will be, my favorite. Why? After all, it's almost completely historically inaccurate, and I am a great lover of history. It's incredibly brutal and violent, and I prefer peaceable means to settle arguments in my life. It's not even filmed in Scotland, but in Ireland.Despite all these flaws, it is after all a movie, and in this it gets almost everything else right. It has passionate romance tempered by passionate violence. It explores the qualities of honor, kinship, and loyalty, tempered with the all too common human traits of deception, greed, and betrayal. Vengeance is also a centerpiece here.Aesthetically speaking, the film is positively gorgeous to behold. There are grand, sweeping panoramas. The sights, sounds, and even smells of medieval life are brought to the screen, as imagined by its creators. The battle scenes are epic and intense, yet time is also spent on the aftermath, and the often terrible pain and loss of life. In short, the movie is an experience, and a fantastic one at that.My criticisms are almost completely overshadowed by the overall effect of the film. See it for yourself, then if your interest in the life of William Wallce is piqued, you can learn more about him from a few books and other scant references.",10,3,7,26 October 2007
