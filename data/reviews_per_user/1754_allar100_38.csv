Vertigo," Hitchcock proves beyond a doubt that he is a master
","What can I say.  Hitchcock is indeed a master.  No wonder everybody studies and imitates him.  He can build suspense, make you question at all times what is going on, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  This is a great film that any self respecting film buff would have seen by now, and any self respecting movie goer should see.  All of the acting is top notch, the visuals, and the pacing of the film is just fantastic.  A must see. 10/10***FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM ONLY**** Do you think that this is all a dream that happens in Jimmy Stewart head while he is hanging on the edge of the building at the beginning.  If you watch the film, there are just a whole lot of dreamlike elements to the film that just make me question if this is all happening in his head, right down to the very ambiguous ending.",Null,3,5,28 February 2003
Scarface," Excellent Pacino
","This in my opinion, is Pacino's best role.  He looked, sounded, and acted the part with an incredible amount of intensity without overacting.  A great script by Oliver Stone, I'm just a little curious as to why he let Brian DePalma have it.  DePalma does a great job with the direction.  The set design was top notch, cinematography was excellent, and the music, which should have bothered me because it was that hokey 80's movie stuff, just seem to fit.  Highly reccomended. 9/10",9,0,1,5 April 2003
Alien 3," worst of the series
","This is by far, the worst of the Alien series.  The idea is kinda neat, but the execution was just really bad.  There is no suspense, no terror, and I really did not care if Ripley made it through this one or not.  The most disapointing thing to me is that they never explored the mutation, if that was what it was of the Alien in the prison, what was different about it. The only reason to see this is so that you can go on to the final installment of the Alien series.",5,397,416,11 July 2003
Miracle," Excellent Kurt
","Kurt is the heart and soul of this movie.  His performance as is one of the best out of him that I have seen in a long time.  When you go to this movie, you know that you are going to be getting a U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A movie, but it really just makes you feel good, not cheap or cheesy.  I personally enjoyed it, and if you remotely like hockey, then I would say its for you.",9,1,1,21 February 2004
Finding Neverland," Amazing and sad at the same time.
","There are some movies that inspire me, give me hope, and make my soul ache like no other. This is one of them. The film all around amazing. All of the acting is wonderful. The sound, design, and cinematography is amazing. However, the true star is the story. While it might not be exactly true, I really don't think that it matters to much. From watching the film I feel as though it was written with nothing but emotion. It is in every word, it is in every set piece, and it is all simply amazing. Just don't watch this film expecting happiness. While there is that, this is more about pain, imagination, and deep sadness. Again, it was one of the most amazing movies that I have ever seen, but I think that it will be a very long time before I ever see it again.",10,1,2,1 December 2004
The Big Lebowski," My fave from the Coen bros
","This is my personal favorite from the Coen brothers.  This film is absolutely nuts,  John Goodman character is soo extream that your jaw just drops whenever he shows up.  Every one of Steve Buscemi's lines steal the scene that he is in.  This film has dream sequences, people p***ing on rugs, and a guy who has been dubbed 'The Dude.'  What more do you from a film?? 10/10",10,0,1,28 February 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," fun stuff.
","Johnny Depp is a good actor, has always been a good actor, and will always be a good actor.  With that said, Geoffrey Rush also did a fine job as the leader of the cursed pirates.  While it is fun and good, it isn't perfect. It is a little tame for a pirate movie, but that is to be expected from Disney.  Anyway, fun stuff all the way through, that doesn't have you checking your watch.  It didn't feel like 2 and 1/2 hours. 7.5/10",7,0,1,13 July 2003
Ed Wood," Burton's work of love
","Depp continues to prove that he is one of the best, and most underrated actors in the biz and ever for that matter.  Tim Burton was the perfect person to direct a biopic about such a wierd and cultish director and coaxes the best only best performances out of his actors in this fine piece of work.  Depp plays the part with just the right amount enthusiasim and energy.  And Landau as Legousi, while not a physical match (who is)is excellent as the ageing junkie who had no respect for Boris Karloff.  A must see for Burton, Depp, and even Ed Wood fans. 10/10",10,0,0,28 February 2003
X-Men," Singer delivers
","While this movie isn't anywhere near faithful to the comic book, it delivers, and keep the spirit of the comic book in mind.  And that is what truely matters.  There is no way on earth that someone can translate the comic book over exactly without alienating large parts of the masses, or making a completly stupid looking movie, see some of the 80's marvel movies if you have your doubts.  I assure you, those will be hours of your life you will never get back.  Good job Singer, keep up the good work, you have my full confidence that you will deliver on X 2.",8,0,0,2 March 2003
Snatch," Ritchie has much more talent than Tarantino
","Guy Ritchie's films are (with the exception of Swept Away, I will blame that on Madonna) way better than Tarantino's.  I know a lot of you are going to freak out at this, but let me explain.  Guy Ritchie is actually original!!! Tarantino, while he is talented, and I love his films, don't get me wrong, he is really just a clever knock off artist.  He 'steals' his plots, gimmicks, and even whole scenes from other movies.  Look at Reservior Dogs, then watch City of Fire, and try to tell me Tarantino didn't steal the storyline.  If you ask me, Tarantino's true talent lies in his sharp, original, and whimsical dialogue.  Anyway, this film is original, funny, has dead on acting, and is bound to be a copied for years to come.  Keep up the good work Guy.  10/10",Null,0,1,28 February 2003
Léon: The Professional," By far, Besson's best
","If you haven't seen this, you should.  This is by far Luc Besson's best film, I don't know what the hell he is thinking now, he just seem to write stupid action crap.  Anyway, Gary Oldman is in top form (when is he not) as the corrupt cop, and Jean Reno is very likeable for a hitman.  The story is wonderful and the characters are well developed.  Don't be fooled while this movie does have some awesome action scenes, IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!! This is more of a drama with action thrown in because of who the characters are.  10/10",10,0,1,28 February 2003
The Italian Job," lots of fun
","I thought that this movie was lots of fun.  Some pretty decent acting from all of the players in the film, and the direction was a huge improvement from his last piece of work A Man Apart.  This is not a great movie, but it is good, and it is entertaining.  There are some good laughs, and it is generally a fun movie.  Works as a good date movie because of it softer crime nature.  You could do a lot worse, but this is by no means a must see.",8,0,0,15 June 2003
The Thing," By far Carpenter's best
","I would have to say that I do generally like John Carpenter's films, and I feel that when he has a good script to work with, he can make an intense movie.  This is by far my favorite of his.  Usually a film like this becomes very dated very fast.  And I'm talking about special effects, sound, visuals, the works.  This one though is differant for me.  The special effects are some of the best makeup effects (which I prefer to CG) I've ever seen, and the visuals are beautiful and bleak.  The only real thing that seems to date this film is the clothing and the shots of the 'high tech' electronics.  If you can get past these minor things, you will find that this is a gem of a film.  The story is intense, the acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction are good, and the score, a staple of every John Carpenter film, is as haunting as ever.  It's a shame that more people don't recognize this movie for the wonderful film that it is, and in my opinion, on of the best in it's catagories.",8,1,2,5 April 2003
Armageddon," Michael Bay ruins yet another film
","Michael Bay is not a good director.  He can't keep any of his films from going overbudget, uses WAY too much color when he does not need it among many other things.  He also seems like more of a director of explosions, than actors.  The story is there, but like every action movie it gets ruined with some cheesy love story.  The scene where Ben Affleck plays with the animal crackers is retarded.  My friend thinks that Ben Affleck is the hottest guy EVER!!! So I had to give this movie a 7/10, and not the 5 or 6 that I wanted to.",7,0,1,27 February 2003
North by Northwest," It's Hitch and Grant
","It's a Hitch film with Grant in it.  What more can you ask for?  How about a crop duster chasing Grant?  Okay, you got it.  Hitch's trademark blonde? Okay, you got it.  Hitch's perfect direction?  Done.  A score by Bernard Herrmann?  How about an excellent story, and perfect pacing?  You can have that too.  Top quality, should be on all to see lists.",10,0,0,9 May 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," inferior
","This was a sad sad attempt to make a another installment to some pretty great films.  First off, they try to add too much comedy to the movie making it a times just plain stupid.  The T-X is great to look at, but other than that, she is cheap attempt to recapture the magic of T-1000.  The sound is off and cartoonish at times, just to name a few flaws.  In my opinion, the only redeemining thing form this film is the ending which I thought was kind of cool.  See it if you must, but it really is a let down.",5,0,0,4 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," perfect
","Cameron may be a dip, but I have to give him this. He knows what he is doing.  His sound, cinematography, direction, and everything else is all top notch here.  I personally feel that it is in part due to the fact that retaines a hand in every aspect of the films that he does.  I can not really find anything wrong with this film, and that fact that it is still good looking, even by todays standards is a great credit to his name.  Anyway, this is a fun movie that I do not grow tired of.  It is a part of pop culture, and it is practically perfect.  See it, period.",9,1,1,5 July 2003
Pearl Harbor," Awful!!!!!
","Once again, Michael Bay ruins another film.  This movie is a complete waste of time.  The only things in this movie that you should see, is the Jimmy Doolittle raids, and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  That takes all of 45 min. of the 3 hour waste of time.  Trust me, this is 3 hours of your life that you will NEVER EVER get back!!!!",4,0,1,28 February 2003
The Butterfly Effect," I wanted to love this
","I really wanted to love this film.  As it was, it was alright, but it could have been much better.  First of all, there was some serious acting issues in the film.  Ashton wasn't so bad, but other parts of the cast, like his mom, really was.  The story was cool, but there were some really forced plot points in the beginning, and in the very end which hurts the film.  It seems to me that the makers had this great idea, and knew in general what they wanted to do, but needed a quick way out because they just couldn't figure out what else to do.  All of the plot problems could have easily been solved though with just a little reworking.  No other real major complaints, and fairly enjoyable.",6,5,11,20 February 2004
Seabiscuit," I was impressed
","I was really impressed by this movie.  I honestly didn't expect much, and really could not have cared either way if i saw this movie or not.  However, I did end up seeing it, and really enjoyed it.  Every actor did a fantastic job, the story kept me interested, and the direction and cinematography were sweeping and beautiful in their use.  The only thing that bothered me every now and then was the narration, but I quickly forgot about that.  Even if you are not into horses, this is a film that you should see.",9,0,0,11 August 2003
28 Days Later...," good, but not inventive.
","First off, this is being billed as a really scary horror movie.  Do not expect that, while there are some parts that do kind of get you, it is not really a horror movie so much as a movie about people in a desperate situation.  Second, it borrows from the Omega Man, and the Living Dead trilogy.  And finally, I hate digital video, especially with this film.  It looked like somebody had wiped their butt with the film print, and then sent it in, DV just looks awful.  I think that all of the budget was spent on everything other than film stock.  All in all though, it was a good movie, but I suggest that you wait till video so that you won't notice how horrible DV looks as much.  7/10 because of DV.",7,0,0,29 June 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," Huston deserves more respect
","John Huston deserves a whole hell of a lot more credit than he gets.  He consistently made great films that were not just technically proficient, but always had great acting, strong stories, and wonderful direction.  He truly is one of the forgotten masters who deserves to have his work studied with the likes of Hitchcock, Wilder, and Wells.  This movie is no exception. Cain and Connery are wonderful as always, and the story of chance and luck is fun to watch unfold.  If you haven't seen this, or any other Huston film, you really should.",9,1,3,3 March 2003
Dumb and Dumber," mindless entertainment
","Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie as much as the next guy, but you got to admit that the technical aspects of this film are just not there. If you are a fan of these guys humor, and by some odd chance you have not seen this movie, then by all means buy it.  It is guaranteed that you will like the film.  6/10",6,2,5,27 February 2003
The Evil Dead," The most horrific of the three
","This is the most horrific of the three Evil Dead movie.  Two moves a little bit into the humor side of things, and Army of Darkness seemed to abandon the horror aspect of the film entirely.  This one on the other hand has quite a few scenes of jarring imagery despite the glaringly low budget. Thats how all the great horror movies seem to be made.  Reccomended for all Campbell, Raimi, Army of Darkness, and horror fans.",9,0,1,2 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Technically perfect.
","This is a fine example of how films should be made.  Granted, Ridley Scott was at the helm, and he always makes a perfect film from a technical standpoint.  This movie had fantastic pace, some great acting, with the exception of Ewan Mcgregor, and well perfect filmmaking.  One of the best war films that I have ever seen.  However, be prepared for a lot of blood, and some heavy downer moments.",10,0,1,30 July 2003
The Last Samurai," Very energetic.
","I fell that this was a very energetic piece of film.  Everything was well planned out, well shot, well written, well directed, and very well acted. My only complaint was that there were some very odd editing choices that really stood out when I was watching the movie.  Normally I miss these type of things the first time around, but there were a few that were just really jumped at me.  I would give this film a 10 if it weren't for the last 15 or so seconds, which I feel was not needed, and for the notoriously bad shot of Tom Cruise on the horse in the final battle.  That was really bad and hard to miss, shame on them for putting that in. Also, I think that this will get some nominations from the academy, but I don't think it will win anything major.  I could be wrong though.  9/10",9,0,0,11 December 2003
Hoosiers," Hackman is great as always
","Gene Hackman is a fantastic actor who has not become a cartoon version of himself like DeNiro and Pacino has.  Neither of those guys try anymore, they just be themselves, and everybody loves them for it.  Hackman on the other hand always hand in a good and often varied performance (see Unforgiven, Crimson Tide, Hoosiers) that has me belive that he is the character he is playing, and not just Gene Hackman.  Anyway, this movie was pretty good, even the simple basketball games have you cheering for the small town Indiana team.  Dennis Hopper turns in a great performance as a drunk (I'm not so sure it was a performance though) that wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his son, and isn't sure he can handle it.  Good flick to watch if you can't decide on anything else at the video store.",7,2,2,12 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Part 2 of 3
","This one suffered form being the second of a trilogy.  It has to set up the third without really resolving anything, which is exactly what it did. There were some pretty cool sfx, and some neat new characters and villians, but I am not sure if we will even see some of the villians again.  Anyway, the only real complaint that I have is the 5 min rave/sex scene.  There was no point for it.  Other that that not bad, but the first was better, and I am betting that the third will be just by simple nature of it being a trilogy.  See it if only to see the third of the series.",7,0,0,19 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Where the story really begins
","This is where the Harry Potter story really begins to take off.  This movie is a little more horrific than the first story with some frightening visuals.  Think giant spiders and snakes.  The story is tight, and well told, limiting us to the world and knowledge of Harry Potter, the way it should be.  Music and sound are great.  Cinematography is beautiful and smooth.  The acting is better that what I would expect from a film centralized around a large amount of teens and pre teens.  If you saw the first, see the second.  If you haven't seen the first, see them both.",8,0,0,9 May 2003
Army of Darkness," One of the greatest of all time
","I love this movie.  This movie is full of some of the greatest one liners in history.  One of the beautiful things about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and by doing that became an instant cult classic. It also kind of helps that Bruce Campbell is a cult fav actor, and that both Evil Dead one and two were cult favs.  This is by far the funniest of the three films, so if you are looking for some genuine scares you might want to get the first one, but for just good plain fun, this is the movie for you.  This classic should be required viewing.",9,2,3,2 March 2003
Paths of Glory," Why Kubrick will always be king
","Movies Like this are why Stanley Kubrick will always be king.  Sure the guy was a little crazy, and a bit of a perfectionist, but look at the classics that this man has turned in.  I have more respect for Kirk Douglas as an actor from this film then any other that he has done.  I really don't know why that man has never won an oscar.  This movie is not really a war movie, and it's not really a court room drama.  It's just a really good human drama film.  I really don't think I need to comment on any of the technical aspects of this movie, because Kubrick's technical aspects are always perfect.  Top notch film that deserves to be placed next to other classic Kubrick works such as A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, and 2001.",9,0,0,12 April 2003
Ben-Hur," Stellar
","There is a reason why this film won soo many awards.  Excellent acting, grand sets, a sprawling epic storyline, beautiful shots, a fine score, and fantastic direction make this one of the greatest films ever made.  If you have not seen this film at some point on your life, you should.  It is well worth the time, and is required viewing for all film buffs. 10/10",10,4,6,2 March 2003
Identity," the first 3/4th were pretty good
","The first 3/4th of this film wasn't to bad, and for a while there, I was kind of impressed with what I was seeing, considering the bad word of mouth reviews I had heard, and some of the problems that occured on the set. First off, the clues that they give as to who the actual killer identity is are broadcast loud and clear.  The story of how everybody gets to the hotel is kinda neat, and the little backgrounds that are given are sufficent, but my main complaint is that there are to many characters.  With too many characters, there is no real way to make any of these characters fully fleshed out and make us really care or hate them.  That combined with a weak cop out ending make this a film that you should see if you have nothing better to do.  Everything else is fine. On a side note, John Cusack tried to get out of the project 3/4 of the way into filming due to different people rewirting the ending.",7,0,1,11 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," fun stuff
","Action packed, fast paced, and full of comic book referances that only comic book fans will understand.  Lots of cool performances, and a great storyline move this movie along.  My only complaint is that there are so many cool mutants that they don't spend enough time with.  Personally I would like to see a mini series like Band of Brothers for the X Men.  Anyway, one of the best comic movies I've seen.",8,0,0,4 May 2003
Amélie," Beautiful. Pure. Simple.
","When I say that this film was beautiful, I really mean that.  Every shot in the film is a work of art.  You could take a frame and enlarge it and be proud to have that beautiful photograph on your wall.  When I say that it is pure, it really is.  The movie is nothing but delightful with fun and interesting characters, it is also a movie that retains an air of innocence, even though this girl has become somewhat of a peeping tom.  When I say that it is simple, I mean it in a good way.  This movie seems to be a labor of love, and makes a viewer feel good.  A must see.",10,0,2,28 November 2003
True Romance," Slick
","Tony Scott always makes pretty slick film, and this is no exception.  Lots of great acting, and some really fun characters, especially Brad Pitt's stoner roommate, make this a real treat with the trademark Scott flair. Lots of cameos keep you guessing who will pop up next.  I find it really hard to tire of this film, and reccomend it to anybody who hasn't seen it.",9,0,2,2 March 2003
The Wizard of Oz," Everyone should have seen this by now
","This is just one of those movies that needs to be seen.  I don't care who you are, whether you hate musicals or not (I usually do)it is just something has to be seen.  I always kind of liked that tin man and the the wizard. Needless to say the flying monkeys kinda freaked me out as a kid, but I think I am over it now.  Classic 10/10",10,1,2,28 February 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen brothers keep it coming
","Have the Coen brothers ever made a bad film??  I mean really, they always have topnotch acting, their writing is always excellent, the direction, cinematography, and editing is always superb.  O Brother Where Art Thou gets even better when you see what they did to get the get that great dust bowl era look. Full of quirky characters, as in all of their film, this movie gets better and better with each viewing.  Excellent music, and well thought out story adaptation have me giving this one a 9/10.",9,1,2,28 February 2003
