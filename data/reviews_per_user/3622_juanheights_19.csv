Us," headline

Snatch," headline
",Although the story was split through various subplots seeing it all come together made the movie really enjoyable. seeing the antics of each group and how it affected the next added flavor to the already conflicting personalities of each character. the film is funny and the cast did a good job.,8,0,1,17 November 2019
The Shining," headline
",It's a good film. the cast did a fantastic job displaying the raw emotions going through their characters. you did feel for the family when it got rough but the main focus of the film was mainly pointed towards Jack Torrance. whenever the film wasn't on the character it felt pretty underwhelming and it's what made the rest of the family's screen time feel not as impactful as it could've been,8,1,3,11 November 2019

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," headline
","Solid film with the lead duo's chemistry feeling authentic, their individual arcs were a pleasant experience to watch. Although the presence of Robbie was enjoyed, her story, along with certain other characters, did feel overstretched and at times pointless. The overall payoff was great and ended the film with one of the best endings ever seen.",8,0,1,11 November 2019

Ex Machina," headline
",It's a good watch. the ending of the film was pretty predictable and didn't really feel for any of the characters so it felt more like an example of what could possibly happen in the near future more than a story being told.,7,0,0,11 November 2019

",There isn't really much to say about this one as it pretty much continues to be an action packed adventure that is definitely well done. the stakes are even higher as the choices from the previous film bleed their way into the events that unfold as a response to debts being paid.,9,0,0,11 November 2019
