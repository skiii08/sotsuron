The Mask," Why I still watch movies (metaphorically speaking)
","Although I prefer the classic 40's and 50's 5 minute cartoons of Tex Avery to this homage, I must admit it still makes me hoot with laughter whenever I see it. One of the few 90's films I've liked (out of only a few more) I think it has the edge city over Ace Ventura, equally memorable for Jim Carrey taking off Captain Kirk in the dolphin tank as well as the horrible undisciplined ending.This also has as eye-candy a shapely Cinderella Cameron Diaz who is marvellous - as someone to paint a few little dresses on. Rather smoking for the eyes, I concur with Wolfie. The biggest star however was Milo, what a masterful yet restrained performance, basically as straight-dog to Ipkiss in either form. The two cops were a throwback to 40's style films too, such as the Falcon, Boston Blackie etc - no one is that dumb in real life, uh?The Mask has to be the best comedy film in decades, probably the best film of the 90's full stop, and I'm so glad a sequel never materialised.",7,0,0,14 August 2005
The Avengers," Literally a block-buster
","It's yet another glossy Marvel fantasy which seems to divide opinion – so I think it's one of best average films I've ever seen. It's entertaining, noisy, violent, and you just know who's going to win; mind you, New York was left in ruins yet again. The Marvel plot should run that New Yorker's should just leave everything as it is to save time for the next alien foul-up. Can the producers re-use any of the cgi cartoon conflagration scenes to pad out the next movie?Bad god Loki forcibly gathers a force around him in order to take over Earth and get one over his brother the good god Thor. Meanwhile in the growing chaos Samuel L. Jackson is responsible for assembling a force of superheroes to save the planet: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and eventually Hawkeye. It's a shame Capt. America didn't get his moments readjusting to life in the 21st century, I. Man's slappable whimsicality was reduced, Hulk sure had some fun in his far too brief meeting with Loki, Johansson looked just as serious and good with her kit on. Personally there could have been more room for character interpolations and plot and less building-crunching battle at the end, but I suppose that's what appeals more to the kids. But I must admit that in the thick of it I was wondering where was Popeye and could he have polished the baddies all off a little quicker than this lot. And fancy a future US government signing off the building of a mammoth flying aircraft carrier – with teleportation maybe just around the corner the whole concept of travel – and battle – will be altered. I came away almost impressed at the style over substance brazenness of the film itself but very impressed with Tom Hiddleston's smooth performance as Loki; maybe an Eton education helps perfect acting with a cold heartless demeanour.I loved the after-credit ending section tying back in to the plot, and although if stripped of the cgi it's pretty simple fare I enjoyed it. Not a bad nor a great film - even if compared to Battleship; but it's barmy and just lively and fast enough to suspend belief for two hours. And it does what it says it's going to do on the shield.",7,2,5,26 July 2014
Vertigo," Heady stuff
","I thought I'd sit down and watch the best film ever made but I picked this one instead. And what a wonderfully silly film it still is too! It's not the type of film I can watch too often, but once I reach a certain point I always find myself completely immersed in its dreamlike ambiguities. It was a superb creation from a master storyteller, Alfred Hitchcock knew his craft so perfectly after over 30 years in the business that it's hardly surprising that Vertigo still delights people today. Whether it's a better film than Citizen Kane though is perhaps a question to leave to the experts  to get wrong.Ex-police detective James Stewart is hired by old friend to follow and make sure his wife Kim Novak is alright as she doesn't appear to be alright in the head. Stewart falls in love with Novak, and later vice versa. And literally head over heels too! She apparently commits suicide with vertigo-struck Stewart unable to prevent her. But be warned: what begins improbably continues implausibly and climaxes almost impossibly. I've seen it quite a few times since it was first on UK TV in the '80's (copyright problems held it and some other Hitchcock films off the box till then) but once seen and you know who's leading who up the garden path it can lose a bit of its power. It's slightly unsettling watching Stewart as a middle-aged stalker then as a perceived pervert, but Novak soon puts minds at rest in the pivotal scene when she's trying to write her confession. As with a few other films the music actually makes it much better – Bernard Herrmann's score is actually essential to the enjoyment of this; it's insistent and weaves in and out revolving around everything in here. Favourite bit: the love scene of course, I just hope you hear it in stereo!Nice acting (Stewart's best performance outside of It's A Wonderful Life), memorable photogenic locations, lovely lilting music, grippingly mad story, tremendous production values and direction – who could ask for anything more? One of the best films ever made depending on the size of the list, mine would probably have at least 100 titles in it to be included.",8,2,4,4 August 2012
Skyfall," Adequately entertaining
","I wanted to see this as it's been trailed by the UK media and critics as the best Bond film ever. Well, to my mind an impossible job as Sean Connery hung up his toupee decades back – but I thought it could be a good action film for all that. I found it rather entertaining hokum and a passable time-passer, then I saw some of the savage IMDb comments and wondered what I'd missed.The first 12 minutes are cops chasing robbers chasing cops, but the film quickly resolves itself into  nothing but that. The baddies have stolen a list of names the other baddies wanted to keep secret, 'tis Bond's mission to find out how/why/who/where and instigate liquidation proceedings. The film is a shallow linear and hackneyed adventure thriller yarn told straight – nothing wrong with all of that, but compare it with the contemporary Dark Knight Rises for something equally as nonsensical but with marvellously inventive use of cameras, sets and cgi cartoonery. Favourite bits: the crackers chase opening; the mesmerising scenes in the psychedelic Shanghai skyscraper with Bond calmly letting a stranger get murdered; when trying to get to Mum in central London marvelling at top mad baddie Silva's precision prescience which rivalled that of Paul Muad'Dib in Dune Messiah; the scenes at Skyfall itself, bringing a lot of old fashioned wood into the picture to give it a rosier glow. Craig & Dench in particular out of the muttering cast did a good job with their guttural whisperings. The biggest letdown was the cold blooded and pointless execution of Bond's female consummation of the night before – why do film makers insist on some such gratuitous atrocity, is it only in the hope we'll remember their films fondly?Overall, it's nothing fantastic but enjoyable and entertaining – and probably the best Bond film since Connery.",7,6,12,19 November 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders Of The Film Vault : RiffTrax
","It's a film I hadn't seen for years, until just now when the little one and I watched the RiffTrax version. We used to avidly follow MST3K's erratic adventures on Sci-Fi Channel UK until axed in the early Noughties, now it's reborn we've found a whole old new world out there to see again anew!Story has hunky archaeologist trying to discover and then rescue the Ark of the Covenant through a sea of sweaty action adventures with Nazis, Arabs and snakes but this time with the bonus of 3 disembodied voices constantly taking the mickey out of everyone and everything on screen. As with all of the MST3K past classics it can be hit and miss  the misses are cues for the tumbleweed but when they hit it can be side-splitting stuff. I agree with my daughter in that I think they were better tearing into terrible old and/or dubbed movies (who can forget the unclassic Prince Of Space?), but they obviously would like to reach a broader audience with shorter memories  and as they say, some movies ask for it! This is the only way to see modern films, the only trouble being the process is irreversible - to watch the original in the original frame of mind ever again is impossible. I have no idea how they've got round copyright issues, just glad they did  or if they didn't, keep on running boys!The film itself? There can't be really much left to say about a film that has sunk into movie-fans collective consciousness like this one has - it was OK then, but it's much better now.",8,1,2,15 September 2008
Casablanca," Seen through a compatriots eyes
","One of my all-time favourite movies, I've now seen it over 20 times with no loss of admiration.For all the 'making it up as they went along' hokum it's an ABC of Hollywood film-making, everything is perfect and perfectly in place - all you need to know to make a movie in fact. Although no imitators of course could hope to come close.The acting, the script, the witty dialogue, the music, the atmosphere, all come together into a marvellous blend, albeit with faults - what hasn't got faults? Maybe too much corn and the fast speed at which Rick's patriotism suddenly rears its head, but these are minor considerations. Everything can be forgiven at Rick's.It was dated the first time I saw 30 odd years ago, I think it is one of the few films ever made to have passed beyond that state, into a timeless world where all that is shown and all that happens on that screen is utterly believable - like a filmic fairy tale in fact! So many favourite bits it'd be easier listing dull moments: No, I still see Ilsa's tear-rimmed eyes and so submit to the inevitable - it's a beautiful film!",9,3,4,6 February 2005
In Bruges," Mad, manic and marvellous
","I've always preferred watching 'old' films - even when they weren't so old I preferred films made in the Golden Age to all those modern films made in the '60's. But I still occasionally try new ones out, usually to my disappointment or disgust but In Bruges is one of the great exceptions. I've now seen this a couple of times: how such seedy violent profanities can appeal to me still puzzles me, but there's no doubt to me that this is a brilliant film – with many faults, dazzling to watch. My daughter wasn't as impressed as me so maybe it helped not to be as used to modern movies or maybe it's just that you'll either love it or hate it.Two Irish hit men (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) hole up in Bruges - definitely not an excrement-hole – they don't know why except to await orders from their gangster boss Ralph Fiennes back in London. Farrell is mentally tortured by the recollection of accidentally shooting a young boy in the head. When the order finally comes to Gleeson it comes as a surprise to put it mildly. With everyone constantly swearing their heads off with some great lines, all bickering, taking the mickey, the story veering into very dodgy territory at times all depicted with a slapstick frankness, great photography/colour/sense of humour/style, editing and atmospheric music. So what if the denouement was a little contrived and telegraphed to the viewer well in advance, it all made perfect sense in a glorious black comedy. Favourite bits from so many: the opening sentences 'After I killed him '; Farrell and the bunch of elephants interested in the church; the dismissive references to gay beers; the wingeing skinhead shot in the eye by a blank; Fiennes sorry for calling his wife an inanimate object; the wonderful meeting between Gleeson and Fiennes in the café, with so many side-splitting unrepeatable comments made or retracted; I really really hoped Farrell wouldn't die too. I never thought I could laugh so much at so much coarseness!It's fast and stylish, with beautiful Bruges at all times looking like it's from a effing fairy tale. Not recommended if offended by sex/violence/bad language/adult themes (as I very often am, but only in what it shows the film-makers think of their audiences) – however this is an eye popping work of Art, in my admittedly limited experience utterly unique and recommended.",8,2,4,16 September 2012
Gravity," Brevity
","It's a modern ninety minute short film therefore it's probably a great film without even looking full stop. Most new films stretch out longer than their event horizon with cgi cartoonery too daft to laugh at and say less than this one's end credits. But however entertaining this might possibly be it's still as vacuous as the space that is the ... er real star - at least the ninety minutes didn't drag though.Two astronauts (Buzz Clooney and Ripley Bullock, the entire cast) are tinkering around a space ship when debris from space collision causes space mayhem and serious space problems for them to get back to safety. There's some gripping and some risible moments always complemented with eye-boggling cgi; although this is a live action cartoon it looks real to me at all times ... is that partly because we all know Americans with their backs against the airlock are always as resourceful as this ... If I'd seen this with some Buddy Holly 3D specs in the cinema I might have come away seasick – so thank the Lord I didn't! Without the 3D gimmick it's a film easier to concentrate on and criticise for its empty headed plot. And why off Earth did I keep reminiscing about Fireball XL5? I'd watch this again when it's on the telly in the future as a slot filler as no big loss.But it certainly was fantastic and space-breaking work by the legions of cartoonists and technicians: it looks great, appears heavy, ends up lightweight.",8,15,25,10 January 2014
Star Trek," It's a noisy cartoon, Jim.
","That I've got all 80 episodes of the original marvellous TV series on a titchy flash stick would have had Mr. Spock's eyes go round with wonder. I used to love those moral and intelligent stories with beginnings, middles and ends but by now Star Trek has now gone where no older man should really follow. This is cinema purely for kids of all ages or people coming across Star Trek for the first time with admirably open minds.Young and brash James Tiberius Kirk comes of age as the Captain of the USS Enterprise spaceship, picking up his to be famous crew one by one to reboot the franchise, sorry, legend. On the way they have many loud and chaotic adventures, the main problem coming from a Romulan renegade from the future intent on making Spock watch his home planet Vulcan be destroyed. Belief must be suspended for the duration of the film but especially when young Kirk meets old Spock in the ice cave; it was so sloppy it had me too transfixed to laugh. At least Spock had his false teeth in.The cgi cartoonery is slick, relentless, fantastic, brutal, confusing – in fact everything that is required nowadays, acting and physical sets are adequate, but of course the story comes a solid last as usual. Why couldn't the rogue Romulan and his crew on their trillion trillion dollar spaceship go back in time to save their planet from destruction instead of looking for a dubious vengeance for its said destruction? It's the ridiculous graphics that take the attention – as soulless, heartless and pointless as all the other bloated cartoons made nowadays – King Kong, Prometheus, Hobbit etc. There's nothing here that has added to the original series or inspired in me anything other than to watch the original series again – that at least was Star Trek after all. It looks good, isn't dull and passed the time for me, somehow. Ah well, now for Into Darkness!",7,1,1,13 October 2013
Citizen Kane," The Golden Age's Best Film
","And imho those years 1915-1955 were the most entertaining in movie history too. I've never called myself or written down that I'm a film 'reviewer': unless you get paid for it by someone else and it's your job title the internet is generally the place to simply pass comments about this, that or the other. There's more than enough reviewers out there in the world anyway, and critics or snickerers too. I dislike passing bad comments on anything because 99% of the films ever made took some effort and brainwork even if I didn't personally approve of it. I could never 'review' Kane, passing some paltry comments on such a monumental film is hard enough, but over the last 40 years I've now seen it so many times think it's high time I gave my opinion too.Disjointed story told by disparate people at different times of boy growing up to be ruthless newspaper magnate who is used to getting his own way with everything and everyone, and a newspaper reporter trying to find out what he meant by his dying word. So: It's relentlessly inventive and near perfect in every department, script, acting, production-direction, camera-work, sets, costumes etc, with the available technology they had at the time presenting a movie that still looks fresh as a daisy to someone who doesn't. A nitrate-gleaming black and white production, with no colour, cgi cartoonery, swearing, relevance to ordinary peoples' lives, sex or violence for enlightened modern audience tastes (but containing some analogue cartoonery for those who need the fix) – it's the lack of these absolute essentials that most people today can't forgive in Kane. And the plot isn't incomprehensible and no one grunts through their parts like today. On the other side are people who think that after all the decades this has now been proved to be the unbeatable ultimate in cinematic art, and all other films are simply also-rans with Kane in its somewhat traditional role of being unassailable. Both sets are wrong of course - it's all personal taste and nothing lasts forever, even criticism isn't static. However, Kane is set in the amber of the Golden Age of the movies and is to me the best movie from that celebrated era. Indubitably. Again however, if I could only take one film with me to watch on a desert island this isn't it.Far from being mediocre the end ties everything up beautifully, and it helps make poignant sense of the previous two riveting hours. Unlike the vast majority of films, come good, bad or indifferent criticism it'll still be here after we're all gone so let's hear it for Good Old Citizen Kane!",9,6,10,6 October 2013
The Birth of a Nation," 'A plea for the art of the motion picture'
","Third time I've seen this racist film in forty years; that's probably mysteriously enough to make me a racist to people in the antiracist industry. That's also probably enough times for me to see it too – never again! A century on and this film still has the power to divide opinion and even shock some sensitive souls and I even guarantee that less people in this lovely world have been shocked by Salo or A Serbian Film than by this. Those two examples of vile obscenity are probably blithely watched by the world's antiracists without any qualms, and they would likely defend to the death the rights of the violent perverts who made them, but not this one. The Prophet may be fervently insulted by present-day other-believers in the Name of Free Speech, but a silent film made by racists in a previous civilisation almost has the power to send millions of selective-egalitarians into paroxysms. Where are all the antiracists whenever there's a genocide going off, too busy complaining about images and words which don't suit them?We all know what this is about: The American Civil War is fought at first for the Union then for Emancipation, the North wins, the South loses; Southern Negroes are turned from being absolute slaves fighting for freedom to being US wage-slaves fighting for jobs, which is a much cheaper option for colour-blind capitalism. The film itself is competent and cogent with excellent direction and photography for the time, and the first part is fairly straightforward. The contentious part is the Reconstruction, in which several Liberties were taken by the author and acquiesced to by the producers. All very unnecessary and nasty! The message appealed to a vast white market at the time, a market that still exists - although I very much doubt any of those many supremacist Chelsea fans on the French train barring entrance to a single black man recently had even heard of this film or the Ku Klux Klan! The actual reconstruction was a gruesomely complicated affair and not easy to glamourise by Hollywood, although its overall image of the South certainly was – I always found the apparently acceptable Gone With The Wind just as racist as this only glossier. But as for that so-called wonderful comedy Blazing Saddles, which black people tend to appreciate more than white - so much for Time healing all wounds!I'm sure there were many vindictive Northerners and ex-slaves back then just as I'm sure there are many vindictive present-day antiracists; not only racists have agendas. Griffiths 'may not have feared censorship' and lamely disclaimed on the intertitles that the picture was 'not meant to reflect on any race or people of today' and afterwards came up with a movie with the scope of Intolerance as a possible atonement but will this continue to be remembered by the current crop of egalitarians. Will copies of this nasty yet revered fiction film be allowed to exist outside of the Library Of Congress in another century's time? It's interesting tripe - I simply don't see it as either enriching or enhancing in any way but refuse to worry about it or advise anyone else to be worried by it.",7,0,0,29 March 2015
Passengers," Get a life
","As a sharp and slick work of fantasy fiction this film entertained me. It reminded me of 2001, Silent Running, Mission To Mars and even The Shining, but with its own gravitational spin. It covered 90 years in less than 2 hours and successfully kept me from looking at the clock.One of the 5000 hibernating passengers (has suspended animation been put into cold storage?) on an interstellar starship is inadvertently woken up on the journey with 90 years left to go to arrival – if you couldn't re-hibernate what would you do? Would you calmly walk about a gargantuan ship populated with a handful of robots drinking and playing with your yo-yo for the rest of your life or try to get someone to talk to? Love the place you're in or Love the one you're with. With this moral dilemma eating his vitals Chris Pratt is suitably chiselled and wooden as usual, however Jennifer Lawrence steals the show with her intensely believable performance as usual. On believability - whether someone could survive being so close to a nuclear reactor as was Pratt, protected only by an oven door is a moot point and a bit of a comedy moment too, but I thought the well thought of Gravity was similarly daft and not so weighty as this either. For the bar room scenes with Arthur The Android a bit of Al Bowlly crooning in the echoey background wouldn't have been amiss, but thankfully science fiction films and mankind have gone far beyond Joan Baez warbling end credits even if the message is similar.Whether the film is guilty of Sexism or not it's certainly guilty of Corn, and nothing wrong with that at all. Excellent hokum, superb cgi cartoonery, and a central performance well worth watching.",7,2,6,27 February 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Direness
","Well, at least this is better than Star Trash from 2009 imho, right from the off it's noisy, eye-catching, even absorbing, and can make you forget about your own mortality for a couple of hours. All good thingshowever! No matter how colourful or action-packed the cartoon is overall it's as vapid and vacuous as the space between us and the Klingon Empire.I didn't really enjoy Wrath Of Khan or any of the other movies either, I'm a confirmed old TOS-er now; why retread old ground adding nothing new but new film technology. Why can't they invent new myths for the younger generations? Baddie Benedict Cumberbatch plays a rather snooty Khan to goodie Chris Pine's rather snotty Kirk – one looking like an old work colleague of mine who had an evil eye the other like an old English soccer millionaire who had glass legs. How humdrum all the characters are though – the baddies aren't enough to frighten us now, cgi special effects have taken their place. And there is some jaw-dropping cartoonery in here, from the first appearance of the Enterprise to the other starship crashing on the city – where will all this 'realism' end? Pity about the unoriginal story though! Billions and billions of innocent bystanders slaughtered again to the sound of popcorn and ringpulls. It's amazing the bad guy didn't smash into the twin torpedoes of Kirk and Khan as he was being sucked out of the same airlock at the same time – the smash might've created a new particle. All the physical objects, the moving parts, even all the running about people did - another positive for the original Star Trek was that they took teleportation for granted!Flat, dull, stale and unprofitable (to experience). But still, it's a better way to pass two hours than in cryogenic storage, possibly.",7,0,0,19 October 2013
12 Angry Men," I don't know, but it's just possible that this is a great film
","This little film has been one of my favourites since the first time I saw it on 3/12/72 on UK TV; back then I couldn't fault it but over the years its minor imperfections have become more noticeable to me. Repetition assists clarity...It's an engrossing tale of 12 sweaty jurors cooped up in a hot and claustrophobic jury room trying to reach a unanimous decision on a potential murderer who's just been tried. Henry Fonda believes it's possible the guy is innocent, the other 11 initially don't. And that's all the background needed. It's marvellous watching the story unfold – more or less logically – but! The characters are really 12 Emotive Stereotypes: The 2 main well bred Thinkers just had to be the broker and the architect and not the slum dweller or the baseball fan, the 2 small businessmen just had to be the most interesting characters, not the old man or the clerk. The stagey and sporadic irrational emotional outbursts would make an agreement unlikely in the real world and yet it's carried by both the sincere and insincere at the finish. Where did Lee J. Cobb go to when everyone was theatrically getting up from their chairs and turning their backs on Ed Begley's right wing frothing? His chair was empty during this very contrived scene but not just before or after, presumably because it would have looked a little incongruous if he'd stood up too. And I concur with Fonda's glib comment that the defence lawyer couldn't have been very good!However, it's still a classic and a film I owe a lot to: it made me realise from age 13 there's often more lurking under the surface than above, and in all probability nothing is impossible.",8,0,0,10 April 2011
The Mummy," Fun pharaoh tale
","This has been shown by UK ITV so many times over the years that apparently similarly with the many other regular viewers it has become one of my comfort films to see repeatedly. A night with Die Hard, Where Eagles Dare, The Guns Of Navorone, Stargate, Time Machine and The Mummy all on TV would be a night of terrible clashes.Starting in 1290 BC in Egypt with a 'very naughty' priest mummified alive it moves on to AD 1923 with a wise cracking male American archaeologist meeting up with a dotty female British one and her lily-livered brother to go on a jovial quest for an ancient tomb. Together with a jovial rival digging party they manage to unleash the forces of Darkness by awakening the less than jovial Mummy to bring plague and death. I hope Evie was happy with all the carnage her impetuous reading of the incantation from the Book brought down on thousands of hapless heads. The varied mayhem ensuing meted on the just and the unjust is sometimes horrific sometimes slapstick – probably kids today think the heartlessly graphic imagery laughable, but me, I'm easily horrified. However ultimately, it's a fast and fun adventure yarn for kids and adults alike with an interesting plot but with plot holes as gaping as Imhotep's gob, taken relentlessly and with panache to a noisy conclusion. The gags fall thick and fast too; it was Brendan Fraser's finest film and although Rachel Weisz has done better things they really made a charming screwball couple – without them sparking it would have been a completely different film. And I wouldn't have seen it so often either. If Arnold Vosloo lives to be 2000 years old he will probably never top his characterisation of the ancient baddie in here. So with some gruesome cgi cartoonery moments not for the squeamish but also with plenty of solid nonsense entertainment for the hardened majority there's something in here for nearly every mortal.",8,5,5,1 February 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After RiffTrax
","Probably this is a good film for kids and gamers but it's a tedious cliché-ridden maelstrom for older film-watchers like me with any serious message frozen or drowned. I wish I could have seen it at 11  at 49 I think I've seen it all before except for the eye-boggling cgi cartoonery they use for cheapness nowadays.Global capitalism's efforts to get global warming going finally causes Earth to catch a cold ushering in a new Ice Age, and giving poor old New York some more cataclysmic breakdowns to recover from. Liberty Don't Surf! Dennis Quaid (paleo-climatologist) has to rescue son Jake Gyllenhaal (schmuck) and friends from freezer. It's all pretty harmless laughable stuff anyway, but the RiffTrax soundtrack version is absolutely hilarious, a relentless pisstake I recommend watching instead of the original tosh. The scenes in the public library stumbling over all that burnable furniture to burn books and keep warm are amongst the best I've seen, along with the indestructible digi-wolves on the huge ghost ship that managed to get into the centre of the city without turning. And Gyllenhaal's watery phone call to his Dad is turned into a real tearjerker! The cartoonery is impressive, and generally a lot of money was spent to make it look good, pity the plot was plastic and the acting was wooden. At the end the Free World was given time to recover from the safety of the 51st state of the USA, Mexico.I can't imagine ever watching the proper version because it's so so-so (maybe a 6/10), but with RiffTrax you can laugh in Armageddon's face and chuckle at catastrophe if you like.",8,1,3,13 October 2008
The Terminator," I won't be back
","I stayed away from this for thirty years but finally got fed up of all the people absolutely amazed I hadn't seen it and recommending it to me before it's too late. Well, it's fairly exciting enough as a low budget sci fi chiller, but does everyone really have to enjoy the same things? And judging by the music and special effects, in this case it's too late. Even if I'd seen it at an impressionable age such macho machinations were never my bag.An impregnable robot sent from 45 years in the way distant future to kill a woman who will have an important son, and another man from the future is sent to save herand unwittingly impregnate her too. Busy! The futuristic '80's music is as cheap, backward and laughable as Blade Runner's is, they also share a vision of an extremely grim future. The present is merely cars girls guns and mayhem after all. Schwarzenegger as the Terminator robot acted totally believably, and when reduced to the hilarious internal metal frame he acted with even more passion; but Harryhausen's stop motion skeletons in Jason & The Argonauts were as kittens in comparison. Made at the butt-end of the olde analogue age I bet director Cameron wished he could have done a Lucas-like Revision to it and rebooted it with cgi cartoonery for the special effects instead. However, the over the top violence was expected and delivered - the utter childishness of the multiple random killings only proves yet again to me how valueless some human film makers think other human beings lives are and therefore the contempt they must hold the audiences in. But I do realise you don't have to be in the Army to fight in the War, and most importantly this is mild stuff compared to nowadays. The film was all I expected, take away the viciousness and you might have a very good little b film.",7,1,4,24 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'Four bananas make a bunch and so do many more'
","I never bought into the Star Wars hype machine so didn't see this until the 1997 revamp. I remember warning some ardent fans back in '83 that it wouldn't take too long for the much vaunted special effects to wear thin and start curling at the edges, to be met with almost universal scoffing. I felt vindicated when looking at it again to discover thanks to cgi cartoonery it's become almost laughably ludicrous, or it would be if the story wasn't so dull.Not freedom fighters/terrorists up against the Empire/baddies yet again, pulleez – or as C3PO says Here we go again. The four heroes Hans, Leia, Luke and Chewbacca are off again in their corny quest for victory against the Dark Side. There's an interminable affray with Jabba, space dogfights, cute Gummi Bears on parade, bits that make the old UK TV advert for Smash mash look stylish, I was even fondly recalling Za Za the cat out of Hector's House too. Shame they couldn't have got Stevie Nicks out of Fleetwood Mac to take over the part of Leia from the cardboard stereotype on view, but with cgi anything is still possible! It all looks and feels so olde and tired that I wonder how jaded and faded the original version is now, but maybe many millions of people would lose part of their childhood if they did see it. This is now a monument to Revision, Lucas altered the look of the original work of Art to extend the life of the franchise. After all, even the great painters did it! But why not have done with it and run the revised opening credits to the Muppet Show or maybe more aptly the glorious Banana Splits TV show theme? There's some good imagery, pitifully few though eg Vader meeting the Emperor with a starry backdrop, some good slapstick eg dopey Chewy inadvertently entrapping them all in the Care Bear net - or should that be Snare Bears?At the time of the original hullabaloo it was generally considered the weakest link of the three movies, the rose-tinted spectacles used by an ageing generation who saw it when they were children have imbued it by now with a mystical worthiness that really is unwarranted. I understand and appreciate the power of viewing favourably as an adult the precious things of youth, but it never blinds me as to the real worth of the aforementioned precious things in the manner Star Wars does with its fanbase. And I see yet again just how inspirational and memorable Star Trek TOS was. It's merely OK as a time passer and much better than catching a cold; sadly I saw it too late to think it great.",7,1,3,5 July 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Hype's Labyrinth
","Encouraged to watch this by the intriguing storyline and awards it won I finally got round to it wanting it to be as mesmerising as it was claimed. Well no, but it is a well crafted, fabulously photographed and darkly violent imaginative fantasy film. A previous post criticised it for not being fantasy enough - I got news for him: all films are fantasy because they depict worlds no-one knows and condense and order stories into contrived chunks for mass digestion. Why make fantasy realistic?Girl wants to and is given the opportunity to become a Princess in Fairyland partly out of childishness but also to escape the horrors of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. She has to complete three tasks successfully - something not quite achieved but! Like A Matter Of Life And Death and others, you are shown that this other world could be just an hallucination, even at the very end and even though you need it to be really true by then after all the brutality you've sat through. A brutal opinion of the audience indeed. There are three things shown to good advantage by this film: one is the sadism of the Captain and therefore the sadism of the movie makers in rubbing our noses in such fantasy bestiality, two is the eye-cutting digital cartoonery especially essential for the fantasy sections, and three with the present day message that Franco represented a dark time it actually succeeds into making you believe that the Republicans won the War instead of losing and instilling a 'positive' note into the proceedings: another fantasy. If you need to see a truly wondrous fantasy film with subtitles watch Jean Cocteau's Belle Et La Bete instead.I enjoyed it to a point but hated the glorification of routine violence as a worthy artform even though I know that pandering to todays progressive and enlightened audiences could have made it much worse. Does it make us all better people to see a cheek being digitally knifed open or does it take us all down yet another notch? Because of all that not on my welcome back list, but it's interesting and thought-provoking stuff unless you're pretty sure that you can do without it.",7,2,5,18 April 2007
Alien," I Will Fear No Evil Mostly
","Every time I see this I think of my initial reaction to it at the cinema in 1979. I hadn't seen anything quite like it back then, I dare say that applied to most of the audience too  I thought it a steely cold classic, with a simple plot wrapped around a complicated future. Real computers were thankfully invented afterwards because the use and therefore the inevitable over-use of cgi cartoonery would have ruined the whole point of the film.Team of space miners get nosey and investigate signals coming from a nearby planet  too late it turns out not to be a distress signal but a stay-away signal. The menacing external and then internal shots of the grounded gargantuan alien spaceship in the storm are still impressive. The result of their nosiness is a ruthless alien lifeform gets on board their spaceship and causes mindless havoc, the implication being of course that they would carry it with them to eventually doom Mankind. The corollary is incomplete as we don't learn whether the aliens are of different politics or religion, although we can see for ourselves that no mercy must be shown to merciless Evil. Will aliens ever be clever enough to swear an oath of allegiance via a universal translator to gain entry before embarking on their savagery? Back to the cinema: the scene where the bloody gibbering penis lookalike dashed out of John Hurt had the audience unintentionally rocking with laughter, however when Dallas confronted the alien in the air vents I jumped a clear foot out of my seat. You feel so daft! But in this dark and cold world everything is so believable and most things beyond criticism or mockery, except maybe as the Rifftrax version I've just watched pointed out, just how many times do you have to save a cat in a picture?There's plot twists and turns to the very end: it must be one of the best of its kind even with faults caused by technological limitations, simple but unique and worth watching over and over again.",8,0,1,16 November 2008
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Crash Bang Wallop
","Every year that goes by and every film in the fantasy franchise that goes by the cgi cartoonery gets more polished and potent and this outing is no exception. Where will it end? This is an exhausting ride of cartoon violence and unremitting mayhem that although I stayed with it to the conclusion I knew was coming I was happy when it was all over and quiet descended again. Until the next time that is, when we can all start over again.The organisation protecting the world's freedom SHIELD has been found to be completely infiltrated with the different brand of freedom lovers from the alphabet soup HYDRA. Boss Samuel L. Jackson's injunction to Capt. America Chris Evans to Trust No One rings very true here: don't trust anyone but especially don't trust your own eyes. Or his for that matter. Basically many people have to die in the chase for a flash stick, but the film loses impetus once its secrets are 'revealed' and the graphics take over. Scarlet Johannson as Black Widow succeeded admirably in looking powerful and non-sexy, Evans' life was saved at least half a million times during the picture by his titchy shield, Falcon looked a force to be reckoned with except on very flimsy wings but it was the Winter Soldier who looked impressively impregnable. I couldn't imagine such a cool savage dude ever sneezing, getting a wedgie or paying a parking ticket. The heroes – or should that be merely saviours – didn't seem to care much for the Innocent Bystander, so it was refreshing to hear Johannson shout to hundreds of bystanders to get out of the way of the baddies flooding the air with bullets. And as for the mammothly expensive death-dealing flying machines – cheap teleportation will transport us all into a new world of non moving parts; same as those flying machines when disabled with a credit card, it's right on top of us.However I enjoyed the film - less than the first because of the excessive cartoon choreography which probably doesn't play as well on a TV, but wasn't surprised or disappointed by any of it: same as all of us I knew what I was getting into. The biggest point to me: Why can't all freedom lovers whether political or religious mind their own business?",7,1,2,18 August 2014
Interstellar," Interminable
","I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies – after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually 'there' or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too.It's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to 'Us' by 'Them', whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers – I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge.Basically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt – I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it. Way too long though, it seemed to last decades.",7,4,10,22 March 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America Meets General Mayhem
","What makes this a good movie is that I enjoyed watching it, only looking at my watch once to guess how long the army of credits would be at the end. If you don't enjoy watching it then it's obviously a bad movie and one you should have avoided. Basically these Marvel Superhero cartoons always split opinions depending on how much corn and cgi cartoonery you like and whether you're a superhero story purist or not – a well made film with an entertaining storyline that holds to the end is usually the last consideration.It is utter nonsense of course: puny 4F guy keeps trying to join the Army to fight the enemy, is chosen for TS experiment in instant bodybuilding, becomes 1A Captain America and goes on a personal crusade. He, his shield and a small veritable band of brothers are up against the massive Nazi Hydra organisation controlled by self-styled god Red Skull – who apparently took his attitude cue from Paul Scofield's marvellous art-loving Nazi colonel in The Train, and a doctor who kept reminding me of Peter Lorre's mad doctor in Arsenic And Old Lace. Maybe that makes Red Skull looking like Sam Neill look like Raymond Massey looking like Boris Karloff from the same film? The bit with the flagpole reminded me of Will Smith with the noisy table in Men In Black with Tommy Lee Jones. The cgi used on the weedy Chris Evans at the start is absolutely amazing, the cgi used later for all the explosions is either routine or laughable depending on your mood, or amazing if you're a kid. I have a job lugging a shopping bag about but I suppose it's no biggie for a big strong man to be glued to a heavy metal shield. Jones as usual steals every scene he's in; what a shame the cgi wasn't up to making HIM Captain America instead. The attention paid to normal, genuine period detail is total. The only gripe I had was Red Skull seemed too quick to capitulate – firstly at and in one of his massive complexes he declares he's outmatched, presses self-destruct and skedaddles holding his petticoats, and later in the plane is swiftly despatched to the stars. But this is pure Marvel – with echoes of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and A Matter Of Life And Death – I only hope someone is in charge of Marvel Cinematic/Magazine continuation coherency otherwise I'm going to get (more) hopelessly confused.Well made (Shepperton too!) and enjoyable but completely forgettable - an admirable time-passer with brain on off or standby; fun to watch as all fantasy films should be.",7,0,0,19 July 2014
American Hustle," Tulip Or Turnip
","There were many stylish and deep movies made in the '70's with thoughtful plots and acting and poignant soundtracks from The Godfather way down to The Story Of O – to go over the same ground again so soon takes some balls. It has to be special in some way to drag me back to that modern stone age while I still remember it so well, but unfortunately this isn't the film to do it.Comedy? It's a pretentiously complicated and generally boring tale of conmen, politicians, gangsters, in fact all very similar people and their molls loosely based on fact. Very stylish photography and undeniably wonderful acting by all the leads doesn't help me – it's deadly dull, flat, stale and unprofitable from start to finish. The story is so tedious and the comedy is so grim that what should be interesting is not and it just left me cold. So what if people wore big curlers, were suspicious of microwaves and phones had wires way back then; now film itself is redundant, audio sound is so perfect but there's nothing new worth hearing and soon we'll be able to converse with our coffee cups. As the Kinks sang in 1977 Life Goes On! The whole enterprise was probably aimed at the billions of people who have no pre-digital experience at all, billions who it must be hoped have more patience than me. Wasn't there any room for the Eagles' Desperado or one of Dean Friedman's songs or hairdo's? Or more to the point the Who's Won't Get Fooled Again or even better, Let's See Action?! I recall the Duke Ellington band's classic question posed at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956, not on the original LP shown so lovingly in this film though but just after the second Jeep's Blues on the 1999 CD release: Tulip or turnip/rosebud or rhubarb/fillet or plain beef stew – tell me dreamface/what am I to you? Tulip Jennifer Lawrence's great performance is perhaps the only reason to watch this - but even a quick snog between her and Amy Adams can't save this overall from being a Prize Turnip.I'd be surprised if the DVD isn't remaindered and if it's ever on the telly more than an obligatory twice in the next ten years. It definitely is a well made film but presumably mainly for self-declared clever and arty people and not me; for this even to be in the running for Awards only tells me some hustling has been going on.",7,1,3,12 January 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne In The USA
","And off we go again, part 3 of the Bourne dashing all over the place franchise. I can't fault the action and pacing, the sense of realism and the brevity of it all, I still don't like the shaky camera-work though. The old guys wouldn't be able to stand the pace I'm afraid: what Matt Damon as the ultimate hero-food goes through in here - Roger Moore would have ended up mussed and breathless, Sean Connery hors de combat strangled by his wig, John Wayne would have survived the first ten minutes of Identity only as horse-food. In my case, maybe 10 seconds.Jason Bourne is still looking for himself with bloody consequences for everyone. It's a fascinating wild chase through Madrid, London, Tangier, New York with I regret to say, the CIA with its knickers continually in a twist. Just what on Earth are our Betters paying these hopeless clowns billions of dollars for?! And the woman who eventually brought the baddies down was originally put on the case by them – some forethought! Tch – 2007 and so much paper and so many paper trails, equals an old fashioned McGuffin. But I thought the chase and resultant fight in Tangier was one of the most gripping sections in the whole trilogy, amazingly swift data gathering by all involved including the viewers, and Bourne wasn't even bionic. As with everything involving opinions or shaky-cam it's not perfect, but how can this be bettered?",8,0,0,18 February 2014
Fargo," Bleak comedy
","On the strength of liking the rather coarse In Bruges I was recommended to see this one, one that had passed me by but trailed for me by the recommender as an even blacker comedy. Being a sucker for black comedies I complied, and found it ingenious and engrossing fiction, but with a streak of nastiness not in In Bruges. Brainerd definitely looked colder than Bruges!Geeky husband (Macy) arranges for two hit men, one dumb the other kind of funny looking, to kidnap his wife so they can all share the ransom money to come from her rich father. Except it all goes wrong - especially for a lot of innocent passers by, which is something I always find difficult to extract humour from as I never know what or in particular who lies around the next corner myself. Some funny alleged Minnesota mannerisms and accents from the cast, the pregnant Sheriff Marge had some of the most whimsical lines and was a convincing eccentric, to this outsider anyway. Favourite bits: Her police outrage when she sees Macy Fleein' The Interview; the funny looking guy getting shot in the teeth and continually whinging about it; trying to guess exactly how Macy's wife met her end, how often Ya was uttered throughout and where's the money buried. Nice photography and the music was atmospheric and excellent too, although it sometimes put in mind 17th century France. I just wish the main characters and their many foibles had been fleshed out a little more, otoh it was all nicely packed into 90 minutes...maybe the rather pointless meeting of Marge with Mike could have been jettisoned?Although redolent of Twin Peaks it's one of the best films from the '90's I've seen from my limited experience, episodic but good and enigmatic enough to bear repeated viewings.",7,1,1,21 October 2012
Oblivion," Excellent escapism
","Thankfully I saw this sci fi film without knowing much about it apart from the fact that one of the BBC's critics had dismissed it when it came out, because there's some lively plot twists right to the very end you'd be best to be er oblivious about. I'm not a Tom Cruise expert but it's the best film I've seen him in, and even though it clocks in at two hours and some think it too long I wouldn't have minded another hour.The Earth in the future is war ravaged, patrolled by robot drones and their repairmen under the control of the ultimate spy in the sky, the gargantuan spaceship Tet. Cruise plays one such repairman Jack who finds his wiped memory returning for him to question his role. And much more. The whole plot edifice is cleverly constructed and maintained, with slick and clean cgi cartoonery and graphics, supported by good performances. Although I do get fed up with pumping up the volume to compensate for pseudo-heavy guttural whisperings replacing ordinary talking - you'd think they'd all have sore throats after a days shooting. And why oh why hasn't teleportation been invented yet - it's almost as if people in the future prefer to fly enormous physical objects with innumerable moving parts, or is that just to make the game version more interesting! I see that the future still features brief(less) appearances by naked females, somethings will never change apparently. It's maybe heartwarming for oldies to surmise that the LP will survive the CD and that Led Zep will still be relevant post apocalypse but it's the plot that's more interesting after all and all I can do is recommend concentration otherwise parts of this brave new world may pass you by. I had to keep stopping and playing back to double check little things, for instance the whole section when Jack 'repaired' Julia.There's nothing completely new here at all, just the entertaining updated cinematic way it's all been brought together from Planet Of The Apes, Silent Running, Dune, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Star Wars, Star Trek, Independence Day et al. And the end credit graphics even reminded me of the episode endings to Thunderbirds, none of these are bad things. It's the best sci fi film I've seen in years, if some of the critics don't like it just ignore them and see what you think instead.",7,4,7,7 September 2013
The Bourne Identity," Bourne To Run
","Believability is subject to many things, I try to believe in everything until proved false. Except politicians. This is supposed to be and looked like a realistic modern spy movie and not being a spy or (hopefully) a baddie, I believe in it completely. What do I want to know about bloody spies, except that this particular spy film entertained me. Haven't any idea or a care whether it followed the book or not, this is a movie commenting zone.Athletic amnesiac is recovered alive from the sea and gradually pieces his past lives together and works out why the authorities are trying to kill him and the woman he picked up in his flight. It's slick and expertly told, intelligent and extremely concise and swift. The two have a violent time racing and dodging about France but ultimately I'm sure it wouldn't be so easy to escape the clutches of the combined relentless forces of 'good' and eventually even be able to storm the nerve centre singlehanded. But, really no criticisms are necessary as it's so entertaining. I don't quite understand why the makers were so worried the events of 9/11 would instantly date the movie when it was released when some huge PC's are on display and the lack of so-called smartphones would give it all away soon anyway.For years people kept telling me this really was a great film and I should watch it - well, they were right. It's not perfect, but that's entertainment.",8,0,1,15 February 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Generally astounding, but is Middle Earth truly for the Middle Aged?
","As I was one of those people who hadn't read the book I always thought I'd be one of those other people who were going to read the book soon; over 35 years later I conclude I'm in a previously undreamed of third category of one of those people who now have no intention of ever reading the book, along with getting the video games. It appeared the film was going the same way  over 9 hours of expensive numb bum at the cinema didn't appeal to me, but I've finally seen Parts 1-3 (interspersed with shedloads of brain-rotting adverts) over the last few weeks on TV. And I was impressed even though I can't take all the hype surrounding it seriously being a non-geek and non-gamer.Part 1 - Lost ancient evil finger ring is re-discovered causing Everyone and their wicked uncle to hunt it down and take over the world with it, and the hobbit who accidentally ends up with it to skedaddle with the help of a wizard, humans, dwarfs and elves with the aim of destroying it. It's a magic ring alright, not only with its secret inscription but also it's the right size to fit both hobbit and human fingers. The main characters of Frodo and Sam his gardener - who certainly knows his rightful place with Mister Frodo - weave in and out of the story trying to reach their destination with the ring with the help of a motley collection of hairy heroes. It's a wonderful fantasy world portrayed with mind boggling cgi cartoonery, with the live action and animation working well over the imaginative real and cartoon landscapes. The game, er battle is on between Dark and Light, sorry - Stereotypes Alert - Evil and Good and after 3 hours is  left unresolved, for this is the first epic I've ever watched that has no ending. Like some of Andy Warhol's apologists might have suggested, maybe you need to see the entire 9 hours for a proper opinion, but the difference here is a lot happens in this first segment and there's a lot to ponder over afterwards. The 1939 Wizard Of Oz was shortish, cogent and to the point, but also had an ending and most importantly it first cut me when I was a kid, something I may have needed but can never get with this. Frodo's wide-eyes kept reminding me of Soundgarden's olde video to Black Hole Sun.In Part 2 - which has neither beginning nor ending (but at least is a middle), probably unlike the video game - I was reminded of the Wizard Of Oz again, what with talking trees (or were they giant Pepperami?), evil ugly soldiers marching back through a gate into their domain but sans any stirring music and flying dragons but sans monkeys on their backs. Mordor definitely looks a more dangerous place than the Wicked Witch's castle though! At one point Gandolf the White reared his white horse against a golden Sun in the same manner as Roy Rogers used to with Trigger in the '40's. The mammoth black and white battle between Evil and Good continues; by now the message should be clear for kids that White = Purity, and Royalty = Special People Worth Dying For Unquestioningly. Never mind about the 10,000 strong army of shapes assailing Helm's Keep, the impressive army of names on the end credits were just as realistic and almost tempted me to look to see if I was included somewhere; but I held firm and ignored them completely as usual. Many cliffhangers, splendid cartoon scenes, imaginative backgrounds and a beautiful music score lead us to the final part, for the main game.Part 3 - the best use of cgi cartoonery in a motion picture I've seen to date, with especially fantastic use for the 4 million horseless men of the Apocalypse - no arguing with them! Bet the game was damn good for the mass slaughter battle with the ugly blokes and their giant elephants. Shapes are slaughtered in their millions and the handful of Homeric heroes lauded - ah, what progress has been made since All Quiet On The Western Front! The Wizard Of Oz references are legion - when Frodo's recovering on his bed and all of his old Fellowship troop in one by one he only had to say There's No Place Like Home, and near the end when saying tearful goodbyes to his three friends I Think I'll Miss You Most Of All to Sam for it to be complete. The West thankfully won by the way - but Pure Evil will live to fight another day!However, a tremendous amount of work and loving care and attention to detail obviously went into all of this and it shows. There's so many marvellous and memorable scenes, some with real-life character interplay but most of them cartoon with gargantuan incongruous ornate ancient architecture or sculptures on display that I'm glad I saw it and joined the majority of the population of the world who have already. Hell, I'll probably even watch it again sometime it was that good, and as my daughter tells me the extended directors cut versions make more sense it'll be them (all being well).",8,1,2,28 September 2008
Man of Steel," Superman TNG is too daft to laugh at
","Depending on how old you are this is either going to be impressive artwork or vacuous nonsense. So this is Superman for the next generation - the Computer Generation, or should that be the next white Hope? Why can't the next generation get their own heroes and superheroes, and based on this does the next generation really need some heart and soul instead? I've always liked superhero movies, up till nowadays that is – I think I'll have to leave it to the next generation as I'm now feeling as much a fish out of water as General Sod was on Earth. To watch these cartoon blockbusters doesn't bring enrichment, only headache.Olde story of baby refugee from dying planet Krypton growing up and making his superhuman life on Earth but facing massive problems when his surviving former compatriots visit him to discuss some DNA. In the heat of the violent discussion millions of us Earthlings unfortunately have to die horribly, but so what. At least it looks good even if superficial. The cgi cartoonery is large, fast, spectacular and relentless, so when are they going save paying for real actors? The duel scenes were done cheaper, quieter, quicker and better in High Noon. If only Jeremy Irons had had such a deadly female sidekick in Die Hard 3! I wish I could see Mighty Mouse again to compare Henry Cavill and Amy Adams as Clark and Lois are certainly easy on the eyes, but compared to splintering cartoon concrete, pulverising metal and continuous mayhem anything is. Really missed having some Ker-Pow!'s for fisticuff scenes and Krunjjj!'s for when Supey was hurled through half a dozen skyscrapers at a time though.I enjoyed it to a point, but got nothing of value from it and will never intentionally revisit it. All being well I'll watch Batman Vs Superman when it's finally drawn in the hope that Spidey's there too and they all smash each other to their component atoms and have done with it.",7,9,14,17 November 2013
Hugo," One in the eye for Scorsese
","My, how movies have progressed since Georges Melies time. In his age he composed and filmed good hearted nonsense in days, while Martin Scorsese takes an age with a long film to pay homage to the great man and his works with his own film nonsense. It's tremendously stylish and even lavish but mainly cgi cartoonery and with 3D made redundant on an ordinary TV set, coupled with a tortuously inane plot. Great for kids over 10 though!Young boy living in gargantuan cartoon railway terminal winding the clocks is fixated on fixing an automaton which he is apparently convinced could send him a message from his dead father. When it comes it sends the film and us in a new (old) direction and makes one wonder if his father was having a laugh. It's very well done although with a few puzzling visuals and very well acted although with a few emotional non-sequiturs, an impressive mix borrowing from Wallace & Gromit, Modern Times, and even Dead Of Night where the automaton's name was Hugo. This is a film for youngsters who might appreciate the history but mainly for adults who think they know the history. Does it work? Well, I enjoyed it as a one off, a harmless expense of two hours time but probably never to be repeated. It helps to have an appreciation not only of the history but of his works too – sadly something along with the reading of Noddy books I was never able to accomplish or miss. For me, the clock had always ticked too long.A two minute Melies or a two hour Scorsese? That is the question.",7,1,1,24 March 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Entertainor
","As with the first Terminator this was recommended to me by a friend at work simply because I'd never seen it. I wasn't too impressed with no. 1 and told him I wouldn't be back but he insisted that no. 2 was much better with a stronger production and is even in the IMDb top 40 films of all time. Well, he was absolutely right, but I'm glad he's moving on because I just haven't got the stamina to keep going through all of his testosterone-fuelled favourite choices.It's a revision on no. 1 with a bad robot sent from the future to terminate a young boy to prevent him from growing up into an important good guy, and with a good robot also sent from the future to protect the boy. Much mayhem involving many pulverised vehicles and a tidy amount of broken glass ensues as the lad, his Mum and his rather straight faced Uncle Bob spend the picture trying to escape from the bad robot's steely clutches. Arnie being a descendant of the Tin Man in The Wizard Of Oz, beguilingly indicates he may also have a heart, it's certainly melting by the end. It helped that the music was way less dated than no. 1, and that cgi was rearing its shiny head by the time this was made. On the other hand cgi cartoonery gave Cameron & Co. a greater opportunity to portray gratuitous brutality, which they used with gusto – was there really a point in showing the good Samaritan motorist getting needled through the brain for his concern by the bad robot? As childish as pulling the wings off flies... But as it wound on it turned into a reasonable comedy – the sight of the baddie being split right down to his gizzards by the goodie and looking only slightly annoyed was surely the funniest bit. Mel and Brucie couldn't do that in Lethal Hard! Ultimately though, it was solid escapist entertainment and well worth its long running time.",8,2,4,3 November 2014
Salt," Heartless
","Depending on your point of view this is a fast moving spy yarn or risible and preposterous drivel. Either way to me it's brutal and pointless and not something I'm ever likely to let darken my eyeballs again.Just when you thought they'd both run out of USD it's Russia vs America again folks, this time a complicated plot with (plenty of) planted sleepers within the very halls and vaults of Yankee power. Is there really room for all of them and the many other sleepers there from the other religion too? It mainly involves the apparent mission of an indestructible Russian/American triple agent played by Angelina Jolie up against double and triple agents galore all out to, well, destroy the world. On the way many people are ruthlessly kicked to bits, butchered, or both; endlessly running down corridors toting guns has been used many times before to much better effect. On the other hand it's a film that can leave you thinking about it long after it's done and I admit I also stayed interested in hopefully finding out who's zoomin' who: the answers returned the producers and me. But the sheer panache of the nonsense held my attention to the very end, when I got a final unwelcome surprise twist - a sequel was/is planned! Go get 'em girl - without me watching.",7,1,6,28 December 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Therapy?
","An amazing film, because of the high quality of the acting amidst the wavering quality of the screenplay. Also amazing that the subject matter doesn't normally appeal to me but I was easily hooked in for what turned out to be an absorbing 2 hours. There's not really any sex or violence but plenty of frank interchanges between the cast, usually loud and frantic; aggro abounds in this smart modern romantic comedy.Volatile young man gets released from mental hospital back into community to recover still holding a candle for his cheating wife, finds plenty of aggro and a volatile young slut with a dead husband. And a pretty interesting relationship follows and develops. The acting by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence was marvellous, they're completely believable in their leading roles sparking off one another. They're so natural in all the important and trivial things you can even forget you're only watching a fiction film. Even old Noodles DeNiro himself can't spoil it, a great cast playing with a great script. That is, until the lead up to the climax when sadly notes of contrivance and conventionality are introduced almost on a coarser and cornier Dirty Dancing level; but then comes the glorious upbeat happy ending which is even referenced twice for double Positivity. And the production values were impeccable with deft camera-work at all times.All's well that ends well. Well, what's wrong with that and why can't it happen more often nowadays?",8,1,2,31 March 2013
Captain America: Civil War," A fictional fantasy easy to swallow
","I always check a page of previous comments, mainly to verify I'm on the right webpage but also to verify I watched the same movie and possibly to purr at shared opinions. This time I was very surprised at the vehemence of the angry dislike and scorn of most commenters to the latest Marvel offering, because as a non-purist it was basically what I expected: fantastic in the expected sense, not great as expected but I quite enjoyed it, as I'd hoped.There's a rift in the lute betwixt Iron Man and Captain America and a spat develops when the Avengers are told by a mere 117 governments they must be officially registered to be allowed to continue saving the Earth. Iron Man and his motley crew side with the UN, the latter with his team side with Good. For a commercial work of fantasy it works. If all the Avengers had appeared in a scene singing and dancing in top hats and suspenders I would have accepted it in the same way we have to accept scenes like Bucky stopping and mounting a motorbike going by at speed one-handed and riding it away, or America mega-leaping from a building to the edge of another and continue running with no damage. Thumping whilst flying is routine and as for stopping a helicopter in mid-flight with your bare hands, well that kind of thing happens every day! I do have a minor problem with the chances of a traffic camera being nicely on hand in 1991 to record Stark's parents' brutal murders, the videotape surviving, and being suddenly available to the understandably outraged Tony 25 years later - in front of the murderer. But not much. You can appreciate that an appearance by Hulk would've made for a rather one-sided battle, but I admit I'm puzzled why Thor was excluded. The plot and acting is suitably unbelievable, the many action scenes are so superbly cartoon as to make Jason Bourne look a doddering old fool. My only worry is that it can't be long before the MCU, like the books, disappears up its own fiendishly incoherent plot vortex. Expect no ending, for there no ending in this world.This franchise is financed by hard headed business people expecting only a profit but made by creative people who appreciate what they're doing as well. And in the main it'll be watched by people already looking forward to the next satisfactory Marvel time-filler probably including the real D. Trump too I expect.",7,3,6,8 January 2017
Enchanted," Snow White Redux
","Snow White being one of my favourite films ever I felt I had to see this parody of it and themselves by Disney, nor was I disappointed. It's probably the best piece of non-violent non-heavy entertainment made in the last 10 years, updating Disney's roster of fairytale films with a bit of gentle mocking, respectful homage and a touch of worldly cynicism and getting away with it.In cartoonland a beautiful girl is transported out of the way to the real world by evil Queen desperate that her stepson Prince shouldn't have the chance to marry her and thus become King. However he and a chipmunk follow her to bring her back while a friendly young girl and her father Patrick Dempsey look after her  to my daughter he was the most enchanting thing about Enchanted! Chaos is brought to the streets of New York as well as smiles to the faces of all of the denizens of Central Park participating in a spectacular song. Does Love conquer Cynicism or does Love conquer Singing in the streets? There's some nice songs , some smooth dancing, clever referencing and witty dialogue along the way to savour. You know you're in the modern film world however when the cartoon chipmunk inadvertently dumps - once upon a time Disney's animators used to spare us such crudities. Be sure too that you know your Snow White, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty And The Beast et al - even King Kong - to get the most from this. The ending was a bit hurried  but just like Snow White's was! Ultimately it's a refreshingly entertaining little film and cheerfully indifferent as to whether it has any faults or not.",8,2,2,30 March 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A barrel of laughs for Smaugheads
","Because so many people have said this Hobbit instalment was mainly from the mind of Jackson and not Tolkien I was perversely looking forward to it. I used to wish I'd read all the books when I was younger, now I'm glad I never got round to it, the films are more than enough of an experience.The band of bland dwarfs and hobbit continue their trekking across much real and cartoon scenery, facing many cartoon dangers but the whole story satisfyingly wrapped up in a gorgeously glorious and awesome triumphant conclusion of mythic proportions. Well, maybe not the last bit: the screen goes black which probably correctly matched the feelings of the audience with ten minutes of credits ahead of them. To cut to the chase: the almost endless barrel chase down the rapid river with elves and orcs battling it out over the dwarfs' heads - I haven't laughed AT a movie so much since Jackson's King Kong Brontosaurus stampede! But unintentionally laughing at a quality film is not meant to be a recommendation though. As it's mainly aimed at the gamer generations is there any characterisation at all, any interaction you can cherish, any character you root for, any race you feel master, in fact anybody you can relate to in here? In two and a half hours there are plenty of scenes to admire though: Galdalf's pointless but impressive separate quest before he realised he'd left the dwarfs in danger; Smaug's memorable erudite conversation with Baggins amidst the mountains of gold which has been raked in by the franchise, even though the caterpillar and Alice came to mind; the elvish and selfish city. As usual the cgi cartoonery veers between impressive and ridiculous – oh to be ten years old again! Overall and as a film I'll probably never watch again it was far more entertaining and cinematic than part 1; I made the most of it because I know the actual story will be flatly resumed in part 3.",8,1,5,18 January 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Art!
","This one's a bit of an odd one for me: is it Art or Fart? It seems to divide opinions up the middle; me, I'm in the middle  I liked it to a point but much prefer Tyrone Power's admittedly unrealistic take on Jesse James from 1940. Which means I'm probably going to get brickbats thrown at me from both sides of the fence. To me, nearly all modern films aim or pretend to be Art, and you can't argue this has some beautiful photography realistic plotting and natural acting. Life in general usually has no great plot, why should a movie always need a completely cohesive one - refer to the classic Dersu Uzala by Kurosawa for a masterclass of languid plotting. What we're watching is still a fantasy: none of us were there in 1882 to know better. And all people are ordinary people unless they're hyped up into special people by media or gossip, so if James really was a charmless monosyllable psycho well done to the team for trying to portray him that way.Unknown slimy adolescent idolises renowned violent baddie, worms his way into his confidence and eventually becomes Someone by shooting him in the back. Looking into the dusty picture at that momentous moment did James really want someone to put him out of his misery or was that just guesswork? Pitt and Affleck play the duo locked in time and make this tick, Pitt playing Pitt with a cigar this time, and Affleck the uptight Coward speaking like Stepin Fetchit used to, no one else matters much apart from in the tension of wondering who's going to get shot next. There's hardly any crudity, sex or violence which is probably off-putting for a lot of todays audience used to it who maybe can't do it without it anymore, but to me there's still too much because what's there is all gratuitous. Favourite bits: the gang waiting in the woods to rob the train at night; the few times anyone laughed or smiled  life was tedious sure, but human beings will always find good hearted humour anywhere; nice attention to period detail, manners and speaking idioms, although so cleverly made not over required; the aftermath and taking the Ford show on the road.Why not simply view this as a useful appendix to Ken Burns' still staggering American Civil War TV series? It's the most stunning modern film I've seen for years - then again, I don't get to see many! Imho well made, thoughtful, colourful, cogent, courageous and I didn't look at the clock once to see how much longer I had to go. Based on that yardstick I wouldn't mind seeing the 4 hour version ... only not just yet. But  give me Tyrone Power any day!",8,4,8,17 April 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Repetitive and repetitive
","Never managed to read the books but overall I enjoyed the Lord Of The Rings film trilogy with its relentless use of cgi cartoonery taken to its limits in furtherance of the story. So I was also looking forward to seeing this, the prequel being also a trilogy. Some people may want to call it Art, I call it maximising the potentialities of this particular revenue stream. After director Jackson has done with it maybe he'll find a way to continue the saga, in the same way that Dune, Shannara and other tales have been resurrected in print more times than Frankenstein.Band of ragtag dwarfs looking for a home come unbidden in Bilbo Baggins the anti-hero's home to devise a way with Gandalf the hairy wiz to get their home in the Lonely Mountain back from the clutches of the Smaug dragon. Who unaccountably loves gold. One tedious chase or flight leads to another, however I suppose the tension does alternate between the tedious and the tiresome. The story development is almost nil because of the screenplay elongation and repetition in the real Quest to get money from the hordes of Smaugheads. The cutting edge cartoonery is used to the max, this alternating between impressive and laughable. Repetitive, complete and devastating mayhem rules yet there is no doubt there will be no casualties (except in the game version): vast mountain ranges thumping one another over their heads, half a million goblin-shapes against 14 are great odds, and falling miles into jagged ravines the brave band is as indestructible as Captain Scarlet would've been. Sometimes from a distance it looks like millions of hieroglyphics zanily slipping and sliding about a page. Gollum looked more like an old fashioned cartoon in this outing though, methinks someone was trying to save a few bob on him. I love all kinds of cartoons but this is unlovely. This was a motion picture I've just watched passively, not a game or I'm missing the controls.Most kids under 20 years old will be entranced by it, older kids will face an increasing problem: they've seen it all before, and in this case within the same film too. It's incredibly well made in most visual departments and I enjoyed it to a point but along with most other ordinary films I've watched will never ever watch it again. My problem now is do I still bother with the next 3 hour instalment: The Hobbit – The Expected Flogging Of A Dead Horse.",7,8,12,18 August 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Warped and witty at warp speed
","This is a slick slapstick comedy adventure film taken at a fast pace without a trace of heaviness but with a continual cleverness that had me glued to my chair for the 99 minutes in case I missed anything. More happens in any one minute in here that happens in some entire films (if you don't believe me just try Once Upon A Time In Anatolia for comparison), this is a motion picture first and foremost designed to entertain and make money.Faded hotel owner tells the story of his success in life to an interested guest, how he started off as a eccentric lobby boy to an eccentric employer superbly played by Ralph Fiennes. An elderly rich female  patron dies or is murdered leading to Fiennes stealing a valuable painting, going to jail, and having her thwarted and thrusting family on his and everyone else's heels. And much more. It's a sumptuous and atmospheric world portrayed in a lucid cartoony style – one of my favourite bits being what the impetuous Willem Dafoe did in lawyer Jeff Goldblum's office and Goldblum's perfectly delayed reaction to it. Other fantastic (in every sense of the word) bits: the deep-end introduction of Zero the lobby boy; the cartoon escape from the prison; the 200 mph ski/sled chase through the snow and abrupt end; the call for help to the Society Of The Crossed Keys; the mass pointless shoot-out at the hotel. So many good witty and stylish scenes! Unfortunately a few tasteless ones too, the occasional gratuitous swearing, coarseness and violence is at least understandable – no matter whether the film is in 1932 or 1968 you know damn well you're really still in 2014 and if at all, not so easily shocked. However, replacing the 'valuable painting' for a piece of pointless graphic pornography is neither easy to get down or get off on – you know damn well the makers (and maybe a larger section of the audience) wouldn't have countenanced a portrait of two gay men masturbating instead - after all, can't be too shocking.Fiennes is memorable as the bizarre lead character Gustave, and in his bizarre relationship to the round-eyed Zero during their journey through this marvellously cynical live-action cartoon for the 21st century. Definitely not another Trouble In Paradise or Grand Hotel and nowhere near being a perfect film but overall, totally engrossing and hugely enjoyable hokum worthy of repeat viewingsbut with room for reservations.",8,3,7,7 June 2014
Frozen," The Wonderful World Of Disney
","Another magical cartoon from Disney, meant primarily for kids but with plenty throughout for adults to appreciate too – as is the case with the best cartoons made over the decades whether by Disney, MGM, Hanna-Barbera etc. It adapts Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, adds a few nice shouty songs and special syrup resulting in a nearly masterpiece. It's full of stereotypes and clichés, is image-rich and plot-weak, sweet and short and glib and witty and unrealistic and a fantasy which thankfully 'says nothing to me about my life'. Even if I'm a crusty old guy do I have to like the crusty realism so prevalent nowadays? With variable success I try and follow Thumper's injunction - if you can't say somethin' nice, don't say nuthin' at all.Queen Elsa has dangerous magical powers to freeze things, becomes cold and closed in her attempts not to hurt people or things but eventually flees to an instant ice palace high in the mountains when inadvertently creating a perpetual winter. The only trouble with the film is that either she or the weaselly trader should have been an evil villain instead of unwitting ones for a greater freezing frisson. Sister Anna would then had an external battle to match her internal one. Favourite bits: the relentless sound and vision witticisms in Love Is An Open Door; the trolls Fixer Upper welcoming of Kristof; the great action graphics with Hans and Elsa at the ice palace; Anna freezing to death but more worried about Olaf melting; the heart-warming moral perfectly portrayed in the best Disney tradition. Talk about sistas doing it for themselves! On another note, I find that Disney's conception of female beauty has got so atrophied over time that the handsome males now look far more normal. But I join the Corporation in distancing myself from Kristof's crass bogey-men comment which got right up my nose. The cgi cartoonery is unremittingly excellent and as suitably cold as ice, even breath-taking – where will all this technology lead to?Can I say something crazy? The best non-Pixar cartoon of the last twenty years - wonderful stuff! The most positive and worthwhile film I've watched in years: Love is all around indeed, at least until the warm glow engendered melts away. 'Twas just the same with Snow White too. So kids, if you want to keep the fantasy alive, watch it again.",8,4,14,12 April 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne With Fortitude
","I feared the worst about this but ended up mildly surprised at just how engrossing it had been. Sure, it's milking the franchise for all it's worth but it does so quite entertainingly - but maybe it was all so empty-headed I can simply empathise better. They're flogging a horse with some life left in it.Rogue super agent Aaron Cross is a thorn in the side of Uncle Sam only they don't know it for most of the movie; he dodges certain death a few times, causes incessant mayhem and picks up an emotional sympathetic moll in his quest for the McGuffin. There are many complex and unnecessary cul-de-sacs in the plot to fool you but ultimately that's all there is. And along with the photography there are many action scenes that are impressive, but it's mainly the two leads gruff Renner and tearful Weisz who carry the film and contribute the most. Although usually I've got a lot of time for Weisz I was wondering at first if Thunderbirds' Lady Penelope was a more believable and less wooden actress, but she certainly picked it up and by the climax was brilliant. Favourite bits: the pivotal sudden flare-up at Weisz's house and subsequent prolonged bafflement of the security forces; the improbable foot and motorbike chase through the slightly busy streets of Manila.It's not as good as Matt Damon's previous three outings, but at least it's swift, honest and a fairly enjoyable time-passer. So it's OK, but whether it was worth all the money spent on its making is another matter.",7,4,6,5 April 2014
La Grande Illusion," Class(ic)!
","Every time I watch this I find something else I hadn't thought of before, every viewing is an augmented experience. Things I hadn't spotted at 11, 19, 22 etc I spotted last night, mostly inconsequential but still adding to the picture 36 years after my first time. That to me is the difference between great films and Great films, one of the reasons why this ostensibly simple movie is one of the all time Greats.And it is simple (the simplest things are usually the best) - boring to some people who sadly will never understand its logic and magic - an absorbing prisoner of war tale that is also a prisoner of class tale. It defines that class loyalties are more meaningful than patriotism even if not always practical, and that to those who consider themselves to have breeding it's far more important to have 'blood' than capital. Boldieu and Rauffenstein embody this, they both knew their chivalric world order was being gradually diminished - the next war will and was led by people without breeding, types like Marechal and Rosenthal who fought on. The most significant borders are not between countries, races, religions, sexes or ages but those between the classes. Renoir was at his most inspired with Illusion, with so many memorable images and set-pieces, an engrossing storyline even when down to trying to say blue eyes in German or being posh by gossipping in English, and fantastic acting by all concerned. Everything has already been covered and better in previous posts, but I would add I don't understand why Regle du jeu is the Renoir film that gets the kudos today - unless by being deliberately more obscure it appeals to influential Artheads.The French film I love the most.",9,41,49,28 May 2006
Children of Men," 'Ain't Life Unkind?'
","I better start with that the premise of this particular work of fiction held no promise but it was recommended to me by a supposed optimist. To live in a country with no hope and no future is something we hope to correct in the present, and to know we are simply sheep to our Betters is to live in hope they get a shearing instead. This portrayal of a violent flatland is good science fiction because it's thought provoking but ultimately the grim relentless pointlessness of it all ensures once I've chewed it over it'll be filed away and forgotten.In 2027 infertility rules mankind until Clive Owen stumbles upon heavily guarded heavily pregnant woman – guarded by a terrorist clique who seem to want unfettered immigration into this grey and unpleasant land. It's a bloody and chaotic journey to get her to safety abroad. Everyone has guns and is trigger happy in support of various useless pointless causes except Michael Caine, who I thought turned in his best performance for years in here. Maybe because it was brief though. The mystical condition of pregnancy is shown as having been completely forgotten about by everybody in the 18 years since the last birth – which only shows to me how young and immature the writers and makers of this film were. Like Owen I didn't see the birth scene coming, but then again, didn't really want to! It seems the idea is that in the future our beloved government will spend endless amounts of money to maintain a violent ultra-strict anti-immigrant policy while endless amounts of foreigners don't realise this and continue to flood into paradise. Even in the midst of the chaos in Beirut in the 1970's people still bought Coca Cola and Esso ensuring capitalism's smooth running and their Betters healthy bank balances. In this film's vision all people seem to want are guns and weed. There is an emotionally upbeat climax with religious overtones which is quickly quashed with the final depressing scenes on the boat with the ship coming. It left me thinking: do the world a favour and have the ship sink the boat.It's very well made, well acted, well thought out and well out of order. We are indeed all doomed one way or another – religion and capitalism can only speed us on our way. Pax Vobiscum.",7,2,4,24 August 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Everybody Wants To Rule The World
","Now this is a pleasant surprise - it's an excellent action comedy and I enjoyed it. Big as it is it may even be the Star Wars of the current cgi gamer generation, only shame that all the characters and maybe the stories were variously imagined decades ago in prehistory. Not forgetting the music; going by the sound quality I only wish my audio cassettes could have stood the test of time so well with such perfect stereo separation and stability after 26 years of constant playing.It starts by a deathbed on Earth in 1988 and swiftly moves onto somewhere else bleak and grimy in the Universe 26 years later. A disparate group of five weird criminals is forced together for their common good under the leadership of Star Lord in defeating a weird baddie Ronan (the barbarian) who will destroy the Universe if he's gets the chance with his new shiny toy, the Infinity Stone. It has been explained to me by a knowledgeable friend that it's supposed to be far more complicated than that and that all manner of gemstones are or will be involved next time. As well as mayhem. Amidst all the cgi cartoon conflagrations there's a generally delightful repartee between all of the main characters, most times hitting the mark but occasionally missing. It's all taken at such a (literally) breakneck speed that it's not surprising though. The proto-Guardians are Star Lord who is reliving Han Solo except that he likes '70's pop songs far more and even enough to die for, Gamora is playing a green Rihanna for the kids, Rocket Racoon is without Gideon's Bible, Drax is built like a power station, and Groot is most definitely playing himself! Or, at least I think he is, as I've never read any of stories or even know or want to know 1% of the tortuous histories. However, no matter how interesting or amusing it gets the indifferent approach to a gruesome and colossal loss of life is always annoying to me – I mean, no one ever had to die horribly in Popeye cartoons and it still does nothing for me to see how many ingenious ways of painful annihilation can be sadistically portrayed by cgi. And must a family fun fantasy film have to open with emotionally fraught scenes of a boys' mother dying of cancer simply to provide the raison d'etre for a Walkman plot device? But as an even better old song goes I Guess I Just Wasn't Made For These Times. Although overall it's not too bad - I did laugh at Groot's violent method of despatching swathes of surprised baddies with a sweep of his arm, and his silly wooden look back over his shoulder afterwards. I wonder if Van Halen's Dance The Night Away was on director Gunn's hit list of olde tunes – it was used very effectively in Mission To Mars but no one watching this would've remembered that very old film.With reservations it's the best Marvel Disney I've seen to date. Two hours whizzed by watching this colourful well-made hokum and I didn't reach for the internet once, always good yardsticks, so exceptional stuff for the kids, pretty good nonsense for us oldies too. My bottom-line advice is to watch it simply because there's a whole new complex franchise looming out there: one day every other film made anywhere will be of Marvel's Universe so better try to get up to speed as soon as you can.",8,2,5,24 November 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not weird at all: It easily holds its own
","Against the excellent previous Avengers film I mean. Seen this four times now over the last few months so it seems to be a film I enjoy for one reason or another. It definitely helps that when I was a kid I briefly got into superhero comic book adventures, then left it for other things but think I still understand the genreand even a few of the plots. Marvel will worry about alienating people who can't keep up, as they first started to in the '70's; but ultimately no one can keep up, including their scriptwriters. However, they're by far the best ones to do their stories.More or less superhuman Goodies vs Baddies led by a violent peacekeeper Ultron in a breathless bone crunching nail biting 2 hours, mixing mayhem and wise-cracking comedy effortlessly. It's pointless describing anything in more detail even if I understood it: the plot's deliberately barmy but engrossing, with cgi cartoonery used as it was always meant to be used - with many variations we've seen it all before and with many more variations being presently dreamed up expect to again and again. As with the first film there are many iconic comic booky scenes for posterising. Ultron cynically sings I've Got No Strings from Pinocchio occasionally, but the original Thunderbirds were just as realistic to me. Worthy of note is the almost Shakespearean scene on the train between baddie Ultron and Scarlet Witch after her brother's surprising demise.Highly enjoyable and recommended non-essential viewing by this non-expert non-purist, the running time whizzes by every time I see it. At this rate I may understand it all in about a year's time too. Do Marvel include Howard The Duck in their Cinematic Universe?",8,10,21,20 December 2015
Toy Story," Toy Slavery
","I've finally watched the 3 (so far) excellent Toy Story Pixar Disney films after hearing Mark Kermode recommend them on UK BBC as the BEST trilogy ever made, including the Godfathers. Well, who am I to argue with such a cinema expert? But he obviously doesn't remember the dashing Dick Barton!#1 has the main toy characters of Woody and Buzz overcoming impossible odds to escape from the clutches of psychotic child toy killer Sid, #2 Woody from the clutches of psychotic toy collector Al, #3 Buzz and the gang from the clutches of psychotic toy Lotso. Throughout the individual films and the series as a continuous whole the characters, the character development, the cgi cartoonery, the comedy and the story are uniformly elegant and almost perfect. This is fast paced logically progressed stuff for kids to enjoy and adults to appreciate, and hopefully most of the relational morals will be taken on board by most people – apart from whether or not it's OK for someone to be portrayed as owning apparently live human beings and using them as toys of course! Do you empathise more with Andy the caring Owner or Woody the faithful Slave, or neither like me?A personal yardstick I use for cartoons is Does the film look like the people who made the film had fun making it? With Toy Story 123 the answer is a resounding Yes – they were so full of fun and confident that even a cod Spanish reprise of Randy Newman's main song was included in 3. And that came after some surprising scenes of heartbreaking poignancy – containing Tom Hanks' finest ever performance. In an ever more populated genre getting ever more technologically advanced and intelligent this series remains magically simple, and simply the best of its kind. Great fun and very re-watchable.",9,0,0,28 December 2010
Elysium," Impressive nonsense but much preferred WALL-E
","This is a bleak imagining of the future on Earth: the carefree rich capitalist class all decamp to a safe and remote playground leaving the stricken poor working class to stew in poverty and grind out profits for them. Hey, isn't that the present?Elysium is the vast elite space station of which everyone wants to be a citizen, Matt Damon plays a rather dying man eager to bring about regime change and helped by a gang of geeks armed with tinpot laptops and big ideas. And there are some good ideas in here, some good cgi cartoonery on display – pity none of the characters are worth bothering about though. I was left thinking why all the time, money and brains spent on this couldn't have instead been gone to produce Ringworld on film at last. Now there's a good story! Mentioning brains: there are a few gratuitous gruesome violent scenes in here too, probably completely acceptable to the majority of people, but such childish indiscipline doesn't appeal to me. Also, to think a change to a computer programme can reboot global capitalism and bring NHS saviours to a renewed perpetually smiling populace is not only childish but woefully misleading. If capitalism is still in force in 2154 then it will be solely because the majority of the world's human population have wanted it that way in the intervening years. It'll be entirely our fault if it turns out like this movie.For all that, I would've absolutely loved it as a kid (especially the violence), quite like it as an adult (especially the shortness), but now to press delete and log off as a cynic 'from which there's no coming back'.",8,0,0,21 June 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," A fable for adults
","This is an unforgettable roller-coaster ride, a mammoth 217 minutes (UK TV runtime) of love, hate, friendship and memories (Leone's words). And routine bestiality. Leone brought to the American gangster movie all he had given to the American Western movie in the preceding two decades, leaving this stuck out somewhere between The Good Bad And The Ugly and The Godfathers. I've only ever seen the full European cut (still well edited down from Leone's original), I assume the original cut US cut is the one that draws the bad reviews.Disjointed story set in 1968, 1923 and 1933 has handsome chap Noodles played by DeNiro being called back from self-imposed exile to his old stomping ground by someone after decades of hiding, he wants to find out by who and why. Although he turns out to have been a vicious murdering rapist gangster when young we have to root for him as he's really the best of a bad lot. We're treated to lengthy arty flashbacks and many heavy poignant moments, softly tender scenes giving way to scenes of brutal sadism  all in the name of so-called Realism. This, remember, is via persistence of vision viewed on a two-dimensional screen, with a fictional plot contrived to fit logically into a timeslot complemented by a stirring orchestral soundtrack you'd never get in Real Life. Leone himself said he never tried to make realist films, so why pile on the violence and smut? And to crown it all, within is a woman who apparently 'age cannot wither'. Morricone excelled himself with his score for this  like Cinema Paradiso, the film could simply not stand on its own without it, the repetitive and relentlessly moving and melancholic main themes, especially Deborah's Theme can leave you in tears and yet sometimes you don't know why. And they 'forgot' to enter it into the Oscars nominations  Doh! Also the lush orchestral version of Amapola in the dinner for 2 sequence can give you a lump in your throat, though make the most of it because the dreamlike spell is ruthlessly broken in the back of the car come the dawn. DeNiro was perfect for the role of Noodles, his highly visible semi-intelligent thought processes struggling along but almost creating a few longueurs at times. The climax seemed a bit fast with all that had gone before  you might even call it a rubbish ending (hem)  but it still fitted in well. Even the static 6 minute end credits with Morricone's music is worth watching!A helluva lot happens in these 4 hours, good and bad and happy and sad  overall brooding melancholia spurred by memories of mistakes made. I love it with all its faults, and even though at times it makes me wince it's definitely a masterpiece.",9,4,9,16 June 2007
The Mummy Returns," Preordained entertaining sequel
","Not only does the Mummy return but his friends and enemies and all the romance and adventure they brought with them in the first film. Stephen Sommers, Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah were back to do the second part of the franchise, this time up against an even more powerful adversary. Parts of the plot are amusingly retrodden from the first part too; and again not much makes or is expected to make sense.The former servant of Anubis the Scorpion King and his vast army have lain dormant for nearly five thousand years biding their time. Young Imhotep would like to control this power, meanwhile the Fraser's are chasing after them all to get back their precocious eight year old son who has been kidnapped by Imhotep, and to fight Evil with Good too of course. It's a swift film with no messing about but favourite bits out of many include the London Bus ride, the boy's journey on the train, the barmy dirigible flight, the race to get to the pyramid before dawn. With this movie it's only the ride that matters - all the way from 3067 BC to AD 1933, not the reason for it. The cgi cartoonery was laid on with a trowel but usually complemented the action even if a bit brutal at times. Fraser and Weisz certainly had a delightful rapport.It only worked because it was the same team on and off the screen - take one part of the jigsaw away and you don't have a jigsaw, witness the later disastrous part three. However I still wish it originally could've been a three-film franchise instead of two, simply because we would've had even more of this pleasantly nonsensical hokum to enjoy all these years later!",8,2,2,4 May 2015
The Artist," Homage to the Image
","A lovely sparkling film. What goes around comes around - that a French 'black & white' 'silent' film should be made and feted in 2011 is odd enough, but also that it is so good in all departments too, and with very little recourse to digital cartoonery.If you know your silent film mythology and well remember films such as A Star Is Born, Singin' In The Rain, Show People, Flesh And The Devil, Citizen Kane amongst many other referenced the story is rigidly straightforward - a big male star struggles to cope with the onslaught of sound films. He starts the slide to the bottle and suicidal thoughts while the acting career of the younger woman who loves him is in the ascendant. But the acting, production and direction are all perfectly in time: the pose struck and the camera movements as starry-eyed Peppy got off the tram; the very close ups of George's expansive smile (based on Gene Kelly's); Astor's – sorry, Uggi's race with a cop down the pavement to save George. In the Golden Age movies like this were churned out by Hollywood studios at dozens per week, it has to be so much more involved and convoluted nowadays. Now nearly everything strives to be Art first then Entertainment but nearly everything fails. My daughter and I watched it expecting to find a few holes somewhere, I couldn't really fault it and the only thing that jarred with her was she thought Berenice Bejo looked too 21st century. Poor old Uggi though – apparently shot dead accidentally near the end by George! Well, did you see him again after the gun went off?I enjoyed it, as a triumph of discipline – a reminder of how good films (silent or sound) can be whether when they're made without the routine bestiality that's always required nowadays. Based on my extremely limited knowledge of modern movies I would say it deserves to win every award everywhere in 2012 and hope it does for years to come, but whether it deserves all the hype is another matter.",8,6,11,25 January 2012
Where Eagles Dare," Dynamite!
","Of which Clint Eastwood had a seemingly endless supply, while the Nazis had none and were also poor shots to a man too. This is how to make a motion picture and entertain people; belief has to be suspended, because of course, all fictional motion pictures are fantasies and are the produce of many peoples imaginations. It's a relentless and engrossing action-packed ride - if some people can't like it they must analyse things too much and without a trace of a sense of humour.Wartime British army special team are sent to rescue an American General confined by the Nazis in a supposedly impenetrable castle in cold and snowy Bavaria. Except as usual with the British secret services there are many traitors around who craggy Richard Burton has to unmask as well. It's all very stiff upper lip stuff, even the token Yank Eastwood (that's why the Hell he was there) appears as a semi-regal second-rate punk. Between the two of them they bring to their enemy widespread devastation and anachronisms and are totally unflappable while outstaring Death. It's obviously all the result of Burton's character possessing an innate seventh and eighth-sense for danger. Favourite bits: the multiple confrontation between the interested parties at the castle dinner table; the bloody escape from the castle (there were even people left alive!); Burton improbably jumping from one cable car to another; the explosive chasing of the bus to the impossible catching of the instant airplane; many others. How any film can leave in a shot of the entire camera crew reflected in a window and get away with it shows you how much panache this film had whatever the errors littered in it, and how literally escapist it was to make all errors, plot devices and plot holes completely forgivable.It's so good it's still a regular slot filler on UK TV and one I've seen a shamelessly sad number of times now to know almost by heart. It helps that We Won, I think. But if you know something is enjoyable why dis it just because you've seen it before, why not enjoy it again and again? I've also liked Mars bars ever since the 1960's too. Fantastic entertainment clearly from the 1960's but not as dated as most of the tripey and trippy films made in that decade.",8,3,5,14 December 2013
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A stench in the nostrils
","Someone lent me the then brand new BFI VHS of this appalling film in 2002, he didn't want it back and I couldn't blame him. I saw it the once, but finally threw the tape in the wheelie bin a couple of weeks ago without bothering with it again. I was fascinated by the hoohah it caused in 1975 and always felt I had to see it to see which side of the fence I was on, but regretted my curiosity afterwards. Curiosity killed by scat. In fact, since then any curiosity I used to have to see heavy arty modern films has dropped to near zero saving me both time and money, so I can thank Salo for something at least (meaning 1 mark and a belated comment marking garbage joining the rest of the garbage, a ceremonial act meant to be self-purging and of repentance.De Sade wrote his book specifically to appal everyone except perverts, it was turned here into unlovely clumsy pointless porn ostensibly factual about Fascists made by a fascist and intended for fascists. Think of: What if customers had paid for guided tours of Belsen when it was in full swing, and you've got it. If you're watching it and not getting any kicks but feel you must hang on to the bitter end for a moral or even a message you will be disappointed, for there is none in the film itself. Years later I can say that fairly cheerfully, but back then it would have been with a sense of horror, with the despair of having wasted my time and blighted my mind for nothing. It tells you more about the human condition in perverts wanting to get such vileness out there into the perversion market, and perverts pretending ordinary filth is meaningful Art in self defence or in denial. In that sense only is it relevant and a metaphor for the problems of the world. The biggest problem is capitalism and all of its manifold perversions which will remain blissfully unaffected by people watching films like this who support capitalism and therefore all of its manifold perversions. There must be thousands - millions! - of sleazy bdsm films in porn shops or on the internet that are artier and with more meaning than this, honest hardcore made by little teams of perverts not interested in hiding behind Art, interested only in getting people to buy the product, get off on it and come back for more. Timid Pasolini thankfully was hidebound by some ordinary conventions anyway  no penetration for instance (remember how excited the perverts at Film Four and the BFI were when Ai No Corrida was finally passed for release a few years back!); no animals, snuff or worse, but plenty of hairy naked cattle either being herded around, tortured or eating pretend poo off the floor was his bag. For what it's worth the acting, direction and production values are all rather crappy too, but that's the least of its problems. Because of the polarity of opinions it's sadly guaranteed a very long shelf life with future generations either getting off or throwing up  is this what film as an art form is all about? Can real Art meant for ordinary people ever be lighthearted or inspiring again, or must it always be nonsensical or pornography made by talentless wasters like Pasolini or as nowadays mainly from well meaning anal retentives from in favour demographics? What it boils down to is: Did Pasolini win his geologically brief immortality with an open hearted kiss to the world or with a cynical fart in our faeces? It was banned for decades  I wish our Betters at the BBFC still had had a vestige of moral fibre to have kept it that way for those unwary of us still left with some, but that genie's out of the bottle now. Censors used to be paid to protect the general public by filthying up their minds instead of ours, now they seem to be paid solely to help entice innocent folk into admiring debauchery  one not so fine day it'll be on TV at teatime, and they'll be partly responsible. She's not likely to be interested in this but I'd be very sad if my 28 yo daughter ever saw this even though she's quite inured to mindless sex and violence on film as along with cgi cartoonery it's all de rigueur nowadays. It's almost as bad as Blazing Saddles, which was a porn of a different colour but at least was quite forgettable. However if you watch this I'm afraid you won't ever be quite the same again, which after all was one of the Marquis de Pasolini's aims. My advice is to think of nice things to do or see instead  you could fall asleep watching the wife gardening, or see the 1939 Wizard Of Oz for the twentieth time for example, it being a true Art film. The point is: keep your innocence - you won't miss anything of any positive worth so don't ever give way to watch this  unless you feel you'd enjoy being raped.",1,7,24,29 July 2008
Limitless," Remember what the Dormouse said > Feed your head
","This was inexplicably recommended to me by one of my movie-expert friends, an expert who I think doesn't watch any films older than brand new. If there's a next time I'll make sure I'll tell him my opinion on this one and that The Wizard Of Oz is one of my favourite smart films, he may have heard of that one.Bradley Cooper plays a loser who gets to pop a mind-expanding pill that changes his life; as in one pill makes you larger, one pill makes you small blah. It's all slickly and sickly handled, Cooper begins his rise to wealth and power on the back of a limited amount of the drug, whilst brutal gangsters and other assorted thuggish users are out to nobble him for his stash. It's an engrossing plot for the most part with only a couple of gross-out bits â€“ didn't see the slurpy bit coming with the Russian gangster, but didn't want to either. Cooper puts in his usual sterling performance as the main man and he's in almost every scene. As with all fantasies you're forced to take a number of plot turns for granted and follow the relative outcome algorithms along to the end, either to the end of the film or more likely to the end of the supply of drugs. At least the spice on Frank Herbert's science-fictional Dune set ten thousand years in the future was inexhaustible! But as with all things, the ending comes and with it the only twist possible: however if you're not prescient reference the result of Paul Muad'dib's junkie experience on Dune. My report back on this is it's well made violent hokum but just not my cup of tea.",7,0,0,27 July 2014
The Da Vinci Code," Authentication and therefore perpetuation of mumbo jumbo
","Interested in the hype surrounding this for a long time I finally got to see the film tonight, it happening to be buried somewhere amongst UK Channel 5's usual shedload of brain numbing adverts. For films like this that require some thinking I find these many interruptions more than a distraction and almost a hindrance to acceptance of either film or advert.Complicated and convoluted tale of various goodies and baddies chasing after that ultimate holy grail, The Holy Grail. During the chases you can lose track of who is good, bad or both apart from the earnest and always dependable Tom Hanks. And by the end I had denouement fatigue, so many pre or misconceptions were reversed or blown away that it almost became a comedy for me. I think they found the HG by the end, although another last minute 'discovery' by Hanks overshadowed even that. I thought the ending of Pygmalion was the most contrived I'd ever seen until this - all that was revealed to me was nearly 3 hours had gone and that my TV was still on the same side.There's usually at least two things I take away from films with religious messages: 1/ just how destructive fanatics of all kinds (whether believers unbelievers or neithers) can be; 2/ just how works of fiction such as this can end up authenticating the subject by serious treatment and therefore invigorating the superstition they are fictionalising. Also I suppose it's incredibly sad that so many intelligent people of all persuasions got so swallowed up with this nonsense they partially jettisoned common sense - whereas all religious or anti-religious fanatics jettison all common sense. My Catholic father in law would never watch this on principle! Well, he didn't miss anything conceptually vital here except maybe a good laugh.It's fascinating and extra-thought-provoking hokum! A well made slick time-passer cleverly mixing fact fiction and fantasy and God willing something I'll watch again - but apart from fanatics does anyone really know or care where the key to the code to the key to properly appreciating it is to be found?",7,1,2,28 August 2011
Thor," Simplistic yet Thortful
","The closest I've ever got to Odin & Thor is through The Vikings; this was slightly different fare to that classic. I didn't expect much from this but got lots which surprised me – it's the usual Marvel superhero cgi cartoon movie, but taken at a cracking pace, shaved of gristle and utterly daft. Quite good in fact, although I was warned by a few friendly movie experts it was naff – however I always bear in mind none of those particular experts have ever seen or intend to see Citizen Kane.Hammer wielding impetuous youth Thor is thrown out of celestial Asgard by his all powerful father Odin, crashing to Earth, while his brother Loki machinates for overall control by apparently siding with the grunting red-eyed baddies from the Dark Side. Time is saved not only by accepting the universality of the English language but that standard plot devices involving falling in love, straightforward fight scenes, and metaphorical battles between Good and Evil are implicitly consented to as well. So many things are simply assumed that it gets a bit confused at times, and any characterisation is completely jettisoned as not worth the time – and in kids movies like this it isn't worth the time. The cartoonery is swift and relentless but atmospheric and not as senseless as other similar efforts, such as Man Of Steel for example. The contrast between the serious ethereal world and the flippant real world is cleverly handled, almost impressive and reminded me of The Fountain in its doom-laden commentary. Different story strands all come together satisfactorily, whilst Thor or is it Brad Pitt lopes about suitably heroically. A nice one excellent in its inconsequentiality and well worth watching – Gary Son Of Jan has so decreed.",7,1,2,12 July 2014
The Fountain," Om
","OK, try to start with a positive: Aronofsky's Fountain was a much better film than Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. He always seems to be straddling the line between arty indiscipline and sincere message, and to me usually falling between both points.Grief-struck surgeon's wife is dying in the present, meanwhile accidentally saves tumour-ridden monkey's life with extract from Tree Of Life, while man and metaphor get mixed up with storyboard inclusions from the past and future. Well made, sometimes messy, but with some astoundingly deft emotional imagery, a laudable refusal to use cgi cartoonery and reasonably believable acting by the main characters played by Jackman and Weisz, it moves swiftly to the confusing finale. And with eye-cutting cinematography. Nearing the various ends you can only hope for the last pieces of the jigsaw, however none are given, but 'everything's OK' anyway. It's arty all right, but personally true Art has to make some/any kind of sense for an afterlife – this will probably join the heap of stuff that is interesting and gorgeous to look at but ultimately fluffy and superficial. On the comparable thematic level I'd lump it with Buster Keaton's forgotten Three Ages – no one digs that out nowadays, and only dedicated film historians would look up Griffiths' Intolerance. The Spanish story reminded me of a true Art film, Hertzog's Aguirre. It's only going to be a Revelatory Experience for the young, inexperienced, heavy or intoxicated, the rest of us have too many problems. I eagerly compared notes with my daughter - but (thankfully) she was as confused and much less impressed than I was. We're dealing here with a fantasy that strives for authenticity but apparently with Mayans who speak Mayan with English subtitles and with Spaniards who speak English fluently. Those dazzlingly sparkling images of Weisz's full face as the Spanish Queen are the money shots!I enjoyed it to a point simply because I don't think that there is a point – it's a romance with lots of panache and dignity and very little swearing, sex and violence, which are always bonus points in my unfinished book. I can enjoy a Mars bar without having to know its chemical composition. He's a markedly talented director so I expect Aronofsky will one day eventually make a meaningful movie without trying so hard to be something completely different.",7,3,6,10 July 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," When You Wish Upon A Star
","Why should any open-minded open-hearted person want to dis this particular film? The same as with millions of other people it's my favourite Christmas film, and a classic I've always enjoyed for all kinds of wholesome reasons, with a heartwarming moral I know I am and which everyone should be the richer for the experience.James Stewart has plans to do what he wants to and travel the world but is constantly thwarted with those plans and ends up not going and staying all his life in his crummy little town as a bank manager. His is a long story of self-sacrifice until a crisis is reached and the film veers into a charming and cathartic fantasy. Everyone played their parts perfectly, but Stewart was the essential part: it wouldn't have worked as well without his usual affecting intensity, the gulping emotion he displayed was knockout. The story was an excellent All-American updated retread of Christmas Carol with the moral surely just as decent and incontrovertible. It's worn very well, and I've never needed to watch it with rose-tinted spectacles or an excess of seasonal slush – the first time I saw it UK Channel 4 showed it one July presumably after the copyright had been allowed to lapse in the 80's. On the other hand as the decades have gone by the hype has been ratcheted up to hopefully sell Christmas DVD's, streams etc; there were only about twenty people in the local cinema to see it last night – a ten-day run is probably too much.I like slushy sentimentality with a strong and timeless moral – that is if it's handled well, as was this lovely little film. Frank Capra, I preferred your It Happened One Night, but thank you for making It's A Wonderful Life and I hope you've got your wings. Money can't buy you love but love sure can buy you money!",9,1,4,20 December 2014
Die Hard," An uplifting experience with dirty vests
","Die Hard is a marvellous 80's film, I can't say that for many of that decade... thinking of this one I can't think of another as good. It turned out to be Willis's magnum opus, and a severe case of type-casting developed afterwards for him.I suppose I watch it nearly every time it's on TV (so far always UK ITV), does that make me a die-hard Die Hard viewer? ITV always muck about with it, editing the violence or swearing, or like last night both simply to squeeze the end in before midnight! I'm not one for violence depicted in modern day films, ie since 1954, but I think it's ridiculous nowadays to part edit a film for timings, especially one a shed-load of viewers will have seen over and over again! They think: screw them, their memories will have to compensate for all the missing bits, we have to get to the adverts on time.The film flows effortlessly, and easily makes you swallow all the stereotypes and (mainly Christmas) corn it doles out along the way. The portrayal of the arrogant deputy and FBI men make me cringe a bit, especially post 9/11, but as they're pivotal in holding our interest in the events outside the building must be endured.It's a pity DH2/3 were so poor in comparison, maybe if they'd had another emergency in the Nakatomi Towers it would have worked better! After all, the building itself was the biggest star in the movie!",8,2,3,19 December 2004
Psycho," Director's Cuts
","When this was shown on UK TV as a classic for the first time in the mid '70's I considered myself a horror film fan and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Since then of course the Hollywood horror film has 'progressed' to the stage where only perversion and gore are considered fit entertainment meaning most people today would sadly now probably equate Psycho to their ideas of Mickey Mouse. However it remains to me the best of its kind, and as violent and sleazy as I'd want anything to get. Will tomorrow's film buffs think the Saw movies of today laughably non-violent too?Woman steals money from employer and scrams but unfortunately runs into homicidal maniac who polishes her off as she's getting second thoughts  about coming clean! Leigh's shower scene is justly famous – I guess Hitch the voyeur would have been tickled by the microscopic attention it still gets. There was even a stultifying gigantic slow motion frame by frame movie exhibition in London in 2006 by some idle Arthead extending the 40 seconds into 6 or 7 hours. Really worthwhile to have a stab at! When I was a kid Arbogast getting it at the top of the stairs startled me the most, although if you see it again you wonder how he could defy gravity while dying. That moment with Perkins biting his fingernails as the car stops sinking into the mud! It has a fantastic plot (in the best sense), with Hitch pulling out all of the cinematic stops he could think of, that keeps you hooked to the pervy climax and thoughtful ending. As with a few other films, such as Once Upon A Time In America, the music score is integral and vital as Hitch recognised – without Herrmann's zigzag music you might as well have been watching a (better) Corman.If something is labelled 'classic' it doesn't have to be good or feelgood as well, but Psycho certainly was the first two.",8,1,2,3 February 2008
All Quiet on the Western Front," Babes In Arms
","I first saw this at 10 years old, it made a pacifist out of me before I knew what one was. It's not that simple of course: no one gets through life being totally pacific, but I draw the line at trying to kill strangers for my Masters or strangers trying to kill me for theirs. Literally a Milestone film this was the first Great talkie, its primitiveness and simplicity increasing its stark lustre. Film makers learnt quickly how to be more subtle at propaganda but sometimes a sincere message makes a point better.German boy is indoctrinated by school mouthpiece of the caviar-guzzling class to go to war, he does with stars in his eyes, loses the stars, tries not to get killed, that's all. The squalor and horror of trench warfare in WW1 is relentlessly hammered home  was this how deathlessly romantic Homer's siege of Ilium should have really looked? There isn't any tragic background music or heavy concepts ground out by the main characters to distract - everyone is an ordinary guy whose thoughts are clay. During WW1 representatives of British, French, German and Russian arms manufacturers regularly met in Switzerland to trade, with the blessings of their respective governments. Without them there wouldn't have been a WW1 or this film either. The young Lew Ayres played his heart out, a decade later in WW2 he was a Conscientous Objector. On the journey we're shown Behn's useless harrowing death, Kemmerich's amputation and useless boots, the French soldier uselessly trying to kill Ayres in the crater but not succeeding much to Ayres later passionate useless regret, the Dying Room in the useless hospital  all vividly memorable scenes amongst many others. But none more so as war-bitten Ayres' electrifying diatribe returning to the classroom near the end  telling the kids how it is but unfortunately not providing the answer: Just Say No, and in those days, Scram. The useless but heartbreakingly poignant ending is the last straw: if you have tears prepare to shed them now.A classic film with a classic message that will apply as long as class based society does. If you too thought the whole world had changed since then just look around, to Iraq/Afghanistan, Chechnya, Somalia, Colombia, Spain et al.",9,7,10,16 March 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The best of the bunch but I'm looking forward to the next instalment
","Possibly perversely I enjoyed this instalment - but is that only because it's probably the last? I've more or less enjoyed all of Peter Jackson's extremely condensed Tolkien heavily-edited interpretations, usually less and none of them have inspired me to read the books. All of the films kept a lot of people in work, creative people and the banks happy and audiences mesmerised so in a sense it's a shame it has to end – couldn't they squeeze a quadrilogy of The Simarillion to keep the gravy train rolling?It opens with a fiery flying monster getting his violent come-uppance amidst relentless carnage above Lake-town; then the title. I thought Smaug the magic dragon was a fantastic character, gone too soon. Then began the main carnage with a mix of rumbustious racism and feeble posturing from a motley assemblage of concrete stereotypes (the most glaring still being that perceived Ugliness equals Evil and so-called Betters have Brains). But if War Is Hell no one in here was to blame - the hundreds of men women and children who got themselves slaughtered in this film may have been consoled by that thought but I wasn't. I tend to mentally switch off during modern cgi cartoonery battle sequences but I would've missed most of this film if I had; and apparently it took up only one chapter of the original book. As with the five other films I wondered idly about the ancient hordes of workers, peasants and slaves that would have been required to build such mammoth cities and buildings – no one in the current Middle Earth seemed to be involved in creating anything, even food or clothes. As politicians and terrorists have always found it's easier to destroy than create, so film-makers always find viewers are more entranced by destruction (as a form of creation) than construction. It was nice to see oldë Christopher Lee kicking such violent ass, strange to glimpse giant worms used merely as plot-device escapees from Dune, weird to wonder of the true significance of the Arkenstone in the book as there was none in the film. However, it's a film of tremendous imagination and scope, small plot holes and non sequiturs are entirely understandable and forgivable.Too many damn people died in here for me to care about any of the important characters who croaked, although even I would have been surprised if the littlest hobo hero had met his doom too. Overall, I'm still determined to never read the books but all being well I'll spend a week on a LOTR&H Fest sometime, with Part 7 being a night of silence - it might just make more sense to me if seen with the others in context, and before I've a chance to forget all that went before. We shall not see its like again, hopefully: the poignant end credit marathon sings it all.",8,7,15,9 February 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," 'Wanna know a secret?'
","It's spellbinding! I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song 'Wishing', and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's 'inanimate' body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art! Highbrows probably don't like it because it was charming and incredibly popular, so does any normal person in the world dislike this film, and if so, why?",9,34,42,20 March 2006
Inception," A fun idea for a flight of fantasy
","This is a breathtaking science fiction film to watch and its 2 hours 20 minutes sped by for me. Even if it borrowed a lot from Matrix, Orphee, even Kane at the climax, and others, it was so confident and assured in the depiction and dissection of its nonsense world I couldn't help but be very impressed. So what if the plot apparently bulges with Real World non sequiteurs and Dream World paradoxes – as recommended to a character in the film (and by Cocteau in Belle Et La Bete) we have to take a leap of faith. It's why so many people believe in a God.A team of mind altering thieves (Extractors) are recruited and hired by a billionaire capitalist to plant an idea via dreams (Inception) in a rival billionaire capitalist's mind to break up his empire and thus preserve profit margins. As you might or might not imagine it's not so straightforward, leading to a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream and limbo  at least. The acting was good, however the characters were basically 2D and although DeCaprio's was fleshed out a little more I didn't empathise with any of them, but the plot was the thing after all! There's no compromise: it's tortuous to follow at times and relentlessly fast paced throughout – the first 10 minutes were incomprehensible to me but gradually it became as clear as mud, until even I saw the ending coming. My modern-film-savvy daughter was on hand to act as interpreter but we had to lean on each other and promise a re-view next year sometime. I would add that the actual process of putting people under was thankfully skipped over and Michael Caine's usual death-touches were blissfully brief.On first and second thoughts I recommend this as a film made in 2010 that has absolutely no swearing, no sex, not much violence, a 'realistic' amount of cgi cartoonery, but a well made engrossing storyline instead.",8,6,13,26 December 2010
Arrival," Um
","What do you get if you cross The Fountain with Independence Day? I hooted with laughter at both of those films at the time, but after seeing Arrival they suddenly appear stately and meaningful. And at least I didn't haven't to squint in the dimness of it all. The over-use of TV news and gasp TV news seen on laptops to tell the story in here grated with me, it always looks like a lazy script when they fall back on that old fashioned and hackneyed trick. Now add incredibly old fashioned and hackneyed art-house 'music' comprising random burps farts and groans to this mix.The plot appears as dim and grey as the film: 12 gargantuan alien stone peanuts float down on Earth causing consternation among all the ants in God's garden, turn into gargantuan mushroom caps and after the phoning to a Chinese general of his wife's dying words start gargantuanly fizzing away in mid-air - apparently job done. Er.I'll try again. Expert linguist Amy Adams put in a good performance as usual, but what to make of her deathly serious demeanour for the entire film is the big question. She didn't even smile at Jeremy Renner playing a brainy physicist press-ganged into playing a spare tool. We're told that successful communication with the aliens could take years to accomplish and we can also guess there's years of boredom ahead, when Adams segues into a higher state of consciousness and finds out in seconds they want to help us now as they want something from humanity way in the future. Er.As bonkers as The Fountain and as gungho as ID. The use of flashback memories brimming over with loss and longing to a heart tugging string quartet is the big similarity to the Fountain though, and it works fine again. If you're looking for lightheartedness you won't find it here, or a meaningful examination of the political motives of alien and Man either. Just another arty excuse to explore the overwhelming emotions we all have and can froth to, as we've all lost someone or something in our lives. Including these 116 linear minutes I knew I'd never get back before the film had even started.",7,5,11,28 February 2017
Prometheus," I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
","Well, back to it again – there's no hope for humanity, as usual only luck can save us from this foreign object. This looks like being a series of prequels to Alien, now delivered digitally so absolutely no laughs for cinema audiences at animatronic dicks being pulled across dinner tables. It's impressive on TV, I would have been bowled over at the pictures – and left doubly depressed too.This is a tale of a multi-trillion dollar spaceship being carelessly fitted out with a disparate set of lacksadaisical opaque people to find the potential creators of the human race. They find a planet where they expected it and instantly hit on a likely looking alien structure to investigate. It's an intersection of Forbidden Planet, Silent Running, Alien, and Mission To Mars, and at this stage I'm not sure which I prefer. I had to suspend belief in that people were still smoking in 2093, bozos were blithely marching into sinister dark and damp alien spaceship interiors without any cares, and that the Isle Of Skye was not an island made entirely of spent uranium and tarmac. It's hugely impressive and superficial at the same time, so much happens and it seems to say less than Alien did. Favorite bits: the glimpses of the olde film Lawrence Of Arabia with the late great actor Harry Fowler; if it hadn't been so nail-bitingly gruesome I could have laughed at the New Ripley speed abortion, and that she could still do all the acrobatics afterwards; the 3D mapping of the alien structure, although it reminded me of the Great Pyramid I had feared a Close Encounters remix; the Grecian marble-like creators; the  nod to the original robot decapitation; the eye-cutting cgi cartoonery creating a soulless world populated by soulless people; really being quite pleased that nearly all of the characterless characters had bitten the dust.Hardly any of us know how to make a 5 minute film up to Melies standards, nevertheless most of us are film experts. Some of us only have opinions: this was a cold film which was very enjoyable and very forgettable.",7,1,3,5 November 2012
The Woman in Black," Harry Potter And The Good Gothic Gloom
","Two things I freely admit in advance: I'm not a big fan of horror films made nowadays, and I do tend to make fun of the modern fashion of films of all kinds to over-rely on the use of cgi cartoonery. However, this one is an exception. It uses a necessary amount of cartoonery to help generate a spooky atmosphere, and although shocks galore has no gore.Young employee sent by firm of solicitors to none too friendly North to help wrap up a dead person's estate, an estate apparently situated next to a village full of weird yokels with secrets and in the middle of swampy washland, gloomy woods and a doom laden time warp. For the first hour it's really good (pity it wasn't two hours), backwards and forwards in a dark candle-dependant Gothic house and grounds, unfortunately it then gradually becomes rather ordinary with the ending telegraphed to the viewer in advance. Instead of a walking into the sunset ending nowadays a walking into the spotlighted grimy fog does. Every trick in the book was trotted out to great effect, I noted all the obvious bits from three of my favourite films The Innocents, The Haunting and Diabolique. Serious young man Daniel Radcliffe said less than the dog he was with, and could've played Leonardo DiCaprio's son in Titanic and got away with it, but was to me surprisingly good in the main role.But I was surprised by how good the entire film was overall, a judicious mix of shocks and cartoonery that actually worked and even has me hoping I will be spared long enough to revisit it!",8,0,1,27 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," So dark only Batman can see in this one
","This is a fascinating journey all right, and one even further into the arty dark fantasy this franchise has become. I admit: I prefer my Batman with the non-cynical eye-winking humour of Adam West and shaken not stirred, however I've followed the caped crusader's descent into the gutter with interest over the decades. Who hasn't?A complicated story line has Bruce Wayne in ultimate charge of a rather dangerous potential nuclear fusion reactor, which is stolen by a distinctly nasty set of baddies ostensibly led by a chunky man in a muzzle: Wayne vs Bane as it were for control of Gotham City. At least that's what we're led to believe. I saw this the same weekend as Skyfall – instead of chasing after a little list there they're chasing after a set of fingerprints here. An awful lot happens in here – it is a very long film after all – and is nearly always engrossing and inventive. As usual in these comic book adaptations everyone has a lifetime's worth of emotional excess baggage weighing them – and us – down with gallons of heartfelt yearnings, observations and threats. Especially boring is butler Alfred (Michael Caine) continually exasperated with his Master and whinging endlessly about his apparent death-wish. The section in the prison with Bale sweatily trying to get out of the funnel would have turned Luis Bunuel green with envy, a nonsensical waste of time which even with the end reveal can't dispel. Also what gives with the modern fascination for the sometimes incomprehensible guttural mutterings by the cast – Christian Bale got so wrapped up in this rule he theatrically growled/grunted out a comment about the 'shitizens' – how apt! Favorite bits: the Gotham shitizens putting on trial their previous oppressors, with Bane understudying Robespierre in the Reign Of Terror; the big suspension bridge being blown up in its middle yet not collapsing; a whole class of schoolchildren out of the whole city were nearly saved; the thought of 3,000 policemen trapped underground for 3 months – it must have been Hell in there!; Batman having his vertebrae re-aligned – felt that!; the views of grimy Wollaton Hall in Nottingham standing as Wayne Manor; the excellent production values and direction generally.Very enjoyable, not to be taken too seriously and absolutely not worth anyone dying for. But Batman has almost grown up - if only Kurosawa had lived long enough, he might have wanted to direct the next one!",8,3,6,20 November 2012
Black Panther," Colourful caper
","It seems a long time since the Civil War, this Marvel Cinematic Instalment goes on to show what was happening in Wakanda before the Infinity War starts.Whether it was overhyped or overcooked I know not: I never follow the hypesters or their drivel. Hype is always Overhype as far I'm concerned.The acting was OK, the script as nonsensical I could desire and satisfied the kid in me; maybe I should've left the subtitles on but that happens all the time nowadays! The cgi cartoonery was perfect, almost believable in its enormous scope. At one point the baddie says Death is preferable to Bondage, but the historical statistics wouldn't support such a view - and besides, every living creature on the planet is born into bondage to life unto death. The only difference with humans the world over is that we can also be slaves to capitalism. I won't dwell on the admiring loyalty shown by the common people in here to noble blood royalty!Overall entertaining, even if it couldn't help being chockful of someone else's social, racial and political opinions.",8,1,4,2 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Superman vs Godzilla
","I promised myself after watching Man Of Steel (all being well) to steel myself and see just one more Dark Crap film and this was it, the 3 hour Dawn Of Justice Ultimate Edition. Is there a Coherent Edition out there too? I wasn't disappointed – as I expected I didn't enjoy it; I'll probably stick with light-hearted Marvel from now on for this kind of entertainment, because ultimately Time's running out.Batman has a lifelong violent grudge against Superman for being responsible for his parents' deaths and machinates to kill him for the first 150 minutes. Then, upon the utterance of a single word by Superman to the grunted astonishment of Batman all sins are forgiven for the final half hour and they become allies in attempting to defeat Evil. Unbelievable, they're living in a fantasy world if they expect us to swallow that! Then, the film nosedived from being mildly incoherent and boring into intensely incoherent and laughable. I thought the tinny music for the relentless multi-coloured patterns on the screen which were supposed to represent a cgi conflagration suited the Godzilla/Hobbit monster perfectly though – no doubt Warners owed any Asian backers something. There seemed to be more newspapers and TV news telling the 'story' than usual – but do kids nowadays remember those antiquated types of news outlets? The film started and ended with gloomy grimy graveyards with much grunting and griping; there has to be an overarching moral there somewhere. And don't expect any light-bulb moments in here! Carnage is wreaked and Death would be stalking the Land for weeks afterwards but none of the twerps protecting the planet cared a fig about that. Affleck was fascinating with his ridiculous grunting, Cavill was a thoughtless sulky yob, Gadot should have been with someone else, I felt sorry for Amy Adams in yet another hopeless film.I grew up with the nonsensical 1960's Batman, but unfortunately these particular superheroes have been allowed to grow up superselfish and superfluous.",6,4,7,22 January 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Me Thor, you Jane
","It sure was Dark all right, they weren't wrong there. It's as well to remember this is Marvel-Disney; so what if there's the odd mix of dark menace and light-hearted frivolity, it's only a motion picture after all. I enjoyed the first Thor but the second was even more stylish and enjoyable if weighed down by even more nonsense-science.Er, basically primeval dark forces attack Asgard – and Greenwich, London – pretty obviously via gravity space-time wormholes, Thor's girlfriend Jane is accidentally invested with a sinister Mcguffin power that is chased after by the head baddie (whose physog reminded me of a young Davros from Dr Who), Thor doesn't trust Loki and Loki doesn't blame him, and cartoon bones and concrete are crunched remorselessly from the off. On the way to the crackers climax Thor obediently hangs his hammer up on a handy coat rack and decides to catch a handy tube to get to the final battle in time. Light comedic touches like those always go down well with me, I love panache when trying sell a ridiculous plot or watching a film revelling in brazen brainlessness. It's also the first film I've ever seen to contain a last minute killer twist, then a sinister teaser for the next film, and finally a droll comedy moment to end on but one that would definitely have dire implications for anyone happening to be walking by at that moment! As with the first film I thought Tom Hiddleston stole the show, and Idris Elba had a marvellously enigmatic character to portray. And again, the serious reason for some of the warring sides to fight with swords and some with guns escapes me, as it did at 11 years old reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series. The cgi cartoonery seemed perfect to me, capturing flawless vistas of other worlds and impressive violence alike to these old eyes.The kids would probably make much more sense of it all than I could, and maybe even follow the swift impenetrably dark battles successfully – me, I went along with it in the right spirit and thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean why bother giving it a chance at all unless you want it to work?",7,1,1,9 August 2014
Lucy," Ninety-Nine And A Half (Won't Do)
","Scarlet Johansson seems to like these kind of roles: expressionless and powerful – after Under The Clobber and Avengers I think she's cornered the market. Her face, and by now her persona too lend themselves perfectly to the display of vapid heaviness; personally speaking good to look at but not someone with whom you can empathise. But maybe lucky everyone else in this film is personally speaking ordinary looking and/or ugly. As long as she keeps picking fairly interesting scripts this is her golden period.In this she unwittingly becomes embroiled as a mule with a terrible boss of a machine-like drug gang in Taiwan and has a literally incredible naughty drug sewn inside her to sell on to the endless suckers in Europe. The story is what happens after she's charmingly kicked repeatedly in the stomach by some pointless nutter releasing the secrets of the universe within her so she goes from 10% to 100% total awareness. In other words, a techno-version of Frank Herbert's 1960's tub-thumper Dune and what happened to Paul and Alia updated for tablet screen-swiping generations. And it is a trip. The potential for the story was vast, indeed almost er Limitless, only what a shame it was allowed to dwindle and disappear into a nonsense computerised climax/vortex, or maybe anus would be better – with the full possibilities of Johansson's heightened awareness unrealised. It may be that in her heightened state she took everything for granted, but that's not much consolation to the hordes of thwarted viewers who couldn't take anything for granted, who saw tantalising glimpses of her kicking ass in various outlandish robotic ways and a car chase almost boring in its proportions. Various people are slaughtered peremptorily throughout, mainly baddies but the one I objected to was the poor random guy whose medical operation was interrupted by her shooting him dead explaining glibly to the surgeon that he wouldn't have pulled through anyway. I could never empathise with an executioner even if they could be right. It's a pretty emphatic if trite end proving to me yet again if I needed it that the way forward is in flash drives; I hope but doubt there's a USB connection to a sequel.I don't love Lucy however I did 100% enjoy it, the time (as being of course the only meaningful measurement) flew by but I did see the film therefore it must exist. The seediness, violence and lack of humour definitely exist along with the artifice, artificiality and artistry within these mere ninety minutes. So the premise is fiction - yawn - what else can be really expected of a fiction film? They Saved Hitler's Brain was also fiction, apologies if that's considered a spoiler. But look around yourself – look at the mess homo sapiens has made for millennia, is making and will continue to make of our only home, and maybe we should think the 10% human brain-usage could be a 90% brainless over-estimate.",8,5,12,3 December 2014
Amélie," The Mark Of Zorrini
","I liked Amelie a lot, even if it needed a bit more discipline in the tasteful stakes and tightening up on the running time. A film that opens with sperm and a live birth, continues later with the 15 orgasms blossoming in Paris at that moment, and is blasé in that true little shop of horrors, a porn shop, is not really my idea of a feel-good film. There's too many witty uncomfortably cynical moments in Amelie for that.Having said that, it's an extremely confident, stylish (French style), expertly colourful and cleverly directed comedy movie, where life's daily eccentricities are totted up and trotted out as being meaningful by their mundaneness. Par example, are you one who hangs the toilet paper top rolling outside or in? Have you always put your left sock on first to ward off toothache? Then get these concepts out there in digital widescreen and make people feel good they're not alone!An engrossing and pleasant enough two hours, but ultimately the feel-good movies I know I'll going back to include It's A Wonderful Life, Greyfriars Bobby or, as my daughter pointed out, Pollyanna!",8,2,5,29 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," For the kids
","Back in 1977 I enjoyed the original Star Wars, all six passable follow-ups since have only left me wondering why I bothered with them. This time, for the last time.The preliminary rolling script tells you in advance all you need to know: it's straight-faced and interminable - by the second paragraph I was glazing over. It's an updated cgi copy of the original, only right down to the corny plot and hackneyed characterisations as well. Although the threadbare Nazi comparison looms larger in this. If you've seen the original and aren't a kid or are childish you've no need to see this – the franchise will survive and thrive without us, and vv. Film companies have long written over 50's out of their plans – although Hans Solo was humorously shown up with Routine Early Onset in here. And just for the record for the kids: don't bother watching the originals either in case you choke with laughter on your cocaine - What you have with this film is something that will live on in your memories and imaginations.It's a well-made time-passer, but I got so little out of this film that it's made up my mind to watch any more instalments only by pure chance, during post-Christmas dinner subsidence. Let's see, that'll be The Empire Awakens And Strikes Back followed by The Returned Jedi Awakens won't it?",7,2,11,22 May 2016
Godzilla," Monster Fail
","I had to do something else less important so decided to watch this with half an eye to save time. Even that was a waste of time as I got nothing from it at all in nearly two hours. They spent USD 160 million to make a poorly executed, grimy coloured, dark and hopelessly inadequate b film and made a profit! And some highly paid film critics actually praised this – all I wonder now is how much they got paid for their misleading recommendations. The only good thing is it kept a lot of talented people in a job, including the highly paid critics too I suppose.It starts fairly well as a Close Encounters rip-off, a man and his son trying to get into nuclear power station the brass hats have put out of bounds claiming ridiculous radiation poisoning for some lying inexplicable reason. They're soon let into the secret as the secret breaks loose. The remaining ninety minutes drag by in grimy darkness, with admittedly great sporadic cgi cartoonery – although there were far more stretches of dark with only farty noises which reminded me of the great Fred The Oyster and other sound effects from the Goon Show. Apart from periods of incoherent messiness the character, monster and plot development was nil; at least in the original Godzilla everybody and everything was cardboard and more real. My own favourite was Godzilla vs King Kong, what was yours? This sentimental-macho techno-hokum may be pleasing to the psyche of modern Japanese viewers but personally bring back The Prince Of Space or The Neptune Men anyday.Did I mention the dark griminess, only broken by the depressing dysentery green of everything? John Wayne made Iwo Jima look like Paradise compared to this non-splendid vision. It's probably the worst film I've half-seen for ages, doesn't do what it says on the tin, and may leave you with eye-strain.",6,4,7,9 November 2014
Looper," Time Will Tell
","I enjoyed this film a lot; you have to open your mind and travel back in time to when you were young and your mind was always open. The film needs the observer to take a loop, sorry, leap of faith because it does take some liberties with realities. It's full of exuberance, panache and loopholes but the plot contrivances don't bear up too well against post-analysis.Baddies from 2074 dispose of their enemies by sending them back through time to be shot dead and incinerated in 2044. It would be too easy to send them straight into the furnace. The main character is momentarily nonplussed when his future self (Old Brucie) is sent back for slaughter leading to (both their) getaways from the 2044 baddies. The emphasis shifts slightly from time travel to telekinesis – obviously embracing 12 Monkeys, Source Code and even Children Of The Corn. It's a bloody two-dimensional chase, with even a motive for the ultimately pointless murder of two innocent children sympathetically portrayed and glossed over. The cgi cartoonery department were overused here too, what with suspended objects monetary or animate floating around – but Inception did it better. Also if a baddie from the future was chopped up in 2044 his 2074 self wouldn't be seen to fall apart dramatically limb by limb surely? By the end no matter how tender hearted the story has got you don't feel that interested in any of the characters, even to speculating how they obviously thought time could be changed just for themselves and no one else. Didn't any of them see Joan Collins in the original Star Trek for the logic to be explained simply? And on.Engrossing, always interesting, well made and a current-time passer, thoughtful only don't think about it too much. And no, I don't want the 2 hours back.",8,1,3,1 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 1977: A galaxy much too far away
","I saw this marvellously old-fashioned hokum with my girlfriend at the packed out Pics on March 25th 1978. Exhausted at all the screen wipes by the end all we were thinking of was hopefully not waiting too long in the cold for the last bus home; so much for intergalactic travel. Star Wars was a phenomena then, and still is – although I did warn a big fan I knew at the time that it wouldn't take too long for the special effects to go dog-eared with age and even recommended Kurosawa's original to him instead. However, he probably still disdainfully thinks, along with many others that movies, indeed history, began with Star Wars.Young stereotype joins forces with a disparate group of stereotypes to save the white universe and Princess Stereotype from stereotypical space baddies in a adventurous story bordering on corny with then innovative now dated film technology. Definitely nothing wrong with any of that, just that when stripped down it's not only incredible but incredibly ordinary and merely reflects back to me some lovely sunny days from the mid '70's. Even the sinister ugly aliens had somehow listened to the cleaner music of Frank Zappa. Fancy spending trillions of trillions on an immense battleship complete with a titchy flue with a security implication. I saw Lucas's 90's cgi cartoonery revision at the Pics with my daughter, the spacecraft still wobbled and there were many white borders on display but overall his team had done a good job trying to stem the onslaughts of Time on his cash cow. Many of my favourite films are pure - and poor - old fashioned corn but no one on planet Earth thinks they're life changing works of Art in the same way as they do this monument to Luck.The film I saw was Part I full stop; if Disney ever gets to Part XXVII what if they want to do a prequel to the prequel and more pathetic re-numbering and retrospective digital title re-jigging ensues, will Lucas let them? I've always favoured the originals of anything generally and also draw the line at altering future history.I enjoy it immensely whenever it's on UK TV, as I can feel the persuasive Force of not having to think for a couple of hours and to simply enjoy the ride.",8,4,6,10 November 2013
Cloud Atlas," Cloudbusting
","So I had 3 hours to devote my attention to this film, because like Inception it takes no prisoners. You have to immerse yourself into it and concentrate on the tortuous plot otherwise there is no point; this is a digi-Intolerance on acid.Plot has Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in various guises and in various times and places linking various seemingly disparate stories together. By turns it's fun, deadly serious, tender, brutal, inane, heavy, obvious, incomprehensible, fast and ponderous: it's quite a journey. The production values are generally tremendous even when aided by cgi cartoonery, the acting, sets and make-up to these old eyes are wonderful to behold. So much happens it's impossible to convey except it's such a roller-coaster of fairly swift intercutting that (if the plot intrigues) you need to see it for yourself. Favourite bits out of many: The out of Delius amanuensis' suicide and his lovers' distraught discovery; the cops chasing the deviant revolutionaries in the future and all the flying cars almost out of Metropolis - if you pardon the pun teleportation is just around the corner, the benefits to global capitalism will ensure its development sooner rather than later; Hanks' top-hatted gravelly-voiced alter-ego in the other world almost out of Beetlejuice, a very effective startling character; Tom Gramps at the beginning and end  I wish I'd listened more to the words of the Kings Of Leon now; Berry as a hip chick in 1973 – was she and Professor Hanks supposed to be smoking a perfectly manufactured spliff? Least satisfying bit was the thumping of the Sassanachs in the pub for the modern farce section.Very entertaining nonsense, even has nice music for the 10 minute fade out, and I'll hopefully watch it again. However I prefer Intolerance - if for no other reason than because the connection between its individual stories was coherent and had a thematic integrity; the clue was in its title. This has nano connections.",8,3,9,17 February 2013
The Great Escape," POWerful escapism
","Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway.Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film – but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes – this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s.It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.",9,1,2,21 September 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Entertaining
","Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit.",7,1,1,1 June 2014
Aladdin," Disney's Aladdin meets Robin Williams' Genius
","It starts out as the usual raucous and routine Disney animated feature but over thirty minutes in a blue genie appears and as if by magic the film already very good is transformed into something special. Robin Williams and his manic vocal interaction with the cartoonery is sure fine looking, and still crazy after all these years: imho it was his best film.The old story of a poor street urchin who falls in love with a rich Princess, attains a magic lamp and the genie within who grants him three wishes; the rest is mythology. There are some nice atmospheric scenes and songs, with the plot holding up well with the sight and sound gags at many times running at the rate of one a second. So Pay Attention! The characterisations of Jafar and the Sultan from The Thief Of Bagdad are perfect, while Gilbert Gottfried also has a tour de force performance as the voice for Iago the brash parrot. There's the occasional dark moment which may scare the very young and me but it all adds up to a wonderful family film for children of all ages from 2 to 102. And you don't even have to wonder what it would've been like without Williams' incessant madness – if you're up to it just settle down and watch the sequel The Return Of Jafar as I did the once; I think the rest of the gang were there anyway!",8,3,5,17 January 2015
Spectre," Batmanesque
","I would rather watch silly escapist entertainment films like this any day over films which disappear up their own arthole in the pursuit of grim meaning. Because of that I'm sure this was the best 'British' film of the year even though I haven't seen any other; I'm also sure nearly everything produced nowadays has to be sadistic and/or perverted to have any money spent on it at all. The colour in this is so subdued most of the time for the sake of modern realism it may have looked more realistic to have pressed the monochrome button. Whether it would look more believable is another matter though!James Bond is on the chase after baddies variously in places like Mexico, Rome, Tunisia, Austria, and London of course with all of its splendid under-publicised tourist attractions. He gets some, and a few women along the way as usual with many slick nail-biting obligatory chases and fights. What more needs to be reported and what more could anyone want of Bond? Daniel Craig as 007 and Sam Mendes as director have helped make a huge improvement in the Legend that Sean Connery left us; those poor quality extended Saint episodes in previous decades that were passed off as Bond are getting more risible with every new episode. Favourite bits: the delicate artiness with Monica Belucci; the sinister meeting of the baddies in the ridiculous banqueting hall; the romance with Lea Seydoux and then the violence on the empty train – I can't believe they'll throw big Dave Bautista away just like that.If there was product placement it was very subtle - but I personally wouldn't know a Rolex from a Reebok. The whole plot and almost every character in it is nonsensical and Batmanesque with its cliffhangers, resolutions, cars and gadgets but the actual climax bordered on ludicrous and was rushed (among other things there was no fanfare for Q), however there was a lot to savour in the overall mammoth running time. And I admit it - I preferred it to Skyfall.",7,1,5,27 March 2016
Donnie Darko," A very different kind of teen love story
","This is the only film made over the last 10 years or so since 1995 that I've watched twice, even though it was made for teens and twents and not a middle aged twerp like me. I've always loved off-the-wall sci-fi, all the way from the Epic Of Gilgamesh to Micromegas to Harvey to this, a much neglected modern classic.Basically it remains a well made, languidly photographed love story chockful of teen angst, cynical of the present (1980's) but still full of hope for the future. Oh, it also has the continual butting-in of a metal-rabbit-headed teen from 28 days into the future and a tangential Universe complete with wormholes - but Donnie Can Save The World! Thought-provoking is hardly the word for this film! The DC runs in at a precious and often visually stunning 122 minutes plus 6 minutes credits and a beautifully remastered and tinkered-about soundtrack (Joy Division are now at the Party). The incessant '80's pop music (original recordings) play an important role here in setting the right ambiance - never did like Echo and the Bunnymen though!Overall, although undisciplined in places abounding with non-sequiteurs and pretentious arty-fartiness this is a marvellous film - if you can't like it or even be slightly impressed by its cleverness it's your loss!",8,1,2,18 December 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne To Be Riled
","This was an excellent sequel to the Identity, just as smart and swift and only slightly spoilt by the shaky camera technique so approved of by the gamer generations.Trained assassin in hiding in Asia with partner has to re-engage to find out why his previous employers are apparently gunning for him again. This involves a tortuous and complicated trail of hide and seek and destroy across Europe, from Naples to Berlin to Moscow. And imho it is complex – I was hoping to do something else as well as watch this, some hope! It looked bloody chilly in Moscow, how artists suffer. With concentration turned up there's plenty to savour: the marvellous brevity, endless bone-crunching fight scenes, non-cartoon car chases and explosions, the overall sense of realism. It was the realism and the way everything that happened seemed fresh and immediate that helped me through a convoluted plot unflinching to the sharp and well-judged ending. Nearly two hours went West so fast! I still prefer films to be unshaken and stirring, but it's worth putting up with this pretentious angle of the otherwise excellent camera-work for some decent entertainment.",8,3,3,16 February 2014
The Birds," Memorable flight of fancy
","Sadly this was the last good film from Alfred Hitchcock, it was downhill all the way from this – sadly because I always felt the last 5 he directed were all wasted opportunities and not inherently bad films. Although Frenzy was cheap and nasty and Family Plot was dull and flat. Hitch was still at the top of his game here, completely indifferent to the content of du Maurier's short story and telling us as he done so often in the past a cinema story instead with wonderful panache.Ice cool blonde Hedren falls for chunky lawyer Taylor, visits him at his house by the sea bringing with her 2 love birds and also apparently bringing down all the local birds united anger. The birds sporadically violently attack the humans, no one knows why or how to stop them – but how could they when they didn't even know the difference between ravens and blackbirds. Plenty of iconic old fashioned shocks: the farmer in his pyjamas lying dead; the crows silently flocking on the climbing frame behind the awkwardly smoking Hedren; the chaos when the petrol station was attacked; Hedren being stabbed in the shower, sorry, bedroom by the waiting birds; so many others. The necessary Disney cartoonery and special effects were almost immediately dated, and also much corn and clunky melodrama are displayed, all of which will always be overlooked when a story is told so masterfully as this is. Hitch always wrapped his cleverness up with a sheen of simplicity and seemingly effortlessly played with his viewers' emotions. Nearly two hours go by and then comes (the end)Hitch would've enjoyed utilising the standard cgi cartoonery and camera technology available today (not to mention today's wonderful freedom to portray deviancy and bestiality as normal); thankfully what we have is a classic film, with faults, but watchable over and over again.",7,3,5,10 June 2012
The Martian," Stayin' Alive
","As soon as I saw Jeff Daniels I realised this picture was going to be Dumb And Dumber than I was initially hoping; most of us live in hope. But at least he makes sense paired with Sean Bean. Serious scientist Matt Damon in a life and death situation relishing using naughty adult words doesn't help. I hadn't seen Robinson Crusoe On Mars for decades either and to see him brought up to digital date was the next best thing – although continually and sometimes hopelessly incongruous 70's disco music kept taking me back to the ye olden primitive days when NASA actually had some of their employees cavorting about on the Moon.Damon is left for dead on Mars after a big storm and disaster and has to survive and fend for himself until death or rescue. It's all extremely well done, with the usual seemingly minute attention to detail looked after, and is sufficiently gripping and entertaining. All of us millions of news-hungry space fans cheer Bravo! from Times Square, Red Square and Trafalgar Square for CNN to cover this opinion as Breaking News. And great that the making of the film gave 15,000 people jobs and purpose (the end credits seemed to be much more populous), and I only wish there could be many sequels to keep them all employed. But now to delete it.Unlike Damon I'm not going to have to science the poo out of this but – I would rather recommend the equally corny, escapist and similar film but with more honest human characterisation and emotion Mission To Mars instead. And Jeff Daniels wasn't in it either.",7,1,1,20 February 2016
