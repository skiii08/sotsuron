United 93," My favorite parts
","Simple. I can boil it down to two.1. Terrorist number 1 (The idiot with the fake bomb) getting his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher.2. Terrorist number 2 (The pipsqueak thug who looked like he was 18) screaming in Arabic as one of the passengers breaks his neck.While we'll never really know if that's what really happened, it made me feel better to think they put at least two of those cockroaches in a world of hurt before going down. Like everyone else who has seen this film, you know how it will turn out, but you can at least leave the theater feeling some pride in a group of ordinary Americans who confronted the darkest side of hell and in just a few minutes, defeated it handily. Their sacrifice will be remembered through the ages.",Null,1,9,30 April 2006
