Walk the Line," Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for Oscar
","Going to see a biography is usually nerve racking--don't waste my time with a bunch of fiction and try to sell it as someone's life story. I was relieved to see that 'Walk the Line' was produced by Johnny and June's son John Carter Cash. From what I have personally read and watched on such show's as 'Biography' on A&E, this film stays true to Mr. Cash's experience as a share cropper's son to his struggle with drugs and alcohol. The depiction of Mr. Cash's relationship with June Carter Cash is not at all 'corny', but pretty uplifting. Joaquin Pheonix IS Johnny Cash, especially on stage. I went for Reese Witherspoon's performance, but was blown away by Phoenix. 'Walk the Line' is Joaquin Phoenix's movie. Bottom line-I have re-newed faith in Hollywood, there actually is talent out there.",9,0,1,26 November 2005
