Mission: Impossible III," A Thrilling and Pulse-Pounding Action Film with Flaws that Make it Fall Short of Greatness
","This is considered by many to be the best of the 'Mission Impossible' series up to this point. I think 'M:I-2' is better, but this is still pretty good. This had a lot of potential to be great, but there are some shortcomings that bring the film down a few notches.Tom Cruise is great once again, and the supporting cast is also really good. Notable additions to the cast are Laurence Fishburne and Simon Pegg.The action sequences are electrifying and never let up. From the helicopter battle to the sequence on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to the mayhem out in Shanghai, the action delivers.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a fantastic villain in Owen Davian. He brings a real mystery to the character and shows why he is one of the world's most versatile actors. The story also has some good twists and turns.However, there were also many areas in which the movie left a lot to be desired. For one thing, Hoffman is woefully underused. He doesn't get nearly as much screen-time for his character to be well-developed and is barely in the action.As I said, the story has good twists, but the payoff is rather unsatisfying as they never even explain what the Rabbit's Foot is. I also found the ending to be rather bland.On the whole, though, this was a fun, entertaining summer blockbuster that just could have been better.RATING: B",7,1,2,11 January 2016
Skyfall," The Best Bond Film to Date
","This was the first Bond film I saw in the theaters. I had low expectations after the first two films with Daniel Craig. However, when I watched this, I couldn't have been more blown away. This ended up being not only an instant Bond classic, but for my money, the most thrilling and engrossing James Bond movie to date.Daniel Craig is much better and more comfortable in the role of Bond this time around. He really feels like the spy that Ian Fleming envisioned.The story and drama of the film is very gripping and realistic. It engages you the entire time, unlike 'Casino Royale,' which was too boring to keep your attention, and 'Quantum of Solace,' which didn't have much of a story at all. One thing I really loved was getting to see the place where Bond spent his childhood.The action scenes are both larger-than-life and pulse-pounding. The pre-credit sequence where Bond rides a motorcycle, silver cars, a bulldozer, the caboose of the train, and then seemingly dies was one for the ages. I admit, I really thought that they had killed off Bond. There are also many other excellent chase scenes and fight scenes.Javier Bardem is outstanding as Silva, a villain that is entertaining and uncomfortably creepy at the same time. This seems to be a type of character that Bardem plays often, and he knocked this one out of the ballpark.There are also many wonderful additions to the cast. We get Ralph Fiennes as the new M and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. I especially loved Ben Whishaw as Q. He is a younger Q and I loved this new take on the character.Of course, we also have Judi Dench in her last outing as M. The scene at the end where she passes away really tugged my emotional strings.Adele once again shows us that she is one of the most talented artists of her generation with the atmospheric, haunting title song. The locations, particularly Shanghai, also have an epic quality to them.I can't praise this film enough. This, in my humble opinion, is the best Bond film ever made, which really says something. It is a more realistic type of Bond, but unlike the first two films in this reboot series, it didn't sacrifice the fun. A nice touch is that although undeniably slick and modern, it still has the feel of a lot of the classic Bond films. A must-see.RATING: A+",10,2,10,28 January 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Epitome of Action/Adventure
","This was the beginning to one of the most popular film series of all time. These films were tributes to the classic adventure serials from the 30's and 40's. They took the concepts of those serials and breathed new life into them.Harrison Ford is nothing short of legendary as Indiana Jones. He makes for a perfect action hero and he has a vulnerability that makes you root for him all the way. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood makes for a good love interest and has great chemistry with Ford.The story, which involves the Nazis trying to obtain the Ark of the Covenant, is very compelling and has the right amount of reverence. The action scenes are astounding, from the classic opening with Indy running from a boulder to the fight at the bar to the various chase scenes.The scenery in Egypt is gorgeous and the classic music score is absolutely rousing. Also, the ending was mind-blowing.An outstanding start to one of my favorite movie franchises. I prefer 'The Last Crusade,' but this film is definitely a classic that still holds up today.RATING: A+",10,0,1,16 January 2016
Spider-Man 2," One of the Best Sequels and Superhero Movies Ever Made
","'Spider-Man 2' is a very rare thing, a sequel to an outstanding film that far surpasses that film. This film does everything right. It takes all of the best elements of its predecessor and expands on them.Tobey Maguire once again nails it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. His character is given great depth, and it was brilliant the way they dealt with the split personalities of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. The relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane is further explored in this one.Alfred Molina as Doctor Octavius makes for one of the best villains ever in a superhero movie. As a villain, he is very threatening with his deadly mechanical tentacles, but at the same time, he's a character you really feel for.The story is very compelling and dramatic. Peter decides to quit being Spider-Man and tries to live a normal life, and meanwhile, Mary Jane is going to get married. However, when Mary Jane is in trouble at the hands of Doc Ock, he realizes that Spider-Man is his true calling.The action scenes are truly magnificent. They are expertly directed, thrilling, and truly edge-of-your-seat. The stand-out, of course, is the fight on the train between Spider-Man and Doc Ock. So exhilarating and flawlessly orchestrated, it may well be the greatest action scene ever in a superhero movie.The supporting cast is once again stellar, as is the soundtrack. You also gotta love the message that sometimes you have to make sacrifices to do what is right.The first film still has a special place in my heart, but this film outdoes it in pretty much every way. It has a better villain, a more mature storyline, and action sequences even more enthralling than before. A must-see movie and one of the best sequels and superhero films of all time.RATING: A+",10,2,7,8 November 2016
Batman Returns," An Excellent Sequel to a Classic Movie
","This was the follow-up to the hugely successful 1989 film 'Batman', and it was an excellent continuation of the Batman story.Michael Keaton gives another cracking performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was a little more violent in this film with the way he killed a lot of the Penguin's goons.Michael Gough and Pat Hingle return, but there are also a bunch of new actors to the cast. The main villain is the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. His portrayal of the Penguin is decidedly different from Burgess Meredith's Penguin from the 60's TV show. Whereas Meredith brought out the more comical side of the Penguin, DeVito plays a more tragic and grotesque version. He is creepy, but he also makes you really feel for him.Another villain in this movie is Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is sexy as well as creepy, and the scenes between she and Batman are quite engaging. Christopher Walken plays Max Shreck, the other villain in the movie. Walken is one of my favorite actors, and as always, he was great in this movie.Tim Burton gives the movie the same unique visual style he gave to the first movie. There is a lot more action in this movie, and it is quite thrilling. The Christmas atmosphere is also really nice.You couldn't have asked for a much better sequel. While not quite as good as the original, it is still one of the best sequels out there.RATING: A-",9,0,2,6 January 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Easily The Worst 'X-Men' Movie
","This was actually the first 'X-Men' movie I ever saw. I saw it in theaters back in 2009 on my birthday. I thought it was awesome when I first saw it, but that was when I didn't have much taste. Upon rewatching it after developing critical thinking skills, I realize that this movie is pretty bad.There are many things that this movie disappointingly glossed over. The first few minutes showing Logan's childhood and the montage with Logan and Victor fighting in various wars each could have honestly been their own movies, but both sequences were only a few minutes long.Another issue is that, like 'X-Men: The Last Stand,' it had far more characters than it knew what to do with. Gambit was awesome but was totally wasted and there were other characters that felt unnecessary. The worst thing about this movie is what they infamously did to Deadpool: they sewed his mouth shut. He is supposed to be 'The Merc With The Mouth' and they sew his mouth shut?! Really?!The film's story doesn't make much sense and there are many things that leave you scratching your head. Why do they try to kill Wolverine when they know they just made him indestructible? Why did Wolverine no longer want to kill Stryker after finding out that it was a set up and his wife was in on it? Why didn't the captured mutants just use their superpowers to escape from the cages?The action scenes are poorly staged and shot and shown from many random angles. The cutting an 'X' in the wall scene and the walking away from explosion scene were both shoehorned into the movie just so they could be used for the trailer. The CGI is also surprisingly lackluster.The only things that save this movie are the leads. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber were both excellent as Wolverine and Sabertooth respectively, and the nature of their relationship is very interestingly played out.This is one of the worst comic book movies out there. Even die-hard 'X-Men' fans don't need to bother with this one. This is easily the worst of the series, but at least it lead to the series being taken in a different direction that made it better.RATING: D",3,1,6,23 July 2017
X-Men," A Solid First Film in the X-Men Franchise, but not Great
","This in addition to being the start of the 'X-Men' franchise was also the first superhero film of the 2000s as well as the first major adaption of a Marvel comic. This was a pretty solid movie with plenty going for it, even if there was better to come.Of course, one of the best things about this franchise is Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He is a tough joker and someone you don't wanna mess with and also very interesting to watch. He was made for the role just like how Christopher Reeve was made for Superman and Robert Downey Jr. was made for Iron Man.Many of the supporting characters are also interesting. Patrick Stewart is great as Professor Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen makes for a great villain in Magneto. Mystique, Storm, Cyclops, and Sabertooth also compliment the film nicely.The film has a solid enough story and some pretty exciting action sequences. I also liked the music score.However, one issue is that a lot of the supporting characters, while cool, weren't developed quite enough. One character I didn't care for was Anna Paquin's Rogue, who was a bit whiny.There isn't really anything to make the film anything more than solid. It really kind of felt like they were holding back some with this film. It isn't surprising that director Bryan Singer considers this to be the 'prologue' to the 'X-Men' series.It's still a good, solid movie that laid the groundwork for the 'X-Men' movies. There would be better superhero films to come, but this is still worth watching.RATING: B",7,1,4,22 July 2017
Spider-Man 3," The Weakest of the Spiderman Trilogy, But Still a Solid Film in Its Own Right
","This film really tends to get a bad rap. Many consider this to be a disappointment and a weak ending to the trilogy because of the many story lines and villains stuffed into it. I disagree. While I would say this is nowhere near as good as the first two films, I still think this was pretty good as far as third installments go.Tobey Maguire gives a great final performance as our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Of course, the dance scene with 'emo-Peter' seems to really get a lot of backlash, but I really didn't mind it much. If anything, I just laugh at it.There may be a lot going on in the film, but I thought that most of it was handled well. The CGI for both Venom and Sandman was top notch. Sandman is another sympathetic villain, and is played well by Thomas Haden Church.The main storyline involving the relationship between Peter and Harry is very well done, and I found the final scene where they reconcile to be very touching.The action scenes are just as entertaining and exciting as ever, giving the audience the bang for their buck. The supporting cast also does a good job and we have another strong soundtrack.It isn't without its flaws. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is nowhere near as compelling as the previous villains in the series, and he doesn't even become Venom until late in the film.The story does have some questionable elements, such as the section of the film where Harry had amnesia and how Harry's butler for some reason not having told him the truth about his father's death a lot earlier. The film is also a bit overlong and could have left other characters out, such as Gwen Stacey.However, I still found this to be a solid movie overall. It seems that people pan this mainly because it's a third film in a series and because it had a lot going on in it. In reality, however, this film is an action-packed, emotionally resonant, and mostly satisfying ending to the trilogy. It may be the weakest of the trilogy, but still gets a recommendation from me.RATING: B",7,3,4,9 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A Return to Form for Spidey
","This was a surprisingly good addition to the Spider-Man mythos. The third on-screen iteration of Spider-Man, the sixth Spider-Man movie, and the first time Spider-Man is a part of the MCU (aside from his involvement in 'Captain America: Civil War'), this film brought some really neat stuff to the table.Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is much more suited to be Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield, who was too much of a jock. Like Tobey Maguire, Holland really brings a relatable vulnerability to Peter Parker, and he really seemed to be having fun as Spider-Man. I thought that the new things they did with the Spidey suit were really cool and interesting.Michael Keaton as The Vulture proved to be an excellent villain. He's a much better villain than any of the baddies from the two 'Amazing Spider-Man' films. He's a fairly compelling character, and Keaton managed to make him very convincing.The action sequences are very well done. I particularly liked the sequence where Spider-Man had to stop the elevator from crashing and the ferry scene.It also has a solid supporting cast. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man as usual, Aunt May was good, and I also really enjoyed Peter's best friend Ned.The film does have some issues, though. The pacing at times can feel very off, and I didn't find Liz, Peter's crush, to be that interesting of a character. There are also some instances where the humor falls a bit flat.However, I still really enjoyed this movie overall. This is a solid addition to the MCU, and I can definitely say that it's the best Spider-Man movie since Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2.'RATING: B+",8,2,6,8 January 2018
Suicide Squad," It Has Some Fun Moments and Some Solid Performances, but It's Still a Pretty Weak Movie Overall
","I saw the premiere of this movie with some friends last year. We had fun watching it and we liked it. However, after rewatching it on X-Finity and reevaluating it, the movie isn't really that good. There are some things in it to keep you entertained, but it is still another weak film from the DCEU.I liked Will Smith as Deadshot. This is an unusual thing for Smith to play an assassin, but he pulled it off well, and his character was pretty interesting. I also liked Harley Quinn. This was the first time the character was adapted to live action, and Margot Robbie was convincing in the role.There were also some pretty good action sequences and the film did get a few laughs out of me.Sadly, all the other villains on the team were considerably less interesting and didn't get enough character development to really get behind them. The interactions between the villains were pretty forced for the most part.Jared Leto was pretty good as The Joker, but he was wasted because he was barely in the movie at all.The story was very weak and the pacing could have been a lot better. Also bad is the depressingly murky color palette. Some bright colors in the film couldn't hurt, you know!A lot of people think that this is even worse than 'Batman v. Superman,' but I disagree. I enjoyed it more than that film because at least this film is fairly entertaining at times and had a few good performances. However, this is still a mostly unsuccessful effort from the DCEU. Thankfully, things would get much better with the next DCEU film, 'Wonder Woman.'RATING: C",5,0,2,9 July 2017
Elf," One of My Favorite Christmas Movies
","I have very fond memories of when my family and I saw this movie in theaters in 2003 when I was only 7 years old. We quickly got it on VHS, and we have since watched it every year around Christmas time.Will Ferrell is a very hit-or-miss comedian, but he hits big time with this movie. He does a great job with the childlike aspect of his character, and his comedic timing and line delivery is just brilliant.We also have an excellent supporting cast consisting of James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Deschanel, and Peter Dinklage. The relationship between Buddy and his father is wonderfully played out and manages to be very touching. Santa, Emily, Michael, and Jovie were also great characters.This film also has a nice Christmas feel to it. It just really gets you in the mood for the holidays. The end scene with everyone singing 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town' and raising the Christmas spirit to make the sleigh fly always gives me the warm fuzzies.Funny, intelligent, and poignant, this film is everything I want in a Christmas movie. It's one I never grow tired of watching, and I can't recommend it enough.RATING: A+",10,2,6,25 November 2017
Spider-Man," A Spectacular Start to the 'Spider-Man' Trilogy
","The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular 'X-Men,' but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of 'Spider-Man.'Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman.The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin.Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that 'X-Men' kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack.There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film. It was the kick in the pants that Marvel studios needed. Although this film would be surpassed by it's sequel, 'Spider-Man 2,' it is still not to be missed.RATING: A-",9,4,6,8 November 2016
Die Hard 2," An Underrated Sequel and an Explosive Follow-Up
","While it doesn't quite live up to the action masterpiece that is the first 'Die Hard,' this was still an excellent sequel. It has plenty of action and one-liners to come around.Bruce Willis once again nails the role of John McClain. Like the last time, he is both human and tough as nails. It just makes you appreciate him that much more when you think about how he degenerated into a Superman figure in the 4th and 5th films in the series.Renny Harlin does a good job directing this movie, properly building suspense. The story may be another terrorist plot, but they managed to really make it work. There was a plot twist that was extremely well done which I won't spoil. The airport was a nice setting for the conflict to take place in, and I also liked the snowy atmosphere.The action scenes are an absolute blast. The action taking place at the airport was great, and the last 30 minutes of the film kept me on the edge of my seat.The reasons it isn't quite as good as the first one is because it isn't quite as briskly paced and the villains, while still good, aren't nearly as memorable as Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber.However, I was still very pleased with this sequel overall. I consider this movie to be very underrated and a great action movie in its own right. Check this one out.RATING: A-",9,3,6,13 June 2017
Quantum of Solace," The Nadir of the James Bond Series
","This film is just not what I want Bond to be. Like 'Casino Royale,' this is a lackluster film, but for totally different reasons.Daniel Craig is once again more Bourne than Bond. This was a problem in 'Casino Royale', and it is far, far more apparent here. Olga Kurylenko's Bond girl is so forgettable that I can barely remember her.Dominic Greene is another dull villain. Mathieu Amalric is a good actor, but his character was so boring that it doesn't matter.The action scenes are totally ruined by the 'shaky-cam.' Having the camera shaking and showing everything at weird angles whenever an action scene or car chase comes doesn't 'get us in the action' by any means. If anything, it makes us dizzy and we can barely see what's going on. This didn't work in the 'Bourne' movies, so why on Earth did they think it would work in Bond?The story was also nothing special, and the film was too short. 'Another Way To Die' is a good song, though, and we get to see Judi Dench again as M, which is always nice.'Casino Royale' was a lackluster film buoyed by a few saving graces. This film doesn't have as many saving graces. It is the worst Bond film in the official series, and only marginally better than the horrid unofficial Bond film, 'Never Say Never Again.' This is simply an action film that happens to have Bond in it. Thankfully, the franchise would go right back on track with the next film.RATING: D+",4,2,6,26 January 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Hugely Disappointing Third Installment that Made Many Huge Mistakes
","Like the 'Karate Kid' and 'Back To The Future' franchises, the 'X-Men' series was a series that really dropped the ball with its third installment. This film has many problems, not the least of which is it's treatment of the characters and the source material.One problem is that the film strays from the somewhat political themes of the first two movies and is more like your typical shoot-'em-up summer blockbuster. Replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner didn't prove to be a good idea.While Professor Charles Xavier's death was admittedly treated like a big deal, the other two deaths were not very well executed. Cyclops' death happened off-screen after the character had barely even been in the movie at all and Jean Grey's death felt very anti-climactic.The movie feels very scatterbrained. There are FAR too many story lines and new characters introduced in this movie, none of which were explored very well. It failed to make everything cohesive. The overall plot felt rather rushed and, in addition, butchered one of the most beloved story lines from the comics.The film does have redeeming qualities that make it watchable. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen all hand in really good performances as usual. For the time that he got, Kelsey Grammar was great as The Beast.Some of the action scenes are fun to watch, and the special effects are as good as ever.It's a shame that Bryan Singer decided to direct 'Superman Returns,' because Brett Ratner took the 'X-Men' series in the wrong direction with this mediocre, overstuffed, and immensely disappointing movie.RATING: C",5,0,4,22 July 2017
Mission: Impossible II," A Great Thrill Ride, Far Superior to the Overrated Original
","I must say, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. I wasn't expecting much because this movie got worse reviews than the snooze-fest that was the original. However, this movie managed to keep my attention a lot more than the original and had a lot more action.People have criticized that the plot is more like James Bond than Mission Impossible. They're probably right, but at least the story is easy to follow in this one. I thought the twists with people wearing masks were actually pretty clever.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt and once again proves that he can carry an action blockbuster with no problem. Thandie Newton is eye candy and plays a real role in the story. The main villain of the film, Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott, makes this a love triangle. Ambrose is a decent if not great villain.This movie has quite a lot of action. The motorcycle chase and subsequent hand-to-hand combat between Hunt and Ambrose at the end will give you the bang for your buck. There is also an exciting gun sequence at Ambrose's laboratory.They scenery in Australia is really lovely and I liked the update of the M:I theme song. I don't like that Anthony Hopkins only had a minor role, though.After the dull first installment, this movie was a breath of fresh air. The action and romance between the leads makes this a great summer blockbuster. It's not art, but it sure is fun.RATING: B+",8,5,10,11 January 2016
Avatar," Astounding Visuals Elevate an Otherwise Average Movie
","Ah, Avatar. The highest-grossing movie of all time as well as one of the most insanely hyped. It is often recognized as a milestone in filmmaking. I know that I'm far from the only one to espouse this opinion, but I feel that the amazing technology and special effects on display save this film from mediocrity.Let's get the obvious out of the way. Pandora is of course a wonder to behold. It's a totally immersive experience, and gives you a sense of wonder. The sheer visual splendor and world-building alone managed to keep my attention for a good while.Unfortunately, that is really the only thing about this movie that is truly groundbreaking in any way. The story is pretty pedestrian and nothing new whatsoever. As many have pointed out, it borrows heavily from many other movies of its kind, most notably 'Pocahontas' and 'Dances With Wolves.'The performances and main characters are serviceable, but sadly nothing more. Jake Sully's relationship with the Navi was pretty interesting at times, but is sorely lacking depth. The dialogue isn't that great, either.One of the film's biggest problems is its 161-minute running time. As I said earlier, the film kept my attention for a while, but during the last 30-40 minutes, I pretty much lost interest. It also didn't help that the themes and messages felt pretty heavy-handed at times.It hurts me to be critical of this film, because James Cameron is one of my all-time favorite movie directors. I'm giving this film an above-average grade just for the amazing visual experience alone, but basically everything else was average in every sense of the word. Were it not for the enormously high budget that went into making this, it would probably be forgotten by now.RATING: C+",6,0,3,10 July 2018
Mission: Impossible," Terribly Overrated and Dull
","I was actually pretty excited for this one because of the good reviews it got. This movie came out the year I was born, and my parents watched it while I was an infant. They told me they fell asleep during it. I finally watched the movie myself when I was 13, and I must say, I can see why.This movie is mostly just a snooze-fest. The plot is very convoluted with a very predictable twist and the slow pace makes it even harder to get into. The lack of action for most of the running time also makes it really boring.It really takes off in the final 10 minutes, however. The climax on the train is as exciting as it gets and practically saves the film.Tom Cruise was good as Ethan Hunt. He certainly knows how to be the man of action. Many the supporting performances are also good. It's just a shame they didn't have a more coherent script to work with.Overall, I was extremely disappointed. Tom Cruise, the great cinematography, and the thrilling climax are what save the film from being a dud.RATING: C",5,0,2,10 January 2016
Love & Mercy," A Great Music Biopic Portraying the life of Bryan Wilson
","Saw this movie in the theaters last summer and really enjoyed it. It was definitely intriguing to see the struggles and hard times that Bryan Wilson went through.Each of the actors looked enough like the Beach Boy members to portray them, and they each do a good job. Paul Giamatti is excellent as Wilson's therapist. It is a very accurate portrayal that makes you absolutely despise him.It's also definitely a plus that we got to listen to plenty of Beach Boys tunes throughout the movie. Their music always has put a smile on my face.In conclusion, this is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of the Beach Boys.RATING: B+",8,2,4,9 January 2016
Jack Reacher," A Tense and Enjoyable Thriller
","I haven't read the 'Jack Reacher' books, so I have no comments on how good I think it is as an adaption. As a movie, though, I thought it was great. It has a similar style to the Bourne films, but it still feels fresh.Tom Cruise, in my opinion, gives one of his best performances in this movie. He plays Jack Reacher with plenty of charisma and looks pretty convincing as a Chuck Norris-type figure in the action scenes. It also helps that his character was given a good amount of depth.The supporting cast is also very good. Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin makes for an engaging character that is definitely tougher and smarter than most girls in the James Bond series. Richard Jenkins and Werner Herzog are also good in their roles.The plot has a realism to it and can be thought-provoking at times. The script is quite good. There is a fair amount of action and excitement with a good dose of suspense.I really enjoyed this movie overall. Despite being a little overlong, it never lost my attention and I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.RATING: B+",8,1,3,28 March 2016
Die Hard," The Definitive Action Flick
","This film is rightfully considered to be among the gold standards for action films. This has all the right ingredients to make it a bona-fide classic.Bruce Willis plays John McClane, and he became one of Hollywood's ideal action heroes after this film. His is just another cop who is at the wrong place at the wrong time, which gives his character great vulnerability, but at the same time, he is also a pretty tough guy that you don't want to mess with. He is also great at delivering clever one-liners.Alan Rickman is amazing as Hans Gruber; a cunning, smart, dastardly, and utterly slimy villain. This was his first blockbuster film role, and he immediately made a name for himself.The story is believable and never loses your attention, and the film is efficiently paced and expertly directed by John McTiernan (who would later direct the third 'Die Hard' film). The Nakatomi building makes for a very engaging setting.The action scenes are not only pulse-pounding and explosive, but also filled with genuine tension. That alone will give you your money's worth. There is also comic relief aplenty, a lot of it provided by John McClane and his limousine driver.This is up there with the best action movies ever made. Everything just clicks, and it oozes quality in every frame. This film should not be ignored by any action movie buff.RATING: A+",10,2,4,21 March 2016
Wonder Woman," Hands Down, the Best Entry in the DCEU So Far
","After the lackluster efforts that were 'Man of Steel', 'Batman v. Superman', and 'Suicide Squad', I just about lost hope in the DC Extended Universe. When I saw this film, however, my faith in this franchise was restored. This was an excellent movie that gave the franchise the kick that it needed.Gal Gadot was a wonderful choice for the role of Wonder Woman, and she pretty much nails the role. She looks the part, is convincing in the action scenes, and puts the right amount of emotion into the role. She also did a good job of selling that she is a character who has a lot to learn about the outside world.Steve Trevor is a nice supporting leading character, and is played well with Chris Pine. His chemistry with Gal Gadot was surprisingly good.One refreshing thing about this film is the color palette. After three films of nothing but bleak and gray, we finally get some bright colors to liven things up. There was also some wonderful cinematography.The story and character development are much stronger than expected and give the film a considerable amount of substance. The action scenes are thrilling and do a great job of establishing Wonder Woman a tough-as-nails hero.One complaint about the film is that Danny Huston isn't that great of a villain. He's not terrible, just rather forgettable. The film was also a bit overlong and had just a few too many slow-motion shots. The CGI effects also weren't the best.Overall, I am very happy with how this movie turned out. After how she was shoehorned in 'Batman v. Superman', it was great that they finally did the character of Wonder Woman justice. One of the better superhero movies in recent memory and definitely recommended.RATING: A-",8,5,8,18 April 2018
Black Panther," Quite Overrated, but still a Really Good Effort from Marvel
","To be honest, I am rather baffled that there are critics who are hailing this film as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the if not the best superhero movies ever made. I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie they did. Even with that said, I still thought that this was a really good movie and I had a fun time watching it in the theater.Chadwick Boseman is quite good as the Black Panther, bringing the right blend of confidence and emotion to the character. There are many supporting characters who are quite interesting as well. I was skeptical about Michael B. Jordan playing the villain of the movie, but he did a surprisingly decent job.The best thing about this movie by far is its world-building. Wakanda is a wonderfully fleshed-out setting, and the gorgeous cinematography really sells the beauty and grandeur of it.The story is interesting and filled with intriguing commentary, with it only occasionally feeling preachy. The action scenes are a lot of fun, with the car chase being my favorite. I also liked the final battle.It does have some problems, though. The film dragged in some places and was overlong, and there were some instances where the CGI looked too obvious. The worst thing about this film by far is Martin Freeman's character. He had no real impact on the story and was kind of embarrassing to watch.All in all, this was another strong addition to the MCU. Even if it is overhyped and overrated, I still really like it. Check it out.RATING: B+",8,2,6,8 July 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Overblown in Every Conceivable Way; Definitely One of the Biggest Disappointments in Recent Memory
","I had been waiting for a Batman/Superman movie for quite a while. I saw this in theaters last month, and I was hugely disappointed. How anybody could enjoy this is beyond me.It is certainly a well-made movie, but the problem is that it is simply too much. The entire movie was mostly loud explosions, overblown CGI effects, and mindless set-pieces. I felt like I was watching a video game most of the time. Is this what modern action movies have really come to?The film had almost no plot and very little character development due to the excessive action and explosions. I felt that the Batman origin was rushed. Granted, it wouldn't have been exactly necessary to have a long, detailed origin story, but it didn't need to feel hastily rushed, either.Ben Affleck was pretty good as Bruce Wayne, but we didn't get to see nearly enough Batman. Keaton and Bale are still the best. Henry Cavill is serviceable as Superman; he's better than Brandon Routh but he sure is no Christopher Reeve.I hated Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He felt more like a nerdy college student than an evil mastermind. Amy Adams is kind of 'there' as Lois Lane.The scene where Batman and Superman fought was kind of strange. Even putting aside the half-baked reason that they are even fighting each other in the first place, Batman seemed less like Batman and more like a black Iron Man. Wonder Woman's entrance was pretty cool, but she ultimately had very little screen-time and was basically shoe-horned in.Also, the ending where Superman 'died' didn't fool me for a second. The implication in the final shot that he's still alive was SO predictable.The film was extremely overwhelming in a very, very bad way. It had virtually no human touch at all, and I just didn't care about what was going on most of the time. This is definitely not the film I have been waiting for. See this ONLY if you are a die-hard fan of these heroes, but don't expect anything great.RATING: D+",3,48,89,3 May 2016
Casino Royale," Overrated to the Max
","This film was a response to many people feeling that 'Die Another Day' is too over-the-top and too ridiculous, even for Bond. They intended to bring the series back to its roots. People loved this movie, but I really don't see why. As a huge James Bond fan, this film is pretty much free of what makes the Bond series fun.The new Bond is Daniel Craig. He would get better later in his tenure as Bond, but here he isn't very appealing. He is more like Jason Bourne than Bond, and he comes off as too much of a thug.The film itself is incredibly boring. 3/4 of the movie is nothing but poker playing. Mads Mikkelsen as LeChiffre is a pretty dull villain, and there are some parts of the movie that are just way too violent.No Q, no Moneypenny, no humor, no gadgets, and most of all, no fun. I don't care if this was closer to Fleming's Bond, this was just not enjoyable at all.The film does have some saving graces. For one, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is a strong contender for best Bond girl ever. She's utterly beautiful and has an engaging personality. This is the first time since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' that Bond was truly in love.The action in the last act of the film is thrilling, and 'You Know My Name' by Chris Cornell is a personal favorite of mine. Judi Dench was her usual great self as M.These saving graces make this a mediocre film instead of a terrible one.RATING: C",5,7,13,17 January 2016
X2: X-Men United," An X-ellent Sequel That Improves on The First Film
","'X-Men 2' is one of several Marvel movies that is an improvement over its predecessor. Whereas the first film felt held back a little, this sequel is much more confident and polished.Hugh Jackman is once again fantastic as Logan/Wolverine. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are their usual great selves. Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm all return from the first film and are more fleshed out this time around. I also liked Rogue a lot more than in the first one.We get a few more characters spotlighted, such as Pyro and Ice Man. The stand-out is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler; he is one of the coolest characters in the entire franchise. We also get a wonderful villain in William Stryker, played by Brian Cox.The film has a great storyline that hints more of Wolverine's past and brings up many interesting themes. It also has bigger, better action sequences than the first one with the best one being the brutal fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. The music score is once again really good.My only real issues are that the film is just a little too long and what lead to Jean Grey's death felt a bit weird (I understand why it had to happen, though).This was a great sequel that builds and improves upon its predecessor like any sequel should. This is one of the best 'X-Men' movies and one of the better superhero movies out there.RATING: A-",9,2,5,22 July 2017
Fantastic Four," A Very Middle-of-the-Road Superhero Effort
","This is the first theatrically released 'Fantastic Four' movie, as there was previously an unreleased 1994 B-movie made by Roger Coreman. I don't find this version of 'Fantastic Four' to be outright terrible; just a little bit bland and kind of unmemorable.The performances are mostly fine. Ioan Gruffudd was serviceable and Chris Evans was pretty good as Johnny Storm, but the best performance here is Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm. He was an excellent choice for the role. Julian McMahon was rather 'blah' as Dr. Doom, as was Jessica Alba as The Invisible Woman.My main gripe with this movie is that the story is rather uneventful. There isn't much action or excitement in it until the last half hour or so. While I appreciate that they took time to show the main characters getting used to their powers (unlike the 2015 reboot), the film at times felt less like a superhero movie and more like a sitcom. It didn't have much of superheroes being superheroes, in short.The climax at the end was decent but nothing too spectacular, and the humorous scenes are hit-or-miss. The special effects are pretty good, though, and I really like the soundtrack.This isn't one of the best superhero movies out there or one of the worst. It's just very middle-of-the-road. Watching it wouldn't be a complete waste of time, but don't expect anything mind-blowing.RATING: C+",6,0,5,18 January 2018
Spectre," A Flawed But Worthy Follow-Up To Skyfall
","This film had a lot to live up to because its predecessor 'Skyfall' was a masterpiece. This film definitely falls short of 'Skyfall,' but in its own right, it's still a worthy addition to the franchise.The film was slow in some spots and about 20 minutes too long, and the scene where Bond seduces a widow on the day of her husband's funeral is just not right. The film does make up for that stuff in several ways, though.I'm not the biggest fan of Daniel Craig's portrayal of James Bond, but he does pretty good in this movie. We have the same supporting cast as last time. We have the younger Q and Moneypenny and Ralph Fiennes as M. Monica Bellucci was a competent Bond girl.We once again get edge-of-your-seat, explosive action. The plane chase, car chases, the fight on the train (perhaps a tribute to 'From Russia With Love'), and many other sequences were all fantastic.The thing that got me most interested heading into the film is that this is the first time in 44 years that we get to see Blofeld, and he's played nicely by Christolph Waltz. Donald Plesence is still the best, though.The film is more formulaic and more action-oriented than 'Skyfall,' but it doesn't have the emotional punch that its predecessor had. Nevertheless, this is still a worthy addition to the over 50 year old franchise. If this really is Daniel Craig's last Bond outing, he went out on a pretty good note.RATING: B+",8,0,6,12 August 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Best of the Indiana Jones Series, and One of My Personal Favorites
","This film, in my opinion, is the best of the Indiana Jones movies. It has the same impeccable combination of action, adventure, reverence, romance, and perfectly-timed humor as the previous two films, but it has one thing that elevates it above the rest: Sean Connery!Harrison Ford is once again excellent as Indiana Jones, and Sean Connery is outstanding as Dr. Jones Senior. In real life, Ford and Connery are only 12 years apart, but yet they were so believable as father and son in this movie. The banter between them was absolutely delightful.The plot is very intriguing. The Nazis return, and this time they are after the Holy Grail. The story moves along at a brisk pace, and the message of this movie is very well done.You can always count on Indiana Jones to give you thrilling action scenes. This time, we get a boat chase, a plane chase, and a pulse-pounding battle involving tanks. I also enjoyed the flashback scene with Indy as a kid.Another thing, the ending scene with them riding off into the sunset was absolutely spellbinding. It was the perfect way to cap off the series. Too bad this wasn't the end of the series.For me, this is the peak of action/adventure cinema. My favorite Indiana Jones movie, and one of my favorite movies in general, this is highly recommended.RATING: A+",10,1,3,16 January 2016
