Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Much Calmer Than Vol.I
","People who expect the same unbridled brutality and violence of KILL BILL, VOL.I may get seriously disappointed with the more talky Vol.II. This sequel is NOT a bad movie at all; it actually shows a lot of the background of VOL.II, but by doing so, the film was rendered with a slower pace. We finally get to know WHY Bill wanted to kill the bride so much. The ending is contrived and a bit disappointing; after all, this IS a very violent revenge movie, but the way this movie ends is nowhere near as bloody as the tamest kill scene in VOL.I. I was expecting something bordering on bad taste for the final confrontation, but what we get is broadway drama. For a revenge movie, the bodycount on this one is EXTREMELY low. But what holds the movie together is our eagerness to see The Bride finding Bill and ultimately, killing him. I could have forgiven the slow pace, the talky scenes and the lack of action had the final confrontation been a real adrenaline rush, but this it was not. KILL BILL, VOL.II is still a fine movie that takes itself more seriously than the first, but by doing so, it sacrificed the youthful kinetic energy that made the original installment a more pleasant movie experience. 7* out of 10*.",7,4,9,29 May 2004
Scarface," Good, but no classic!
","Having seen SCARFACE last night after a 22 year gap I can honestly say that I was entertained, but have to admit that the movie is nowhere near other gangster classics such as (ironically) THE GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS. SCARFACE tells the tale of Cuban 'political' immigrant Tony Montana and his arrival to the U.S. and how he attains money and power beyond his wildest dreams. You don't need to be a narc or an FBI expert to tell that Montana smells of bad luck; his demeanor, the way he talks, etc. would make him an instant suspect in any police department around the world. How he manages the get IN the U.S. is one of the movie's first flaws. It was apparent from the start that Montana was a lowlife and trouble maker. His manners and ways don't change through out the entire film. It's as though we're almost looking at a comic book character. Many people hailed Pacino's performance but I found it terribly annoying, one-dimensional. Forget if he's a nihilistic punk. His character barely shows anything different than the punk he is. Except on one scene, where he is forced to kill a person along with his family. It's the only point in the whole movie where he shows some remorse and/or compassion for someone else. The other characters, like Elvira (Michelle Pfeifer) are equally wasted in their performances. How come she ends up marrying the 'grease ball' she so much hates? If anyone, only Steven Bauer's character was a tad more human and believable. As for the action sequences, they are far less bloody than anything on THE GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS. Sure, there's a lot of cursing, courtesy of Scarface himself. Another thing that annoyed me is that I'm never quite sure how LONG it took Tony Montana to be from Cuban Lowlife to Mr. American dream. The movie never addresses this. Instead of including useless scenes of Tony and his Bank administrator or Tony and Manny checking out the chicks at Miami Beach, more character development would've been much welcomed.SCARFACE plays more like an exploitation film, done with Hollywood standards, but in that sense it wasn't shocking to me when I saw it 22 years ago and it wasn't shocking to me last night. Sure, I like Pacino, Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone and sure, I think SCARFACE is OK, but a TOP 250 IMDb movie??? Like Tony Montana would say, 'Gimme a f#%!g break' !!!",6,2,11,20 April 2008
Alien 3," The worst of ALL Alien movies
","As soon as a movie releases a sequel then their makers are catering to fans of the previous film. Nothing wrong with that. Look at what Jim Cameron did in ALIENS, who many swear is the best part of the series (I slightly prefer the brooding original).ALIEN 3 picks up right after ALIENS ends; remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survives the brutal attack of not only one Alien monster, but many of them, including their Alien Queen. Ripley goes through hell trying to save Newt, a ten year old girl who is the only survivor of a human colony on the alien planet and one that reminds her of her daughter. So ALIENS ends with Ripley saving the newt, Corporal Hicks and Bishop, an android. They enter into hyper sleep hoping some company ship will pick them up. When ALIEN 3 begins we see shuttle carrying Ripley and the rest of the survivors crashing down into a planet that serves as a prison for the worst scum earth has to offer. Dead are Hicks, Newt and Bishop, which is a bummer because it rendered all the agony, pain and hell Ripley went through to save Newt and the crew in ALIENS pointless. So much for nothing! It's nice when a movie dares to be bleak and uncommercial, but like I said at the beginning of this review: if you're making a sequel you are catering to fans of the previous film.While nicely made, ALIEN 3 is a throwback to ALIEN (the first movie) in the sense that director David Fincher tries to make a very claustrophobic atmosphere within the prison. As is to be expected, Ripley, who survives the crash, befriends the prison doctor but is not willing to tell him what terror her ship might have brought to the prison colony. As with the first movie, this time we only have one Alien creature. The last 30 minutes of the movie are a cross between the original Alien and Friday The 13th. To this day, I don't have the slightest idea why the Alien creature kills. It doesn't eat its prey (although one scene apparently wants to address this particular point), and none of the prisoners is taken to be cocooned. The FX of the Alien moving and running through the prison hallways have dated massively. It's obviously a CGI creature and a regular effect during the close ups.David Fincher did a good job considering what he had in his hands. ALIEN 3 went through development hell, hiring many writers and it shows. Despite Fincher's abilities, ALIEN 3 is neither the roller-coaster ride of Jim Cameron's ALIENS nor the brooding and immensely frightening Ridley Scott original. To make things worse, there is an alternate ending, although I much prefer the original theatrical release.",5,0,3,1 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could have been awesome...
","As a true blue STAR WARS fan, I was expecting a superb story with top notch special effects. It seems I only got the 'special effects' part, since the story is so confusing, it's pointless to try and decipher it. It's true that trying to top something like the original STAR WARS is next to impossible, but it CAN come quite close, as evidenced in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. George Lucas completely forgot that most Hardcore Star Wars fans are grown ups now and that we would have liked a bit more substance in the story, and I'd like to emphasize 'a bit', because ultimately these movies are intended for younger audiences. By the same token, the story is so full of complicated mumbo jumbo (about a trade federation and about a conspiracy, etc, etc) that children won't fully grasp what the whole deal is. There is some terrible acting going on with some of the minor characters. Liam Neeson is good as Master Qui Gon and Ewan McGregor does good as the young Obi Wan Kenobi, but that's about the only 'good' acting you'll see in the film. PHANTOM MENACE rises more questions than answers. Why did Ben Kenobi said in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, 'Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me' when it's now obvious that he was instructed by Qui Gon?!?!?! Why does C3PO acts like he doesn't know OWEN LARS and the planet TATOOINE in 'Star Wars', when we now know (through 'Phantom' and 'Clones') that he was PREVIOUSLY OWNED by him (Owen Lars) and that he was virtually BORN on TATOOINE?!?!? These minor contradictions have infuriated many a hardcore STAR WARS fan and it only goes to show that George Lucas and his collaborators weren't paying attention when writing the prequels. PHANTOM MENACE's saving grace are its formidable Special Effects and the obligatory light saber fight between Qui Gon, Kenobi and Sith Warrior Darth Maul. The so much hyped tatooine pod race isn't as breathtaking as the asteroid chase in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (and we're talking about a movie that is almost 20 years older!). All my complaining aside, PHANTOM MENACE is still a watchable and mildly entertaining STAR WARS movie, although I think George Lucas shamelessly aimed this movie at the younger audience (kids between 8 and 13 years old). I think he could have made a nice balance and he almost got it right with ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Let's hope Episode III packs the punch that this one lacked.",4,0,1,24 February 2004
Unbreakable," Unbreakable bore!
","It was tough sitting through this one. As well as other Shyamalan's movies, UNBREAKABLE starts interesting but ends in nothing. The comic book allegory to me was worthless and Bruce Willis performance was tedious to say the least. Even if I did like this movie I'd have to admit that it is VERY slow. I thought SIXTH SENSE was OK, but even that, it looked like a bad JACOBS LADDER rip off. This one, though a bit more original in its premise, ultimately falls flat. I am not usually harsh as a critic, but UNBREAKABLE did manage to put me on my nerves. If you like melodramas linked to supernatural happenings wrapped in a really slow paced flick, UNBREAKABLE's for you. 4* out of 10.",4,1,3,3 October 2004
Monster," Superb Acting
","The main reason I rented MONSTER on DVD is to see for myself why Charlize Theron won the academy award for Best Actress this year (2004). Her being almost a pin up girl (much like Halle Berry), I was really intrigued by what I was gonna get. Well, MONSTER is a truly brilliant picture and it was Charlize Theron's show all the way. Not only did she looked very much like the actual character she was portraying (a round of applause to the make up team)but she literally submerged into the role. It was only at the end of the movie that I suddenly remembered reading something about the real Lee (the killer's real life name)in some magazine a couple of years ago. Christina Ricci was also superb as well as Bruce Dern's brief part. It must've been hard for a woman as beautiful as Charlize to make such a radical role in which her beauty was not required. It goes on to show that this lady will always be Oscar material. As for the movie itself, it is nicely paced, with enough drama to keep things interesting, but if you're looking for the typical hollywood fare, then forget it. This is more like 'indie' stuff. For those who think this movie tries to explain why Lee Wuorons was the way she was, or that it tries to show some sympathy, they are missing the point. Everytime someone sets foot in deathrow, we only know part of the story, so in a way, MONSTER trys to give that perspective and succeeds at that. It's a raw movie and it's not for everyone. 9* out of 10!",9,1,1,22 August 2004
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Star Wars Movie Adult Fans Have Been Waiting For
","Rogue One: easily the most adult of ALL Star Wars movies. To some, saying 'adult' would mean 'boring', 'unexciting' or 'lifeless'. 'Rogue One' is none of those adjectives but it's fair to say it is the most 'kid unfriendly' of all the Star Wars movies. Director Gareth Edwards made it his quest to make a Star Wars movie for the middle aged fans, the ones who were, 8, 9, 10 or even 15 years old when they first got introduced to George Lucas' space opera. Yes, I'm one of those fans. It's unavoidable comparing this movie with the prequels. While the prequels had their charm (and were made by the CREATOR himself, Mr. Lucas), it wasn't really what I was expecting. I don't hate them at all, but I don't like them as much as the originals (I do think however, 'Revenge Of The Sith' is superior to 'Return Of The Jedi'). Gareth Edwards completely understood that there was a huge need for a more 'serious' Star Wars movie. 'The Force Awakens' was a move in the right direction, despite what the unfaithful might think or say. 'Force Awakens' had a perfect balance of serious, dramatic parts with more lighthearted fare (without ever falling into Jar Jar or 'ani' territory). With 'Rogue One', Gareth Edwards went all out to make a grim, bleak looking movie. Certain scenes reminded me of 'Bladerunner' and 'Alien', two masterpieces of adult science fiction. We get to feel the rough edges of the rebellion, that it's not all peachy and good and that sometimes violent decisions must be made for the sake of the cause. Reviewers that have also mentioned similarities to 'Saving Private Ryan' are also right. The fights are violent, the storm troopers are scarier (something that JJ Abrams got positively right in 'The Force Awakens'), the rebels have their defects. It's not all 'good' or 'bad', there are grays, there's a middle ground.What we basically have with 'Rogue One' is a prequel. The most 'prequels' of the prequels, if there's an adjective to describe Gareth Edwards work here. The movie truly ends with the beginning of 'A New Hope'. We finally know how the rebels 'stole' the plans to the Death Star: a lot of casualties, a lot of deaths, a lot of sacrifice. 'Rogue One' was the REAL suicide squad. Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor and their band of mercenaries are heroes as much as Han Solo, Leia Organa or Luke Skywalker. While the latter three lived to celebrate the destruction of the Death Star, I wonder how many of the rebels know the sacrifice that went into stealing the plans. The acting, the pacing, the effects: everything was brilliant about 'Rogue One'. It was a daring project that could've backfired but it did not. Yes, I too missed the intro scroll with the triumphant Star Wars theme playing loud in the background. Yes, I missed the familiar themes of John Williams. Composer Michael Giaccino had one hell of a task but he pulled it of. The main prevalent musical motif in 'Rogue One' (could be 'Jyn Erso's' theme) is similar to 'Rey's Theme' in 'The Force Awakens'. It could be a friendly nod from Giaccino to Williams. Only a couple of Williams' classic cues were used: The Imperial March, the Imperial theme from Star Wars, the Force theme and of course, the end credits have a good portion of classic Star Wars music, but almost 90% of the score is brand new music. It had to be done and Giaccino was the right choice.I have nothing but praises for 'Rogue One'. If you were expecting something like 'The Phantom Menace', this movie is NOT for you, I'm sorry to say. For me, 'Rogue One' hit all the right buttons. It was the Star Wars movie I was waiting for.",10,2,6,22 March 2017
The Hunger Games," 'Battle Royale' light!
","Last night I finally saw 'The Hunger Games' and I must confess it's an entertaining movie. Shades of older movies such as 'Rollerball', 'Logan's Run' and more recently, 'Battle Royale' are very present in 'Hunger Games'. In a distant future North America goes through a war that leaves the nation devastated. The war was caused by internal uprising, not a foreign attack. After a lengthy war the state prevails, but much of the nation is left in ruins. As means to remember this sad period, the state organizes a reality show called 'the hunger games', where each of the 12 districts that started the revolts years ago, must submit a young boy and girl to participate in a televised fight to the death, where only one can become the sole victor. This is where this movie veers closely to the Japanese masterpiece 'Battle Royale', with a premise very much alike.Our heroine comes from district 12, Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Despite casting a bombshell as a tough warrior, Jennifer pulls it off amazingly well, giving a serious performance. I understand this movie is a book adaptation and, in my case, I haven't read the books or book so I can't really tell if it's a faithful adaptation. A strange feeling invaded me while watching 'The Hunger Games'; it felt like something big was going to happen, a big revelation or the real truth behind such barbaric game. But this revelation never happened and by the time the film ends I'm left with more questions that answers. Unlike 'Battle Royale', I developed little sympathy for the rest of the young kids involved in the game. Out of the 24 participants, the movie is designed for the audience to care for only 3 characters: Katniss, Peeta and Rua, that's it. Little or no background is given of the other participants, some of them seemed to really enjoy all the hunting and killing.Little is said about the president of the nation, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, in what I thought was a waste of talent. Again, reading the book would probably help me to understand the many plot holes this movie has. I think more could've been done with the movie's premise, a more social commentary, but director Gary Ross apparently chose not to. In the end, 'The Hunger Games' is really a light version of 'Battle Royale'.",7,27,37,25 December 2012
Spider-Man 2," Mind Blowing and Better Than The First
","I think one of the prime requisites in bringing to life a comic book action hero to the big screen is making him as believable as possible. We all want to relate to some part of this hero in our daily lives and when a movie accomplishes that, no matter how far out the situations might be, it succeeds. SPIDERMAN 2 succeeds in this by bringing more dramatic elements and a more carefully written story. Tobey Maguire is excellent as the confused teenager-cum-hero. He doesn't want to lose the love of his life (Mary Jane, played wonderfully by Kirsten Dunst) but at the same time he feels the obligation of fighting for justice, as means of honoring his late uncle Ben Parker (Cliff Robertson). SPIDERMAN 2's core is more about this repressed love than about chasing villains and saving the day. Even this movie's bad guy, Dr.Otto Octavious (played by Alfred Molina) is not as bad as he initially seems, but he eventually unleashes some over the top mayhem for good measure. You might even say this is a more 'girly' sequel, but fear not: when the action hits the screen, is badder, wilder and more violent that the first movie. In one particular scene, Sam Raimi finally unleashes his true origins as a horror maestro, with camera angles, noises and film editing that will remind the gore hounds of the EVIL DEAD movies. For those of us that have known Raimi's previous work, the scene will be a joyride!Opinions out there might be diverse: I'm sure some fans would've liked a sequel with 2 hours of non stop action, seeing Spiderman battling foes left and right. SPIDERMAN 2 delivers because it has a GOOD story and you are anxious to know what will the next scene be like. I had a blast watching SPIDERMAN 2 and would put this movie along with other great sequels such as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, ALIENS and THE GODFATHER 2. Yep, it's THAT good! Can't wait for the DVD to come out! 10* out of 10*",10,0,0,18 July 2004
The Irishman," Like a Good Aged Wine
","Watching the ensemble cast of 'The Irishman' is like savoring a quality, aged wine at home, whereas 'Goodfellas' is savoring that same wine at a fancy restaurant surrounded by your best friends. This is indeed a fine film, beautifully acted, gorgeously shot, gracefully paced but falls short of being a masterpiece like 'Taxi Driver', 'Goodfellas' or even 'Casino'. The Jimmy Hoffa subject has been dealt upon in various other films, this one being perhaps the most thoroughly produced but still, a theme I've seen before.
I could easily watch Pacino, Pesci, Deniro and Keitel sitting in chairs for 3 hours doing nothing and I would still think it's great, but other people might just fall asleep. The movie, I think, could've been edited down to 2:30hrs and it would've made for a tighter story.Still, 'The Irishman' is worth the watch because some of cinema's greatest actors are in it, directed by one of Hollywood's most talented directors.",7,3,4,24 February 2020
Black Book," Amazing and wildly entertaining!
","ZWARTBOEK (Black Blook) is an amazingly well written, well paced and well directed world war II action/drama directed by one of my all time favorite directors: Paul Verhoeven. I'm a huge ROBOCOP/STARSHIP TROOPERS/TOTAL RECALL, etc... fan. I even found SHOWGIRLS to be not that bad at all. Anyway, Verhoeven did this film in his native Holland and I was actually expecting a kind of indie-styled war drama, you know: good but low budget. How wrong was I? Had this movie been done in Hollywood it would have amassed several academy award nominations. It's a slick looking picture with all the technical savvy of a Hollywood picture. Paul Verhoeven has put all his Hollywood knowledge into great use to make ZWARTBOEK an engrossing picture.The movie deals primarily with the story of Rachel Stein, a beautiful Jewish girl living in German occupied Holland. While trying to get away from Holland, her family is mercilessly executed by the SS, after a fellow countryman had told her it was safe to cross into Belgium at night through the river. She manages to escape and joins a resistance group in Holland, where she is given the task to infiltrate the SS and pass herself as a German cabaret singer. In the process, she falls for Gestapo officer Müntze. At first, Müntze suspects she's a spy and after he finally finds out who she is, he also falls madly in love with her. The movie then turns into a series of conspiracies and double crossing friends. The action never lets up, and there's hardly a boring moment in the entire film (it is way over 2 hours, but they fly by at high speed!). As with other Verhoeven films, there's plenty of sex and violence to please old time fans, but there's also a solid story and great acting by dutch actress Carice Van Houten. She is really hot in this movie and her acting is what makes this picture so entertaining and believable. If she ever decides to go Hollywood, she's gonna blow some young actresses away in a Milli second! Sebastian Koch as Müntze and Thomas Hoffman as the resistance doctor are also superb.Some people have argued that this is probably Paul Verhoeven's crowning achievement and they maybe right: the movie has everything going for it. It really took me by surprise since I was expecting something not THIS good. Make no mistake: ZWARTBOEK is a roller-coaster ride of a movie and it won't disappoint you!",10,2,7,25 May 2008
Constantine," Confusing and non gratifying
","For people who haven't read the comic book (like myself), CONSTANTINE might be a bit tough to sit through, but apparently, from reading other user comments who are FANS of the comic book, their situation is the same as mine. CONSTANTINE deals with the doings of John Constantine, a 'detective/exorcist' who battles demons from possessed people. John has a 'special' gift, in that he can actually see these demons and prevents them from ever crossing into 'our' world. The premise is very interesting during the first 20 minutes or so of the movie. Then, John's path's crosses with Angela (Rachel Weisz), a detective who has recently lost her twin sister in what seems to be a suicide. Angela firmly believes that her sister could not have committed suicide and that she was 'possessed' when she jumped off the roof of a building. She contacts John for help and the rest of the movie is a battle between renegade exorcist Constantine and the forces of evil. The interesting aspect of the story is that, according to John, God and the Devil are playing almost like 'chess' with mankind and that they are 'betting' who will turn out evil and who will be saved and join the kingdom of heaven. Since I don't know the comic book I can only assume that it is a better read than a better watch, since CONSTANTINE drags on for too long without any defined action sequences or defined antagonists. Keanu's performance was poor to say the least. True, his wooden persona sometimes fits a certain movie (I believe he was great in THE MATRIX), but in CONSTANTINE he appears to be asking the question that drives us, 'Where The Hell Is The Matrix!!!'. Rachel Weisz' performances was more gratifying and it was nice to see former grunge rocker Gavin Rossdale as an evil demon. All in all, CONSTANTINE is nice visual candy but story wise it confuses the viewer with its heaven and hell philosophy. It's NOT the movie I expected and I seriously doubt there will be a sequel for this.",5,4,9,16 July 2005
Troy," A Drama That Leads To Nowhere
","Before I start my review I must confess that I haven't read Homer's 'The Illyad', but from what I can gather, the epic poem reads a lot better than this movie. I found TROY very confusing; I think that rooting for one character would help, but you end up feeling pity for Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is portrayed as a ruthless, heartless mercenary, hellbent on being 'THE' warrior. At the end, you don't feel any sorrow nor pity for anyone...you kind of wish everyone dies, which they eventually do so. The scenery, the CGI fx and the overall acting is OK, although I have my doubts about Brad Pitt's casting...he's just 'too' Hollywood, if you get my meaning. Still, he gets the job done with a decent performance. Eric Bana does great as Hector. Another miscast would be Orlando Bloom as Paris, Hector's kid brother. I think we've seen enough of Mr.Bloom in other 'Epic' pictures...his agent should try to diversify his client's movie offers. For a moment, I thought I was going to get a GLADIATOR 2 kind of movie. It is similar (due to the period setting and overall feel), but where as GLADIATOR was wise and had a rapid pace, this one is slow and contrived. Again, I think I should read Homer's poem. Nice movie if you plan to rent a DVD on a Sunday night (by the way, TROY is already out on DVD here in Mexico and NO, it's not a bootleg!!!)7* out of 10.",7,1,2,5 December 2004
Spider-Man 3," More dramatic but still a great third chapter
","I can't believe some of the comments I'm reading here. Surely they must come from pimple-ridden teenagers who were expecting a non-stop assault of special effects and fighting sequences. True, there's plenty of that in SPIDER MAN 3, but for once in my life I couldn't care less about the amazing special effects (top notch work here)because the story truly grabbed me. The conflict inside Peter Parker, the way he transforms into an egotistical maniac, was marvelous. I must confess, it was nice to see spidey taking on his enemies with a vengeful glee, though ultimately this was his undoing. What I really liked about SPIDER MAN 3 was the depth of character of the villains. Unlilke, say, Lex Luthor or The Joker (who are apparently evil since birth for no apparent or explained motive), the villains here end up who they are under very adverse circumstances, like Flint Marko (Sandman). You can't help but to feel sorry for him and this type of villain development is sorely missing in other so called 'action hero' movies. Like Dr.Doom of the FANTASTIC 4: he appears to be evil over some really meaningless reason that doesn't hold any water!If there's one complaint I have about the whole movie, it doesn't deal with the story nor the acting nor the superb special FX: it's about the music. Danny Elfman, who's made countless of memorable scores (BATMAN, SIMPSONS), he just can't seem to make a truly memorable score for the SPIDER MAN franchise. Forget the grandiose score of a SUPERMAN, or STAR WARS, or even his fabulous BATMAN score. The music, while still great, is far from memorable.Sam Raimi has treated the SPIDER MAN movies with respect and you can see there's a work of love involved. If some of you out there prefer the 'other' mindless action hero movies out there, be my guest. For my money, I truly enjoyed the the 2 hours plus ride of SPIDER MAN 3! 10* out of 10*!",10,13,23,5 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Decent Ending of Fabulous Saga
","I think most Star Wars fans agree that 'Return Of The Jedi' could have been a better film. I think the marketing forces involved here had to broaden up the appeal of the film...to kids! Lucas tends to forget that, those of us who were 10 or 12 years old when we first saw the original Star Wars, were 16-18 years old by the time of Jedi. And I'm talking about the die hard fans; those of us that only like Star Wars films more as time passes by. For those fans, we would have liked a bit more depth of characters, a better dialoge. In this movie, Harrison Ford's part felt sort of cut down as was Carrie Fisher's. The Ewoks were ok, but many fans felt they were both: comic relief and a marketing ploy for future toys. Although I've read many comments complaining how Luke's character was never explored fully emotionally, many people tend to forget that Darth Vader also went through some second thoughts of his own, and those feelings could have been explored a bit more towards the end. The final confrontation was good and the complaints I have are mostly with the changing of actors. This would have been David Prowse' shining hour (He played the physical Vader; His voice was James Earl Jones'). Why this happened will always be open to debate. The effects, as always, pushed up the ante and laid the groundwork for contemporary effects. That said, 'Return' is no let down by any means and should be viewed as a decent ending to a fabulous saga.",8,0,0,30 November 2003
Nacho Libre," Offbeat and entertaining Parody
","'NACHO LIBRE' is an entertaining parody of a beloved Mexican cult sport: wrestling. Jack Black plays Ignacio, an orphan from a Scandinavian/Mexican couple who grows to be a fraile in a remote town in Oaxaca, one of Mexico's poorest states. Ignacio dreams of being a pro wrestler and longs for the love of sister Encarnacion (downplayed by Mexican poster-girl beauty Ana de la Reguera). The movie tells how Igancio becomes the wrestler he so much dreams of becoming and in the way he befriends 'Esqueleto', a hobo from Oaxaca with peculiar fighting skills. NACHO LIBRE is an offbeat parody of one of Mexico's most beloved cult sports but within the parody, the film makers make an accurate portrayal of what life in rural Mexico is like. Some of the actors and plenty of extras are truly Mexican, down to the groupies at the wrestling matches, so realism is always present. Some of the humor is decidedly intended for Mexican audiences and in that respect NACHO LIBRE will surely win many Mexican fans. On the other hand, we are never given much background on the characters: we never really know why Ignacio speaks English SO well, as well as some of the townsfolk. You have to remember this is rural Mexico, not Cancun, not Acapulco, where it's easier to find English speaking natives. Even 'Equeleto' for being a plain bum, his English is spectacularly articulate, not to mention the orphan kids at the convent and the priests themselves! Flaws aside, I must confess I did laugh out loud and my wife enjoyed it even more than I did, so I guess NACHO LIBRE and Jack Black achieved their purpose of putting a Mexican parody on film. Let's just hope that other people, unaware of Mexican culture, have as much fun!",7,2,4,12 November 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Much better than 'OCEAN'S 12', but....
","I wholeheartedly enjoyed OCEAN'S 13 far more than OCEAN'S 12. Why? Well, this time around, the story is a bit simpler and I found it funnier. I think I actually laughed more on this one than on the first! The acting was top notch as usual and the ensemble cast was marvelous, if not as great as on the first one. This time around is about a revenge of sorts, after one of Danny Ocean's associates, Reuben (Elliot Gould) is ripped off by Willy Bank (Al Pacino), a new, ruthless casino owner who wants Reuben out of his way. Reuben suffers an almost fatal heart attack due to this back stabbing by Willy. Danny and his friends swear to get even as his friend Reuben lies in bed, almost comatose. Willy Bank is on the verge of the grand opening of his hotel, which will be Las Vegas greatest attraction (a fictional, CGI created hotel). He also wants to win a prestigious '5 diamond' award, given only to the top of the top of luxury hotels worldwide by some important organization. As with the previous movies, it's interesting to see how the guys plan everything to achieve their revenge. The only thing about this sequel is the implausibility of certain events. Where as OCEANS 11, as outlandish as it was, exposed the heist within credible parameters, this time around some things look like right out of a comic book strip. For instance, why would the gang GO to Terry Benedict for help? In the first movie, Benedict was portrayed as a ruthless, almost homicidal casino owner. You really had a fear of him and, after what Danny Ocean and his gang did to him, I doubt he would ever have use for any of them. Well, this time the gang asks Benedict to finance the heist, just because Willy Bank's hotel casts a shadow over Benedict's hotels. And some of the devices used this time around look like out of the latest FANTASTIC 4 movie. As with previous films, this is not a fast paced auctioneer, and the real deal here is to enjoy the subtleties, the way the gang plans and executes the heist. I really enjoyed this, if somewhat unbelievable sequel, and I laughed real hard!",8,0,2,5 August 2007
Barry Lyndon," A Visually Stunning Masterpiece
","Finally, after 42 years of neglect I got to watch Stanley Kubrik´s period masterpiece BARRY LYNDON. It´s a film best watched with a cup of red wine by your side. Although it moves at slow pace action wise, it is never boring. The costumes, the fine details of the era (the 18th century) are stunning to watch even in this age of high tech movie warfare. Still, as visually gorgeaus as this movie is, it is never really engaging. A lot of it, I think, comes from Ryan O'Neil's stiffer-than-a-corpse portrayal of Barry Lyndon. I don't know if his emotionless portrayal was done on purpose or if it's inherent of Mr. O'Neil's acting skills (think Keanu Reeves but much stiffer). BARRY LYNDON would've been much suited for a short mini-series. In that format, BARRY LYNDON's story would've been much more engaging.Humor is very present in a very subtle way, in the narration and in the story itself, yet in never borders on comedy at all. Despite being a 3 hour long movie, BARRY LYNDON goes by pretty quickly without ever being boring. Unlike other Kubrick films, there's little hidden meaning behind BARRY LYNDON with a very straight forward story and an ending that feels rather inclomplete.Still, BARRY LYNDON is a marvel to watch and an overall satisfying Kubrick film, but certainly not his pinnacle.",8,2,4,7 February 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Almost Like A Documentary
","FULL METAL JACKET is a great movie, but despite what the critics or other fellow users might have written, this is NOT the best Viet Nam movie. FMJ has an almost 'documentary' like feel to it. You can pretty much cut the movie in halves; the first one being the brutal boot camp training the draftees have to go through. Lee Emrey's role as the brutal D.I. is perhaps the movie's most memorable performance. The second half is basically on-the-field action of some sorts. Don't expect bodies being hacked and maimed in a non-stop barrage of bullets and shrapnel. What we get instead is the camaraderie that exists between the soldiers, what their views are of this war (which are quite disparate!). It is during this last half that FMJ adopts a 'documentary' feel. True, the very few combat scenes are done with the grace and excellence that Stanley Kubrik is well known for. The eerie orchestral music will remind you of THE SHINING and some 'period' music (Sixties Pop) is thrown in for good measure.I haven't seen PLATOON, which many say it is THE ultimate Viet Nam War movie, but if you ask me which movie deserves that praise, I'd probably say THE KILLING FIELDS or maybe even THE DEERHUNTER. Still, FULL METAL JACKET is a very entertaining movie that views the Viet Nam war from a different perspective.",7,0,0,18 July 2005
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody WILL rock you!
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a nice, if heavily sanitized biopic about Queen's legendary singer, Freddie Mercury and the rest of the band. Although it plays a bit of hanky panky in the timeline department, those in the audience who know little about the band's history won't surely mind. The casting Rami Malek as Mercury was spot on, although I do believe that Sacha Baron Cohen (the producers original choice to play the legendary singer) would've been even more spot on due to his much closer resemblance to Freddie. The rest of the cast was also perfectly cast: Gwilym Lee DOES look like Brian May and Joseph Mazzello IS John Deacon (to the point of limiting himself to only utter one-liners and be, like the real John, mostly in the background of things). Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor is physically less convincing but more that makes up for it with his amusing performance.
This be said, and I'm sorry if I sound obvious, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a movie FOR the Queen fan, even the casual fans. If you're not a fan of Queen or hard rock it's less likely to fire you up. I grew up with Queen, so in my case I enjoyed it very much despite some historical innacurracies (which Brian May and Roger Taylor eventually gave their concent to).The film is basically one huge build up to its 'Live Aid' finale. It would've been interesting to see the aftermath of Live Aid and how the band functioned normally for almost 6 more years, but the movie would've ended on a downbeat.Hearing Queen's greatest songs on a movie theater's speakers will definitely send shivers down your spine!
Great, solid entertainment in an era where we will hardly see another band as massive as Queen.",8,2,3,19 November 2018
Bird Box," Apocalyptic Suicidal Tendencies
","Netflix has a sometimes morbid fixation with end-of-the-world movies as of lately, and its latest entry is no exception. 'Bird Box' has an interesting apocalyptic premise: people start killing themselves for no apparent reason, just by looking at thin air. Instead of turning into Zombies ala 'The Walking Dead', the folks in Bird Box simply go suicidal. Whereas in TWD we are informed that some sort of virus is responsible for making the dead come alive, in 'Bird Box' we are never given an explanation, with only hints of what it could be. In order to avoid going suicidal, people have go blindfold out in the open and avoid looking at thin air.Pregnant single mother Malorie (Sandra Bullock), narrowly survives the apocalypse in her hometown (somewhere in the Bay Area) by finding refuge at a house that soon becomes the main shelter for survivors in that neighborhood. Malorie and the rest of the survivors in the house conclude that they need to blindfold themselves in order to avoid going suicidal which means driving blind to the supermarket when they run out of food. We also know that a very small group of people are immune to whatever's causing this 'suicidal craze', but these people are psychos with mental problems.The movie is quite tense and it develops at a nice pace but my only complaint is that it never explains anything about what caused the suicidal rage and why some people are immune (aside from actual BLIND people, of course). Just like Netflix's other apocalyptic entry, 'How It Ends', the streaming giant just isn't interested in letting people know the origins of their Armageddon flicks, which in turn makes them look half baked and with lackluster endings.It seems that 'Bird Box' would've fared much better as a mini series, since a TON of stuff is left unexplained as if on purpose. As a mini series (and having this movie as its pilot episode), the events shown in 'Bird Box' would probably make far more sense.",7,0,1,30 December 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," An Ending with no 'REAL' ending???
","So many people had told me that MATRIX REVOLUTIONS was a disappointment, that I refused to believe them. Its short theatrical run here in Mexico prevented me from viewing it in all its splendor, but fortunately at last, I rented it on DVD and watched it with my home theater full blast. I loved the first MATRIX and most of you will agree it's a cinematic achievement. MATRIX RELOADED somehow annoyed some people, but it was an action-packed, worthy successor that I personally enjoyed even more than the first. I'm sorry to say that MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is INDEED disappointing due to its oblique and vague ending. I won't mention any spoilers but this I will say: the MATRIX franchise is NOT over. The way the film ends, it gives the WACHOWSKI BROS. a chance to further the series sometime in the future. It seems that all the philosophical mumbo-jumbo of the first two grew way too big and made it literally impossible for 'Revolutions' to have a satisfactory ending. This said, however, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS still holds as a fine Sci-Fi, action-packed movie, and it moves along at a nice and unboring pace. The character of the Oracle comes more into the way of things,but by the same token, other characters, like Morpheus, become almost extras! Niobe and captain Mifune become more important elements in this installment, but the Merovingio and Persephone are shamelessly wasted with 3 second parts. MATRIX REVOLUTIONS may demand some repeated viewing (if you're a real fan) to fully grasp its intentions, but this review is based on my SECOND viewing (indeed, I enjoyed the second viewing more than the first!). MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is NOT a BAD film by any means, but in regards to its previous installments, it is by far the weakest one.",8,0,0,25 April 2004
Man of Steel," Half Hearted Reboot...
","'Man Of Steel' is definitely a 'nice' try of a reboot of perhaps the most famous of ALL superheroes. Director Zack Snyder and producer Christopher Nolan tried hard to bring in a new twist to the story of Clark Kent/Kal-El as the caped crusader but ended up with some very anti-climatic story plots and lifeless characters. While viewers over 40 (like myself) will always compare new versions of Superman to the 1st original cinematic endeavor it's fair to say that younger audiences might find this version satisfying, but even with that audience's blessing you have to stand up against the comics purists. This review is filled with spoilers, so if that bothers you stop reading right now. I can sum up 'Man of Steel' with a series of 'pros' and 'cons':PROS:1. Updated, state of the art special effects.2. This version gives a meaning to the 'S' log on Superman's chest, something NO other version has ever attempted.3. General Zod's motives are better explained in this version than in the original Richard Donner film, thus rendering this character with more depth.4. When we see Clark Kent growing up, we see an alienated kid, coping with his powers and trying to keep them a secret. We see a conflict that we can relate to, thus making this character more believable.5. Jonathan Kent (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner) an Martha Kent (Diane Lane) play better rounded characters than in 'Superman:The Movie'. Jonathan's death on this movie adds more meaning and purpose to what makes Superman tick.6. We get to know Kypton more and how its society came to be and its reasons. CONS:1. The music score: we're talking about the greatest superhero EVER. It's hard NOT to think about John Williams rousing 'Superman: The Movie' theme when watching a Superman movie or hearing the 'superman' name. Hans Zimmer (Inception, Gladiator), known for making some iconic film scores, just couldn't come up with a music score that could stand up to John Williams work. He was simply dwarfed by what was done before. In its stead, the second half of the movie is filled with a barrage of CGI fx. It's as if director Zack Snyder wanted the audience NOT to notice the lack of a memorable score.2. Clark Kent: 'Man Of Steel' literally bypasses the secret identity of Superman! We have Lois Lane actually KNOWING who Clark Kent really is from the very start!3. Superman: Forget the heroics of 'Superman: The Movies', 'Man Of Steel' seems hellbent on making Superman as human as possible. The writers seem to have a problem here and so does Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder. Superman is NOT Batman. Clark Kent is NOT Bruce Wayne. Where Nolan hit the jackpot in history's most acclaimed reboot, it seems the makers of 'Man Of Steel' wanted to turn this hero into a second Batman.4. Lois Lane and Clark Kent: Chemistry between these two is practically non-existent. 5. Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor, is nowhere to be found and that was the beauty of 'Superman: The Movie': how can a inferior, powerless being be a match strong enough for Superman? In his stead we have basically the climatic battle of general Zod and his sidekicks we witnessed in 'Superman II' done with 2013 technology.6. Reboot? 'Man Of Steel' is basically a remake of 'Superman: The Movie'(1978) and 'Superman II'(1981), crammed into one movie and plot twists altered in their order of appearance.I could go on endlessly with more pros and cons (more of the latter really).It seems the makers wanted to make a reboot a la 'Batman' but failed on many things along the way. It's true that no movie is perfect, and what I may find useless or uninteresting other might think just the opposite. I think many more decades will pass until the memory of Christopher Reeve fades away completely. He is and forever will be, the iconic, cinematic Superman. 'Superman Returns', despite being panned by most fans and critics is a much, much more satisfying film than this. At least 'Returns' could be seen as a direct continuation of 'Superman II' (1981), even to the point of having William's classic theme.Still, 'Man Of Steel' is fun to watch and does manage to keep your attention for over two hours, it's just that it is not the reboot I was expecting.",7,0,1,24 November 2013
Split," A slow burner without a Shyamalan Twist Ending
","I like M. Night Shyamalan movies. They were sort of a commodity in the late 90s/early 2000s. 'Signals' has to be my fave Shyamalan movie because I think it's his most original. 'The 6th Sense' was like a watered down 'Jacob's Ladder'. With 'Split', we deal with a psycho with multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) personality disorder. 23 personalities linger inside James McAvoy's character, if I reckon.
Shyamalan's movies became famous for their 'twist' ending: you expect one thing and get something totally unexpected. It's a gimmick that would eventually wear off as his movie career progressed. With 'Split', he doesn't pull any sort of twist ending, which in this particular case would've elevated the movie to far higher level. Story plots are left unexplained or for the audience to figure out (after subsequent viewings, I might add). James McAvoy's performance is indeed OSCAR worthy, but that's about it. The movie drags along at a excruciating slow pace, giving little to no explanation to what happened before.Having a psychiatric patient this sick out on his own was the film's first major mistake. I've worked with psychiatrists before and know for a FACT they would never let anyone resembling James McAvoy's character out in the open. This is a patient that requires heavy medication and heavy surveillance, yet he was living all by 'himself' making a living doing god knows what.The idea behind 'Split' is fascinating; mental disorders can become great Hollywood fodder but in this case, Shyamalan fell very short. What's worse: linking this movie to his previous film, 'Unbreakable' (a certified snore fest) does not help at all. At least 'Split' is a superior movie than 'Unbreakable'. So sad he had to link both movies.",6,0,0,22 October 2018
The Shining," Aged Well Like a Fine Wine!
","I vividly remember that back in 1980, THE SHINING was severely panned by both critics and fans of the book alike. My mother read the book way before the film was released and when she saw the movie she was quite pleased. I never read the book but I think THE SHINING was a very good movie. Released at a time when the norm for 'hip' horror was the 'slasher' genre established by HALLOWEEN and more notoriously Friday THE 13th. THE SHINING, with its moody, creepy atmosphere, eerie soundtrack and seldom body count set itself greatly apart from other 'slasher' flicks of the time. While I do like Friday THE 13th, I'll be the first to admit that it looks extremely dated and that it is the basis for SCARY MOVIE and its sequels. Even many Fangoria readers trashed THE SHINING for not being gory enough, but the charm of this movie is the sheer creepiness and the atmosphere it creates. In this respect, THE SHINING is closer to THE CHANGELING (another haunted house movie that has aged extremely well) than to the slasher flicks that were its peers. Jack Nicholson's performance is outstanding and although he did look like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown long before strange things started happening at the hotel I think his casting was correct. Same goes to Shelly Duvall who does great as Jack's wife Wendy. I have seen THE SHINING many times and all I can say is that the movie has stood the test of time and looks as vibrant and as offbeat today as it did 26 years ago. Unfortunately, a lot of horror movies of that era look ridiculously outdated. This means Mr.Kubrik was right all along!",10,2,3,27 May 2006
Divergent," The Dystopian Future Is In Vogue
","I'm amazed to read most reviews here. It seems to me that most IMDb readers/users think of themselves as 'film noir' critics, or maybe the second coming of Roger Ebert. When I watch a movie, I like being entertained. Sure, the story must be good but not necessarily plausible. If that was the case, movies like STAR WARS or even TITANIC would've been colossal failures. DIVERGENT was such a movie: entertaining, teen-oriented, post- apocalyptic fun. In the not so distant future we find out that there was a terrible war. Little is said who started it or what provoked such devastating war. What it is clear is that mankind survived and made strict rules for its new society in order to ensure the peace. This new society has been classified into different personality categories, or factions: abnegation, candor, dauntless, Amity and Erudite. Each strata of this new society complements the other factions so to keep a harmonious balance. The members of this society reach a certain age (18, I guess), they go through a series of tests that will define their definite personality, regardless if they come from a different faction. This new society's motto is 'faction before blood', so one has to be more loyal to his or her faction than to their families. Those who do not fit in any faction are called (most obviously) faction less, but they do not pose a threat to society, simply an uncomfortable burden (they are the homeless, the tramps, the scum). As the movie moves along we find out that there is another profile of people who also don't fit in, but pose a supposedly 'serious threat' to society. These are called 'divergent' and are to be terminated as soon as they are spotted. Divergents possess qualities of all factions, they are like a 'greatest hits' of factions.As you might guess, the movie revolves around a girl named Beatrice 'Tris' and her finding that she is a 'divergent' and how she must survive in a society that has no room for her kind.Shades of THE HUNGER GAMES are evident all over the place. THE MATRIX too, even FLASH GORDON (1980), but all done in very good taste. I found myself enjoying DIVERGENT significantly more than THE HUNGER GAMES (at least the 1st installment), which I'd like to remind all IMDb critics is a 'light version' of BATTLE ROYALE. We get to see Kate Winslet (TITANIC) as the baddie. It was never clear to me if she was the President or what, but she seems to be in charge of this new society. Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn are in there too and that's about it as far as 'names' in this picture. All other actors are basically teens or twenty somethings, so yes, there's a strong effort from the filmmakers to attract a young audience (like THE HUNGER GAMES). Anybody who's worked for a big, multi-national corporation will quickly see the similarities between the dystopian society portrayed in this movie and the company they might work for. Companies ALWAYS want to label their employees, as if we could only be ONE type of personality, so I found this intriguing. I supposed most 'Roger Eberts' in IMDb barely perceived this. Was it a predictable movie? Most movies are, in a way. All Disney movies have happy endings, don't they? Being predictable is not a sign of being a BAD movie. I found DIVERGENT getting more interesting and interesting as frames passed by. It has good special effects and the acting is quite bearable. Trust me, I've seen far, far worse movies that end up being praised as the ultimate in cinema. If you didn't like the movie, that's OK, you're entitled to think and say whatever, just as I'm entitled to say that DIVERGENT was a truly entertaining, interesting and fast paced futuristic movie. If you ask me, I enjoyed it far more than the over-blown HUNGER GAME series.",9,8,12,2 November 2014
No Country for Old Men," Could Someone Explain Me This Movie
","The Cohen brothers are known for their brainy, meticulously crafted, character driven films. I love 'Fargo', and 'No Country For Old Men' had all the elements of another masterpiece, yet it is not. It is a very well made movie, very well acted and with some high impact action sequences and some nasty gore thrown in to make things real, but since I know little about the characters, little I care about them or what happens to them. You have Javier Bardem as psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh. Where this guys came from, what's his purpose and why does he carry a powerful air gun (with which he can shoot people dead at close range or blow door knobs off). You have Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, an average Joe with a military background who happens to stumble upon a drug deal gone wrong and grabs a suitcase filled with 2 million dollars. A surviving drug dealer, bleeding to death in his truck asks Llewelyn for some water. The guy will not last more than a couple of hours at the most. Llewlyn drives back home with the 2 million suitcase. Instead of packing things up immediately and leave town with his wife Carla Jean, he makes the incredibly STUPID mistake of going back to the scene of the crime carrying a gallon of water. It seems he wants to give some water to the dying drug dealer but for this, several hours have passed, it's dark now and sure enough, the drug dealer's dead, not before a rival gang sees him in the distance and chases him, until he escapes by jumping into a river. That was the stupidest plan ever and sure enough, it sets the ball rolling for the rival gang to try to find Llewelyn Moss and get their money back. The rival drug gang assign wacko head Anton to go after Llewlynd, which turns 'No Country For Old Men' into a tense thriller.Everything was going just fine until the abrupt ending, where town sheriff (played very laid back by Tommy Lee Jones) starts mumbling some monologue stuff, as if to tie some loose ends of the story and suddenly, Poof! The end credits start rolling. What happened to Anton? Did he actually killed Llewelyn's wife? No I'm sure there are some brainy reviewers here that might say that films leave certain stuff for people to make their own conclusions, but this is really over the top. I actually thought my bluray disc player had stuck and jumped over to the credits but no: that WAS the actual ending.One thing that also really bothered me were the shoot out sequences. It appears that Southern Texas is devoid of a police force, since we actually see very few of them, in spite of fire arms being fired left and right, at night and in broad daylight. It reminded me of Mexico, where you can do this sort of stuff during a traffic jam only to have police arrive an hour later. But Mexico is like that, uber corrupt, far more than ANYTHING in the States. Throughout the entire film, I didn't get the impression the police were after Anton Chiguhr, save for the very end.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. I only wish my brain could be far more developed to understand the meaning behind this film, the abruptness of how it ends and what was it all about",6,1,3,2 October 2017
The Pianist," Superb Drama
","Last night I finally rented 'The Pianist' on DVD. It was a superb film and a crude drama on the realities of world war two. Although it has a good pace for a non-action movie, it does tend to get sluggish in parts and you can't help but wonder what actually happens to the rest of the pianist's family (probably killed in Treblinka, but the film never addresses their fate). Also, I wish some more insight could have been given to the Nazi Officer who ultimately became the pianist's savior, as it was truly rare to see such human kindness during a war like this. At parts, it reminded me a bit of 'Schindler's List', although this is a more personal story and one of survival. Polanski did a terrific job capturing the atmosphere of Warsaw in Ruins and it's good to see that the Academy finally lifted their 'ban' on him. If you want to see a good world war 2 drama, don't hesitate to rent this movie.",9,0,1,17 November 2003
The Lion King," Was This Necessary?
","Why is Disney making live action remakes of its animated fare? Has the well run dry? While the FX in 'The Lion King' are phenomenal, they are just a showcase of CGI animators' talents, nothing more. While I was never a fan of the original, I prefer it much more to this CGI-for-CGI's sakes remake.
Maybe younger generations might eventually like it, I'll give it that, and that's about it.
I understand it made a TON at the box office, which proves that kids fare is still king.Watch ONLY if your kids beg on their knees to see it.",5,2,3,4 January 2020
Stardust," awkward!
","One thing's for sure: STARDUST is not your average, epic-fantasy, lord-of-the-rings rip off kind of movie. On the other hand, it is hard to categorize. While I wasn't overtly crazy about it, it's not a bad film, but the question still remains: was this a comedy? A parody of epic/fantasy films? IMDb description of the movie says 'fantasy', while I might put 'comedy' right next to it. I must say I did have a few good laughs, but I tried to make sense out of everything I was watching. It all evolves about a falling star who turns out to be a pretty girl/princess (Claire Danes). There's no explanation as to why she fell to earth, other than 'the stars were aligned' and all that astrological mumbo-jumbo. On the other hand we have Tristan Thorn, the offspring of a normal peasant and a princess from another, alternate world. A lot of bits and pieces are left unexplained, and just when you feel an explanation is on your way, along comes a funny/campy moment. The alternate world thing could've been better developed me thinks, without sacrificing the comedic edge of the movie. The acting, in some parts, looks forced. It's very rare for me to spot a movie where I think the actor is just 'acting', but STARDUST was the case. Michelle Pfifer was great, as well as Robert De Niro (so what's new?). And it was a real show stopper to see De Niro in a drag, dancing can can music in what is easily the movie's funniest moment, as well as the scene where a man's voice is turned into a parrot. I bent over laughing.Still, for all the laughs, STARDUST played to me more like a spoof movie rather than something more epic. I guess the director and writer where aiming for something different in the fantasy genre, but it still looks half baked. I'm sure next time they'll get it right!",6,1,2,21 January 2008
Ghostbusters," Still Fun To Watch
","I was never a huge fan of this movie, but having watched it last night I must confess that it still holds up pretty well. The premise of a group of ghost hunters could've crashed and burned instantly, but the quirky dialog and dead pan acting of Bill Murray (the main Ghost Buster) really saved the day.
Unfortunately, the only thing that doesn't stand up are the special effects. Even by 1984's standards, Ghost Busters falls way short with its cheap looking effects. What leaves me scratching my head is that Richard Edlund (Star Wars) was behind the SFX and was even (gasp!) nominated for an Academy Award!!! 'Poltergeist', which came 2 years earlier has SFX that for the most part, stand out quite well even today.Still, Ghost Busters is still a fun, if slightly dated, classic to watch.",7,3,3,21 April 2019
Brave," I expected more...
","Brave is good family entertainment but compared to other Pixar movies I can only say it's below par. Why? Because at over 30 minutes into the movie I still had no idea what this movie was going to be about? Would Merida (the title character)grow to become some sort of heroine defending her people? Would she face some incredible enemy? The actual story and motivation behind Brave is more trivial. Sure, I had my laughs and my daughters seem to have enjoyed the movie, it's just that Brave ain't no 'Finding Nemo', nor 'The Incredibles'. Neither it is a 'Toy Story' or even 'Bugs'. It feels like an underdeveloped story and probably under the hands of a better writer it could've been a more memorable film. A case in point: Merida's bow and arrow. With all the publicity posters having her with her bow and arrow and then seeing her in the movie being a master in archery, this ability is never ever developed. Merida just looks 'good' holding a bow and arrow, that's it!Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Brave, but it seems Pixar has raised the bar to high even for their own good.",6,0,2,12 August 2012
Prisoners," Top 250 on the IMDb?
","'Prisoners' was a fine suspense/thriller, if a bit slow paced at first. It's not your typical scare fest. The atmosphere it creates is dark and bleak and it makes you think what how would you react if your little girl suddenly disappears into thin air. Although I thought I payed attention through out the entire film, there are many things that I simply did not understand or they were purposely left for viewer interpretation. The acting is first grade and overall this is a finely crafted movie, the type that will be analyzed for years to come, but at face value it left me confused. The motives behind the two girls disappearing just don't hold any water for me.Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give strong and believable performances, far removed from their usual blockbuster fare. What baffles me here is this movie being in the IMDb top 250. 'Prisoners' is a quite good film, but a top 250? Not in my book. Other, far more influential films are NOT on that list, so I'll have to wonder what makes most IMDb users tick.Anyway, 'Prisoners' is not for everyone, it builds slowly and ends in a very disjointed way. It's still very entertaining, but definitely not TOP 250 fare.",7,1,2,25 September 2017

I guess it's not that bad if I actually stayed awake to see it end (I've tried twice and both times I end up in deep sleep). What's even MORE disturbing is how this piece of...art, ended up in the IMDb Top 250. You mean this is 'better' than THE EXORCIST? Better than E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL, NONE of which are in the top 250. I guess the IMDb is turning too snobby for me.Anyway, if you want to end up in deep sleep, make sure you watch this borefest!",1,7,17,1 January 2015
Blood Diamond," No more diamonds???
","BLOOD DIAMOND is a fast paced action/drama that deals with the real truth about diamonds in Africa: that they are sometimes obtained using some of the most ruthless methods and with little regard for human rights. This is the story of Danny Archer, a diamond bounty hunter who during a brief stay in jail meets Solomon Vandy, a black 'slave' worker who apparently finds a large, precious diamond in the diamond digging site, and buries it so no one else can get it. Archer, anxious to know if Solomon indeed has access to this diamond, pays his bail in order to get to the diamond. In the process, Archer meets Maddy Bowen, an American journalist determined to expose the diamond trade's dirty laundry. Maddy needs Archer's inside scoop about the diamond trade, Archer needs the hidden diamond to escape from Africa and Solomon wants to get his family back. All 3 main character's want something desperately and it's the diamond that holds them together. This is an interesting movie about a subject most of us probably only heard once on CNN or read something about it in NAT GEO. It's sad to see this brutal trade still goes on in the 21st century so in this respect, the movie also succeeds in raising awareness about the subject. Just as a note, it's kind of funny how most movies about Africa only deal with dark subjects, either about this bloody diamond trade, or about ruthless dictators (LAST KING OF Scotland), or pure and simple mayhem (BLACK HAWK DOWN). It's a wonder if Africa has a blooming tourism industry! Di Caprio's performance as Archer is amongst his best. Jennifer Connely is also good, but a bit underused, and Djimon Hounsou is simply unbelievable. I don't think it will be too long for him to get an Oscar. All in all, and movie worth seeing again!",8,0,1,23 April 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Better with Each Viewing
","I remember seeing THE GODFATHER III a couple of months after it was released on VHS and being completely mesmerized by it. I actually had my reserveations, thinking what many of us here though at the time:'How can Coppola TOP the previous installments?' He did not top them, but he certainly was VERY close. Several years passed and I bought the DVD trilogy, but before I could get to watch GODFATHER III, some local TV channel aired it, and I couldn't help but watching it, albeit, not totally focused and incomplete. Somehow, the movie didn't grasp me this time around. A couple of days later I decided to watch it with my wife, on DVD and give it another chance. How wrong was I! The magic that unfolded when I first saw it came back like a hammer blow. I remembered something that I already knew: You have to watch these films with total attention to fully appreciate them. The lack of continuous action packed scenes may discourage some people, but then again, when the action scenes appear, they are over the top. THE GODFATHER III is set some 16 years after the ending of GODFATHER II. Michael Corleone is still trying to make his empire, 'Legit' and his desire to shed the blood of his enemies has greatly diminished. We get to see most of the original cast, although Tom hagan's character (played wonderfully in the first movies by Robert Duvall) is sadly absent. It's never mentioned, but it appears that he died during the 70's. Michaels two children are now young adults. Andy Garcia is introduced as Sonny Corleone's bastard son, Vincent Mancini. His performance has yet to be outdone by himself! He is simply superb as the future heir to the Corleone Empire. Michael, in his attempt to go legit, strikes a deal with 'immobiliare', the Vatican Bank. This deal will make the Corleones as respectable as the Rockefellers. As Michael tries to get this deal done, he faces new enemies who don't want him to run 'immobiliare'. The circumstances force Michael to adopt his old 'Mafia Warfare' tactics, although he does it hesitantly. THE GODFATHER III is just as complex and richly textured as the other two movies...even the film quality has that 'grainy' aspect that makes you think it was really filmed fight after last picture. Al Pacino's performance is more subdued in this one, but that's because his character is an Old Mafioso looking to redeem himself. The anger and fury of young Michael is present in Vincent (Andy Garcia). The ending is tragic and while it not may please everyone (it leaves many lose ends in the air)it's decent finale to what's possibly the most highly revered film trilogy in history.",9,1,4,2 November 2004
Mystic River," Entertaining Drama/Thriller...but NOT Oscar material (Minor Spoilers)
","MYSTIC RIVER deals with the lives of Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Jimmy (Sean Penn) as grown ups living in the gritty suburbs of the greater Boston metro area. The movie opens with Dave (Robbins) as a young kid, being abducted by what appears to be an officer. We later find out that this so-called officer is actually a pederast and abuses Dave, leaving him mentally scarred. The movie fast forwards to the present day, where we see these 3 characters living less than spectacular but normal lives. Jimmy owns a convenience store, Sean becomes a detective cop and Dave just a regular dad. We know Dave is a bit of a weirdo because of his abuse as a child, but apart from that, he looks and acts pretty normal, has a loving wife and kid. The story takes a dramatic turn when Jimmy's (Sean Penn) eldest daughter is brutally killed. MYSTIC RIVER now turns into a homicide investigation movie and prime suspect becomes Dave for reasons that you have to see. It is clear to the audience that, despite Dave's odd character, he is NOT the one who murdered Jimmy's daughter, yet, through out the rest of the movie, that belief is stained with Dave's more and more abnormal behavior.Although Sean Penn took the Oscar for best actor, to my belief, it was Tim Robbins show all the way. Penn did a much more dramatic and convincing role in 21 GRAMS than in this movie, although his acting is above average. Kevin Bacon also gives one of his best performances. It's an ensemble cast and it works well. MYSTIC RIVER is entertaining because it keeps you wondering through out the picture who did the murder and why. The ending is downbeat and un-Hollywood-esque, so it's not your standard fare drama with the happy ending, but by the same token, it leaves feeling you empty and wondering what was the moral of the story. This is a good movie, but I don't think it's Oscar material.8* out of 10*",8,0,0,29 July 2004
The Departed," Good film, but certainly NOT Scorsese's best...
","THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info. The guys who do the 'infiltration' are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around. Having this said, THE DEPARTED isn't a bad movie by any terms! But it is certainly not Scorsese's best.",7,3,4,31 March 2007
Man on Fire," Mexican Officials Should Be Killed
","I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A 'must own' for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10",10,219,281,25 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Decent Finale for the Greatest Space Saga of All Time!
","Having seen the movie twice and having waited for the dust to settle, I can now make my comments on REVENGE OF THE SITH. The 3rd part of this 'prequel' trilogy is definitely the best, not because it's darker or more violent, but because the story is plain and simple, superior to its predecessors. Having said this, I must also confess that (as some hardcore fans would come to expect)'REVENGE' is flawed and the way it resolves some of the plot holes shown in 'MENACE' and 'CLONES' is very lame. It's as if George Lucas said, 'Gee, I have to explain this and that, and I don't know how' and he just dribbled something out on paper and that was it. He resolves some plot inconsistencies with grandeur: How the emperor becomes THE emperor, why Anakin falls to the dark side, why the benevolent Republic becomes the evil Empire. But some of other plot inconsistencies, don't resolve in a satisfactory way. My major complaint for the whole 'prequel' trilogy was the age casting: I think all the actors were FAR too young. In the case of Anakin and Padme, their ages are somewhat fine (It's a bit perverse that she falls for a boy who is, apparently, 8 years her junior!). Aunt Beru and Uncle Owens look like poster boys in this trilogy and age dramatically by the time we see them again in 'A NEW HOPE' (Beru looks like she could be Luke's granny!). Obi-Wan also ages severely: Let's assume he was 35 at the time of 'Revenge'; he should be 55 at the time of 'A NEW HOPE', but looks like this overtly tired and old man that's close to 70 years old!!! This minor details have infuriated many a STAR WARS fan because it shows that LUCAS wasn't paying enough attention. in 'REVENGE' we never find out WHY Vader wears that 'special' outfit, why he breathes and talks the way he does. We are left to assume this things as given. We also never find out why Padme names her children Luke and Leia...was it a 'spur of the moment' thing??? It would have been cool to have Governor Tarkin in some dialog scene, or maybe a young Han Solo. There are so many things left in the air that you don't leave the theater fully satisfied. True, this is the culmination of the greatest space opera EVER and a decent culmination it was: Love, Romance, Action, Violence, Betrayal, Deceit, etc. But it is the way George Lucas rendered his final act that left me wishing for more.",8,1,6,5 June 2005
The Good Shepherd," An Editorial Mess
","There's no denying that Robert De Niro's THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an interesting movie; it deals with the birth of the CIA from the perspective of one of its founders. But what could have been a monumental spy/drama masterpiece ends up an editorial mess. Like one user said here, the casting of Matt Damon might've been OK had he had some 'old age' make up on the required scenes. We see the story through his eyes and senses and throughout the whole movie he doesn't appear older than 34 years old...even when he's supposed to look at least 12 years older. Angelina Jolie (who plays Damon's wife) ages a bit better but not dramatically (these people must've been vegetarians to look this good at an old age). Casting aside, its the story itself that doesn't hold up. You feel no attachment to ANY of the characters. Not that I must feel any sort of attachment to any character in any movie, but what I'm trying to say here is that I couldn't care less what happened to Damon's character, or Angelina's character or their son's character. Damon plays an emotionless public servant who goes on to become big in the CIA. He seems to forsake his family in the name of America. I wonder how many fathers would do that now a days. The story is too messy and unclear to give you an accurate description. It's nice to have movies that leave something to the audience's imagination, but this one goes a bit too far. Many things are left unexplained or discussed very briefly. Only the flashback scenes (Damon reminiscing of his younger years) do make some sense and in a way, could have been a terrific movie on their own.The acting and camera work is top notch and somewhere beneath this mess lies an interesting drama. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it!",6,1,2,8 August 2007
Prometheus," Fans were expecting more...
","Probably my most anticipated movie of the year was Ridley Scott's Alien prequel , 'Prometheus'. Being an Alien fan since basically day one, I was anxious to know the origins of the xenophorm. I later found out that Scott denied the fact that 'Prometheus' was a 'direct' prequel to the Alien saga, but he would base the story very close to that universe and would heavily reference his 1979 blockbuster. This statement left me a bit cold; in my book, it's either a prequel or not. It's like saying your girl is 'sort' of pregnant. Either she is or she is not. He could've made a whole new movie about the Alien's background instead. Anyway, 'Prometheus', in general, was a great movie to watch but it will leave die-hard Alien fans like myself with more questions than answers. The movie not only deals with the origins of the Xenophorm but with the origins of mankind itself: who made us who we are and why? A pretty neat way to put a new twist into the Alien saga, I thought. Noomi Rapace stars as Elizabeth Shaw, an archaeologist obsessed with the theory that us human beings were 'engineered' by an extraterrestrial race and for a reason. The ever present Weyland corporation manages to bankroll her and her team of scientists to travel to a planet where they think everything originated from. This planet is the infamous LV223, the same planet where Dallas and his crew met their fate on Alien (1979), although in this movie we see a planet very much like Earth, with an almost livable atmosphere, unlike the hostile environment we see in Alien (1979). When the spaceship arrives, they see what appears to be ancient buildings and huge runways for bigger spacecraft to land in. Assistant to the crew is David, this movie's equivalent to Ash, a human like android who acts mysteriously throughout the entire movie, possessing knowledge about this alien civilization unbeknown st to the rest of the crew (and the audience!). Needless to say, once the crew set foot on the planet, the mayhem is slowly unleashed. It is here where my big questions arise and discrepancies start to abound when compared to the first Alien film. One thing I truly despise about so called 'prequels' is their lack of 'reasonable continuity'. Let me explain: If the events in this movie happened BEFORE the first Alien film, then why the hell are we allowed to see a VASTLY superior technology in the hands of the crew? Sure, Special FX these days allow for a more glitzy showcase; floating touchscreens, intelligent portable devices, superior spaceships, etc. I mean, can you really watch a movie from a 1940's time period with supersonic jets, laptops and flat screens??? Although not as offensive as the STAR WARS prequels, I'm amazed Ridley Scott allowed this. Still, and unlike the STAR WARS prequels, shades of Alien's (1979) technology are present in this movie: the space ship corridors and set up do hold a strong resemblance and the cockpit and some of the navigation controls are practically identical to those seen in the first film. 'Prometheus' biggest revelation and probably fan's biggest surprise, was getting to see the origin of the ominous 'space jockey', the giant alien corpse that Dallas and crew find inside the alien spaceship in the first film. Although in the first film we are lead to believe that we are watching the skeletal remains of this big alien, in 'Prometheus' we find out that the 'skeleton' was an 'armour' and that a human like creature was inside. Again Ridley makes a sort of continuity mistake: in the first Alien film we can clearly see bone and flesh remains on the space jockey's chest, leaving little doubt that this was no space suit but an actual corpse that 'exploded' from the inside. Now in 'Prometheus' that 'corpse' turns out to be a space suit! In the final scenes of the movie, David (the android) 'thaws' out one of these space jockeys and starts talking his language. It is understood that David, as a computer/machine, has spent thousands of hours learning different human languages. Since these space jockeys are direct descendants of us humans, he figures that by making a mix of languages he can communicate with this alien. In a sudden turn of events, the space jockey goes mad and rips David's head off and starts attacking the rest of the expedition. It appears that the space jockey's spaceship was carrying a deadly cargo and was heading for earth before being thawed out. Why was he going to Earth is never fully explained, but Dr. Shaw and David assume that his mission was to destroy Earth. Oh, and the Xenophorm!There's something like a 'pre-Alien' alien in the film, but again, we are left to wonder where these 'pre-aliens' came from and why where they so important to the space jockey race. A movie that could've addressed these origins went by only leaving me with more questions. Ridley could've made the BEST Alien movie since probably 'ALIENS' (1986), giving audiences AND fans the treat of our lifetimes by truly doing a prequel, instead of this half baked attempt. True, I really enjoyed 'Prometheus' and I will probably watch it more and more as time goes by, trying to find those tiny details that I probably missed, but it's because I enjoyed it that I truly missed a better written prequel.",7,1,5,31 December 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," Over-hyped and Average... But Not As Bad As People Say It Is.
","Finally, I saw this movie last night. I've read so many dreadful reviews that I was prepared for the worst. For starters, I have not read the book so I'm oblivious to the source material, but since so many reviewers regard it as trash also, I really didn't bother reading it.Fifty Shades Of Grade had many problems when it hit theaters. Its main problem was the over-hype, and it goes both ways: people hating it, and people (ladies in particular) loving it, or at least, being less harsher with their appraisal of the movie.It all boils down to this: it's a dark, romantic drama. Had it been named something else, like 'The Rich Psycho' or 'Charming Sadomasochist' perhaps it would have fared better with reviewers, because I understand it was a big box office hit.It's the story of Anasthasia Steele, a student in her final year in College, living with a friend, Kate, and both studying something related to journalism and English literature. Kate has an appointment to interview Christian Grey, the local millionaire impresario, who also happens to be a young, handsome looking bachelor. When Kate can'y make it to the interview, she sends her roommate Anasthasia to do the job. Knowing very little about Mr. Grey, Anasthasia agrees to interview him, but has virtually no interviewing skills (she even forgets to bring a pen or pencil to write down things). When Anasthasia and Christian Grey meet something happens to both of them: they like each other. Ana, as she prefers to be called, is shy, good looking and in her very early twenties. Christian must be at least 8 to 10 years older (mid thirties probably), with an athletic built and a bit of an expressionless face (he rarely smiles. Ana is obviously smitten by Mr. Grey, as usually rich and powerful people don't always translate into handsome. But unlike other women, she seems genuinely interested in him, and not his wealth, and I think this point was pulled out rather well in the film. It's easy to write off Ana as a 'money hungry' woman, but the meeting of the two is well played out. Christian as well feels something odd about Ana: he obviously is also smitten by her, unlike all the women he's met or had before, and a guy of his wealth could have virtually anyone and anything. Ultimately the two admit that they like each other a lot, but there's one problem: Grey's past, which we learn in little bits throughout the film but we don't get to know the guy well enough, just like Ana. It seems Mr.Grey is fond of some sadomasochistic kinkiness and Ana is his new prey, but one she cares for a lot to be just 'another one'. Grey's character (portrayed by Jamie Dornan) was often criticized for being dull, but I think that's exactly what his portrayal wanted to be. We have a man who is haunted by a less than pleasant past and sees in Ana as a way to escape from that past, yet he finds it hard to let go of a lifestyle he has completely submerged in.Reviewers find it hard to believe a woman willing to be hit with whips, tied to a bed with ropes and such, yet women like these actually exist: in households with husbands that hit and mistreat them. A lot of them endure the pain because they have nowhere else to go but others, and they might be a minority, endure it because they truly love their partners in spite of them, and still have hopes that someday they might change. One of those believers in Ana, who herself becomes obsessed with Christian Grey as to why he won't have a 'normal' relationship. As to why he won't 'sleep' with her like a normal couple. As to why he has to make a contract for their relationship. Ana falls madly in love with Grey, and Grey is obviously madly in love with her, but he can't let go of that past that still haunts him. All the power and money he has achieved at his young age can't compensate for the turmoil in his head. He is in dire need of psychiatric help. So in real life, stuff like this DOES happen, and it goes both ways: women with hidden traumas and guys with unresolved childhood issues. It just happens that, for Hollywood's sake, the psycho here happens to be a well looking millionaire.There are bits and pieces here and there that might look illogical. When Ana found out Christian was into kinky, sadomasochistic stuff, why didn't she go away? Again, she fell deeply in love with this guy.The movie is definitely not the worst movie ever. All those reviewers really need to see some BAD movies. Was it an over-hyped movie? I'll hand that to you. Was it the best? Certainly not. Was it overtly sex filled? Basic Instict was far more explicit. Is it OK to watch it with your girlfriend or spouse on a rainy Friday afternoon? You bet!",7,2,4,31 December 2015
Black Panther," Please Wake Me UP After It's Over
","I'm still puzzled at the amazing Box Office success of 'Black Panther'. I was looking forward to watching this movie as soon as it came out on Blu-ray. Finally, last weekend me and my family watched it. The veredict? Very nice eye candy but I never felt ANYTHING for ANY of the characters on the screen. The only one who had some sort of 'life' was Andy Serkis character, but he was gone way too early. The plot is contrived at best, something 13 year old kids will definitely have trouble with. It was nice seeing Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead) in a prominent role, although she basically apes what she does in TWD.
Halfway through the movie I fell asleep, literally, just waking up some 20 odd minutes before the end.
Either I'm becoming too old (which is a fact) or movies of this nature are becoming a bore. I'd like to thing it's the second, cause I enjoy mostly sci-fi/fantasy/horror fare over any other genre. Plus, I still enjoy kids movies like 'Coco' or 'Ferdinand' very much. I think there's been an over saturation of things Marvel in recent years, even more so than Star Wars stuff. To top it all, comic wise, I don't recall ever hearing of a hero named 'Black Panther', unlike Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk or Spider-man.One thing's for sure. The FX are marvelous and so is the sound mix, so this is the perfect movie to show off your new home theater system. Other than that, stay clear off this one!",4,2,3,17 May 2018
Identity," Fast Moving and Entertaining
","I rented this last night and had no idea what was I getting. I knew most of the stars: John Cusak, Rebbeca Demornay (who I hadn't seen in movies for a while) and even Alfred Molina (who had a brief role in the 1st Indiana Jones movie). I actually thought I was going to dislike this movie because I had never heard anything about it. I guess that was my blessing, because IDENTITY was actually all the contrary: a fast moving, action packed and entertaining movie. You have to pay close attention to the beginning of IDENTITY, since an important premise is given and is later brought up to round up the film. On the surface, IDENTITY is about 10 people who meet in a run down motel in the middle of Nevada, on a heavy stormy night. They stay at the motel because of the heavy rain and because the roads are blocked. Among the people is an ex-cop turned limo driver (John Cusak), a has-been movie star (Rebecca Demornay), a recently retired prostitute (Amanda Peet), a Cop (Ray Liotta) driving a murderous convict (Jake Busey) to another Estate, a husband with a wounded wife and his,a young couple and the motel owner. These characters then start being murdered one by one with NO apparent reason or motive. This is where the real suspense begins. It's got enough gory murders to appeal to any bloodthirsty, fango crazy movie lover, but everything is done with the style of a big budget production.. All I can say is that what you are watching is not what it appears to be. I enjoyed IDENTITY a lot, especially John Cusak's performance (you see him in mostly comedy films) and proves that he can do the serious act very well. Good for a late night watching! 9* out of 10*!",9,0,1,23 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Ignore the IMDb Spammers - Star Wars is back... BIG TIME!
","Most longtime Star Wars fans were dismayed beyond words with the prequels, especially at 'The Phantom Menace'; the lackluster acting, contrived script, overuse of CGI and cheap comic relief might have been amusing to 10 year olds, but for the older Star Wars fans who were there since day one of the saga, we left the theater feeling disappointed to say the least. On the other hand, there are legions of kids who grew up with those prequels and expect new Star Wars movies to continue in that direction, and it's understandable to a certain extent. A new Star Wars film would have to be, for business' sake, a careful combination of both, the original and prequel trilogies.So, is 'The Force Awakens' the Star Wars movie we've been waiting for? I'd like to think it is. I'll summarize the key things I liked and the ones I didn't: Things I Liked: 1. The acting – The best acting in a Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back', hands down! 2. The new cast – Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver were great in their roles. 3. The use of practical effects – JJ Abrams used CGI wisely (it's all over the movie, but it mixes well with the practical effects to give an atmosphere closer to the original Star Wars. 4. The script – Despite a few details, it was a solid story. 5. John Williams – hearing the maestro once more was priceless! 6. BB-8 – The little droid is meant to substitute the adorable R2-D2. It brought fun into the movie without relying on Jar Jar Binks tactics of cheap comic relief. 7. Stormtroopers - In ALL previous Star Wars movies, these soldiers were just faceless minions that when they were shot, you couldn't care less. They were also as menacing as Jar Jar Binks and were terrible Tie Fighter pilots. This time around, the Stormtroopers we see are decidedly more accurate, more merciless and actually give out a fight.8. Harrison Ford - despite his public disdain of anything Star Wars, he gave out a stellar performance as Han Solo. Maybe the $20 million dollar paycheck helped to hone in his acting.Things I didn't like: 1. The Orchesra/The Music – I know John Williams is old, but not recording the soundtrack with the London Symphony Orchestra is as close to blasphemy as you can get. The opening theme (yes, that same opening theme) lacks the intensity of previous intros. Also lacking are the musical motifs, the ones that made Star Wars so famous. No substitute for 'The Imperial March', no theme for the first order, no themes at all. This is the only aspect that got royal treatment in the prequels, the score. 2. Déjà vu – The most ardent Star Wars detractors have this as their strongest argument: they feel like they're watching a reboot of 'A New Hope'. While not quite like that, there are some scenes that play virtually the same as in 'A New Hope', and I do mean virtually the same. With 'The Force Awakens', it will be the 3rd time we'll see rebels/the resistance go against a giant base capable of destroying planets, virtually emulating the ending fights of 'A New Hope' and 'The Return Of The Jedi'. There's the demise of a central character while others stand and watch from afar, bringing in to mind the death of Obi Wan Kenobi in 'A New Hope'. Having Larry Kasdan (The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders Of The Lost Ark) co writing this movie I would've expected a bit more thought thrown in to differentiate the endings of the other movies to this one. 3. The First Order - The first order is the new Empire. Wasn't the Empire destroyed in the battle of Endor? Who would want to form a new Empire? What is its purpose? What would they gain by reforming? Through some terrible exposition, we learned how the Empire came to be in the prequels. It'd be interesting to know the same about the first order and what's the point of destroying the ones you intend to rule over? Although this might be answered in the next two sequels, I felt like a bit more information should've been given about the first order. 4. Supreme Leader Snoke – Wasn't Palpatine, along with Darth Vader, the last of the Sith? If so, where did this Snoke guy come from? It's obvious the Star Wars universe needs an antagonist, but one that comes from a logical source. Now, there are theories roaming on the internet about where this Snoke guy comes from. Seeing him sitting in a room, projected like a hologram, ringed to close to other scenes in the original trilogy. Again, this could've been done a bit differently just to avoid self plagiarism.Fortunately, the good things I like outweigh by far the stuff I didn't like (more than 'didn't like', is the stuff I found incoherent or out of place). All in all, J.J. Abrams did a great job in Star Wars a much needed boost, and I think it's showing at the box office (as of today, it already passed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office, and it's only been out in theaters for a mere 12 days!). I am confident future sequels will uphold the level of quality and love J.J. Abrams and crew put into 'The Force Awakens'.",9,3,26,27 December 2015
The Purge," Kill Your Neighbors!!!
","It's been a while since I've seen a movie so implausible that I've immediately felt compelled to write a review about it. Such is the case with THE PURGE, a futuristic suspense/horror/thriller by director James DeMonaco. A few years from now, America's economy is on the rise, unemployment is at 1% (an all time low) and crime rate is virtually non existent, except for 12hrs once every year. These 12 hrs (from 7pm until 7 in the morning) are called 'the purge', the only time frame when all crime, violence and murder is legal without prosecution from the law. The new laws in America believe that, by giving people this time frame to release their pent up anger it will 'purge' them and help them become better citizens by 'behaving' the rest of the year accordingly to law. The premise is interesting and even some 'fascist' undertones are sprayed throughout the whole movie via TV news snippets. We hear reporters and newscasters debating that it is during 'the purge' that people can rid themselves of society's less unfortunate population: the homeless, the poor, the crippled, the terminally ill, etc, but as the movie shows, people can ALSO get rid off their yuppie neighbors and virtually anybody they hold up a grudge against. The movie deals with the tragedy the befell the Sandins, a well off family living in the rich suburbs of an undisclosed city. They live happily in a secluded area surrounded by security fences and wealthy neighbors. We know that James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a salesman for a home security company and that he has sold his security systems to virtually all of his neighbors, making his family among the wealthiest in the neighborhood. Everything seems rosy for the Sandins as they prepare to endure another 'purge' by barricading themselves from the rest of the world for 12 hrs while all hell breaks loose outside their house. At 7pm, the Sandins security system goes on, shutting all entrances and windows to the house with heavy steel plates. The family then plans to carry on as usual, even planning to watch a movie later on, but Charlie Sandin, the youngest of the Sandins siblings, sees something odd on one of the security screens and find out it's a black man running away from someone, begging for help and for his life. Feeling compelled to help the runaway, Charlie disarms the security system and lets the man take shelter in the Sandin's residence. As soon as the black man gets in the house, he hides away. It is here that the movie starts imploding with unreasonable acting. Instead of being 'mad' at his son, James Sanding treats him very, very calmly. Now, I didn't expect a father to hit his son but at least a good scolding. After all, little Charlie may have put the entire family at a life threatening risk. This night is, after all, THE purge, the night ANYONE can kill anyone. Anyway, we soon find out who the black man was running away from; a young group of wealthy twenty-somethings covered in scary Halloween masks (apparently from the same rich neighborhood as the Sandins). This group find out the black man is hiding at the Sandin's residence and demand he be turned in, or the group of 'purgers' will take him AND the Sandins by force and kill them. The action, gory violence and suspense pick up considerably after this but it's during this part when I began to ask myself hundreds of questions. Mary Sandin (Lena Headey), James' yuppie wife, can't believe the violence that has been unleashed in her house and questions his husband's suggested violent methods to save the family. Saving one's family should be a TOP of the TOPS priority is an extreme scenario like this so WHY is Mary so squeamish about the violence? I mean, as we know throughout the movie, this 'purge' thing has been going on for many years, it's not a new thing. Yet, Mary thinks it will never get to them or that the 'purge' only applies to a certain strata of society. Later in the movie we find out that the Sandins' neighbors are ALSO after them. Their reasons to kill off the Sandins are so ridiculous I almost turned my bluray player off. We're talking wealthy, educated neighbors being 'jealous' of the Sandins just because they have a 'prettier' house, built from all the sales of James Sandin's security systems. I mean, is that reason enough to kill a neighbor?!?! You have a newer car than me, so I'm gonna kill you?!?!? Now think of the 'purge' itself: if I had a family member killed by an acquaintance during the purge, I would certainly NOT wait a year to get my rocks off. By saying this I'm implying that the 'purge' only perpetuates the hate endlessly and one day it could certainly snap. The thinly disguised moral is that hate is a bad thing, as much as the casting of this film. We have a mother and father, all nice looking and blue eyed, and one of their kids cast as if he were adopted, because he certainly DOESN'T look ONE BIT like EITHER of the parents. He looks like some Mexican kid or something. There's a daughter in there too, but at least she looks cute.All in all, THE PURGE is mildly nice entertainment. Is not an 'edge of your seat thriller' and it's not as violent as some reviewers might want you to think it is. The implausibility of some of the situations is what REALLY put me off. Watch it and then go kill your neighbors!",5,0,0,2 February 2014
The Thin Red Line," Too contrived
","I must say that, although I liked 'The Thin Red Line' I found it contrived and sometimes confusing. It is a different kind of war movie, that I understand. If you're expecting big fight scenes a la 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Pearl Harbor' you're in for a big let down. It's NOT that type of film. It's more of a psychological film, where we deal with the fear and anguish of the soldiers rather than dealing with their mutilated corpses on the screen. Only time will tell if this film ages well. I remember seeing 'Apocalypse Now' when it came out and it also looked confusing and contrived; but now everyone regards that movie as a masterpiece. This is definitely not my favorite war movie, but then again, I wouldn't say is total junk either.",5,0,0,3 December 2001
Fantastic Four," Entertaining, if not outstanding
","FANTASTIC FOUR is a mildly entertaining version of the famous comics by Marvel. This movie deals basically with how the FANTASTIC FOUR became the super heroes they are, so a great deal of time is spent in the set up of the characters. We find out that Reed Richards is trying to convince old high school buddy turned big shot impresario Victor Von Doom about a space program. Reed's former flame, Susan Storm, now works with Von Doom AND is dating him. The setting up of Doom as the FANTASTIC FOUR's arch nemesis is a bit non convincing; there is nothing particularly menacing about him and his so called 'revenge' motives are (at least to me) stupidly unfounded. Needless to say, the space mission with Reed, Susan, Johnny Storm, Ben(Reed's partner)and Von Doom turns out very wrong and upon arrival to earth, everyone's genetic structure is changed. Johnny Storm, Susan's kid brother, is believable enough as the cocky 'human torch'. Ben is forever physically altered, Richards' becomes an elastic being and Susan can become invisible and create force fields at the cost of great physical stress. Victor Von Doom's alteration is somewhat confusing; we never really know what ARE his genetically altered powers. Von Doom holds an intense grudge against Richards for making the mission a failure, stealing his girl and for his financial crumbling but ever since the movie started it seems that Von Doom was only waiting for something like this to happen only to be truly mad at Reed Richards. The rest of the movie moves along at a nice pace but there's nothing gripping about it. SPIDER MAN 2 has way more drama and X-MEN looks even more 'adult' oriented than FANTASTIC FOUR. It seems the makers of this movie fought hard to make this a truly 'kiddy' movie. It's ironic to remember that both, the comics AND the TV Cartoons depicted more a more mature version of the FANTASTIC FOUR. In the TV series, Reed looked more like a early forties man... kind of like a George Clooney type of guy. The casting will make many a fan cringe, despite the fact that all actors did OK with their roles. No matter how beautiful Jessica Alba is, she is probably the last person I would cast as Susan Storm. Johnny Storm and 'the thing' were cast OK. Reed Richards could have been someone else and also Victor Von Doom, as they really don't look the part. Another thing that would have been nice to be included in this movie would be the TV series theme song. After all, SPIDERMAN included it some way into the film. The TV series intense, jazzy flavored theme song would have been very welcomed by yours truly. Only the frantic bass line of that original theme song was somehow spliced into this movie's original score. All in all, FANTASTIC FOUR was nice eye candy and nice movie to watch, but it's also a movie that begs for a superior sequel (a la SPIDERMAN or X-MEN)and better story.",7,1,3,5 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," I Agree with you all: Empire RULES!!!
","Having read most of the comments herein, I must agree that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best movie from the original Trilogy. The acting, effects, story and most noticeably, the music, surpass far and away the original (and that is saying a lot!!!). Though it's obvious 'Empire' would not be the classic it is were not for the first STAR WARS, it still manages to stand high on its own. As a music lover, I must say the the original 'Empire' Soundtrack has to be John Willimas BEST musical score EVER. The ominous 'Imperial March' (also known as Darth Vader's theme) was SO strong, that its motif has appeared in ALL subsequent films, including 'The Phantom Menace'. Same goes for the love theme of Han and Leia, Yoda's theme, and the list goes on. On the acting side, Harrison Ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all STAR WARS movies. His performance on 'Return of the Jedi' looked watered down compared to this one. Same goes for Carrie Fisher's performance. In 'Return' she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and 'Empire'. And Mark Hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. It's weird that 'Empire' worked so well, since most of director Irving Keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. He also did 'Robocop 2', but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes). 'Empire' is a movie that I saw when I was 12 years old, and to this date, it still amazes me. Let's hope that George Lucas comes to his senses and do the new trilogy justice with the upcoming 'Episode II'.",10,0,1,4 December 2001
Back to the Future," Perfect. Period!
","There really is very little I can add to an already PERFECT movie: perfect acting, perfect story, perfect effects, perfect music, etc. Many movies done TODAY wish they could be a FIFTH as good as this one. 'Back To The Future' still stands pretty damn good against current fare. That's a testament of how GOOD a movie this is. If Hollywood ever DARES to do a remake, they will know in advance they're heading for a total failure.Nuff said!!!",10,0,0,21 March 2020
