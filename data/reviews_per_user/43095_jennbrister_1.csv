The Blair Witch Project," Unrealistic and typical 'horror' at best...
","About halfway through the movie, not only was I sick from the camera work, but I was mad that I had paid to see such a terrible movie.  I can't believe that anyone would think that the movie was realistic...these kids in this movie were just as stupid as any of the stereotypical kids in today's 'horror' films.*Possible Spoilers*I kept wanting to scream at the screen, 'Just follow the river you stupid idiots!!!'  Seriously, were these supposed to be college kids?  ...Oh look, here's that river again....lets turn around and walk away from it and walk back into the scary woods to get chased by the evil spirits...I enjoyed the comments about the fact that it was the natural world being scary that made the movie so scary, and I agree that most people would be scared when confronted with being lost in the woods.  And maybe if it had actually been original and realistic it would have actually been scary. But this movie did nothing different than any other typical horror movie. Stupid kids can't keep it together to stay alive and get out of the woods. I was glad they were killed.  By the end I was cheering the evil spirits along and wishing they would hurry up and do their job.Bad acting, worse story.  It's not scary or original.  The only thing original about it was the shaky camera work, and it was definitely not a plus.  If I could give it a negative rating I would.",1,2,4,23 October 2000
