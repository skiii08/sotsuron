First Man," A chance to imagine....
","An unassuming intelligent guy braces life having endured unimaginable loss and, possibly somewhat frustrated with limitations imposed by well meaning peers takes a gamble at an opportunity to do something extraordinary.The character is well portrayed by the actor Ryan Gosling (full disclosure ...I do find his presence on the screen alluring) and anyone interested in space, science and human behaviour has the chance to observe the perspective of someone who never took anything for granted yet due to personal circumstance, sought to be a part of a unified goal to accomplish something that human kind had yet to achieve.I was surprised at just how well the director, writers, actors (not forgetting the behind the scene team of workers who partook to help create this film) purveyed a well scripted thought provoking portrayal of last centuries' monumental achievement; showing a better side to humanity and, done so eloquently, through the eyes of a buzz light year....sorry.....seriously.... joking there....buzz aldrin .....Freudian slip?...nope... just early onset of Alzheimer's...now where was I? ....oh yeah, rambling....personally, take a gamble (of course pun intended) and watch this immersive film....fly me to the moon...",9,1,1,23 March 2020
