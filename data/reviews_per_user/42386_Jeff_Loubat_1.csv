It," It could have been far better
","'It' is far less scary than the first original movie. Tim Curry putted his character on another dimension by playing more psychological. Moreover, the abondance of hemoglobine scenes acted a little bit as a turned down.They wanted this movie closer of the Stephen King's book atmosphere but it happened to be all the contrary that occured.However, I liked the prestation of the 'new clown' who could have been epic with a better scenario.",6,0,0,23 January 2018
