Black Swan," Yes, See It!
","One way you know this is a good movie is because of all the politically correct crap that's being thrown at it under cover of 'stereotypes,' 'cliches,' and various kinds of insensitivity. Please. It's a movie--and an excellent movie at that. Superior performances by Natalie Portman, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder. Solid performances by Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel. A compelling portrait of artists that says, I think, that art is less a matter of transcendence (that's for audiences) than transformation. I urge everyone to see it and judge for themselves. It's a winner.",9,5,10,24 December 2010
Knives Out," Saved by Actors
","At times amusing, rarely suspenseful, really a paint-by-numbers whodunit hiding a lecture on decadence and immigrants.Medical practices at center of the crime(s) have little to do with reality -- same for the so-called cops. The bits about the blood drop and the recording -- just lazy.Family characters needed to be deliciously malicious but instead seem pretty grubby, seem pretty much labels for lecture examples. Their collective helplessness and incompetence may create sympathy for the hero (sort of a plaster saint that vomits) but it doesn't make for satisfying drama.What saves the film? Proper mystery sets, some fair game criticism of elitism and xenophobia, and efforts by very capable actors working with a script that wants to be 'knives out' but is more like...well, there's a prop at one point in the film...See it? Sure. Enjoy the veteran and young actors, but this movie could have been so much more enjoyable if the characters had been written to be worthy of the title.",7,1,2,30 December 2019
Green Book," Award Worthy
","High praise for the performers (side note: Viggo Mortensen, a superior actor, may be endangering his health in cutting or putting on weight in various roles) and the director. To people who don't like 'Green Book': it's a movie, and a story can be entertaining and meaningful without being a lecture. Two quick points: a. I'd vote for Mahershala Ali to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- superior work in developing a complicated character -- gifted, eccentric, idealistic, ambivalent -- and for ultimately being successful in creating pathos and admiration for the character in the audience. b. To highlight one of many excellent scenes (you'll know when you see the film): one of the best ways to fight racism is for the decent person in the room to have the guts not to deliver a sermon but to just tell the fool in the room to knock it off and to damn well watch-your-rear mean it.",9,1,2,22 February 2019
