Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For those of you who didn't like this movie need to go crawl under the rock they came from
","Here's the thing, I've waited 16 years for the time that I would get to see this movie. The expectations I had were that it would look, feel, sound, and even smell like a Star Wars film, but more so I wanted a fun adventure and a visually stunning movie. The movie met those expectations and then some. I don't know what those people that were upset by the movie were expecting. It was the most visually amazing movie ever. The detail of the cgi-generated effects blew my mind. And the fact that a lot of the characters in the movie are completely made from a computer also amazed me. Sure I understand that Jar Jar was slightly annoying, but by the end of the movie I sorta liked him. Yeah the dialogue was a little iffy, but did any of you see a movie by the name of Titanic? Talk about crappy dialogue. Sure, there wasn't much character development, but see what happens when you try to do that in a Sci-Fi movie. They don't mix. The only thing that sucks is that I have to wait another three years until Episode 2.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Being John Malkovich," Being on top of it!!!
","First things first, Lets all applaud Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman for creating such an incredible and original piece of film. Second, lets give props to all the actors, especially Cameron Diaz, for showing diversity with roles none of them have ever done before, (even Malkovich gives a superb performance as...well...himself). It's so refreshing to see a completely new and original film. The movie is full of non stop laughs. Laughs that are not over the top to the point of stupidity, all though there are times where it is appropriate, but laughs that are still laugh out loud funny. I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a real good Terry Gilliam film. 'Cause even the far-fetched seemed believable in this movie. This movie is definitely gonna make an impact on films to come and hopefully it's a good sign of where Hollywood is heading.",10,0,0,20 October 1999
