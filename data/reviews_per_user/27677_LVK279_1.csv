It," BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!
","If I could give this movie more than 10 stars, I would. I love this movie to death. I honestly watch it every single night (no joke) and I'll never get sick of it. It's incredible to me how much you feel for the characters and how fast you fall in love with them in just two hours. I've watched a lot of movies and never felt so connected to the characters as much as I did with the film. Even though it's a horror movie, the movie focuses on friendship and teaches the audience that when you stick together, you can overcome any evil.This movie is not like your average horror movie where there are pointless jump scares every 5 minutes that take away from the plot. In most horror movies, there is a monster and towards the end, the characters defeat it and that's that. There isn't anything you take away after watching those movies and there isn't really any theme or point to it other than the fact that you were scared. This film however, is different. IT has a story behind it and Andy Muschietti (the director) portrays that beautifully. It's about the loss of innocence and childhood and the harsh reality of growing older. It's a story of love and the power of friendship. The kids are stronger when they are united. The kids were all together while fighting Pennywise and that's why they survived. The film has heart and that's something that you don't see a lot in horror movies especially nowadays. The Loser's Club have a bond unlike any other. The relationship between the kids does not feel forced like a lot of movies and you can tell they're best friends off screen too.Many horror movies I've watched take place in a house and that gets kind of boring to see. A lot of horror movies don't pay much attention to landscapes, visuals and don't give enough attention to location & the cities where they were filmed. This isn't the case in this movie. You can really see how beautiful the cinematography and visuals are (the quarry, the barrens, etc).If someone doesn't like this film, they say it is because it wasn't scary enough. If the film were scarier and had more jump scares, it would've lost a lot of its heart and wouldn't have connected with audiences as much. I think the film does a perfect job at being scary and it even made me laugh a lot which made it even better. It had a great balance to it. The humor was genuinely funny and didn't feel forced. It also very accurately portrayed how a group of friends act with one another in real life.I remember crying in the theater when Bill sees Georgie's rain coat and finally accepts the fact that he lost his little brother. His friends come together to hug and comfort him. That was so beautiful. When Stan is being attacked by Pennywise in the shape of the woman from the painting, the kids rescue him, and he says 'you left me alone, you're not my friends.' All the kids start crying and those were real tears as said in the director's commentary. The kids love and care for each other and they are a lot weaker when they are left all alone. That made the movie so much more meaningful for me.I cant even begin to express how amazing the cast was. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd does a phenomenal job as Pennywise. Many people complained that he wasn't acting scary enough and acting childish. What people don't understand is that he has to have that childlike quality. That childlike quality is what he uses to lure the kids in. Pennywise has become my favorite movie character and they couldn't have found a more perfect person to play him. The Loser's Club all gave excellent performances and you could tell they really formed a bond on screen and off.The attention to detail and the little easter eggs throughout the film is truly remarkable. Throughout the movie, there are little hints that Pennywise is always watching the kids. When Ben is flipping through the book on the history of Derry, you can see Pennywsie in the back left in one of the pictures. When the boys are helping Ben with his wounds, you can see a drawing of Pennywise on the wall towards the end of that scene.This movie is truly incredible!",10,0,2,15 May 2019
