Marie Antoinette," It's not a history lesson!
","Ahhhh! If I hear one more person criticize this film for lack of historical correctness, I shall scream at the top of my lungs! This film is not meant to be a historical narrative. As Jason Swartzman prays early on, 'God help us because we are too young to reign.' That's the whole point of the movie. Two young kids playing king and queen. They try to find escape through decadence, but this ends up being not only their demise, but that of the monarchy's. It's a beautiful film that is being torn apart by nit-pickers trying to write a history text book. Embrace the sheer cinematic beauty and accept its theme about growing up and accepting responsibility for one's actions.",8,2,5,5 November 2006
