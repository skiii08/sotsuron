The Young Victoria," A beautiful love story!
","I personally am a huge fan of costume dramas as I think they allow you to get completely lost in a different time. This is one of the best that I have seen. It tells the story of a young Queen Victoria when she first ascends to the thrown and falls in love with Prince Albert.Emily Blunt play the lead and does a fantastic job. Victoria is portrayed as feisty, passionate and strong willed, this is a far cry from the image of Victoria in her later years when she is a little fat old lady who is constantly in mourning and has a white hankie on her head. There is a definite change to Victoria after she is crowned as she gains power so now longer must she be bullied by Sir John (played by Mark Strong) or treated like a china doll by her fussy Mother (Played by Miranda Richardson). What I found quite shocking is that she still had her sanity after she had been forced to share a room with her Mother and be walked up and down the stairs while holding someones hand. Also Victoria was very normal I found as she fit in with all the snooty royals that were around her. During a banquet she befriends Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), I found his character quite odd as I was never sure what his motives were as a point he was taking advantage of her and then other he was generally concerned for her. Prince Albert was played by the lovely Rupert Friend who showed exactly why Victoria and himself where meant to be together. My favourite scene is the marriage proposal where she asks him to marry her, it had me tearing up! There is also a fiery argument between the two which shows that it was a real relationship but a love that is so strong that it had a lifelong impact on both parties. At the end of the film there is an event that causes Victoria to push their desks together and work as one. All in all a fantastic film that I really enjoyed and did get a bit hysterical, with a beautiful song by Sinead O' Connor in the credits to put the cherry on the top!",8,5,12,5 April 2009
Twilight," Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They fall in love, but he wants to eat her. Sheer brilliance!!
","This has to be one the most eagerly anticipated films of 2008 with millions of fans across the world who love the books. I am one of them. I went to see this on the 19th December with my two best mates and even though we were an hour early there was already a huge line girls sitting outside the cinema doors waiting for them to open. When they did, the guy opening them was squashed into the wall and looked quite frightened as the wild stampede ran past. So this film better not disappoint and it didn't. why was this film so good, well where to start? The two leads who played Edward and Bella (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson) where fantastic and their strong on screen chemistry was sizzling all the way through. Before the film came out there was a lot of disagreement about the choice of Pattinson as Edward Cullen as he had previously played Cedric Diggory, but to me it was the next logical step. He got his character perfect. Edward is a very complicated character as he hates himself for what he is (a vampire) but he loves Bella for reasons he can't explain or control, this leads to more self loathing as he keeps wanting to eat her. He is so complex and interesting to watch because although he has a menacing side he is also charming, drop dead gorgeous, kind, brave, funny and passionate about everything that is dear to him. Robert Pattinson portrays all of this an is exactly how I imagined him to be when I was reading the book. Many fans (myself included) have fallen in love with this character so congrats to Rob for getting it right. Bella is played by Kristen Stewart was a mirror of the book as she often talks in monotone and is constantly doubting herself. Stewart's performance was particularly good in the final scenes such as the fight scene and the hospital scene which follows. this is because Bella lets her guard down a little bit as she finally realises she can't live without Edward. Other characters such as the Cullen family were also very true to the book. Rosalie, (played by Niki Reed), showed her true dislike of Bella and general bitchiness, Alice (Ashley Greene) was quirky and pixie like, Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) was actually amusing to watch with his facial expressions where he always looks scared of something and Emmett (Kellan Lutz) even though didn't have may lines was great in the baseball scene. Peter Fancielli and Elizabeth Reaser did a good job as the 'parent' vampires, Dr Carlisle Cullen and Esme Cullen. Cam Gigandet was fantastic as the villain James who wants to kill Bella as part of some sick game he has came up with in his head. It really makes you feel good when Edward wins the fight between them and makes you realise what dangers Bella is prepared to face by being with Edward. The music in this film is accurately suited to it's genera, particularly Supermassive black hole by Muse in the baseball scene, but can be a bit overpowering bordering on cheesy. However this is few and far between. The only other criticisms I can make are that it does stray from the book partially as the blood typing chapter was missed out which disappointed me a little. Overall a fantastic vampire romance and I can't wait for the sequel next year!",9,1,5,30 December 2008
Pride & Prejudice," An alright movie!
","This movie was very heavily weighted because it had to live up to the very successful TV series made in 1995. However I think Keira Knightly was the an alright choice for the role because she but it over well but had a hard job to follow the TV show.This movie was a. There was some humour in this movie which made it more light hearted and warming.Brenda Blethyn who played Mrs Bennet was very good, as well as Donald Sotherland who played Mr Bennet. Mattew Mcfaden who played Mr Darcey was very dashing as Mr Darcey should be, and played the part really well.The scenery was very realistic and the camera work was excellent. Even though Iliked it I can't see it being as popular as Harry Potter which was out at the time because it appeals to a restricted audience and it's an love or hate movie. I have watched this movie a few times over and I like it more than when I saw it in the cinema. A down side would be that the movie wasn't as planned out as the original but it was a film and they couldn't have it this long as well as keep the viewer entertained for so they had to cut it short. Overall a good movie.",6,0,2,4 December 2005
The Da Vinci Code," A fantastic film!
","If your a lover of the book or not this film is fantastic. I went to see it with my friends not having read the book but really enjoyed it. So I am now wanting to read this book. The scenery was great, when they were going through Paris it really pulled me into it. This thriller really gets your heart rising and your on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next, with car chases and bloody violence at some parts it keeps you gripped.The acting was excellent as well, Tom Hanks the leading role really shone in this movie as he excelled at the role of a clever professor. Audery Tautou a women I happened seen acting before was amazing at her role and her and Tom Hanks's on screen chemistry also made the film enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed watching Ian Mckellen, as I think he is a great actor to begin with. Also he shows off his talent as the role of Lee Teabing. The only character I didn't enjoy watching was Stalis played by Paul Bettany, not because he is a bad actor, in fact he's an excellent actor, the reason was I was scared of him. His character was really creepy! Overall I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it, as it also had me questioning what would happen if Dan Brown was on to something and it was true. Would it show that women were equal to men, or that Jesus was a normal man? Many other questions I could ask. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I have and i definitely want to see it again.",8,0,1,24 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Fantastic Fantasy!!!
",This movie is a must see film!! It is very exciting and humorous as well as frightening in some parts. The special effects are amazing and very realistic. Daniel Radcliff is great in this movie he shows deep emotion and determination in his role as Harry Potter. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 10 as there are some scary scenes that would give younger children night mares. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time as it was a very gripping movie. However the movie is a quick and not as spread out as the book. Even though it is 2 and a half hours long. That is the only fault in this brilliant movie I would go and see this movie time and time again! One of the best movies of 2005!!!,10,0,1,4 December 2005
