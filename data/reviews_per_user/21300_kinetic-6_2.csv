Walk the Line," good, not great film
","At first Walk the Line felt like a great film. After thinking about it a little more, I started to feel that it a very good film flirting with, but not touching greatness. The story was a little too simplified for its source, both in spirit and and formation. I thought the way Cash's demons were simplified in the film didn't do it complete justice. Also, the more I thought about the script, the more I felt that other than Cash the characters were lacking the depth required to be a great film. I really liked the directing. Mangold is an impressive director with more range than I realized. He now has at least three distinctively unique films on his resume with Ring of Fire, Kate & Leopold, and Identity. I would definitely watch near anything he directed sight unseen. The acting was very impressive also. Phoenix is showing that (pardon the pun) he has the skills to spread his wings and fill a diversity of roles. Witherspoon made an underwritten role have more depth and power than it probably should have. The rest of the cast was talentedly engaging and provided the Phoenix the environment to shine. Ultimately, I thought the biggest flaw was the script. It seemed to turn the story of Johnny Cash into a little too much of an one character story. June Carter seemed like there should have been more depth to develop her, and in some ways Vivian Cash seemed to not be present enough in the whole storyline. Overall, it is an impressive film. I don't it entirely succeeded in its goals of show us who the man in black really was. 7/10",7,0,1,8 February 2006
Corpse Bride," missed it by that much
","The Corpse Bride, Tim Burton's second venture to share the magic of stop motion animation to a new generation, is a film I wanted to love. I really wanted to love it. But unlike Victor's piano playing in the movie, it seemed to be a note or two off. Technically the film was superior than his first venture, The Nightmare Before Christmas. In all honesty, the script and music were as good if not better than Nightmare also. But it seemed to lack that emotional tug and enthusiasm that Nightmare has. But before I go further, I leave the disclaimer that Nightmare is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The Corpse Bride may suffer another flaw with me that is unfair to it- deferred love and praise from a cult classic. Just like that actor or actress who receives an Oscar nomination for a lesser role because last years phenomenal performance was overlooked, The Corpse Bride might have acquired a little extra unearned hype from Burton's first venture that went initially unnoticed by the mass audience. I think that if you were to have seen this film before Nightmare, it would definitely impress. And it did even to me. I watched the whole film and enjoyed myself. The scene where Bonejangles leads his skeleton band is fun to watch. The end actually maintained a solid level of suspense and closed the story on a great note. But ultimately the simple characters, arguably no more complex than in Nightmare, never really stuck to memory for me. And as enjoyable as the cinematic ride was, I guess I would prefer to ride down the cult cinema of Nightmare, not The Corpse Bride, any time.",6,1,5,24 November 2005
