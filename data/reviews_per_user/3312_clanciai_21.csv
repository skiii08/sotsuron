Requiem for a Dream," A mother and her son both getting addicted to their dreams in different ways.
","Ellen Burstyn (84 today) was nominated for an Oscar in this shocking social drama of how dreams can take control of you by your own addictive delusions. Jared Leto plays her son and Jennifer Connelly his girlfriend with equal brilliance in this impressively well made film of stunning expressionism enhancing the impact of the brutal realism. The music adds to it, but it's the visualization of the drama, the dreams, the illusions and the hopelessness of the incompatibility of reality with your dreams that creates the lasting impression, finally suggesting that in spite of all the dreams will always get the better of you as after all a better reality than reality. A shockingly thought-provoking film with stunning performances. Ellen Burstyn is always good, this is no more than a typical performance of hers, but none could have made it better or more convincingly true.",9,1,3,7 December 2016
The Death of Stalin," Stalin's dirty old men in deadly party quarrel after his death
","If this is supposed to be a comedy it isn't funny. I can well understand those who couldn't stand it more than 11 minutes. It's a bitter caricature all the way of the arguments of power, the humour is darker than black and not humourous at all, and all laughters are strained to grotesqueness in morbid hypocrisy, but that is probably how it was. It all makes a very realistic impression and couldn't perhaps be staged more realistically without the satirical caricature touch. The main factor that turns them all into ridiculous parodies is that they all speak cockney, all except the pianist, who makes the deepest impression of all and who introduces the morbid farce, the one serious person in the context.Although they all constantly speak in a foul loud-mouthed way without listening to each other and almost merely making a lot of noise and fuss, it is very well acted, and what saves the film is the fine choice of music. Music introduces the spectacle and also gives it a worthy exist. It's brilliant entertainment all the way, although all laughs get stuck in the throat. Michael Palin from Monty Python is the best and most convincing actor, and the actor who plays Krushchev has a startling resemblance to Putin. Perhaps it was intentional? I heard the film was forbidden in Russia, and a cinema owner who showed it anyway was prosecuted for it. Putin has tried to exonerate Satlin, so this political portrait of an active establishment in a superpower 65 years ago could be scaringly up to date.",8,0,2,2 March 2018
Darkest Hour," You have never seen Winston Churchill like this before.
","There have been many Winston Churchills on screen and television, and although none of them have been completely convincing, they all managed to get as close as possible, which, although far from the goal, anyway generally were good tries. I wouldn't say that Gary Oldman is the best so far, but he is at least on level with Albert Finney, while Kristin Scott Thomas definitely is the most beautiful Clementine of them all. I always admired her deeply, she adorns every film she partakes in, she is intelligent and beautiful, which is an invincible combination - she just has to appear, and she turns any dreadful story to something deeply interesting. Her perhaps least successful appearance was in 'The English Patient' as the romantic lead - she is only superior as a leading supporter.As for the rest, Roland Pickup makes a very convincing and almost heart-breakingly melancholy Chamberlain, all too clearly singing on his last verse, who is the only tragic figure of this movie. The others are all quite all right.The music by Dario Marianelli was a positive surprise, it's very well manufactured, even pointing out and underscoring some comical moments, while the main character of the film is documentary - the effort has been to catch the strain of that terrible first month of Prime Minister Churchill's, which ambition definitely is achieved. It couldn't have been made better.So without flinching I join all the other 10-voters and hope to see the film again.",10,2,9,15 January 2018
The Danish Girl," Anatomy of transgenderism at its first venturesome and failed efforts - Was it worth it?
","First of all, it's a beautiful picture all the way with amazing wonder of pictorial qualified aestheticism which is sustained throughout, masking the very debatable and to some disgusting plot in merciful and seducing perfume. Especially the music by Alexandre Desplat works miracles about this - he always seems to do that and has elevated the quality of many films that way, especially art films. This is above all an art film and should not be ignored as such. After six years of marriage an artist finds himself in a typical artist's crisis and finds a peculiar way out of it - by transcending into a woman. Eddie Redmayne does not make a bad job of it but actually makes a more impressing performance than the Oscar-winner in what must be recognized as one of the most difficult and sensitive performances imaginable. It's actually difficult to think that anyone would willingly venture into such a minefield.And does the transgender operation solve his problem? Of course not, and that's the disappointing conclusion of the film. Anyone should have known that from the start, and especially the artist. I have met many transgender people in my days, and not one was convincing - the old sex shone garishly through in every case. I am not saying that it must fail, but violating nature is never a good idea.Nevertheless, it remains a very beautiful film, for the music and the scenery and couldn't have been made better. Enhjoy it for its beauty, and pardon the tragedy for its foolishness, – but, as so often in films, without that there would have been no story to be told.",9,0,1,4 March 2016
The Irishman," Three and a half hours of squalid wallowing in the lowest forms of human nature
","Sorry, but I cannot share the common enthusiasm for this monster of a film - well made, indeed, splendid camera work, good acting, but like the earlier 'The Departed' hopelessly base in its persistence on discussing and dwelling on only brutality in vulgar bamkruptcy of everything except the lowest forms of human nature, that is relying on violence for the cultivation of brutal egoism only. As one observer reckoned: 'Realistic and rather infrequent violence. There are some scenes of killing but not that many. 136 uses of 'f**k', 20 uses of 'cocks****r', 40 uses of 'sh--', and other expletives, smoking and drinking throughout.' There is no other meaning or point with the film. It is unbearably tedious and boring in its consistently slow motion, there are only dirty pathetic old men who murder each other throughout the film, Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is just overacting all the way, and finally there is a catholic priest absolving Robert de Niro for all his premeditated brutal murders, and there is an alarming lack of any sense of humour - a desert of meaningless human viciousness, the only oasis being his daughter Anna Paquin who finally refuses to have anything more to do with him, the professional cold-blooded murderer, who kills just for being told and paid to do so. Sorry, not my cup of tea.",6,2,4,30 December 2019
The Best Years of Our Lives," How war veterans never get rid of their wars but have to live with them anyway.
","The main triumph of this film which makes it quite exceptional and unique of its kind is the performance of Harold Russell as Homer Parrish, who has lost both his hands in the war, which invalidity he shares with Harold Russell. It's a story and film about war veterans and without doubt the best of its kind for its humanity and extremely sustained restraint all the way in the exposure of very sensitive and personal affairs and feelings of the most delicate kind. All the actors are outstanding in their characterizations, Fredric March as the sergeant and former banker who can't quite control himself or his bottle, Harold Russell in the performance of his life, (the pajama scene must melt all hearts,) the only time ever an actor received two Oscars for the same part and well deserved, Dana Andrews as the noble war hero who is humiliated by his wife (Virginia Mayo perfectly abominable) but has the very good luck of finding the irresistible Teresa Wright instead and at her most charming, who is so much the better, and Myrna Loy finally as the sage and stable mother. The music is perfectly fit to illustrate the moods and the tensions, with Hoagy Carmichael crowning it, while the mastership of the direction of William Wyler in his slow and careful but very well thought out and intentional direction to bring out all the best and the truth of the story from his actors probably takes the prize. The film has a number of unforgettable scenes of singular eloquence, but I think my favorite would be Dana Andrews' revisit of his old pilot job in the junkyard, one of William Wyler's most impressive scenes, and there is an important forewarning of it in the beginning. This is a veteran film for all times which is inexhaustible in its humanity and which all people of all generations have something to learn from to improve themselves with. Finally I have never seen so many reviews for a film here, but a film like this just can't have a review too many.",9,3,3,19 March 2015
Battleship Potemkin," Mutiny on a Russian battleship 1905 with consequences both tragic and heroic
","Of course it is still impressing after almost a hundred years, for its amazing sense of details, its tremendously dramatic impact, its highly strung pathos and its wonderful cinematography all through, but still there is room for some objections. It can't be helped, but it is tendentious, it glories in Soviet nationalism with the individual being effaced in the movement of the masses, it even says so in the text, and it is somewhat hysterical in its constant muddle of crowds amassing and running together in fanatic frenzy, which reminds me of the fanatic Christians massing together to massacre the poor Hypatia in the Agora film. It's a film about crowds for the masses, where individualism is completely run over and abolished, which it can't be for human reasons. It's a great film but with tendencies that must bring misgivings, as a prelude to the age of totalitarianism under Stalin and others.",9,0,1,17 May 2019
American Sniper," Inside view of a sniper's life.
","This film has been fiercely criticized for glorifying war and violence, for giving a one-sided view of the Iraqi war in favor of America and for ignoring the issue at large. Well, Clint Eastwood's ambition was not to make any moral or political assessment but simply to tell the story of this sniper's life. The topic is extremely controversial, since a sniper's business is generally judged to be the least honorable and most cowardly way of making war - you kill people by hiding from them. Nevertheless, Clint Eastwood succeeds in defending his sniper. For the first time you are convinced that he has to do what he is doing, he simply has no choice, it has to be done, and there are two crucial instances when he is faced with the very difficult issue of having to fire at children. The first one is in the beginning of the film, there is the child's mother also, and he kills them both - there is nothing else to do. In the second issue he actually prays that the boy will not pick up the rocket that has been left by the soldier he just shot down. The child picks up the rocket and starts moving as if to use it, the sniper hesitates, this is perhaps the most poignant moment in the whole film - and I will not reveal what happens. In the end he returns to ordinary civil life, and the story reaches a sudden and quite unexpected end, which must reconcile anyone to this whole sordid business. It's true, he killed 160 people in the most cowardly possible way, but you have to excuse him. Someone had to do it, and he only did what he had to do. End of story. Clint Eastwood refrains from any further comment, and so should we.",8,7,18,29 January 2015
The Last Legion," The last Roman emperor, a young boy, finds his way to Britain with some help of Merlin, an Indian princess and Excalibur.
","Most people behind this film are Italians, and you can tell that from the design: theatrical almost operatic story, colorful staging, great imagination, playful development of characters and story, florid fabulation and great joy of epic story-telling - most of the production names are De Laurentiis. All this makes up for not a bad movie at all. In fact, the story is not incredible, although utterly untruthful, and both Ben Kingsley and Colin Firth make credible characters and performances enough. Focus is though on the boy, who is the only thoroughly splendid character, both as an invention, the type and his development and acting. What actually happened is unknown, but both Odovakar and Romulus are historical figures. In the film the events of Romulus' abdication occur in 460 after having been emperor for no more than a year, while it actually happened in 476 but is historically correct. No one knows what happened to Romulus, however - his fate is lost in history, and his young character and mystery is like made for legends. Odovakar did not remain king of Rome very long, being soon overthrown by Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths. Vortigern, the awful villain of the film, did exist but remains a rather doubtful character - in the film he is grossly exaggerated to fit the role of a supreme villain, a tyrant of great paranoia and cruelty, while some sources name him the discoverer of Merlin. A great epic adventure film made on a great epic story, in brief, a worthwhile entertainment with the positive consequence that it must raise your interest in the darkest medieval history.",9,3,5,2 October 2015
The Thing," An unidentifiable thing making a mess of things
","There must be certain objections to this classic Science Fiction film, by many considered John Carpenter's masterpiece and best film at least, and of course it is extremely well done with a virtuoso program of special effects, making the results of the activity of 'The Thing' as horribly revolting as possible - you really aren't prepared for it when the first appearance of 'The Thing' turns up doing something terrible to the poor innocent dog. The first time I happened to this film I could not see it any further than this, the second time I gave it a chance but still couldn't see it all, but now the third time at least I was prepared and could watch it calmly to the end. Everything is technically perfect, and the direction and music by Morricone couldn't be better, but the flaws are all in the script. After all, these researchers in the Antarctic are all scientists and should act accordingly and not constantly lose their self control. When doctor Blair loses control it's the starting point for the whole adventure to run off the rails, and then it constantly gets worse. They resort to violence, which is the last thing a scientist should do, he is educated to have no capacity for that, and then the film goes constantly from bad to worse and becomes nothing else than a monument to paranoia. Of course, these poor fellows without a woman or even any picture of such a healthy creature are all fenced in by the Antarctic winter in hopeless isolation in the dark of winter, so naturally they could develop psychic problems, especially in the encounter with such a thing as 'The Thing', but they should at least TRY to keep cool and maintain some scientific self control. They all fail in this, and the signal for everyone's going off the rails occurs perhaps already in the beginning, when Kurt Russell accuses his computer, with which he plays chess, of cheating and pours whiskey into him. That's perhaps the starting point of the following accumulating monumental mess.",9,0,0,3 May 2020
The Revenant," 2½ hours of self torture - for what?
","There is nothing wrong with the film. The acting is perfectly natural all the way, so natural, that you can't understand what almost anyone is saying for their mumbling in their shaggy beards, especially the main crook (Tom Hardy), who isn't credible in his unmotivated evil, and of course everything goes constantly wrong. They do everything they shouldn't, go wandering alone in a dark forest when there are bears around and you can even hear their cubs - these bear hunters couldn't be unaware that there must be a worried bear mother near by when she smells a human hunter close to her cubs. Of course, the bear attack triggers the drama, without which there would be none; but the greatest folly is in the end, when the two good men go a-hunting for a desperate murderer in the wilderness and they split up. How could they be so dumb? Sorry, it's a weak story with no psychology mainly made up for its effects, and of course, these are marvellous, the main prize going to the fantastic photography of the wilderness in the awesome landscape scenes, and here you could actually speak of poetry, but that's about all. They say it was all shot without any artificial light, which of course adds to the intriguing atmosphere of the nocturnal scenes, and the whole enterprise of shooting such a film under sinister conditions in the wilderness deserves much credit. At best some of the wilderness scenes succeed in creating some 'Call of the Wild'-ecstasy, especially the most spectacular of them all with the buffaloes. But the story is such, that you feel rather inclined to take sides with the Indians and the bears than with these villains causing nothing but mischief in the wilderness and even failing with that, while the original Richard Harris-John Huston film from 1971, which I haven't seen yet, could be expected to be better.You could blame the flaws of the story, which appears to be founded on fact way up in the Dakota wilderness in the 1820s among Sioux and Pawnees, on the necessity of the truthfulness of naturalism, people could actually be this beastly, and if they are beastly they are usually dumb as well, so let's make allowances for that - realism in absurdum, which though only makes you take the stronger sides with the Indians and the bears. One final question mark - even an Indian would in the end feel motivated to do something for the trapper that after all saved the life of his daughter, which she couldn't be unaware of, when she exits with her father with no more than a look.",7,4,14,28 December 2015
Cross of Iron," The ordeals of a conscientious objector as an officer in the German army
","This is indeed thoroughly a masterpiece, with tremendous realization of atrocious war scenes, with outstanding acting performances by above all James Coburn but also Maximilian Schell and James Mason among many others, but an objection must be raised against the story. Is this really credible? Could German soldiers act like this against fellow soldiers? I must find it hard to believe. The shattering finale, when James Coburn leads his last men back to his own German lines, must all the same be considered one of the strongest war sequences ever filmed, reminding very much of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' from 1931, and Maximilian Schell succeeds after all in making his character credible, although this is the crucial instant of the film and the story. The bloody gory scenes are so overwhelmingly multiple and crowded, so you must suspect Sam Peckinpah made this film just to be able to wallow as much as possible in visual cruelty and atrocity. James Mason is a contrast to this in his cool detachment to his job, while Steiner is the one really interesting character, both here and in the follow-up 'Breakthrough' two years later with Richard Burton in the role. It's impossible to say if James Coburn or Richard Burton makes it better. Burton makes a more aged scarred veteran, while Coburn is more virile. The most interesting scenes of the film are those of his sensational extra-sensory experience of reality after his severe concussion as hospitalized with Senta Berger as his nurse - this is exactly how you may experience brain damage after a critical concussion. It is and remains a masterpiece for all time, but it is not a very sympathetic or likeable one - Sam Peckinpah's films never seem to be able to include any well needed refreshing sense of humour into their epics of cruelty.",9,1,1,10 March 2020
Zulu," Great show.
","No praise is enough for this film. It is realistic cinema at its best concerning every single detail, from each individual soldier, the epic environment settings, the drama about the priest and his daughter, John Barry's terrific music, the constantly sustained almost unbearable suspense - many scenes are absolutely quiet and the most exciting ones as they always introduce something, - and above all, the overwhelmingness of the Zulu warriors. This all happened for real, and here cinema fulfills its highest mission in recreating and transmitting it all correctly. They are all ordinary men, Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are just ordinary soldiers, the priest is like any scared priest, his daughter (the only woman in the film) perfectly natural in her hysterics, and even in the baracks the soldiers and patients couldn't be more down to earth. This is cinema and cinematography at its most perfectly best - and a film difficult to transcend in excellence.",10,1,2,14 July 2018
The Favourite," The last days of the morbidly wretched Queen Anne and her grotesque court of intriguing favourites of all sexes
","This is a disturbingly unsympathetic film, enterprising a thorough insight into the goings-on at the court of the old dying Queen Anne, totally invalidated and rather potty and wholly at the mercy of wicked favourites who grow the worse the more influence on her they get. There is not one sympathetic person in the plot, unless you try to mobilize some absurd sympathy for the Queen, like all her courtiers and favourites never tire of cultivating a maximum of hypocrisy of affection for her just to keep a finger in the pie. Rachel Weisz carries the burden of the play with magnificent splendour as usual, for once you can see even her truly nasty, she is almost the only man in the context, while Emma Stone starts well to develop more and more into another mummy and dummy like all the others, doing anything just to stick to her situation. There are some notable anachronisms in this otherwise perfectly realistic costume drama of the first decade of the 18th century, like music by Schubert and Schumann and Emma Stone saying 'OK' and a modern word a number of times, but what perfect palace is completely dustfree? The most difficult part is that of the Queen, impeccably sustained and made totally convincing by Olivia Colman, but all the actors are perfect in their vicious and revolting characters, as is the direction, the cinematography, the composition of the film, in brief, everything - but it's a nasty story, and the more so for being true.",10,2,3,17 August 2019
Across the Universe," A baroque phantasmagoria in music, dance and flower power era nostalgia
","I saw this film with mixed feelings. Of course, it sparkles with virtuosity all the way, and the lyrics and music of the Beatles shine all the way, the actors are good, even the story is good, returning to the roaring 60s with the Vietnam controversy, the hippie explosion, the political turbulence under Johnson with chaos demonstrations going constantly from bad to worse, and so on, all this is good, but this film has received so much positive acclaim, that someone also should have some objections.It's like a gigantic cinematic patchwork, many ideas put together inspired by Richard Lester (of the first Beatles films), Monty Python, Hair (of 1979, which this film could be seen as an update and modern version of), and even a bit of Apocalypse Now and Catherine Bigelow. There are outstanding scenes, especially all the ballet scenes, even Salma Hayek appearing as a number of nurses, but the music gets a bit screamy sometimes, it is overdone, the psychedlic explosions get repetitive, and the film is too long. Technically it's expertly made all the way, it's a marathon feast to the eyes, but the dialogue is lost in mumbling, articulation is missing, they speak neither clearly nor intelligently, since they don't need to, since there is the music, the colours, the parties, the demonstrations and even action at war. It's a grandiose film but suffers from some degree of superficiality - splendid firerworks that just blow over, and after the party there is nothing left.",8,1,1,22 November 2018
La Grande Illusion," The first great and unsurpassed film of prisoners of war, focussing on gentlemanly soldiery
","For me, this is Jean Renoir's ultimate masterpiece, although he made many. Critics generally prefer 'La règle du jeu' a few years later, which maybe reveals even greater virtuoso direction, but 'La grande illusion' is deeper and more human and made with considerable compassion. What is the great illusion really? It's difficult to pinpoint this, but it has to do with the silent gentlemen's agreement between officers in war. The drama lies in the relationship between Erich von Stroheim, in the finest acting performance of his life, and Pierre Fresnay, today almost only remembered for this film, as the French officer, He and Jean Gabin with many others end up in a German prison camp during the first year of the first world war and spends the following years trying indefatigably to escape. This is the first great film of prisoners of war and perhaps the greatest. The first half of the film just shows off their ways of making their life in a prison camp as endurable as possible, there is a hilarious scene when they provide some entertainment dressed up as women, but the second half becomes more serious, as the most incorrigible prisoners, like Jean Gabin and Pierre Fresnay, are transferred to a prison fortress in the mountains. They have met Erich von Stroheim before, but here he is now two years later a handicapped disillusioned commandant, who grieves for his loss of capacity to fight in the war. He and Fresnay find each other, they have had the same mistress in Paris, and there is a deep a mutual respect between them for each other, which makes Fresnay reluctant to follow his fellows on a daring escape, since he knows Stroheim is relying on his word as a gentleman.But the greatest golden character of the film lies in its extreme realism of almost a documentary character. The prisoners and officers speak French, German, English and Russian, and the life inside the prison camp is caught with an authenticity which is baffling in its natural spontaneity, which is all due to Renoir's wonderful direction. The film with its great story couldn't have been made more convincing.",10,5,5,5 April 2019
The Imitation Game," The triumph of solving the enigma problem turns into human tragedy.
","This is a deeply moving film of a true story for its fathomless tragedy. It was already filmed in 2001 with Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet and again in 2011, but this is more complete, telling the whole story, which actually are three stories, the filming starting 6 years after the war to introduce the critical aftermath, then proceeding to the actual Enigma story, the backbone of the film, and then diving into his childhood to start from the beginning on the story of Christopher, his best friend, later his computer. Charles Dance makes an excellent villain, he is always good at this, he has some tremendous scenes of sabotage and obstruction before he disappears without tears. Keira Knightley makes a deep impression as Miss Clarke, and every scene with her lifts the film, especially the last heart-rending scene. This is a story of the highest level of heroism, the quiet background closet worker, who does his job in silence without anyone except himself realizing the importance of his work, which he obstinately carries on against all odds and adversities - and gets no reward for it whatsoever, only a total cover-up and a horrible punishment for nothing, due to the dumbness of the authorities. The three stories melt into one and makes a complete tragedy - after a complete triumph. Only after 50 years the truth was allowed to become known. This is a film to always return to.",9,2,7,28 January 2015
Where Eagles Dare," Richard Burton doing his best against extremely troublesome odds
","This is not only perhaps the best Alistair MacLean film together with 'The Guns of Navarone' but also one of the best war films ever made, for its constantly increasing density of action and tension and outstanding palacting by all the actors, especially Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood of course, who actually are each other's opposites but match each other more thasn well anyway. Also the story is one of MacLean's best in its muddled up confusion of treason and double dealings, espionage on the wrong level and booby traps costantly sabotaging the mission, indeed a mission impossible, but surprisingly they carry it through anyway thanks to the inofficial assistance of Mary Ure and even disobeying orders from above. Patrick Wymark is as he always is, he can never play any other character than his own, while the Germans are given too little space to act properly. I saw it 50 years ago, but to watch it again after 50 years was more than rewarding, as I was quite astonished to find it so astoundingly excellent. This is definitely a classic for all times, as it is entirely without any weak spots anywhere in its constantly throbbingly vibrant life and suspense, mainly kept up by superb acting..",10,1,2,6 March 2020
The Shape of Water," A modern fairy tale in the shadow of the space competition between US and Russia in 1960.
","This is poetry all the way, a beautiful love story of the kind that will endure forever, like similar love stories by Victor Hugo between monsters and virgins, the most impossible love stories triumphing in overdoming reality and surviving by its poetry. It's like a continuation from 'Pan's Labyrinth', and it's actually the same actor playing the faun and the amphibian man, doing it quite convincingly in both cases. There is very little to add to the previous 756 reviews, it's just to join the chorus of supreme acclaim of this masterpiece of the cinematic art. The story is clearcut, the characters are well developed, realism is joined with fantasy in perfect convincing unity, and the drama is consummate. Nothing could be better.",10,36,69,20 March 2018
The Departed," 2,5 hours of brutality, violence and massacres
","The film is well made with great actors that are doing an excellent job, but it's actually a remake of a Korean film, which are notorious for their excessive brutality and violence. That is certainly not lacking here. The Korean original is much shorter, more efficient and intensive, while Scorsese has made his version as long and tedious as possible. There is very little action the first two hours, and mainly only talk and paranoid intrigue. But the worst thing is the language. The word 'f..k' occurs in almost every sentence and at least in every scene. This extremely base and vulgar language with very little vocabulary and mainly used aggressively in constant outbreaks of anger and violence ruins the film and makes it deplorably void of style. Of what use then is the brilliant technique, the excellent actors and the splendid direction, if the film is just 2,5 hours of brutal criminality, atrocious violence, constant massacres and only foul language? Sorry, Scorsese has made a few great and interesting films, like 'Bringing Out the Dead' and 'Shutter Island', but this is not one of them.",7,1,1,5 December 2019
Macbeth," Shakespeare done away with and replaced by brutal primitive pretensions
","Whatever happened to Shakespeare? He is almost completely lost in this pretentious whisking away of any meaning and poetry of the play by complete obfuscation of the language, the very flesh and blood of any Shakespeare drama, here mumbled in the beards or wheezed half way while most gets stuck in the throat, as if diction suddenly was anathema and banished. All previous Macbeth adaptations for the screen that I have seen have been better, and they were at least four. Things are made even worse by the fact of the alterations, the important part of the porter (peeing in the gate) has been obliterated, the murder of the family of McDuff is turned into a grotesque exaggeration like a blasphemy of the play, and McDuff's war trick in the end with the wandering forest, the very top of the play, is substituted by an intentional destructive forest fire. The battle scenes are grossly exaggerated and turned into artificial ballets made worse by slow motion, and there is little to save the film except the marvellous landscape scenery, magnificent all the way through, and the after all good acting, despite the fact that the actors are not allowed more than to mumble. Sorry, this was an indecent corruption and humiliation of the theatrical art of Shakespeare. What a marvellous film it would have been, if Shakespeare had been kept alive and allowed to shine in his language in these true landscape settings of wildest Scotland!",6,3,5,25 January 2016
