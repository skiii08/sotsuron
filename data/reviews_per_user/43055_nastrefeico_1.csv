Iron Man 3," Stan... Where are you? (SPOILERS)
",":::SPOILERS::::: Fans, children, Geeks: The Mandarin... there is no such thing. And now Marvel has its own Schumacher, I would like to introduce you to: Shane Black.I feel really fooled, not surprised, so The Mandarin was only a decoy and the biggest disappointments in the superheroe movie history, just like Schumacher's Bane, nice move! trying to make a Nolan's Ra's al Ghul turn look like? FAILED! the real villain is an Extremis crazy Scientist and then a lava metrosexual guy? seriously?... looks like Jim Carrey's Edward Nigma from Schumacher too. Not mentioned the Red She-Hulk Pepper ugly surprise. I'm going to keep just the two trailers in my mind with the excellent quotations of the FAKE Mandarin because the entire movie it's a complete flick full of politics and no comic story related with an obnoxious 8 year old boy as a sidekick of Tony Stark, really? it seems that you are watching the Osama Bin Laden E! True Politics Story merged with Power Rangers.The CGI effects were meh! and the post credits scene is a real mess. They ruined one of the most famous villains of Marvel and the Iron Man movie franchise. Stan... Where are you?",1,51,101,29 April 2013
