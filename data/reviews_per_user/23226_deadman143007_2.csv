Men in Black 3," Just one word... Disappointed
","I am a huge fan of spielberg's alien invasion movies..and Men in black series is my fav. But this sequel fails to deliver in every possible way. No only the story line is crap and hopeless, the dialogues are also vague and unnatural. I mean, considering the two awesome parts of this movie, i went in the hall with huge amount of expectations but MIB 3 turned out to be a huge low-blow.A nutshell- start was a bit good, but what happened to the story writers. MIB franchise is well known for its messy and ugly creatures from outer space. Those were no where to be seen. We love the chemistry of Agent J & K, not the chemistry between Agent J & young agent K. small role of Tommy lee also added to the negative points. The story line along with the dialogues were also not hilarious at all- at least for me they weren't. All & all i was very sad when i came out of the screening. Thumbs down to this sequel of MIB.",3,8,17,27 May 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Ultimatum is truly ultimate
","After the two blockbusters The bourne Identity and the Supremacy, this one takes you down to the starting point of the journey. Action packed, cars getting torned and crashed, fast paced story line- courtsey to the novel, great direction, perfect cinematography and super performances by every damm actor. This movie has everythin you want to love it. I saw it in the year 2012.. and i regret this...This movie defines sheer perfection. Though i am little sad that Matt damon is not in the next bourne movie. keeping my fingers cross for it. Dnt miss this.. Just great. Deserve more Oscar to b honest.... :-)",10,0,1,13 July 2012
