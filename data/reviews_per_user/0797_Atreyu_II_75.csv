The Mask," This movie is a scream!!!
","If you ask me, 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it: 'Smokin!'Jim Carrey can be two things: either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts, although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time, if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easy-going guy with great sense of humor (which matches his funny name). He is «the nicest guy», yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends, except for his co-worker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo (a Jack Russell Terrier). Stanley likes to watch cartoons (particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf), decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama :)Jim Carrey also portrays the title character (The Mask), which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example, he can dance like Fred Astaire, Gumby and Barishnikov (all together) - and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy, a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet, despite its cartoonish humor, it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time, this movie is clearly inspired (in many ways) on several cartoons, such as the Looney Tunes, Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live action/animation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds, as well as great lines, nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here: she was more curvy, sexier, so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus, she was great in this role. In fact, she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film, with a husky, jazz-like voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding', where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a live-action version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters (along with Stanley Ipkiss) are Charlie Schumacher, Milo, Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great: the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs 'Hey Pachuco' and 'Cuban Pete' - this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he (as The Mask) dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, Nancy Fish, Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty, but also for being lovable, playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus, Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders, he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus, he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear, joy and sadness, for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is: a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9,54,59,7 July 2007
Vertigo," Not really all that great, but not very bad either
","'Vertigo', now one of the most praised and popular Alfred Hitchcock's films, brought me mixed feelings. The first minutes are very interesting for what happens in them and also because they take place on the rooftops of San Francisco. Then the movies goes to a somewhat slow start but ends up becoming interesting and intriguing from the moment when Madeleine enters in scene. There are also many filming angles which are unique, typical from The Master of Suspense, as well as some lovely vistas: the streets of San Francisco, the Fort Point (near the Golden Gate Bridge), the San Francisco Bay, the Mission San Juan Bautista...While Madeleine is on screen, the movie is good, but after she disappears the movie loses its interest. Scottie becomes obsessed with an unpretty woman named Judy who doesn't look like Madeleine at all (but somehow, for him she does). Eventually she transforms to the point of looking almost identical to Madeleine and apparently (which I find ridiculous) she *is* the same person. The ending is good, though, as it takes us one more time to the Mission San Juan Bautista.James Stewart offers a good performance as Scottie and his acrophobia problem. Kim Novak is very good as the beautiful and lovely (however with a problem of major depression) Madeleine. Her look as Madeleine is simple and old-fashioned but an example of classic beauty: attractive, classy, undeniable pretty and charming. It's hard to believe that the same actress portrayed the completely different in every way Judy.In conclusion, a movie that doesn't completely satisfy but also doesn't totally disappoint. However, it does not live up to its status and fame, being clearly overrated.",6,2,6,23 August 2010
The Sound of Music," More endless than timeless
","With all the respect for this movie's fans, but seriously I don't find it that great.For one thing, the biggest downside of this movie is its runtime. I mean, this movie is almost 3 hours long! It's too long and becomes tiring! A movie like this could be told in less 1 hour than this.The movie itself is nothing extraordinary either. But not everything is bad. It has some great moments which are really enjoyable.The opening sequence is perfect. It shows us all the beauty of big mountains, large lakes and a blue sky with clouds. Then Julie Andrews appears singing «The hills are alive with the sound of music». After that, the nice village of Salzburg (in Austria) is presented to us, which is another quality of the movie.Other great and memorable moments of this movie are the sequence 'I'm sixteen, going on seventeen' and the part when Maria takes the 7 Von Trapp children for a walk in Salzburg and teaches them how to sing. This sequence has also the precious help of the naturally gorgeous backgrounds, surrounded by green places, giant mountains, a blue sky with clouds and a view to the village.I also enjoy when Captain Von Trapp finally accepts to bring back music to his life and his kids's lives. He even sings very well, like Julie Andrews does. More than that: from a cold and very serious man, he becomes a loving and nice man.The songs of this movie are all nice and classics.But the rest of the movie isn't that good. I think it has too many needless moments and perhaps that's why it becomes too long and even a bit boring. It naturally loses some of its enchantment and classic status. By the end, when the war starts, it becomes even slower.Julie Andrews and Cristopher Plummer play very well their roles and it's notorious that they really enjoyed making this movie.",7,3,12,4 August 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Overrated
","With all due respect for the fans of this movie or any other Indiana Jones movie, but this wasn't what I expected. I found this to be a rather weak adventure film (and I like adventure films) and I personally don't consider this a classic.The reason why this film didn't live up to my expectations is because I was hoping this to be a movie with great adventures and lots of fun, amusement and classic humor - you know, something like 'Romancing the Stone' and 'The Jewel of the Nile'. Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence. The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing. There are some good action scenes, but other than that it's not much of a movie.",5,23,45,10 February 2008
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A unique movie experience
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a wonder in the art of making films. Because it mixes live-action and cartoons, it was a challenge to be made. But that's exactly what makes it so distinguish and unique, especially considering that the idea works out so well. It's a different and original movie experience, a real winner.Yet, the film is more than a combination of live-action and cartoons. It has a dark atmosphere with lots of suspense, almost like a thriller. Classic humor isn't forgotten either, with numerous funny lines and hysterical gags, as well as humorous characters. The joke about «uncle Thumper» is one of the funniest, but there are many others. There's also a hilarious piano acting with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, which they play the same piano song as in Tom & Jerry's short 'The Cat Concerto' and have their hilariously silly battle. In fact, the soundtrack of the movie is excellent, including Jessica Rabbit's song 'Why don't you do right?' and a suspense music very similar to one from the original 'Back to the Future'.Other movies that successfully mix live-action and cartoons are 'Mary Poppins', 'Pete's Dragon' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks'. Like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', those three movies combine this 'marriage' very well. On the other hand, other movies such as 'Space Jam' tried this idea but without the same success.I believe that this movie was made in a unique moment of inspiration. The sceneries are great, the designs, the cartoons, the backgrounds, the details, the animation, the special effects, the artwork... everything was carefully made and I much welcome that. This is one of the greatest Disney films.Great actors make the difference too. Bob Hoskins is English but speaks with an excellent American accent, not to mention that he does the amazing thing of acting against the air. Joanna Cassidy, Charles Fleischer, Alan Tilvern, Stubby Kaye, Cristopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner are awesome too. Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit, with that sexy and sensual voice. And... guess what! Even the singer Frank Sinatra has a minor role in this film as the hilarious but useless Singing Sword. Even without looking at the credits, who wouldn't recognize that great voice? Frank Sinatra's voice is just as recognizable as Nat King Cole's or Sterling Holloway's.As for the characters, the weasels are a perfect example of chronical stupidity. They're humorous because they're always laughing, even though they know what happens to someone who can't stop laughing.Marvin Acme is «the king of the jokes», always humorous and cheerful and at his funniest with his mythical hand-buzzer. Angelo is an idiot, drunk and greedy guy, but funny at the same time. Dolores is a great character. R. K. Maroon is an interesting character with half a dark side and half a good side. Judge Doom is a great villain, humorous, mysterious and somewhat sinister. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and very jolly - that's his only purpose as a cartoon, like he says himself. Jessica Rabbit is a very sexy cartoon, one of the most beautiful and sexiest ever - she's not bad, she's just drawn that way. Benny the Cab is funny. Baby Herman is a bit annoying - he might look innocent at first, but he is extremely rude and he loves to woo women. Eddie Valiant is another great character - grumpy, serious and funny sometimes. And he looks very much like my godfather in appearance.The movie takes place in Hollywood, 1947. It does recreate the 40's very well. That influence is notorious in many ways, including the cars used.Before finishing, let me say that I like rabbits very much. They're adorable and very cute animals, although in the cartoons they aren't as cute - but they're usually funny in cartoons.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9,15,17,14 July 2007
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," This is the movie that introduced me to dalmatians
","The 17th animated Disney classic is a less ambitious film comparing to earlier top Disney classics, but it is enjoyable enough anyway.'Sleeping Beauty' nearly bankrupted the Disney studio. Perhaps because of this and also because other extremely expensive Disney classics were initially a failure, the Disney studio needed to make cheaper animated films in a try to recover financial costs. This one is cheaper and more simple in everything: story, designs, sceneries/backgrounds, colors, picture quality, characters, etc...It certainly doesn't have 'that' magic and attention to detail which makes Disney so legendary, but it doesn't deserve to be judged too hardly. It isn't Disney at its worst, very far from that! The animation is great as usual on Disney and this one also has lots of fun, entertainment, danger, adventure, darkness, classic humor and even some touching and depressing moments. The happy ending is another sign that it follows the Disney tradition.Although the artwork is way cheaper-looking than in the most artistic Disney tales, is still in a good and acceptable level in many ways. It is basically the same artstyle we see in 'The Sword in the Stone' and 'The Jungle Book', for example. Simple and not extraordinary, but not as poor-looking as in 'Oliver & Company'. Just for the record, I consider 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' a better movie than 'Oliver & Company', 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Sword in the Stone'.However, there is one thing which the artwork of this movie is brilliant: a brief scene which we can see the sparkling stars at night, with an impressing resemblance to the fabulous artwork of the best Disney classic ever, 'Pinocchio'.The characters are very enjoyable in general. The most enjoyable are Roger, the Colonel, Sargent Tibs, Pongo, Perdita and those adorable 99 dalmatian puppies. All of the puppies are adorable.By the way, the first time I saw dalmatians was in this movie. I didn't know that dog breed before, but ever since then they became one of my favorite dog breeds. They're such cute spotty dogs! I love dalmatians since I was a kid.Returning to the conversation about the characters, Cruella DeVil isn't one of my favorite Disney villains and I personally don't consider her one of Disney's best villains, but she's one of the most eccentric and original. I like her red car, nevertheless. She's got a beautiful and fine automobile! Jasper and Horace are Cruella's sidekicks and they are funny in many moments. They are just as cruel and heartless as Cruella, but more comical. There are several hilarious moments with these two guys. It's so funny how the dalmatians (with the help of other animals) make their lives miserable, considering that they definitely deserve it. This only accents the comical effect.Pongo, Roger, the Colonel and Sargent Tibs are equally humorous characters. In fact, Sargent Tibs (the cat) has always been one of my favorite characters from this movie. He's funny, smart, clever, well-mannered and cool.This movie takes place in England. It takes us not only to London, but also to other places that must be not very far from London... or maybe they are. But wherever they are, those are all nice places, at least judging by the movie's perspective.About the soundtrack, it is generally great too. 'Cruella DeVil' is a delightful song (a perfect song for Cruella DeVil, describing her in perfection). 'Dalmatian Plantation' is a catchy one. 'Kanine Kruchies Jingle' is a lovely and cute song.'One Hundred and One Dalmatians' had a 'remake' in 1996, but as a live-action version. The live-action version/remake has amazing similarities to the animated version, being very faithful to it. Although the live-action version is okay, I rather the animated version with its simple and old-fashioned charm.Overall, a charming Disney classic which might not be their best, but deserves its attention too. It also features the voice talents of many well-known Disney artists.This should definitely be on Top 250.",8,16,21,19 August 2007
Lifeboat," The whole thing takes in a lifeboat. That's all?
","I can see why is this film considered one of Hitchcock's limited-setting. To be honest, I wasn't particularly thrilled. The scenario and backgrounds are nice and the film is neat-looking but it's just too limited. I mean, the whole thing takes place in a lifeboat. There isn't even a scene in the ship that sinks. It could use at least some 15 minutes in the ship before it sinks instead of beginning the movie with the ship already practically sunk. And at the end there isn't even a boat that comes in rescue! It's kinda like what they ask themselves: «What do you do with people like that?».And having that said, I also have to be fair. This isn't a bad movie, it just doesn't really make my type. However, it could be a good bet for Hitchcock fans. This is probably one of his least famous and heard, so it should be one for 'hitchcockians' to discover.",6,0,7,2 February 2012
Citizen Kane," This is considered one of the best movies ever?
","'Citizen Kane' is often regarded as one of the all time greatest films. But is it all that great? Of course, that is very subjective, but for me the answer is no. Considering all the hype around this movie, I expected something far better. That said, the movie isn't bad and it's an important film. Directed by and starring Orson Welles as the title character (a wealthy newspaper publisher whose life is the subject of the motion picture), it is a movie with many innovations.For example, Orson Welles (who was an unproved director at the time) was given the choice to develop his own story, select his own cast/crew and was given final cut privilege. The screenplay, however, was developed with the help of Herman Mankiewicz. This film created a new style of film-making by studying various forms of movie making and combining them all into one. The advanced cinematography is notorious in many levels: the extended use of deep focus, the peculiar way how low-angle shots were made, the use of an optical printer whenever a deep focus was not possible, the special effects, the nice scenarios, the in-camera effects and flashbacks, etc. Even the ending is different compared with other films. Ya see, after the words 'The End', the following text appears: «Most of the principal actors in 'CITIZEN KANE' are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them».The plot is a 'roman à clef' that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane. It starts with this death, which causes great impact around the world. Kane's story is narrated principally through numerous flashbacks, from his childhood in poverty until adulthood (with money and power, as well as all the negative consequences it carries). The Xanadu estate is fictional, but in real life a city named Xanadu exists. The cast is interesting. Orson Welles is great as Charles Foster Kane, Buddy Swan as Kane when he was 8 years old and Paul Stewart as Raymond. It was nice to see Paul Stewart in this, too bad that only happens in the final part of the movie. Paul Stewart starred some years later in 'The Window' as the character Joe Kellerson. I think that this movie starts off interesting but then it becomes boring and loses its interest. There were also things I didn't properly understand, such as all the 'Rosebud' talking.To conclude my review, I liked the cinematography but the plot and the movie itself were not quite what I expected.",6,3,6,10 April 2010
Beauty and the Beast," A very popular Disney movie
","The 30th animated Disney 'classic' is, without a doubt, one of the most famous Disney classics, which is a good and a bad thing either, because its success tends somewhat to overshadow other very good Disney classics (often better than this). Or maybe what happens is that this movie gets the deserved attention, while others sadly do not have the same luck (such as 'The Rescuers', 'The Aristocats', 'The Fox and the Hound', 'The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh', 'Robin Hood' and others). That is the worst aspect of this movie's success. So, as one can see, it's not all roses.Nevertheless, 'Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's most original movies. To a point, it is every bit as creative and imaginative as 'Alice in Wonderland', except that it isn't as eccentric as that one.One thing that is very obvious from the beginning is that this is a french tale. It's quite easy to understand that because all the characters have french names. Plus, they often use french words such as 'Bonjour' (which means 'Good morning' in french). Lumière even uses the word «Sacré bleu» once. However, it's not very clear the exact place of our story. All we know is that it's somewhere in France.As much as I don't like all of the movie's characters, some of them are very charming. For example: Lumière (the candelabra), Cogsworth (a clock), Mrs. Potts (a teapot), Chip (the cute little teacup), Belle, Maurice (Belle's father, who is also an inventor) and Philippe (the horse). It's funny that a horse is named Philippe (Philip in french) - LOL.Belle is one of Disney's most beautiful chicks, together with Jasmine, Ariel and the Blue Fairy. Belle is also classy, charming, carefree, nonconformist, conservative and nice. All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his 'little wife'. Belle is appropriately named like that (her name means beautiful in french).Gaston (who is considered the villain of the movie) is a character who's got no culture at all, being the epitome of pure strength and no brain (like Biff Tannen from 'Back to the Future'). Gaston is a tall, muscled, vain, arrogant, snobbish and chauvinistic guy with a heart of stone.On the other hand, Gaston's follower and helper, Lefou, is more of a goofy guy than anything else, nearly like a comic relief. No wonder he is named Lefou (which means 'The Fool' in french).Monsieur D'Arque is a strange man with a sinister appearance that makes him seem to come from a terror film. For some children, he might be a bit of a creepy character.My favorite character is Chip (he is the cutest of all, besides, his natural sweetness and innocence helps). However, Lumière and Belle come incredibly close to Chip when it comes to my favorite characters of this film.The soundtrack isn't entirely spectacular, but the romantic ballad 'Beauty and the Beast' is beautiful. It has 2 versions. Angela Lansbury's version is good, but the original one by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is extraordinary.As for the cast, it is brand new comparing to older Disney films and most of them do well. Paige O'Hara and Angela Lansbury are among the best ones, but those who steal the show are Bradley Pierce as Chip and Jerry Orbach as Lumière. Jerry Orbach gives so much life and energy to Lumière, with such a convincing french accent.The best part of the whole film is the famous ballroom dance sequence, which is wonderful, brilliant and very artistic (the graphics also make it look incredibly close to a live-action ballroom).Generally speaking, this film has the main ingredients of an animated Disney movie: great picture quality (good designs, backgrounds, sceneries and colors), very good animation, creativity, originality, some charming characters, some romance, adventure, darkness, suspense, classic humor and so on...The Prince (that is, the Beast as a human being) almost looks like Jean Michel Jarre with that long hair. That said, his change of heart during the movie is amazing. From a person who is spoiled, selfish, unkind and with an explosive temper, he becomes kind, gentle and even romantic.Although the sequence 'Human Again' was originally gonna be included in the movie, it was removed in the final version. It was recovered for the DVD. Yet, the version I consider the true one is the one without the sequence 'Human Again', even if that one is not *officially* the movie's true version. But for me the true version is the one I know since 1991. It's the way I always knew it, so it makes perfect sense.",7,5,8,24 July 2007
The Notebook," Great book, 'so-so' film
","As a fan of Nicholas Sparks's romantic novels and being 'The Notebook' one of my favorites, I had to see this movie. Now here comes the time to share my feelings about it. In my opinion, this is a reasonable, emotional and romantic movie, but the book is slightly superior. Without getting into the differences between the book and the movie, at least I've got to tell that I personally find the book deeper, more sentimental, more intense, more beautiful, more emotional and certainly more romantic.The book is one of the deepest and most beautiful love stories of all time and touched me like few romances did. Apart 'The Notebook', only 'Message in a Bottle' had the same impact on me - another one of the best books by Nicholas Sparks.Back to the movie 'The Notebook', it isn't bad but it's inevitable to compare it with the book. Anyone who saw the movie and is familiar with the book, knows that the book is more complete (the same happens with 'Message in a Bottle'). As a movie, 'The Notebook' seems somehow like a forced adaptation in many parts.About the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are good in the roles of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton, but I'm not sure if they are the best choice for these roles. I don't know who would I cast for Noah, but for Allie I'm sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar would make a perfect Allie (any of them).In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is probably its beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, especially that enormous lake/swamp where Noah and Allie are crossing by boat and the lake scene with ducks flying at the beginning (by the sunrise or sunset time).",7,2,7,28 December 2007
Finding Nemo," Not bad for a CGI motion picture
","I am really not big on CGI productions because what I really like are the old cartoons drawn by hand. However, 'Finding Nemo' isn't such bad for a CGI production. It isn't 'Cars', but it's a little better than 'Toy Story' for example, and much better than movies like 'Shrek', 'Madagascar' and so on...'Finding Nemo' is technically very acceptable. It has great graphics which make the whole scenario look so real and so natural. The story is clever and the movie has lots of dangerous adventures lived by a clownfish and a funny regal tang with memory problems. However, although the graphics are in general good thanks to its quality sceneries and well-designed various fish species, the human characters are awfully designed, especially that horrible little girl who looks like the annoying Sid from 'Toy Story'.Aside the movie's faults, generally speaking the movie is okay, entertaining enough and offers fun for everyone who's watching it. The movie has some quite funny gags, such as whenever a character says something like «He's a clownfish, but he's not funny at all». Another good joke is when Marlin is trying to tell a joke to the sharks and, while he's making a fool out of himself, he suddenly yells «Nemo!!!». Bruce (the shark) is a funny and interesting character. Bruce is a very humorous shark and he's got a funny way to invite the fishes for a dinner with his other two friends sharks. After all, «fishes are their friends». Oh, by the way, I think it's very good that for once a movie includes a blue whale, which is a very forgotten animal in animated films. It is the biggest animal on Earth and it sure is a fantastic creature.Overall, one of Pixar's best films (although not a tremendous film for me) and better than the overvalued and overrated 'Toy Story'.",7,1,3,3 September 2008
Dead Poets Society," A hymn to life
","'Dead Poets Society' is more than a lesson of life. It's a hymn to life. It has a good message: 'Carpe diem', which means 'Seize the day'. I completely agree with that message because there's no coming back and time flies.It's a reasonable movie with an inspiring story, good message, great performances from the actors, wonderful sceneries, awesome soundtrack (classical music, for example), drama and comedy.John Keating is the kind of teacher that anyone would like to have as a teacher. A teacher with such a colorful imagination and sense of humor, a teacher who inspires his students to make their dreams come true and makes their lives extraordinary. I mean, wow! John Keating is brilliantly performed by the comedian Robin Williams. In general, Robin Williams is as humorous as usual in this movie, but we can also see some of his talent for drama.Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude). All of them are very well played by the actors.About the boys, Charlie Dalton aka 'Nuwanda' is the funniest of all. He's just hilarious! 'Nuwanda' is such a funny nickname - lol.Todd Anderson is a shy character portrayed by Ethan Hawke. This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset'.Mr. Perry (Neil's father) is a complicated character. Like Kurtwood Smith himself says, «he's understandable, not likable». He doesn't let Neil do what he wants and controls all of his life and future.The ending is somehow... empty: Neil dies and 'Nuwanda' is expelled. But the boys's homage to Mr. Keating at the end is admirable. What's even more amazing is that it is started by Todd Anderson.",7,5,6,30 August 2007
Brokeback Mountain," All the hype is virtually ridiculous
","Before I started to write my own review, I took one good look at the reviews around here. I didn't pay much attention to the positives because my priority were the negatives. And I agree with a lot of things said by the people who wrote negatives.There is frankly nothing memorable in this film. Its one saving grace is some of the beautiful scenario of Brokeback Mountain but there is so little of it. I mean, so little of the best of the scenario.It's a painfully slow and long (2+ hours) movie, as much as it is forgettable and boring to death, so boring that I could yawn like a lion. It isn't even the slightest bit entertaining. The acting of Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and all other actors is clearly overrated. To be frank, both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall act quite badly, but Jake acts particularly badly. Heath could act a little better but still he wasn't a great actor. He had a typically cowboy voice but that wasn't enough.Also, there isn't any real feelings, emotion, sympathy and chemistry between the lead actors. They simply weren't believable together. All they did was this: one moment they were kissing and making love and suddenly they were brutish to each other and constantly yelling. Their story was so forced and phony, just like the rest of the movie.Other negative aspects were the lack of character development, the weak plot, the bad direction and finally the thing that bothers me most: the implied animal cruelty. Some animals here are shown in highly questionable condition. As an animal lover, that disturbs me and horrifies me.I'm glad that at least I didn't waste any money to watch this deplorable thing, although I still had one small price to pay: the energy wasted in watching it.",3,1,20,31 December 2011
Home Alone," Surreal and hilarious
","'Home Alone' is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.The plot is quite original and surreal: a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' (performed by Brenda Lee), 'You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch', 'White Christmas', 'Carol of the Bells', 'Oh Holly Night' and 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the 'wet bandits' Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected 'surprises'. Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The 'wet bandits' were nicknamed like that by Marv because their 'calling card' (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both 'wet bandits' are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film 'Angels with Filthy Souls' are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the 'wet bandits' and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski, the «Polka King of the Midwest».",7,33,46,20 August 2007
The Jungle Book," A movie that appeals to life
","The 19th animated Disney classic is, like the other Disney classics produced in the 60's, not one of their greatest. Yet, it is entertaining and great fun.'The Jungle Book' is an appeal to life and a hymn to life. They never say the words 'Hakuna Matata' here, but there's no doubt that the 'Hakuna Matata' philosophy from 'The Lion King' is the same philosophy that we see here: a life full of joy, fun, no worries and which the problems are to be forgotten. In fact, it isn't any lie to tell that 'The Lion King' was inspired by the idea of this movie.'The Jungle Book' is a traditional animated Disney classic. Although some of its designs look simple, the artwork is very good and full of 'life', following the classic Disney's standards. The songs are full of life and rhythm, making one wanna dance at their sound (that's the case of 'Bear Necessities' and 'I Wanna Be Like You'). Speaking of this, I'm surprised that initially the song 'Bear Necessities' wasn't going to be in the movie - I'm glad they changed their mind, because this song is so joyful and very important: after all, it symbolizes the main idea of the movie.The characters aren't the very best on Disney, but they're still good enough. Baloo (the bear) adds a lot to this movie. He is a very cool bear, not to mention humorous and jolly. Baloo is probably the best character of this movie. And all this charm is combined with the inimitable voice of the legendary Phil Harris.Bagheera is a more serious character than a funny one. Bagheera is wise and, to tell the truth, it's pleasant to see a black panther being portrayed as a wise character for once instead of another owl. Bagheera is voiced by one of Disney's legends, Sebastian Cabot (at his best here).Mowgli is an alright man cub, but strangely his voice changes very much: during a while he has the voice of a teenager and suddenly he speaks with a more 'babyish' voice - perhaps a sign that he was voiced by more than one actor? The same thing happens with Arthur from 'The Sword in the Stone'.Kaa (the snake) and Shere Khan (the tiger) are the villains, but their role is small. Kaa is voiced by the unforgettable Sterling Holloway, while Shere Khan is voiced by George Sanders. Shere Khan is mean but cool, because of his delicate and charming voice (very much like Scar from 'The Lion King').Colonel Hathi is an interesting elephant. Everybody knows the myth that «an elephant never forgets». Well, Colonel Hathi is an elephant that forgets! But that is exactly what makes him so funny. King Louie is a cool orangutan, brilliantly voiced by Louis Prima. Rama is a loving and caring wolf, voiced by Ben Wright. An unusual story, great animation, the designs, sceneries/backgrounds, the jungle/forests of India, the soundtrack, generally good characters (apart the vultures, which I consider boring characters), the friendship between Mowgli/Baloo and classic humor make this movie.This movie is known for being the last one with Walt Disney himself involved. Sadly, he died during its production and never got to see the final result and its success. But he will never be forgotten and, even after his death, the «9 Old Men» knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit in the following movies because of their long-time experience with 'uncle Walt'.",7,2,3,27 August 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," The global warming: not fiction, but a fact
","'The Day After Tomorrow' isn't just fiction. It's fascinating and scary the way it comes close to reality. I mean, what we see in this movie might happen someday. The global warming isn't a game, it's a serious subject. Its consequences might be tragic.'The Day After Tomorrow' is a reasonable movie, without much boring moments. The story is intriguing, the visuals are amazing, the special effects are impressing and stunning, the actors's performances are great (especially by Dennis Quaid - at his best here) and the movie has a good combination of drama, suspense, thriller, adventure and tension.The only negative side of its special effects is that, in some cases, they are unbelievably quick. For example, when the ice freezes in only very few seconds. We all know that's impossible.This is a movie to teach us to give the deserved value to Mother Nature and to take care of it, before it's too late. It also focus on things such as the value of family and friendship.Overall, an acceptable movie which also makes us think.",7,2,4,2 September 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Absolutely unnecessary violence
","This Spanish-Mexican film, also known by the title 'Pan's Labyrinth' (nothing to do with Peter Pan, in case you're thinking that because of the 'Pan'), is not what it seems. This films fools anyone who is expecting a fantasy film. It happened to me. I didn't hear about this movie until some time before I watched it. Despite me not knowing very well what to expect from it, I expected a movie of fantasy and magic. Something in the line of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Labyrinth' but better than 'Labyrinth'. But it ended up not being anything of what I imagined. And not in the good sense...Aside some beautiful backgrounds/landscapes and a relatively well made labyrinth, most of the movie is horrible. It is violent in the maximum sense of the word. No kidding. It's not a movie with just one or another brief scene of violence. There is brutal violence in many scenes. It's too much and that is something unacceptable on a movie like this. I wasn't prepared for the excessive violence in this movie and wasn't expecting it. I mean, one thing is a movie being violent if its genre or story justifies so. By this, you accept better its violence, even if it's brutal. But not on something that is supposed to be a fantasy/magical movie suitable for everyone including children. I can handle violence in films (even if it's brutal), as long as it is in an acceptable level and not excessive. But this one was too much for me to handle. There are far too many shocking scenes that I could mention, but I won't go into that. See for yourself and judge for yourself, but be warned: this ain't pretty to view.To tell the truth, only about 10% of the movie has fantasy and even those moments of fantasy have no charm... in fact, they are more dark (in a bad way) than a revelation. This is a strange film. It seems like 3 or 4 completely different films in one, all different in temperament and such. It's a disturbing and very bad movie.The story takes place in Spain in the year 1944, a few years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Franquist period. The character Captain Vidal is so tyrannical and brutal that he deserves his comeuppance, but his men aren't any better than him.As for the characters that belong to the fantasy part of the movie, I liked the stick insects, the fairies and the mandrake. But the Faun annoyed me. Not only he looked repulsive and was irritating, but also his disturbing intentions about the baby were alarming. The Pale Man was so grotesque and disgusting that words are incapable to describe how much that thing disgusts me.And this movie is as acclaimed as it is? And is considered one of the best foreign movies and even is on Top 250? I'm shocked. I'll never watch this again!",3,17,34,13 August 2010
The Polar Express," This movie is a Christmas gift
","'The Polar Express' is a magical and distinguish animated film directed by the great Robert Zemeckis.This is a different kind of animated movie because it looks almost real (mostly the characters and the sceneries). No wonder it looks so realistic because, after all, it is entirely live action using performance capture technology. As a consequence, the graphics are amazing and the movie is technically admirable. Plus, the visuals/sceneries/backgrounds are terrific, the special effects are amazing, the magic is naturally present, the Christmas carols are nice and catchy and the movie has lots of adventure, strong emotions and suspense. A formidable combination of loud sounds is another quality. Definitely approved.'The Polar Express' is also a remarkable film for Tom Hanks's career. He plays 5 different roles in this movie (the Hero Boy, the conductor, the Hobo, Santa Claus and the Hero Boy's father). By the way, the conductor really looks like Tom Hanks, except that the conductor has a mustache and is bald. Anyway, as I was saying, if it's already admirable to see an actor playing 5 roles, even more incredible is when that actor is Tom Hanks. Usually I find Tom Hanks a weak actor, but he is very good here.This is, without a doubt, one of the finest Christmas's films ever made. Has everything to become a classic. Remember when we all used to believe in Christmas's magic and in Jolly Old Saint Nicholas? This movie brings us back this special Christmas spirit and some of the best memories from childhood. It even makes us want to believe again and hear the soft sound of the silver bell.A curious and original detail about this motion picture it that most of the characters's names aren't mentioned, except for Billy and Sarah. I'd like to talk a bit about the characters.First of all, the Hero Boy. He wants to believe in Christmas's magic and it's admirable how he ends up believing in Santa and all of the Christmas's magic. He is a nice and interesting character.The Hero Girl also adds a lot to this movie. Not only is she a sweet character, but above all things she befriends with the Hero Boy and Billy, helping them to restore their faith on Christmas.Billy is a gloomy and shy little boy who believes that he is «the little boy that Santa Claus forgot» and he has serious difficulties to trust on Christmas's magic at first... but the Hero Girl and the Hero Boy help him through this journey.'Know-it-all' is the typical intellectual boy. He is wise, smart and intelligent, but nerdy, funny, very talkative (he speaks very quickly too), impatient and he can be a little boring at times. But even this character changes his attitudes. By the end, he becomes more calm, patient and 'humble'.The Conductor has amazing talents with the tickets. He writes words on them without even looking at them. Simply amazing!The Hobo is a mysterious and enigmatic character. He does have a great sense of humor and he is also one of the heroes in this Christmas's tale.'The Polar Express' isn't an absolutely perfect film. Its negative side (from my point of view) includes the two engineers who happen to be ridiculous characters. Besides, I don't see what's the point of that Aerosmith's song and Steven Tyler's presence in a Christmas story (at least it's only for a brief moment). The Santa Claus looks okay, but a little... artificial? Could be a little better. But, overall, this is a wonderful movie. It's the movie of the year 2004.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9,4,7,16 December 2007
Empire of the Sun," There's some good and some bad about this movie...
","Humm... this is a difficult to rate one. I'm not sure how should I rate it. It's a movie that creates mixed feelings on me. Although this is not bad for a war movie, I feel it could have been way better. I feel that the movie had potential to be solid, but ended up being only okay. But I don't want anybody to think I'm writing in Chinese, so let me explain my point.The movie has an expressive story, a great soundtrack (for example, that beautiful 'Suo Gan' theme), an amazing performance by a young Christian Bale, some of the most incredible scenes with planes ever put in a film (at least on this point it is perfect) and the movie is quite good during the first hour.However, from the second half on, the movie begins to lose its initial greatness: it focus too much on the killing fields and the story (even the movie itself) loses its interest. There are still some wonderful scenes with planes in this second half of the movie and fabulous special effects (a visually stunning experience), but just that isn't enough to save it.Christian Bale, like I said, is outstanding in this film. He portrays in perfection Jamie Graham, a very lively and talkative young English boy fascinated by planes (to the point of wishing to pilot one and even calling them «P-51, the Cadillac of the sky») and fan of the Japanese pilots's bravery.Jamie is a likable chap. However, Dainty, Frank and Basie are quite annoying. Plus, the fact that Ben Stiller is in the movie already seals the movie's fate a bit (even if his role is minor). Ben Stiller is one of the most ridiculous actors of all times.This isn't one of the most violent war movies, but still there are some brutal scenes, such as Jamie's Asian friend being unfairly killed.So, a reasonable movie and decent Spielberg film. But not one of his best and not one of his worst by any means.",7,2,7,1 March 2008
Bridget Jones's Diary," Another good example of British humor
","'Bridget Jones's Diary' is another okay romantic comedy with British humor. It is neither a great movie neither a bad movie. Just acceptable and watchable, but without bad surprises.This movie is in the same line as other British romantic comedies such as 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Notting Hill', which wouldn't be surprising (considering they are all from the same producers and they all star Hugh Grant). I personally consider this neither better neither worst than those two movies that I mentioned.Nevertheless, it's a reasonably entertaining movie with its fun. Its most positive points are: a good soundtrack ('All By Myself', 'Respect', 'Out of Reach' and 'It's Raining Men'), some beautiful landscapes of England, the British humor (despite some offensive lines), the blue soup made by Bridget Jones (I wonder how that soup tastes like) and a hilarious fight between the characters Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.I also like the way how Renée Zellweger portrays Bridget Jones. Not that she is really great, but she's funny in the way she portrays this silly character. Hugh Grant is cool with this performance as the charming 'playboy' Daniel Cleaver. But this isn't exactly a movie that I would want to add in my film collection.Overall, a funny movie and a full plate for any fan of the peculiar British sense of humor. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys British comedies. As long as it is not taken too seriously, this movie can be easy to enjoy.",7,0,0,13 April 2008
Notting Hill," The peculiar British humor
","It really doesn't matter if 'Notting Hill' is taken too seriously or not. It is an okay romantic comedy. I mean, without being a great movie, at least this is entertaining enough and something that can be watched without much bad surprises. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor, unlike 'Frankie and Johnny' and 'There's Something About Mary', which makes this a much more intelligent movie.'Notting Hill' is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Bridget Jones Diary', which makes it a good alternative to these movies.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great. Hugh Grant does a great job as William Thacker, as well as the guy who plays Max. However, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations for the actor who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role.Julia Roberts, on the other, is okay as Anna Scott but not exactly great. I don't sympathize very much with the character she plays here. I mean, she only goes to William when is convenient for her, she uses him, leaves him and does other things that break his heart. They shouldn't have stayed together at the end, because she doesn't deserve him. I know, it's just a movie, but I feel bad for William, he deserves someone much better than Anna Scott.Overall, a movie which is nothing spectacular or to be taken very seriously, but made just for fun. And it has a nice soundtrack too.",7,5,9,9 March 2008
Léon: The Professional," Good for an action film
","Although this might seem just another movie which everything happens in America, it was however directed by a french director (Luc Besson). Plus, Jean Reno's accent is clearly french (yet his character's name - Leon - sounds Italian or even Spanish).This film is also known by the alternative title 'Leon: The Professional'. Its title obviously refers to the film's main character: Leon, a professional hit-man (or 'cleaner', as he says). Leon is a different kind of hit-man: he does his daily life like a normal person in some ways, he lives all alone, he enjoys watching Gene Kelly's musicals and at the same time he is eccentric to the point of having a houseplant as his best friend (LOL!).Leon, despite being a criminal, is actually pretty cool and likable. Besides, his french accent is cool and his voice is nothing of what you might think. The way he talks is usually very calm and cool and he rarely speaks aggressively.The movie takes place in Little Italy, an area in New York City. The modern scenario is one of its qualities and certain angles of view are exceptionally well filmed, which contributes for a nice visual experience.As a movie, it is so modern even now and it shows how messed up this world really is.This was Natalie Portman's feature film debut in the role of Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl from a dysfunctional family and already smoking cigarettes. She and Leon are actually neighbors. But soon Mathilda's entire family is shot to death, including her much beloved 4-year-old brother. They don't actually show her brother being shot (likely for obvious reasons), but still it's horrible to know that that cute and loving little kid is murdered. That is, without a doubt, the saddest and most horrifying part of the film.Mathilda is the only survivor because she was out shopping when it happened. Mathilda then seeks sanctuary on Leon. She soon finds out what he does for a living, however begs him to take care of her and protect her, as well as to teach her how to be like him (a 'cleaner'), so that she can avenge the murder of her little brother.Mathilda even falls in love with Leon, but he doesn't feel the same way about her, so nobody can say that this movie deals with a certain inappropriate subject. On this, however, Mathilda's behavior is questionable and inappropriate at times.Too bad that Leon dies in the end. But on the positive side, the bad guys are killed as well. The song at the end (Sting's 'Shape of my Heart') is a good song.Natalie Portman and Jean Reno have good performances. Natalie Portman, here as a younger girl, has a haircut that I just don't like at all. But she already had all the traces of a young girl who was gonna grown into a hot woman. Gary Oldman's performance was awful and his character was so annoying and so devilish that I kept wanting him to be brutally 'cleaned' by Leon or Mathilda.So, in conclusion, an interesting and intriguing action film, one of the best of its kind, but long and somehow overvalued. It also deals with serious subjects, such as corruption, crime, violence and revenge. There is also brutal violence in this.",7,3,7,5 September 2010
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Goooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!
","I've been trying to watch this movie for ages without any success. I heard that Robin Williams makes wonders in this film. Finally I managed to watch this movie, now that the new year has arrived.The movie itself is okay, although in many ways better than I expected. But indeed Robin Williams is pure genius in this one! This is one of his very best performances, along with 'Dead Poets Society', 'Hook', 'Aladdin', 'A.I.' and 'Popeye'.Set in Saigon during the Vietnam War, this is also a war movie. It's not entirely comedy. Robin Williams also does a great job in drama here, but it's his comedy skills that really make him shine. This is Robin Williams at his best! Robin portrays Adrian Cronauer, a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio Service who greatly amuses the troops serving in South Vietnam but angers his superiors with his irreverence (they don't have any sense of humor, really - or they're envious of him). But, unlike Robin's character, the real Adrian wasn't that funny.Robin is hysterical whenever he is on the air: he makes voices (typically Robin), he mixes unusual humor with news updates... and I loved it whenever he starts his show by yelling «Gooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!», as well as whenever he pretends to be a teacher.Robin also puts nice music in this film, such as Beach Boys, James Brown's 'I Feel Good' and Louis Armstrong's 'What a Wonderful World'. There are some errors of dates, though. The movie takes place in 1965 and the song 'What a Wonderful World' came out in 1967. But that detail is not to be taken very seriously.Trinh, the Thai girl, is quite pretty. Whoever is the actress who portrayed this character, she did a good job.Overall, a reasonable film without being great. It is particularly worthy for Robin Williams's genial humor which takes this movie far. Robin was so fun in this movie.",7,1,1,2 January 2010
Grease," Is this supposed to be funny??
","How such a mediocre movie like 'Grease' can be considered a classic and loved by so many people is beyond me.Sure, everybody's got their own tastes and I respect that, but seriously what's so special about this movie? For me, this is nothing more than a mediocre movie full of cheap humor and bad messages. How can this be still such a hit after all these years?? The best thing about this movie is the brilliant soundtrack. The songs are classics, not the movie. Songs such as 'Greased Lightning', 'Sandy', 'You're The One That I Want', 'Summer Nights' and the opening song are great and timeless, not the movie.Apart the music, there are very little good things about this movie. For example: the romantic beginning with Danny Zuko and Sandy on a beach during the sunset time, exchanging love promises.What else? The original opening credits (with bizarre cartoons and a cool song), the 'drive-in' sequence and every part with those wonderful songs.The characters are, most of them, annoying. The T-Birds are the most irritating characters of the movie, except Danny Zuko (the only T-Bird who isn't annoying). About the girl characters, only Sandy isn't annoying. Of all the things that anger me in this movie, what angers me most is its dirty humor which is absolutely irritating... not to mention about the 'message' of it.Plus, one of the things that made me cringe most is that the women in the movie say that «All men are rats» and then they say something even worst «They're the fleas of rats». I am a guy and I find that an extremely offensive and insulting observation. That is not a nice thing to say.The ending is somehow too childish, surreal and ridiculous. What was the point of putting a car flying?? Not to mention incredibly long... after too much nonsense, that's when the flying car comes.John Travolta is great as Danny Zuko and so is Olivia Newton-John in the role of Sandy Olsen.Overall, it is a movie to forget and it doesn't deserve all the attention it gets. Anyway, this is just my opinion. I don't want to get into fights because of this...",5,3,7,29 August 2007
The Orphanage," Very intriguing
","The key to this movie's success is on the proverbial simplicity. More than a terror film, it is more of a drama, a sad and devastating story that can impress. The terror is masterfully used here, not only because it really frightens when it's meant to but also because the terror is genuine, avoiding the use of cheap terror and sophisticated digital tricks.There have been comparisons with 'The Changeling' (1980) and 'Poltergeist' (1982). This and 'The Changeling' have slight similarities in details, but nothing major. As for 'Poltergeist', frankly I don't see much where to compare them. Yes, they are both about ghosts, but I can't say they are similar just because they have ghosts.'El Orfanato' is a great movie on its own. It is clearly one of the best movies of the year 2007 and one of the best from the 2000-2009 decade. Considering that this generation brought some but very few really good movies, I highly doubt the current decade will bring many worthy films, although we can always give the benefit of doubt.I got to know that Hollywood plans to remake this valuable Spanish piece of cinema. Can't say that I'm surprised. Hollywood stubbornly insists on remaking films. Stealing the others's works must give them pleasure, so that they can claim it as their own when we who know the truth know what the truth is.This should definitely be on Top 250.",10,7,10,29 September 2011
The Shining," Strange, bizarre, freaky stuff and... REDRUM = MURDER
","This is typically Kubrick weirdness. Difficult to rate. Nowhere near as confusing as '2001' but some elements from that one can be found here. Then again, Kubrick's typical treats.'The Shining' is a bit of a test to patience, being long and slow. But if you have no problem with that, that's not a reason why it shouldn't please you. If you like Kubrick's cinema and weird films, then this is one film for you.It's interesting but hardly really good. There is some disturbing and gross content, as well as some takes which are too long and boring. When it comes to mystery, weirdness, suspense, tension and terror, it shines like its title.After seeing this I finally understood what Richard Dreyfuss meant by saying that Jack Nicholson is too crazy. And he is particularly crazy on this one. Have you seen Jack Nicholson when he gets angry? Boy, he sure is scary when he gets mad! That's what happens with his character Jack Torrance, whose transformation is notorious with strange and even aggressive behaviors and other insanity symptoms. He goes as far as attempting to murder his own wife and child with an axe! More than simply playing the character, he becomes the character. And his face in the famous sequence when he sticks his face through the door he broke with his axe and yells «Here's Johnny!» is crazy! He almost looks like a werewolf in that particular scene, becoming almost unrecognizable. Jack Nicholson is formidable in this role.Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy. She deserves all the praise from us. She worked really hard for this role and went through a lot of stress during filming. She successfully manages to stay away from her 'Olive Oyl' image and honestly people should see her as a very capable actress and not just as 'Olive Oyl'.And finally, the kid is cute and amazingly played by Danny Lloyd. His performance is so realistic and believable that it's as if he becomes the character himself. Such a difficult role for a child to play, but he is so good that he makes it seem so easy.The ending is bad. After all of that, it simply shows pictures? That's it??",6,0,2,4 February 2011
Being John Malkovich," Wow! What is this mess?
","I'm gonna be very, very frank: I hated this movie. I don't get all the praise towards it. It's an original film, but one of those which the difference doesn't bring good results. I didn't like it the slighest bit. In fact, there wasn't a single moment I liked. It was incredibly dull and dumb.Lots of things don't fit well (if anything fits well in it at all). For example, what was that goofyness of the ceilings being SO lowheight in that job, forcing its workers to duck the whole time? Another thing I noticed on that job was that the woman who interviewed Craig misunderstood every little thing he said and even claimed a few times that she didn't know what he was talking about. It also doesn't make sense that Dr. Lester kept insisting that he talked poorly, that people had a hard time to understand what he says - when he speaks perfectly well. Plus, he said he was 105 years old. I don't believe it! Yes, he was an old man, but he couldn't possibly be that old! Not even close to that!None of the characters were minimally captivating or interesting. Craig himself seemed to become something like a nutcase through the film's course. Besides, that ridiculous and alarming obsession of people in wanting to be John Malkovich... including Lotte (Craig's wife), who even wanted to go as far as becoming a transsexual (give me a break!!!) - even if she didn't get to do it.Everything in this joke of a movie was insane and ridiculous. The fact that the other woman manipulates Malkovich to make love with Craig and Lotte when they were inside him (and the way he was controlled by Craig). The fact that in the end Malkovich gets rid of all that mess only to be possessed again by numerous people who completely dominate him - and the portal is never destroyed! Malkovich even goes inside himself to one point. And what he sees is hundreds of Malkovichs! They're everywhere! Constantly hearing John Malkovich's name bored me to death. I got pretty tired of listening to his name all the time. Plus, why is this movie about being John Malkovich and not someone more interesting? For example, like George Clooney? The entire scenario looks awful and so lifeless. As for Cameron Diaz, if I didn't already know she was in the film I probably wouldn't recognize her. It was quite a shock to see the beautiful Cameron Diaz (the gorgeous and super sexy Tina Carlyle from 'The Mask' - a movie that I like very much) like this: really ugly, the combination of that awful freezy hair with that awful color and those more than horrible clothes. All of this made her look almost like a witch. The character she portrayed wasn't likable either. Plus, her performance was very poor (just like everyone else in the film).Everyone in the film thinks that Malkovich was in a jewel thief movie. As far as I know, he was never in a jewel thief movie before this. Ironically, he was in 'Johnny English' (2003), which is a jewel thief movie - and his character, Pascal Sauvage, was involved in it until his neck.In conclusion, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",2,3,7,20 October 2010
The Machinist," To see Christian Bale like this is a major shock
","'The Machinist' (or 'El maquinista', its alternative title) is a Spanish film in English language. It is a strong psychological movie, a movie of extremely moody nature and one that is difficult to digest for some.Christian Bale portrays Trevor Reznik, the title character. Trevor has had chronic insomnia for a year and a drastic loss of weight. The results of this are very visible: his corpse-like appearance, his puzzling behavior, his impossibility of concentration, his insanity and his obsession on the idea that every bizarre event in his life is purposely meant to drive him nuts.The film is extremely weird and bizarre. Plus, it is clearly one of (more than dark) sinister nature. Not just for the story and the bizarre stuff, but also for the extremely dark backgrounds/sceneries that only accent this feeling of creepiness.For this role, Christian Bale went through a brutal loss of weight as a personal decision. To achieve that, he went on a radical diet for something like 4 months. Actually, he wanted to lose even more weight, but the filmmakers didn't allow that because of concerns related to health. He is unrecognizable in this film. Who would say that this is the kid from 'Empire of the Sun'? I sincerely think it's crazy that he subjected himself to this, not only damaging his health but also exposing his health and life to serious risks. That is so dangerous! It's incredible what people do for money...Until I watched this movie, I had never heard of it and didn't know what was it about. I got to see it because a friend of mine has the DVD and he loaned me.",4,1,3,14 July 2010
Control," It's like a rabbit coming off the hat
","This film is a surprise for being in black and white. I didn't know that they still make films in black and white. A movie from the year 2007 in black and white is very unusual. In fact, considering that nowadays's youth (and even many more grown up people) doesn't like to watch old movies (even lesser if they're in black and white), I am surprised that this was even made like this and even more with its success.That said, it's time to talk about the movie in question. I watched it without knowing anything about it. In fact, once I realized it was in black and white, I thought it was a very old film, but I didn't take long to realize it wasn't old at all. The way it is made is anything but old.My best friend loaned me the film. I have to admit that I knew nothing about the musician (Ian Curtis) and the band (Joy Division) in question. But with this film and later some research, I got to learn. To make a judgement on this band's type of music, they're very much like The Doors (Jim Morrison's band).This movie is simply a biography of the singer and band in question, focusing on Ian Curtis's life between 1973 and 1980 (the year of his death). It deals mostly with his many personal problems, his marriage to Deborah (and a bit, but very little, on his baby's birth), the birth and rise of Joy Division, his epilepsy issue and his love affair with Annik, and his self-homicide (that is, his suicide). It closes with the words «Ian Curtis died May 18, 1980. He was 23 years old». The film's title comes from a Joy Division song, 'She's Lost Control'.Is it a good movie? Well, this is a rather complicated film to judge, as it often happens with biographical films (of course, I am speaking for myself).",7,1,1,21 October 2010
The Exorcist," One of the scariest movie experiences ever
","'The Exorcist' is often considered a landmark when it comes to horror films. I only saw it once and one was enough. I was never very much into horror films, but there was a time when I still had some curiosity in watching some horror films.'The Exorcist' isn't totally scary, but it contains some of the most frightening scenes ever made in a motion picture. This is *not* a pleasant movie: it is shocking, deeply disturbing, brutal and can be uncomfortable to watch. People should beware of this, especially the most sensitive ones and those who get easily impressed.I guess that this movie is so generally praised by critics and people all around the world because it was probably one of the first movies of its kind, along with perhaps 'Rosemary's Baby'. Nowadays's terror films are not as praised as this, for example, except maybe for teens but even teens don't always praise them forever, I suppose.Anyway, I didn't like this movie at all. Not that I get easily impressed with this kind of movies, but it just is too strong and disturbing for my tastes.",2,4,15,12 January 2008
Gandhi," A biographical film that took decades to come true
","'Gandhi' is based on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's life (or simply Mahatma Gandhi), the tolerant man who wanted to make the world a friendlier place with his non-violent ways. How faithful the movie is to his biography, that seems to create mixed opinions. I will not go into that.This movie was directed by Richard Attenborough. Not only had this movie project been his dream, but also many years before it was made there had been 2 failed attempts to make it. Filming occurred between November 1980 and May 1981 but the movie wasn't released until 1982. It also happens to be an Indian British co-production.Ben Kingsley stars as Gandhi and he looks similar to him in this film. Ben Kingsley is partly of Indian heritage and his real name is actually Krishna Bhanji. So it wasn't all that necessary to select an Indian actor, even though they could have done that.I tend to avoid movies which are longer than 2 hours and a half. But I watched this one, thanks to a friend of mine who kept suggesting me to watch it. So I did it. But to avoid the experience from becoming too tiring, I watched about half of the movie first and watched the rest a few hours later. The movie seemed to become slower and I became more bored with it when I watched the rest of it, it just never seemed to end. Imagine if I had seen the whole thing without interruptions...It's nicely filmed and has a number of beautiful settings and backgrounds, but just that isn't enough to make a great movie. With all due respect for its fans, this ain't my type of movie. It's not that bad, but...Something curious was that this movie has an intermission that lasts about 2 minutes, somewhere near the 90th minute, just like in the film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Plus, the actress Candice Bergen, who portrays the character Margaret Bourke-White, is amazingly Kathleen Turner look-a-like. I even though it was her.",6,3,5,14 August 2010
Mamma Mia!," Nothing special
","Once I began to hear that they were going to do a movie named 'Mamma Mia' and that its soundtrack would consist mostly in ABBA's songs, I was curious to see what would it be like. I am one of the greatest fans of ABBA and thought that this would be a biographical movie. While watching the movie, I realized this is no biography at all. Instead, this is a movie adaptation of the stage musical 'Mamma Mia' based on ABBA's songs, which opened in 1999. Until I found out about that, I even though that this was probably a story about fans of ABBA, people that liked their songs, so they sang it.I never saw the stage musical in question, but I found the movie silly and mediocre. It's not all that bad comparing to most movies of this generation, but it's not my tea cup either. The movie itself is kinda pathetic. Plus, I think they should have made a biographical movie about ABBA. That would have been a more interesting idea for me and possibly for many ABBA's fans around the world. True, there's always the Internet to search for information about ABBA or any other musical band. Even if I have an idea about ABBA's story, I still think it would be interesting to see a biographical film of them. Something like they did with Ritchie Valens in the 1987 film 'La Bamba', for example.The movie's cast includes Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Amanda Seyfried, for example. No one is especially great in their performances, both as actors and as singers. Not even the overrated Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, Amanda Seyfried is very pretty in this.The story takes place in a Greek island named Skopelos. The Greek scenario is beautiful and quite exotic. There are also some great vistas of the immense sea and the Greek island itself.As for the soundtrack, there is a reasonable number of ABBA's songs. Many of these new versions aren't bad but they're far from being great. They just don't hold a candle for the original versions. The original versions are timeless classics and there will never be anything like them.But, back to the movie, in these new versions they seem to transform some of ABBA's saddest songs into jolly songs, which is a bit strange. Not to mention that they made minor changes in the lyrics of some songs. Any ABBA fan who grew up with their songs notices that.Strange that Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus themselves are two of the executive producers of this movie. Even the actor Tom Hanks is one of the executive producers. Well, it doesn't matter. This is not a worthy movie.",5,2,5,28 December 2008
Liar Liar," One of Jim Carrey's funniest movies
","This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are few movies as humorous as this one, being 'Mousehunt' one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.Every minute of 'Liar Liar' is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.The story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks, it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus, seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!The actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede, but there are other equally good actors, like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede, Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max (Fletcher's son). Max is also referred to as 'Maximillian' and 'Monster Max' by his father, who loves to do 'The Claw' much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in 'Pete's Dragon', with that face and long hair.At my point of view, 'Liar Liar' has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.Directed by Tom Shadyac, 'Liar Liar' is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later 'Bruce Almighty'.",7,43,52,21 August 2007
The Pianist," A powerful film
","'The Pianist' is among the most regarded and praised movies about the Holocaust. It's a powerful, realistic and shocking movie, like 'Schindler's List'. However, it is shot in colors and it isn't 3 hours long, unlike that one. Besides, it was directed by Roman Polanski.Although this is a war movie (a type of film which I don't appreciate), there are two things that I liked very much about this: the soft, relaxing and beautiful sound of piano and Adrien Brody's performance (which is incredible and absolutely amazing) as the Jewish polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It's not wrong to say that this is just another Holocaust film. That is one way to see things. But we can see things in a different way instead. Each war movie deals with the same basic subject, but each one has its own characteristics. For example, 'La Vitta è Bella' focus on a character with great humor and colorful imagination. 'Empire of the Sun' is about a boy fascinated by planes and the war in China and Japan (Pearl Harbor). 'Schindler's List' is about a German who saves thousands of lives. 'The Pianist' is about a genial musician. 'Edges of the Lord' is about a Jewish little boy who is a fugitive to escape from a fatal destiny. And I could go on forever...Overall, a reasonable film, but not very recommendable for those who are not into this subject.",7,0,0,9 December 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Quite bad, frankly
","First off, why isn't movie called 'Jurassic Park 2' or 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' instead of 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'? Why invert the positions? The result is a strange title...Well, this is quite a crummy follow-up to the great original film. I cannot give it much praise. I didn't like it, it was simply not in the same league of the original. I thought its action was often over the top and the story left much to be desired. The cinematography was crude most of the time, even though it still had some nice cinematography but not on the same level as the original. Also, I felt that Alan Grant was greatly missed on this one. The idea of Ian Malcolm having a much bigger role in this one was very bad. Also, Ian Malcolm was more bitter in this film (he is funnier in this original). Malcolm's girlfriend wasn't very appealing to me either. I prefer Dr. Ellie Sattler from the original. And how come Malcolm has a fully black daughter? Being Malcolm a white man, that doesn't make sense, unless she was adopted. That is one of the many unanswered questions in this motion-picture. I disliked many of the characters. There were too many characters and too many annoying ones. Another thing that disappointed me is that Tim and Lex only have a very minor role and then they just disappear like that. They only appear about 20 seconds. I would have liked them to have a bigger role, even if not as big as they have in the original.Speaking of Tim and Lex, they run to Malcolm and give him a big hug. He doesn't really spend time with them in the original, so it would make more sense if Alan Grant was in this movie and he was the one the kids ran to and hugged. After all, he was the one who spent time with them in the original and rescued them.The people who went to the new dinosaur island seemed more stupid. They seemed to just want to challenge the dinosaurs. At least in the original it was something that went awfully wrong. But here they already knew about the events 4 years before. The little dinosaurs bugged me: they were too many and too dull and served no purpose at all.The lines were nothing special, but I did like Malcolm's line «Mommy is very angry». That was the best line.This is far more violent and gory than the original. The scene when a T-Rex throws a hinged trailer over a cliff is extremely tense. It's an attempt to repeat the formula of the original's famous scene of the jeep being attacked.At least in one thing this sequel is comparable to the original: the amazingness of the dinosaurs (how great and real they look and their awesome roars and impeccable animation).",4,2,8,12 March 2011
Cars," Ka-chow!
","'Cars' is the right movie to watch whenever one feels the need for speed. I'm not really into CGI films, but at least this one is much better than other CGI productions. It's fun to watch. Unlike most CGI films with annoying humor, weird and awfully designed characters and often weak visuals, this one has brilliant graphics, funny and clever humor and some great visuals.A very creative, imaginative, original, funny and interesting detail is that the eyes of this film's anthropomorphic cars are placed on the windshield. Plus, the cars have mouth and teeth.This is Pixar's greatest achievement. Pixar has never done anything like this before or after.The way how the story is made is funny and entertaining. Many hilarious quotes can be found in this movie, especially from Lightning McQueen and Mater. Mater's jokes combined with Lightning McQueen's sarcastic humor results in a real scream and a full plate.Lightning McQueen is hilarious: overconfident, arrogant, talkative, sarcastic and snobbish. He is also selfish, especially towards his pit crew. But I like this rookie race car exactly like that. After becoming kind, he's not as funny. Also, I like his original race car look better than the changes he makes later in Radiator Springs, which make him look much more conservative, something like a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette. But, focusing only on his race car appearance, he seems to be a mix of a Dodge Viper, a Ford GT40, a Lamborghini Miura, a Ferrari 250 GTO and a Mazda RX-8.His name seems to be a reference to Steve McQueen, who was a fan of cars and speed. Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen's voice. Others do great voice jobs as well, especially Larry The Cable Guy as Mater and Paul Newman as Doc Hudson.Other cars include Doc Hudson (a Hudson Hornet of the original model - to be more specific, the Fabulous Hudson Hornet), Mater (a rusty old wreck), The King (a Plymouth Superbird), Luigi (a Fiat 500), Guido (a forklift which resembles an Isetta), Lizzie (an ancient Ford Model T) and Mack (a humorous Mack Super-Liner lorry). All of them are great characters and even Bessie is... if that counts, LOL. Mater is like 'Tow Mater' but without the 'Tow'.Chick Hicks is the only character I don't like and even hate. He is vindictive, obnoxious and nasty. He is very greedy and actually way more selfish than Lightning McQueen. Although Lightning McQueen is what he is, at least he never rams any car and he'd never do that, unlike Chick Hicks who purposely rams all the cars in his way and causes them terrible accidents (including The King). He hates both The King and Lightning McQueen and yet copies Lightning McQueen's jokes.When it comes to visuals, they can be easily described as real-looking, fresh and modern but done with high standards of quality comparing to most many terrible CGI creations. Visually, the best part is the beginning: the electrifying and powerful noise of the racing cars's engines, the cars running in a big track and amazing race, the fabulous and realistic sceneries (with sparkling lights and entire crowds of cars watching), great music...The soundtrack is not brilliant but the opening song is pretty cool, as well as the song 'Life is a highway'.",7,4,7,17 July 2007
The Little Mermaid," A triumphant Disney gem
","The 28th animated Disney classic is said to be responsible for Disney's renaissance after a dark period during the 1980's decade. Back then Disney was in a delicate situation. I wonder what would have happened to Disney if 'The Little Mermaid' hadn't been made or if it hadn't been a success.'The Little Mermaid' is one of the greatest animated films from Disney. It has fine artwork and palette colors, classic humor, adventure, darkness, great animation, awesome songs, enjoyable characters, romance... in other words, the crucial gradients that make Disney classics. Some mythology is here either, considering it's a movie about merpeople.The soundtrack is fresh, with jaunty songs such as 'Under the Sea' and 'Les Poissons', the romantic song 'Kiss the Girl' and the somewhat sad song 'Part of your world'. Even Ursula's song, 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', is good.As for the characters, the goofy seagull Scuttle and the Chef Louis can be perfectly considered a comic relief, although Sebastian is often hilarious too, especially in the kitchen where Chef Louis is (Sebastian's facial expressions of horror and panic are priceless).Scuttle has a comical way to teach things about human artifacts and respective cultures. For example, he refers to a fork as a 'dinglehopper' and says that it is used as a comb. He also calls a smoking pipe a 'snarfblatt', telling it is used to play music as if it was a trumpet. Scuttle also sings terribly, but he sings much better than many self-claimed artists in the world of music. Although goofy, Scuttle is smarter than he seems. He discovers, for example, the true identity of 'Vanessa' and he does a hilarious destruction of the wedding (with the help of other birds and animals).Prince Eric is one of Disney's coolest and most charming princes. He's handsome too. Grimsby is funny at times. Ariel is a pretty mermaid and she looks even better as human. Ariel is one of my favorite Disney princesses, for her sexy looks and feminine personality. Ursula, the evil sea witch, is one of Disney's biggest villains and one of the most eccentric too. Max, Eric's Old English Sheepdog, is a cute fellow.I wonder what kind of fish Flounder is. Maybe he is not a particular kind of fish. Perhaps he was just drawn that way, fruit of the artists's imagination. He is a cute little fish, friendly and cool. He is also very nervous, shy and gets frightened easily.I don't know where or when this movie takes place, but I suppose it is somewhere in Denmark.As for the cast, there are many talented voices here: the inimitable comedian Buddy Hackett aka 'Tennessee Steinmetz', Ben Wright, Rene Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Jason Marin, Samuel E. Wright, Kenneth Mars and Pat Carroll.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9,3,4,7 July 2007
JFK," An endless movie
","'JFK' is without a doubt the longest film I've ever seen. My goodness, it is extremely long! I mean, more than 3 hours! Even longer than 'Titanic'! It's too much and very tiring! Not to mention that the Director's Cut version is even longer...Can't say that I liked this movie, but I also can't say that I disliked it. This movie is based on a real story: the assassination of the President John F. Kennedy in 22nd November 1963. It shows us the events that have lead to this tragedy and the conspiracy to murder the President.This movie is very realistic not only because it is based on a true story but also because it uses real images of the President's assassination captured in that fatal day.This film is recommendable for those who want to know more things about the President's assassination, a mystery which still wasn't 100% solved even nowadays.Surprisingly the actors John Candy and Walter Matthau appear in this movie. I can't remember about Walt, but John Candy's role was minor. Now about Kevin Costner, he's very good in this role (Jim Garrison). This is, without a doubt, one of his best performances ever - if not his best.What I liked most about this film is its realism and the way how the controversial director Oliver Stone recreates this tragic story, as well as Kevin Costner's performance. But this isn't enough to give it a higher rating. This movie is very slow, tiring, too long and boring in many parts.",6,1,22,20 October 2007
Schindler's List," A deep vision about the Holocaust
","From what I see, most people seem to like this movie very much. I'm not criticizing them. It's just that I don't like war movies, so I don't understand how can anyone like them.First of all, before watching this movie I thought a lot if I should do it or not. It wasn't only because this is a war film, but also because it is shot in black & white and especially because it is 3 hours long.I knew that this would be another Holocaust movie, but this one has something different which made me wanna give it a try: a Nazi named Oskar Schindler saved almost 1200 jews during the Holocaust. I thought that was incredible. I also know that this is based on a real story, which makes this somehow a biographical motion picture.In fact, yes, it's admirable the hero that Oskar Schindler became by saving nearly 1200 lives. That's what happens by the end of the movie, probably the most emotional and powerful part of the film. Oskar Schindler even wished he could have saved much more lives, which is perfectly understandable. His emotions are particularly very well shown in this part.Liam Neeson does a great job and steals the show by portraying the German hero Oskar Schindler.'Schindler's List' is Steven Spielberg's most serious movie ever. It shows us a very realistic foresight of what the Holocaust was: the cruelty of the Nazis, the killing fields, the war, the destruction of everything, how thousands of jews's lives were taken and much more. It is a shocking film and the fact that this is shot in black & white increases this painful environment. Even so, considering that this is a war movie, it isn't one of the most violent.However, this is a film that requires lots and lots of patience. It is a slow and very long movie which might very well take one to the limits of his/her patience, especially for those who don't like this kind of movies or aren't interested in these subjects.There's something else I'd like to talk about. Why does every single movie about the Holocaust has to win Academy Oscars? I mean, every single movie that comes out about the Holocaust is regarded with a rain of Oscars. I understand somehow that they do that, but is it all that necessary to exaggerate?",6,3,8,9 December 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," A strong movie done in a minimalist philosophy
","'Dog Day Afternoon' is an example of how a simple story can make a movie.Although the entire movie is about a bank robbery in Brooklyn (in the year of 1972) and despite almost the whole movie taking place inside a bank, it is involving and entertaining. This is a crime movie which is also a thriller. Besides, it is thrilling, intense, very energetic, dramatic and full of tension. There's also lots of language, particularly the 'F' word. The movie is often hilarious in many ways too. It has very funny lines and comical moments, such as when Sal thinks that Wyoming is a country. Even the most tense and intense sequences full of screams are made in a hilarious way. The title makes perfect sense: it really is a dog day afternoon for everyone in the whole story.Solid performances by the actors is another strength. A young Al Pacino gives an extremely energetic and amazing performance as Sonny Wortzik, the leader of the bank robbery. John Cazale doesn't talk much but he is excellent as Sonny's crime partner Sal. A funny fact is that the actor who plays Sheldon (James Broderick) looks like George W. Bush. Charles Durning plays Detective Moretti, another interesting character.Sonny is one of the most interesting robber characters ever. Although he is a criminal, he's actually quite kind to the hostages (despite his use of language): he gives them what they need when they need something and he helps them when they need help in something. And his screams are incredible, as well as his funny facial expressions and his lines. We end up liking him. Sonny also makes a reference to the Attica scandal. He even calls 'squirrel' to one of the women in the bank.Aside the opening song 'Amoreena' by Elton John, there is no soundtrack at all in this film. Also, the opening credits have little to do with the rest of the movie. They show lots of places and activities in New York city, probably to show that the story takes place in a hot Summer day (a dog day afternoon).The best Al Pacino's movie I've seen so far and clearly better than the 1997 remake 'Mad City' with John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman.",7,2,3,20 March 2008
Cars 2," Silly, very silly
","The original 'Cars' was okay. An innovative, fresh, humorous and peculiar approach on an animated movie. Although with flaws, at least it had some soul and character.This one? No way! Let me start by saying that the animation is excellent combined with even more complex and 'ambitious' scenarios than the original's (more light and more color too) but both the plot and the humor fail miserably. One of the many problems of this movie is the fact that it takes place in many countries. Stories set in several places around the world just don't work (see the case of 'Love Actually'!). I gotta admit, there are awesome sceneries of Japan and Italy, but in London they made the Big Ben look so phony. I wonder if they did that intentionally? Perhaps. Being a sequel, logic isn't the 1st, 2nd, not even 22nd priority.Unlike the original, Mater is the leading character. The film is practically about him. Mater was funny in the original. Here he tries too hard to be funny and as a consequence he becomes too clownish, even irritating.It was actually hilarious when Mater ate that icecream and urgently needed to drink water because it was too spicy for him. Anyway, the 'joke' of Mater going to the bathroom and afterwards farting was too much. Mater is even confounded with an international spy, for dang sake!They attempted to repeat some of the jokes from the first movie, but none of them worked the way they did in the first one: the famous 'ka-chow' line and the joke of the tractors, for instance.Doc Hudson is missing, perhaps because Paul Newman has passed. They mentioned Doc Hudson, but the way they were referring to him makes one think he probably died - either that or else he migrated.",5,1,2,11 November 2011
Ghostbusters," One of those cases which big expectations can turn into a disappointment
","'Ghost Busters' is an okay film, but not all that potato bag for me. In fact, I think it tends to be overrated and a little too overvalued. If you ask me, people tend to give this movie more credit than it deserves. But I respect other people's opinions, even if I disagree with them.'Ghost Busters' is reasonably entertaining on its whole. The first half, without being spectacular, is nevertheless entertaining, fun and has its moments of comedy. In the second half, the movie becomes extremely dark (with all those monsters and strange creatures), losing interest for me (although that giant Marshmallow Man is a curious figure).In fact, those hideous creatures that appear in the second half, that wizard-like woman and some very disturbing ghosts are mostly what ruins the movie for me.However, not everything is bad about this movie. It has a delightful soundtrack theme which is a classic: the song 'Ghostbusters', performed by Ray Parker Jr. What else? The special effects are, most of them, awesome (typically 80's, which is a good thing). And finally: both Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are quite funny in these roles. Bill Murray has a very particular sense of humor. Dan Aykroyd, on the other hand, is an actor which I've always seen playing serious and sometimes grumpy characters, so I never expected to see him in a comical role like this. But in 'Ghost Busters' he's quite funny and he does some hilarious facial expressions.Rick Moranis is cool as Louis Tully, but I honestly rather him as Wayne Szalinski in 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'.Conclusion? It's not a boring movie, a bad movie or a big quality movie. Overall, it's just an okay movie made mainly for some fun and entertainment. «Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!» My rating is a 6/10. I think it's a fair and deserved rating for this movie: neither more neither less than that.",6,8,15,3 May 2008
Coyote Ugly," Not more than just a movie for teens
","Considering that 'Coyote Ugly' is a teen-movie, it isn't even bad. In fact, it is quite better than most of those nasty teen-movies (such as the 'American Pie' movies, 'There's Something About Mary', 'Cross Roads', etc...), but nothing extraordinary. Nevertheless, it is still entertaining enough and has its fun, as well as its moments.The best things about this movie are the good pop soundtrack and the beautiful Piper Perabo as a very seductive girl. The plot is predictable but okay. The dialogs/lines are okay. The romantic atmosphere combined with humor is good in my personal opinion. There is some language in this movie, but fortunately it has no disgusting dialogs or profanity. There is also some drama, without being very intense, however.Piper Perabo portrays Violet Sanford, a very sexy and sensual character, but also a very friendly and lovable character. Adam Garcia portrays Kevin O'Donnell, a likable, funny and cool dude.While not necessarily a great movie, 'Coyote Ugly' is however underrated. It deserves a little higher rating than this, if you ask me.For teenagers, it's very easy to enjoy this movie. As for adults, I won't say they will dislike, but most of them will certainly not be as pleased with it as teens.",7,6,11,28 April 2008
Gran Torino," Not quite what I expected
","I was informed that this movie was about cars and that I could like it for that, as I am a car lover. Despite that, I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie. Even so, the way it was described to me made me imagine it would be something like NASCAR, rallies or even something like Herbie's films (which also have a lot of car races) or of the type car chases. In the end, it has very little of cars and no automobile action. As such, it didn't match my expectations. It was a pretty weak movie.It was a surprise to see 'Blondie' from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' looking so old and with that raucous voice, even though I know he's now 80.Clint Eastwood's character was hilarious at times. The guy was old but though, with balls of steel. Whenever he called Thao 'Toad' (frog) it was hilarious, as well as whenever he kept calling Youa 'Yum Yum' (it kinda makes me wonder: was it because he had trouble to pronounce her name or was the old man saying she was delicious, huh?) :DIt was also hilarious that, despite his initial rage against Thao for attempting to steal his precious 1972 Ford Gran Torino, slowly he ended up being friends with him and even his protector - and how he thought of Thao as a banana (even for being shy with women).But generally speaking this wasn't much of a movie. Besides, I didn't enjoy things such as Thao being a victim of bullying and blackmail by his cousin and his crime partners. I also hated the ending because Eastwood's character got killed. I always thought he was gonna 'clean' them all. Instead, he's the one who gets shot and, as if that wasn't enough, we find out that he didn't bring any gun with him (it was as if he wanted them to murder him).",5,2,5,20 October 2010
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Not a Holiday film like the others
","While this movie may be great for those who don't want the traditional Christmas movie, it was a little too much for my tastes. Maybe I'd have to be a real fan of Tim Burton's work to truly appreciate his 'nightmare before Christmas'.Like it or not, one can't deny that this movie has no lack of originality and weirdness (the director's specialty). It surely was innovative for its time and looks unique even now - although it may have gotten some inspiration from the director's own 'Vincent' (1982).The visuals are great, original, strange and eccentric but the creatures are of bad taste: deformed monsters, undead people/monsters, ghosts, goblins, werewolves, witches...",5,0,2,12 November 2011
Grave of the Fireflies," Harsh to watch
","This is one of those movies which I only heard of (and got to see) after looking at IMDb's recommendations. That is something I always do: to see the recommendations on the IMDb page of the films that I like. Then I do research on them and decide if they interest me or not.This anime Japanese film is probably better than the average anime stuff that plagues TV nowadays. At least the anime here is less crude and the story is sentimental. Nevertheless, this movie is harsh, with a lot of heavy stuff for an animated motion picture: starvation, war, dropped firebombs, burned corpses/human remains (which is very gruesome), badly injured people, two kids who lose their mother, dead fireflies, the little girl who suffers from malnutrition (it's horrible to see her physical condition like that) and is cremated by her older brother after dying...Basically, this movie tells the tale of two poor children (the older brother Seita and his younger sister Setsuko) and their struggle for survival during the World War II in Japan. The film's language is Japanese either.Like animation historian Ernest Rister says, this is one of - if not the most - profoundly human animated film of all time.",7,3,4,3 March 2011
The Insider," One of the most intense movies ever made
","I'm not big on movies about journalism, but 'The Insider' is interesting for its genre. It is more than just a movie for those who want to learn how to be a journalist (which is not my case). It is a very intense movie. The whole movie is full of tension, which is combined with strong suspense, comparable to a thriller (except with no violence). Not the most exciting thing to watch, but definitely a powerful film which happens to be based in a real story.The big downside of this movie is its long runtime of almost 2 hours and a half, which makes it become a little tiring during the last 20 minutes. If only Michael Mann had give me the script I would have deleted 20 minutes of it and made it a shorter movie. I can't lie to you: this movie requires patience. Once you get used to it, things become more natural, but still... lots of patience is needed to watch this movie, as well as a good mood.Besides the intense story, this movie has also solid performances by the actors. For example, Al Pacino is great as usual. Russell Crowe is really good in this role, much better than in any of those which he was nominated Best Actor. Cristopher Plummer has a strong presence too. And Bruce McGill is terrific, being simply incredible when he loses his temper and shouts the line «Wipe that smirk off your face!»The soundtrack is good. The dark/noir-like atmosphere is good too. The quotes are, most of them, very good. The scenario varies a lot - it goes from exotic places/sceneries to extremely simple and sometimes crude backgrounds, but this combination doesn't work badly.The nervous and tense Jeffrey Wigand is the main character of the movie. He lives such a conflict situation that I wouldn't want to be in his skin. I wouldn't want to go through a dilemma like that.Despite being a quite dramatic and intense film, it also has its big moments of comedy. After all, even the most dramatic stories usually have their own moments of comedy.",7,1,2,5 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Technically and visually stunning
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is an extraordinary film and oh so significant. It must have been the pioneer of the science-fiction films and inspired later famous movies of its kind.Amazing and triumphant, it is also a completely different movie experience. Its formula is somehow similar to that of Walt Disney's 'Fantasia', being a very artistic movie that focus more in art and images than dialogs, almost like a space documentary.Technically the movie is impressing and visually brilliant. The visual effects are stunning, the special effects are wonderful, the futuristic and advanced visuals are terrific and the attention to detail is not forgotten (even in the smallest details). This is pure and expressive art, combined with beautiful and unforgettable classical music.Speaking of classical music, Richard Strauss's 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' theme is one of the movie's trademarks, but even better than this one is the fabulous Johan Strauss II's 'On the beautiful Blue Danube' waltz.The 'Star Gate' sequence is the most incredible, indescribable and breathtaking part of this movie. Wow, what a perfect and extraordinary genial artwork! The sound effects were not forgotten as well during the entire movie. The combination of sounds is great. It accents the already quite realistic atmosphere of the movie.'2001: A Space Odyssey' also deals with interesting stuff such as the human evolution, extremely advanced technology, artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.One example of artificial intelligence is the HAL 9000 computer, with his «perfect reliability» and soft and distinctive voice (brilliantly voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL 9000 is a great villain, being even capable of reading lips, which he does in a brilliant close-up and silent scene.The only things I don't particularly appreciate in this movie is the sequence 'The Dawn of Man' (with pre-historical apes, so fake and unnatural that it's obvious they're men disguised as apes) and I also dislike the final minutes of the movie (after the magnificent 'Star Gate' sequence). However, 'The Dawn of Man' also has its good things, such as the gorgeous sceneries, luminosity and that weird and somewhat sinister vocal music when the monolith appears.During the first 3 minutes, all we see is nothing - we only hear a strongly suspenseful music. The title sequence is wonderful, with a satellite image of the Earth rising over the Moon, while the Sun rises over the Earth, all in alignment, looking like an eclipse. More or less in the middle of the movie, there is an intermission that lasts 2 minutes and we hear the same strong music.If this is already a formidable movie, the fact of being from 1968 amazes me even more and makes its greatness even bigger. I mean, just imagine: this was made such a long time ago, when computers and technology were radically different and not even close to be half as developed and advanced as nowadays. It must have been completely unbelievable in 1968! However, this is a movie that requires an open mind and patience because it is long, slow and has very few dialogs, which may make it a bit tiring. But nobody discusses its greatness.Without a doubt, this is a cult movie, a timeless classic, one of all time's greatest science-fiction films (as well as one of all time's great movies) and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, which was written by Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick himself. As for the cast, talents include Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain, William Sylvester and others.",9,2,6,19 September 2007
The Graduate," Seriously overrated
","As much as this film is famous, it promises more than it delivers. While it may have been indeed «culturally, historically or aesthetically significant», it is far from being good. There are some elements of comedy, such as the lead character's embarrassment whenever Mrs. Robinson is seducing him and his famous line «Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me». Other than light comedy, this movie is worth for Dustin Hoffman's talent and charisma, Simon & Garfunkel's brilliant music and for the 1966 Alfa Romeo Spider 'Duetto' (a car with character, a great engine sound and lines to die for).But a good movie? Definitely not! And just because it is old that doesn't make it a classic. Here we see a young Dustin Hoffman in the role of Benjamin Braddock, a recently university graduate worried about his future. Even then he already had the same face and big nose. It's a surprise to see Dustin portraying such a shy and nervous character, that really made the actor seem extremely tense.Another surprise is to see Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson. I will always remember him as the mayor Larry Vaughn from 'Jaws'.I didn't even like much 'The Graduate' for a start and that ending was clearly over the top.",5,2,6,6 November 2011
There's Something About Mary," I hate this movie
","Unlike so many people, who claim that this movie is very funny or a great comedy (and so on...), I can't possibly understand all the success around this film. In fact, I practically never laughed when I saw this movie. If I laughed, it was only one or two times with something minor (like a minor comment from some character or something).This movie is just way too overrated. When I saw it, it was for two main reasons: because of Cameron Diaz (I used to like her more back then than nowadays) and also because I thought this would be a clever, worthy and funny comedy.Instead, I had a big shock. This movie is absolutely hideous, full of cheap and 'toilet' humor and profanity. Besides, its jokes are cruel, dirty, disturbing, shocking and sickening. Its humor is really disgusting, trashy and insulting. I expected at least a reasonable romantic comedy, not a nasty movie.Almost everything about this movie angered me. But some 'jokes' in particular angered me even more than everything else. These 'jokes' were the following ones: whenever Mary's retard brother attacks the innocent Ted; Ted's painful and disturbing zipper accident; when Mary's dog attacks Ted on a certain part (needless to say which part); when Ted is taken by the police and those cruel policemen grab on Ted's face and slam it brutally on a table; when Ted leaves at the end heartbroken; the scene with sperm on Mary's hair; and finally, the final scene when an old man shoots a singer.Poor Ted! He only suffers during the whole movie. He's fooled, humiliated, abused, he's the victim!If *this* movie is considered funny, then I'm concerned about what people find funny nowadays. Seriously, a movie like this isn't something I find entertaining, worthy, amusing or funny. This movie left me in very bad mood and, to make things even worst, it is too long considering the garbage it is - almost 2 hours! I was only wishing that it would come to an end. I refuse to ever watch this movie again and that's for sure. For those who never saw this movie, let me give an advice: skip it and try instead an intelligent comedy with really funny humor (not dirty humor) such as 'Liar Liar', 'Mousehunt' and 'Johnny English', for example.",3,1,5,8 February 2008
Super 8," Super BAD
","I watched this expecting an interesting story in the mold of 'Explorers' (1985), which was what it seemed to an extent. My oh my, 'Super 8' was one of the biggest let-downs ever in the history of cinema.This movie is genuine garbage from the very start until the very ending. So, what is wrong with this movie? Everything! It is too long and slow (let me yawn of boredom). There is virtually no plot. It seriously lacks any character development. The kids can't seem to captivate in any way and they are kids with very bad taste for filming movies about zombies (ugh!).The movie is supposed to take place in 1979, yet it doesn't deliver the slightest bit of the atmosphere and feeling of that era. In other words, a laughable attempt of being something it clearly isn't.Things out-of-line, things that make no sense at all, occur. A giant, disgusting alien-like monster viciously attacks and devours people. And we are supposed to sympathize with it? One of the kids even has a conversation with it and it calms down (come on!). Military men often show up (what the hell are they doing here??). There is too much noise and too many explosions.The one saving grace is the scene when the massive derailment of the train occurs. That scene is absolutely impressive and amazing. I've never seen such a long, intense, fantastic and noisy derailment in a movie. But that's hardly a redeeming feature, given the movie's all-round awfulness.",1,6,11,22 October 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Sad that this movie is not what it could have been
","First of all, I perfectly understand why this movie is so beloved, valued and considered a cult movie by its huge legion of fans. But this user in particular has an opinion which is a little different.I don't think that this movie is all that ' bag of fried potatoes'. I have a big problem with this movie: I absolutely love its first half because its first half is so full of life, joy, happiness, colorful imagination, creativity and slapstick humor, like a fable. Unfortunately, the second half completely ruins this movie for me. The second half is nothing but war, too much concentration on the killing fields. It ends up becoming (another!) Holocaust movie, which turns the movie exhausting for me. Too bad, because this movie had all the potential to be a foreign masterpiece and an extraordinary fable. 'Il signore' Roberto Benigni lost the chance of what could have been the movie of his career and the cinema masterpiece of Italy.The first half, like I said, is absolutely hilarious. Humor is its strong point, not only by the genius Roberto Benigni in the role of Guido Orefice, but also by Sergio Bini Bustric as Guido's friend, Ferruccio. They both make this movie and many others. The quotes are also great (such as «Buon giorno, principessa!»), the jokes are a real scream (all of them especially the one with the eggs), etc...I didn't like this as much as most people did, but I agree that this movie is memorable and unforgettable in many ways.",6,2,5,8 March 2008
A Clockwork Orange," I don't see why so much praise for this film...
","I know that movies are a matter of tastes and I respect that, but frankly I can't understand all the praise towards this movie. Its 'out of this world' plot? Its peculiar visuals? Its strong contents? Whatever the reason is, one thing is for sure: there seems to be very few people who dislike this. I'm one of them.I've been trying to watch this movie for a long time, after hearing so many good things about it. Today I finally did.Well, for one thing, this is a satirical, shocking and disturbing movie. People should know that: it is a violent movie (sometimes, extremely violent) and it has strong sexual contents (even in artistic shapes), as well as nudity. Besides the nudity itself, this movie shows some rape scenes and sexual violence. This is not a pleasant movie to watch, neither comfortable, although it has the power to impress.Anyway, when this movie initially came out in 1971, it was extremely controversial for being too violent. In fact, it was banned from UK cinemas and nearly caused serious trouble for the director Stanley Kubrick. This movie was hidden for 29 years and only went to the theaters after all that time (after Kubrick's death in 1999). This movie was more than controversial at the time, it was a scandal. A similar situation happened with the 1969 song 'Je t'aime... moi non plus' (by Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin), although in the case of this song it wasn't for violence, but for sexual references and sounds of orgasms. Its video was forbidden and the song itself too, but later it was accepted (and it is a great song).For a movie from 1971, its visuals are original, eccentric and futuristic. In fact, it takes place in a futuristic dystopian society (somewhere in England). This is a positive point. And the soundtrack is great, consisting in classical music - mostly by Ludwing Van Beethoven, or simply «Ludwig Van», like the character Alex says. The dialogs are very interesting, especially because many of them are narrated by Alex. This is also a very energetic movie, with a level of energy comparable to 'Dog Day Afternoon'.The character Alex is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm McDowell. He's the movie's main character, a mentally very sick person who loves to rape, kill people and hurt them very badly with the use of extensive violence. Alex and his 'droogs' somehow remind me about the musical band Culture Club with their way to dress and looks. Alex, for example, does look a bit like Boy George, doesn't he? At least in the beginning. Alex, however, after 'curing' himself, becomes a victim and pays for his own crimes.The movie has its brilliant things, but it also becomes too long and tiring when Alex begins his 'cure'. From that part on the movie almost never seems to end. I liked, however, the part when Alex and his 'droogs' steal a sports car for a reckless drive into the countryside. That part is crazy and brilliantly done.This is a very weird and bizarre movie, one that is difficult to 'stomach'. But for those who can 'stomach' it, it will be an extraordinary movie experience. The title is weird too, although it might have something to do with Alex - his instincts, the way he functions is like a clockwork orange.",5,3,8,10 July 2008
Titanic," The 'unsinkable' ship that was destined to sink
","'Titanic' is not only the most famous disaster film of all time, but also one of the most popular movies ever, not to mention that it achieved the rare glory of wining 11 Academy Oscars. Many 'Titanic' films were made during the 20th century, but the famous James Cameron film from 1997 is the most well known.This film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success, so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most cost-effective movie ever made. Many people even went to the theaters twice to see it. And the number of Academy Oscars that it won is another prove of its success. Plus, most everyone praised and liked the film back then. It was a hit on VHS and DVD as well.Strangely, in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and I read somewhere in the Internet that it was considered the worst Oscar winner ever. How ironic, huh? It seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movie.It's an okay movie, but not all that great. However, my biggest problem with the movie was always its length. 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring, even exhausting.The story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912. That makes this a realistic movie. The ship's replica is very well made and detailed. In that way they achieved perfection, making it look just like the real ship, which was the biggest, fastest, most luxurious and most beautiful of its time. Sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away. You know what bothers me most? First, the number of lifeboats wasn't enough because, stupidly, they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an 'unsinkable' ship. Unsinkable? Yeah, right... Second, the ship was going too fast when its engines hadn't been tested enough... and all of this just because of headlines!'Titanic' has beautiful instrumental music, a beautiful ballad named 'My Heart Will Go On' sung by Celine Dion, beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship, romance, tension, suspense and incredibly tragic moments. To see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life. This movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide. However, it's not just a melodrama. It has also romance and even some moments of comedy.Besides, to see the Titanic sinking, breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking. It will live forever in your mind because it's very impressive. Spectacular, yes, but tragic.The actors do a good job in their roles: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Bernard Fox and others...By the way, Mr. Andrews, Jack Dawson, Fabrizio and Tommy Ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movie.Another equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner SS Normandie in the 30's. Its appearance was very similar to the RMS Titanic and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style, very different from the luxury standards of modern liners. The SS Normandie didn't sink, but its ending was tragic too. During the World War II, it was was converted to a troopship in 1942, caught fire, capsized and sank at the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although it was salvaged at great expense, restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive, so it was scrapped in 1946. And I say 'it' because I don't like to refer to the ships as 'she'.",6,2,3,12 July 2007
Mystic River," Not all that great; overvalued in fact
","I saw 'Mystic River' now, which my best friend loaned me. I remember that when it came out it was a widely acclaimed and successful film but I didn't go to the cinema to watch it and I never rented it or whatsoever.Having now watched the film, I don't get all the praise it gets. Maybe it's partially because it was directed by 'Blondie' from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (Clint Eastwood), perhaps it's partially because Sean Penn stars in it. I don't like this person (Sean Penn) and I think he's an overrated actor.The first minutes were promising, with beautiful and awesome angles of sight of the town in takes place (Boston) and interesting sequences with the 3 main characters (Jimmy, Sean and Dave) as teenagers in 1977. They are neighbors, they are friends, they play hockey in a street and they decide to write their names on cement (which will remain marked there permanently). Dave is the only one who doesn't get to finish writing his name. When he has just written 'DA', a car shows up and a fake man pretending to be a cop gets out, threats them for writing their names on cement and forces Dave to get in the car. Poor Dave is kept in captivity and abused by child molesters for 4 days. This traumatic experience changes him forever. You can say that he 'died' from that day on.I was hoping that the movie would show much more with these boys as teenagers, but suddenly and all too soon it literally jumps 25 years ahead, with the boys now as adults (however looking very old for their ages) but still living in the same city. Jimmy is an ex-con running a store. Dave is a blue-collar worker. Sean is a cop.With the 3 main characters as adults, the movie eventually loses much of its interest, although it still has some lovely vistas of Boston. This is a very real story and very current, with much of 'human' on it.Big part of the film is about the mystery behind the homicide of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter. There are a few suspects, but it's not until the very ending that the case is solved. The true criminals are 2 boys I would have never suspected.The worst thing about this movie is that Dave is brutally murdered by Jimmy. He was an innocent man who paid for a crime that he didn't commit. And he was an old friend of Jimmy! Jimmy had already a history of crime in his past anyway. And apparently Sean realizes what he did, but just lets him get away with it. Jimmy shows some guilt feeling, but he's not that devastated with what he did. And his wife even seems to support him after this! Overall, a tedious film and certainly not the 'masterpiece' many claim it to be.",6,2,3,30 October 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Not what I expected
","There are movies that I like so much I never get tired of. I like old films (even very old ones from the 40's, no matter if they're colored or in black and white). This one? Not really.After reading so much about its fame and veneered classic status, as well as seeing it so much in the lists of the best films ever and even IMDb's Top 250, I decided to give it a shot. I was lucky to find this on YouTube. Besides, its whole presentation on YouTube is terrific, with crisp image quality instead of blurry as 'per common' in so many films on YouTube. I'm not surprised why it got off to a bad start. I think that even in 1946 people already had the perception that this wasn't such a great film. Even in those days they already had much better. This one didn't age well and doesn't stand the test of time.It was only some 30 years later that this film became the beloved classic it is today, all because it became a TV staple in the 70's and 80's Christmas seasons. It's almost as if it didn't exist before the 70's. Also, this is the film watched by the McCallisters in the first two 'Home Alone' movies, only dubbed in different languages (French and Spanish).This is considered a Christmas film. I don't totally agree. Yes, it takes place on Christmas and you see a lot of Christmas decorations, Christmas lights, snow and such, but it doesn't feel that Christmassy. In my opinion a Christmas tale is supposed to bring joy and a 'feel good' feeling. Instead, this is a bitter film with a lot of unpleasant scenes. Besides, with a title like that, I'd expect a light-hearted, 'feel-good' movie in the line of 'Mary Poppins', for example.The beginning is excellent and frankly couldn't have been better: with visually delicious details such as the opening credits resembling Christmas postcards, the town with its Christmas decorations and lights and snow, the stars's speech, a group of kids sliding on the ice of a frozen pond where little George Bailey saves his brother's life and the pharmacy sequence except for the disturbing part when Mr. Gower beats up George causing his ear to bleed after George's heroic act. Bobby Anderson does a fine portrayal of little George Bailey.From the moment George Bailey grows up, the film slowly loses its initial greatness and excellency. James Stewart's acting is great but I think he overacts in this role. Adult George Bailey lacks the charm and sympathy of little George Bailey.Mr. Potter, while well portrayed by the actor, is not a likable character, being a corrupt, despicable and malicious man. To a point, George is so frustrated and desperate that he takes it all out on his family and on a teacher by insulting her at the phone and wants to kill himself, feeling he's more worth dead than alive and wishing he was never born at all. His savior, an angel named Clarence, makes his wish come true so that he sees and experiences what would the world be like without him. And that alternative reality is creepy in many ways.To finish my long review, it's truly a pity that the rest of the film doesn't match the brilliant beginning, otherwise it could have been one of the all time greats. It had potential for that. It cost a lot to be made and it looks expensive.After filming was finished, the director considered it the best film he ever directed and even the finest film anyone ever directed. With all due respect to Mr. Frank Capra, but I have to disagree.Some things also don't make sense. For example, adult George Bailey is supposed to be around 18 or 19 years old but James Stewart was nearly 40 years old when he played the role. Also, when his wife announces she's pregnant, there isn't a single scene with their kids as babies or during their first years of life and all of a sudden they're already 'big'. Well, not 'big' literally, but already quite some years older. And, after George wishes to 'live' again, he wishes a merry Christmas to everyone (including Mr. Potter) like a mad man and yells «I'm going to jail! Isn't that great?» I can't see how going to jail is great, but to each their own, right?",7,1,3,8 March 2011
Psycho," Intriguing
","'Psycho' is nowadays highly praised as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films but back when it first came out it got mixed reviews. I'm not that familiar with the cinema of The Master of Suspense, though.In 1960 colored films were already quite common (even Hitchcock's own films) but 'Psycho' was filmed in black and white. One can only wonder why, but I don't care about that. I'm not saying this just because I consider black and white a form of art but also because 'Psycho' is the kind of film that works better in black and white. It probably would be bad if it was in colors. The same way I wouldn't want black and white films such as 'The Window' (by Ted Tetzlaff) in colors, among others. 'Psycho', while I don't see it as the masterpiece many made it seem to be, is an okay movie. The old-fashioned feeling it gives is nice: the opening scene showing a lovely panorama of Phoenix, Arizona (where it takes place); the huge American cars of that time; the fact that it is in black and white; etc.The famous shower scene doesn't look minimally realistic. I'm not gonna spoil my reasons, but it's so phony that it's obvious how it was made. Nevertheless, I think it is well made (if that makes sense) and it certainly is effective when it comes to quickness, although not really scary... well, at least not for our standards. But it must have been so surprising in 1960. For me, the part when the same assassin kills detective Arbogast is scarier, as that scene is so sudden and when you less expect... not to mention that it is very quick!The violin sound makes a great piece of music and works well for the suspense of this film, which has many well made scenes of solid suspense. Scenes which give the feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen, but give the idea that something bad might happen. That's the case, for example, of a sequence when Marion is driving her car on a dark rainy night and the wipers of her car barely clean any rain. We barely see anything, just like her.This is a movie that, watching for a 1st time, it's almost impossible to guess that Norman's 'mother' is actually Norman himself disguised and imitating her. But it's easy to suspect that he's not the innocent guy he seems to be at first, as he smiles of satisfaction when he sinks Marion's car on a swamp (with her body in the car's trunk).Although interesting, it's a weird movie. I hear that weird movies was one of Hitchcock's specialties. Janet Leigh does a fine job as Marion Crane. Other actors do well either. Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack is fantastic.The final shot, which shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, could have been longer. It's far too quick and ends too sudden. Practically the moment they show it the movie suddenly ends.",7,1,2,13 August 2010
August Rush," Oliver Twist in USA?
","This ain't no perfect movie, but it has some original elements. Although it is said to be somehow like a modernized version of the classic tale 'Oliver Twist', I still think it is different enough to be original. And besides, the similarities with 'Oliver Twist' are only in certain and very specific details.Even thought the scenario is decent, it's just another typical movie set in New York city. There ain't no lack of American cinema and I am developing an increasing interest in foreign cinema. Am I getting tired of American cinema? Perhaps...The movie tells the tale of Evan Taylor / August Rush, a child with a passion and gift for music. He can conduct an orchestra not unlike Tom Cat in 'Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl'. He can conduct an orchestra just as well as he can play guitar and organ. Besides, there's poetry in his words, his music and his soul. The character is very well portrayed by Freddie Highmore.The soundtrack divides me. Whatever August Rush plays (guitar, organ and classical music) is lovely and Lyla Novacek plays violin beautifully but anything that Louis Connelly plays is sonorous pollution.Keri Russell plays music better than she acts. Robin Williams plays a dubious character, not unlike Fagin from the Oliver Twist tale. Not the most peculiar role I've ever seen him playing, but positively one of his most peculiar. The acting is, however, typically Robin.",7,0,1,2 October 2011
Jaws," This is 'THE' Summer blockbuster
","'Jaws' is considered the pioneer of the Summer blockbusters. After all, its impact and success made it a much copied movie, by giving birth to 3 sequels and different movies inspired on it (such as 'Deep Blue Sea'). But 'Jaws' is definitely THE Summer blockbuster (and also the one to own).Steven Spielberg was in the beginning of his career when he made this movie. Although he made other movies before, this was his first hit. Its success surprised even Spielberg himself. The movie is based on a 1974 book (same title) by Peter Benchley. I read the book and there are many differences...Filming of the movie took much longer than planned. It was supposed to take about 2 months, but ended up taking more than 5 months (also due to reliability issues with the mechanical sharks).'Jaws' is considered a classic in its genre. Indeed it is a great movie but also shocking. It is intense and combines strong suspense and horror. The shark is immense and intimidating. It is clearly over-sized, but that also makes the movie more terrifying. It looks a bit rubbery at times, but I don't think it looks as artificial as many do. Nicely filmed, the movie takes place in a fictional Summer resort town (Amity Island). The place looks very appealing, the sandy beach is big, beautiful and very inviting. And that's where the brutal shark's attacks occur. It's heaven and hell at the same time.The movie's got some of the most horrifying deaths ever in a movie. While not the scariest movie of its kind, it surely is scary when it is. In fact, I often read and heard that when the movie came out in 1975, never before had the cinemas been so full and the beaches so empty. It wasn't just because of the movie's euphoria, but also because of the shark's attacks seen in it (maybe more than the sharks's attacks in real life). Today the movie continues to marvel and shock audiences.And the soundtrack by the genial John Williams is strong and powerful, very appropriate for the movie. It gives the sensation of being spooky and carried with suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.Roy Scheider portrays the town's police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss stars as the marine biologist Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw plays the rude fisherman and shark hunter Quint. Murray Hamilton is Larry Vaughn, the selfish Mayor of Amity Island. Ever since the beginning, Brody wants to close the beaches to protect beachgoers from the shark's attacks, but is overruled by the Mayor, who refuses to close the beaches because of his greed for money and also refuses to listen to or believe anybody. His selfishness costs lives, as we see in the film - including a child's life.The first half of the movie focus more on the attacks and also lets us know Amity Island and appreciate its scenario. The second half focus on the attempt to hunt the great beast.The movie's poster is great, even more so in the DVD cover.",9,7,14,20 July 2010
The Lion King," The end of an era...
","The 32nd animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known films. It is considered by many 'the best' of Disney. I don't agree with that, there are better films. But still, it is the last of a kind.I first saw it in the cinema in December 1994, with my parents, sister, godfather and his wife and kids. I was 10 at the time. It was in a cinema I used to go many times back then and which I first saw other Disney films, like 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast', for example.The original 1994 version is the true version for me. The version with that dumb 'Morning Report' scene has no reason to exist and is completely unnecessary. Seriously, did they think that people were really gonna accept that? Aside that it's the same movie but why changing a movie, even if it's only for 1 minute?The beauty of the artwork is one of the film's best attributes. It shows us beautiful landscapes of Africa and includes, among other things, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets characteristic of Africa. We know this takes place somewhere in Africa but we don't know where exactly. They call it 'Pride Lands' in the film...The lions and lionesses are extremely well drawn and handsome and their roars are very realistic, so much that I wonder if they used real lions in stage or if it was very talented people roaring like that.Simba is very pretty and cute as a lion cub and grows looking similar to his father. Mufasa always fascinated me and even now he still fascinates me: he is a gorgeous lion, powerful, with an imposing and majestic figure, a strong voice, a brutal strength and an amazing physique. Mufasa really is a 'Sir Lion'.Scar is one of the great Disney villains and he really has that cold and harsh look on his face and eyes.Timon and Pumba are two goofy but funny characters. They are clearly stupid, but more of a comic relief than anything else. I don't particularly like the hyenas, but Ed is a funny one, perhaps for being a mute character like Dopey ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') and Gideon ('Pinocchio'). It's hilarious when Ed laughs hysterically because of the way Mufasa scared them away.However, Mufasa's death is one of the most severe things for a child to watch and the sequence itself is depressing, easy to make some tears come to our eyes.As for the voice cast, talents vary, but some do an excellent job, like James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as infant Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu.The soundtrack is great. It has two versions of 'Circle of Life' and 'Can you feel the love tonight'. In the case of 'Circle of Life', I like both versions. In the case of 'Can you feel the love tonight', I prefer Elton John's version.I also enjoy the songs 'Hakuna Matata', 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', 'Be Prepared' and the silly song 'Asante sana squash banana', but I adore 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and those instrumental-vocal songs which resemble African sounds and at the same time they have this dark feeling in them. The movie's environment is a mix of paradise and darkness.",7,1,5,17 January 2010
WALL·E," Not as good as they say
","With all due respect, 'WALL-E' is said to be such a great movie, but for me it isn't as good as they're making it sound. Although I rarely appreciate a CGI film, I had good expectations about this one. But it seems that my expectations were a bit too high. So, it's an overrated movie. I don't use the word 'overrated' frequently, but this is one of those cases which I think deserves such word.The movie is visually triumphant. For a CGI film, the visuals are excellent, fresh, advanced and obey to high standards of quality. The sceneries look futuristic either, which is no surprising considering that our story takes place in the 22nd century.The movie actually starts very well and promising, with the WALL-E character doing his duty: to clean the garbage and mess of a lost, sad and desert Earth where everything is destroyed and humankind is a rarity now. The first 15 minutes are very good for this and for its sceneries. Speaking of these sceneries, the place itself and all those destroyed buildings made me think of Steven Spielberg's 'A.I.: Artificial Intelligence' and also of a Citroen C4 TV commercial, where the car transforms itself into a robot and dances at the sound of the music 'Jacques Your Body' by Les Rythmes Digitales. The only minor thing that bothers me a bit in the beginning is that WALL-E befriends with a cockroach which is always behind him.The sceneries in space and inside a spaceship (seen later in the movie), on the other hand, made me think a bit of '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Wars' and that Pizza Planet place in 'Toy Story'.Anyway, back to the beginning, when WALL-E meets a female robot named EVE, the movie begins to lose some of its original impact. For a story like this, romance was absolutely unnecessary, even more when the story is about robots and machinery. Plus, once the story in the spaceship begins, that's when it loses all its interest. That Captain guy annoyed me and the villains. The Captain and many other human characters are very poorly designed, as usual in most CGI movies. They tend to overdo their proportions. Not to mention that there are many silly moments, the story gets silly and so on.Despite that, the visuals inside the spaceship are very nice and interesting. They show quality and they look very realistic, almost looking like a giant shopping center from the future.One more thing: what was the point of those live-action scenes when the movie is supposed to be animated? And what is the music from '2001: A Space Odyssey' doing here? As if it wasn't enough inserting that music in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', now they put it in here? I wonder how many more movies will do this in the future.The character WALL-E (an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is likable and interesting. Although he's a robot/vehicle from space, he looks a little like E.T. - besides, his voice sounds a bit like E.T.'s and combines a brilliant robot-like quality. I loved his voice, fits perfectly well for the character.Overall, a nice try, but like most CGI films, it's no match for 'Cars'.",6,4,8,19 November 2008
Scream," A scream
","This movie is a return to the slasher genre after it got somewhat 'asleep' for some years. And it 'woke up' again with this scary, scream of a film.The movie is scary from the start. What begins as a flirtatious but apparently harmless phone call from some guy turns out to be frightening. The guy begins to make strange questions and calls back whenever the girls hangs up the phone and makes serious threats. Soon very disturbing and gruesome things happen.More of these nightmarish events happen through the movie. The phone caller is disguised with a ghost mask on his face. The most unexpected surprise is that there are actually 2 'Ghostface' assassins. The movie is a nail-biter until the end as many terrifying events continue to happen until then.A dull terror/horror movie, but probably a landmark for those who appreciate the genre because it meant a return to the genre, particularly teens.None of the actors are great, although Drew Barrymore has probably her best acting in this small role. Neve Campbell is okay but I appreciated more her prettiness than her acting skills.",5,0,21,25 May 2011
Bruce Almighty," What if God was one of us?
","You know that famous Joan Osborne's song 'One of us'? This movie is a vision of what if God was one of us. It was directed by Tom Shadyac, the same guy who directed the great 'Liar Liar'. While 'Bruce Almighty' is an okay movie, it isn't a great movie. 'Liar Liar' is far superior, more clever and way funnier. Not that 'Bruce Almighty' isn't funny. It has its comical moments, but it never is as strong as 'Liar Liar'.The story is original, different and has its funny side, but can be offensive for some people. It isn't offensive for me, however.This film casts Jim Carrey as the Bruce Almighty of the title, who isn't that almighty as you'll see all over the movie. Morgan Freeman and the pretty Jennifer Aniston also star in this film.The best scenes of the film are, in my opinion, the following: when Bruce inserts stars in the sky and pushes the moon closer to us; when he's testing his new powers at the sound of the cool song 'The Power'; when Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman are standing still on the sea and then we see Jim Carrey running above the sea. I mean, can you imagine the sensation, what would it be like if us humans could walk and run above the sea as if we were doing the same in any ordinary street? And imagine how far could we go and what we could explore...Overall, it's an okay comedy but nothing special. It is, however, recommendable for those who like Jim Carrey's humor.",6,1,3,19 August 2008
Signs," Generally good... until the ending which ruins it a little
","In my opinion, 'Signs' is an okay movie, entertaining enough and has a good level of tension, suspense and thriller, as well as a reasonably dramatic story. But it isn't much more than just an okay piece of entertainment.At my point of view, most of the climax of the movie is during nearly the entire film, because we don't really know how the ET's look like until almost the ending. When the ET's finally appear, it's a major disappointment, because they're so ugly, badly designed and they even look green-like (as if they were wearing military or war clothes)! This is mostly what makes me rate this movie a bit lower, although, to be fair, fortunately the ET's appearance is short.If you ask me, they should have created these ET's more carefully, like Steven Spielberg did in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'A.I.: Artificial Intelligence'.Mel Gibson proves once again to be a good dramatic actor, portraying an ex-priest (or Father) who has lost his faith... until he recovers it at the end.Besides the tension, thriller, suspense and drama, I also like very much those giant crop circles made by the aliens. No doubt that they were perfectly made. Really very well made. Apparently not even a human hand could do crop circles this fine.Overall, a reasonable movie, but the same director (M. Night Shyamalan) has a much better movie than this: 'The Sixth Sense', his most popular and most praised movie all over the world.",7,1,5,12 January 2008
The Sixth Sense," A good movie if a little over-hyped
","'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie but perhaps a little overrated. I believe that those who don't like it are in minority. Part of this explains its success.The unfortunate reality is that this was the only Haley Joel Osment's successful movie. He made a reasonable number of very good movies and none of them was a success: 'Pay It Forward', 'Edges of the Lord' and 'A.I.: Artificial Intelligence'.Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that 'The Sixth Sense' was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense. Cole's facial expressions say all and some of the movie's best quotes can be heard in this sequence.The idea of this movie inspired the TV series 'Ghost Whisperer' which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt.",7,2,3,23 July 2007
Cinderella," Classic fairy tale
","The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Even though a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics.It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. One of Disney's most 'simple' works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and enchantment (which old Disney is well known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics.'Cinderella' is somehow like a return to Disney's 1st animated classic ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') because it brings back the fairy tale genre. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by Charles Perrault.There are plenty of likable characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy Godmother (for a fairy she sure is funny), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke.Jaques is very smart and amusing. I love his voice. Really has that mouse-like quality. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous.The King is hilarious, but I think that what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. They're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from 'Sleeping Beauty' was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) aren't much better than her. However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother.Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. Yet, there's nothing annoying about him.The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although not among Disney's best. The best song in this movie is 'Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo'.There are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten.Despite being simple-looking, the movie has good artwork, as well as its nice details, although never something 'out-of-this-world'. However, the King's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.",7,1,1,18 July 2007
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A pioneer of today's terror films?
","I usually have a strong dislike towards terror films, especially modern ones or from recent years. This one had the age advantage for me to watch it, to see how it would be like. But I also watched it, following the suggestion of two people. It's significantly better than I expected (for a terror film, of course) but it's not a great movie, just okay. But then again, there are much worse in this genre.There is no denying that this movie had a deep impact on this type of films, not only because it was followed by a ridiculous number of sequels, but also because in later years many slasher/terror/horror (whatever) films were made, inspired on this. Even now this still happens.This movie is, as any film like it, disturbing. There is brutal, graphic violence. Plus, the character Fred Krueger (today more known as Freddy Krueger) is more than just sinister: he is nauseating, to say the least. It gives one nauseas, makes one feel sick just to look at him, even through we don't see him that well (at least in this one). Fred Krueger, with his razor-sharp knives on the fingers, makes me wonder if somehow he didn't inspire Edward Scissorhands (even though they are completely different type of characters). Ironically, Johnny Depp is in this (and he was Edward Scissorhands). Johnny Depp was really young here, looks so different that he is almost unrecognizable (and was still far from becoming an actor famous for portraying weird, eccentric characters).As much as the film is terrifying, it also is confusing. The way it transgresses the boundaries between dream (more appropriately, nightmare) and reality often made me not knowing what was real and what wasn't real. And it's strange (and scary) how nightmare becomes reality in this. The cast was nothing special in terms of acting, but I liked Heather Langenkamp as Nancy. She is beautiful and hot!",7,0,1,23 August 2010
The Truman Show," «It's not Shakespeare, but it's genuine. It's a life»
","'The Truman Show' is a completely original motion picture. For good and for bad, it is very different and a unique movie experience.In general, 'The Truman Show' is okay but far from perfection. Some moments are a bit boring. It was directed by Peter Weir, the same guy who directed 'Dead Poets Society'.'The Truman Show' is a movie which makes us question this: «What if my whole life was nothing more than just a reality-show? What if my whole life was just a television program? What if the whole world knew everything about me and my life?».That's exactly what happens with the character Truman Burbank. He doesn't know about this, but as the movie runs he suspects that something's wrong and slowly he finds out the truth. He also finds out that even his wife, his best friend Marlon and most people he knows are actually hired actors. However, Sylvia (Truman's dream woman) is the only one who supports him and feels ashamed about what they are doing to Truman.Jim Carrey does a great job as Truman Burbank. However, Jim Carrey is hilarious as usual in this movie but at the same time he does a very good job as a dramatic actor. Yes, this was his first dramatic role ever, which was a challenge for Jim Carrey, but ended up as a victory.Ed Harris is great as well in the role of the arrogant program's creator Christof. But the other actors do a good job either.This movie is distinguish for being so different and fresh, but at the same time it has the power of letting me paranoid. It's notorious how after this movie came out lots of reality-shows were made (naturally inspired by this movie's idea).This movie looks simple in many ways, but it also has some amazing and original things: a perfect sunset, a nice and lovely town (Seahaven), beautiful sceneries, stunning views of Seahaven surrounded by the sea, the moon which is Christof's studio, different and good camera angles which give us the impression that Truman is being watched (including from the inside of the electronic climate controls of Truman's car - somebody explain me how did they do that?), the rain falling on Truman, the incredible storm caused by Christof's selfish orders and even that final part - when Truman walks through the sea and Christof talks to him from the sky. That final part is so well made that we can consider it magical.By the way, I can't finish my review without talking about the soundtrack. This movie has brilliant and very smooth classical music by Frédéric Chopin. It's so beautiful and wonderful! Besides, there's plenty of more instrumental songs (not classical, however), which are equally awesome and very relaxing to hear.",7,1,2,14 August 2007
300," The 'gorilla' movie
","I have a friend who talked me about this movie and he told me what it was about. He also told me that the warriors in it sound like gorillas when they make sounds, hence why he calls 'gorillas' to brute, rude, dynamic guys who do everything in 10 seconds. My friend was right: sometimes the men in this movie make sounds that resemble gorillas.This film, although not without its original elements, gives that 'I've been here before' feeling: it resembles movies like 'Gladiator', 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Harry Potter', 'El labirinto del Fauno', etc...The look and style is one of this movie's strengths, as the scenario is colorful and beautiful.When it comes to plot, it's a typical epic, but this time it revolves around King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans in battle against Xerxes and his massive army of soldiers. There are grotesque monster-human creatures. There is strong content and brutal violence, although comparing with other movies like this, the violence in this isn't as frequent and as long-lasting. None of the characters are particularly involving and the acting by the actors is nothing special. It was a surprise to look at the film's cast list and see Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes, because I didn't recognize him at all.«Spartans! Prepare for glory!» is probably the most memorable quote of this motion-picture.",6,0,0,29 January 2012
Aladdin," A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view...
","The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.'Aladdin' is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling 'Prince Abooboo' to 'Prince Ali'), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.'Aladdin' is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song 'A Whole New World'. The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. 'Arabian Nights' is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that 'Aladdin' hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250.",8,12,13,24 July 2007
The Proposal," Amazing how two very different people fall in love
","This is a silly film, but fun if flawed and okay if not taken too literally. It follows a bit the formula of 'While You Were Sleeping' but doesn't have some of its excesses (although it has some other excesses that one doesn't) and is by no means christmassy. Nevertheless, they are different films, being both romantic comedies and both starring Sandra Bullock.'The Proposal' is not much of a movie and its plot is quite predictable and formulaic, but it does well its aim of entertaining the public. It's a story of blackmail, selfishness and manipulation which converts in... love! Such a strange 'marriage'...Julia Roberts was to have taken the role of Margaret Tate. However, just like in 'While You Were Sleeping' Demi Moore was replaced by Sandra Bullock, on this one Julia Roberts was replaced by Sandra Bullock. Very clever decision in both cases. I couldn't see Demi Moore in that role or that frog's mouth Julia Roberts in this role.Ryan Reynolds and the loving Sandra Bullock have a nice chemistry. They convince as a couple who hates each other but eventually fall in love. Both act well, but Sandra Bullock is better in her performance. While beautiful, she wasn't always a great actress, but with age she has improved considerably.Sandra Bullock... can you believe she was nearly in her mid-40's when she did this movie? She is in amazing shape! She's undoubtedly a milf and there are a few 'sexy' scenes with her in this movie. A real delight for the eyes and soul of men.",6,0,1,30 January 2011
The Birds," Leaves one question in the air: «What if birds turned against us?»
","'The Birds' is one of the highest achievements by The Master of Suspense. It's a strange but interesting movie. It combines suspense and horror in a classic but fascinating way.However, it isn't just some suspense/horror film. It is very original and unusual. In this motion picture, the birds turn against humans. Apparently, this movie made many people fear the birds after watching it. I don't believe this could happen in real life. I mean, I know that birds can attack when they are messed up with or when they feel threatened but I don't believe they'd attack with no reason, much less entire crowds of birds.Nevertheless, this is what could happen if birds declared war against humankind in real life. The movie is triumphant on this. What it lacks is an explanation. The movie is nearly 2 hours long and it just ends without explaining why did the birds attack people. Was it revenge? Some kind of mental disease or virus? We don't know.While I wouldn't exactly get 'bird phobia' because of this film, it somewhat makes one look at birds differently. I even remember once coming near some construction near the sea and I realized there were a cup of gulls standing on its roof and it was a bit creepy - it made me think of this film, particularly the scene when Melanie is on the school yard sitting on the fence near the playground, smoking a cigarette and we see behind her a bird flying to a jungle gym and then more and more birds show up until the whole playground is full of them.The birds of the film are mostly seagulls, crows and ravens (they're the ones that viciously attack) but there also parakeets (hilariously called 'lovebirds' in the film). The parakeets never do any harm, but they get crazy in some scenes. The film takes place in Bodega Bay, California - which is almost like the apocalypse with all those birds attacks. Many of these birds attacks are impressing, including those which children are attacked at school. Besides, the loud sounds of the birds are brilliant and accent the atmosphere: both the sounds of them 'yelling' (they are well know for being noisy birds) and the crazy sounds of them flapping their winds.As for the cast, the best ones are Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels, Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner and a very attractive Suzanne Pleshette as the teacher Annie Hayworth.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9,2,3,16 October 2010
The Simpsons Movie," This is more or less what I was expecting...
","'The Simpsons Movie'. At last! Well, I never really asked for a movie about The Simpsons, but curiosity is often stronger than the interest itself.Despite the fact that I grew up during the time when the famous TV series was at its best and the fact that it has been going downhill during these last years, I was still curious (although apprehensive) to see this film once I heard about it.In my humble opinion, this is a mediocre film. Let's be frank: it isn't much better than the modern episodes of the popular TV series. Yes, it has its moments (some good and funny parts), but not much more besides that. However, this motion picture has something that makes it more distinguish than the episodes of 'The Simpsons': an original story and the Simpsons family in Alaska. Not to mention that the Alaska's artwork is pretty good here - not bad for 'The Simpsons'. The important message about preserving our environment is also something distinguish about this. Nevertheless, this is no way 'The Simpsons' which I grew up with.I'll also list some of the things I disliked most about this movie. What's the point of Green Day's crappy music? And that 'Titanic' joke when Green Day sink? And those cameos of Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others? And, the most important, what happens to the pig? We never see the animal again after the Simpsons escape from their house on fire - the pig was there, left behind and is never seen again. Did the poor animal die burned? I am glad that the Simpsons's dog (Santa's Little Helper) survived, but it bugs me not to know what happened to the pig.Speaking of the pig, he's the funniest thing about this film. That pig is weird and ugly, but hilarious (especially whenever he imitates Homer).Overall, for those who grew up with 'The Simpsons' I recommend this a try. But don't expect too much. This isn't like 'The Simpsons' from 1989 to nearly the end of the 1990's.",5,2,4,18 January 2008
All the President's Men," A lesson about journalism
","'All The President's Men' is an interesting movie based on a true story, in this case the Watergate political scandal, which took place between 1972 and 1974. Back then Richard Nixon was the President of the United States of America.This movie focuses mostly on the journalism's perspective about the Watergate scandal. It has nothing to do with 'The Insider', but somehow it closely resembles 'The Insider'.'All The President's Men' can teach us many things about what it's like to be a journalist. 'The Insider' also teaches us this kind of thing.The story is real and the movie is slow (it requires patience), but reasonably made: a good combination of real facts, journalism, suspense, thriller, tension, darkness, images from television, machinery, old music and some humorous moments.The actors are great and some of them are legends, such as Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford and Jack Warden.Dustin Hoffman plays the role of Carl Bernstein and Robert Redford plays Bob Woodward, the two main characters of the movie. They both steal the show as the two journalists of the Washington Post. They are both ambitious and a good example because they take their job very seriously. That is something very needed for a job like that.Jack Warden is great too, but his character (Harry M. Rosenfeld) appears few times.Deep Throat is a funny, complex, mad and enigmatic character. No wonder, with a nickname like that... and he's very well played by the actor.The director Alan J. Pakula did a good job with this film.This motion picture has one of the most peculiar endings ever created: writing machines that continually write very quickly and without stopping. The way how they did this is incredible!Movies about journalism may not be the most exciting thing to watch, but they are interesting and, with an open mind and if given a chance, it's easy to appreciate them. They also give good perspectives about the stories which they are based. For those who like this kind of movies and this one in particular, I recommend 'The Insider' as well.",7,4,6,15 August 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Oz is that place somewhere over the rainbow
","'The Wizard of Oz' is a very old movie and looks awfully dated, but still has its magic and charm. To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', 'We're Off to See the Wizard', 'If I Only Had a Brain' (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time.",7,7,13,28 December 2007
