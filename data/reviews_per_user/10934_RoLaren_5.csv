The Blair Witch Project," Less is Definitely More!
","Few films come along which actively invite viewer participation. This is especially true for the horror/fantasy genre which, in this age of overblown computer-generated fx, assault the audience with noise, gore and the likes of JarJar Binks. Filmakers of insight--and the makers of Blair Witch Project obviously fall into this category--know that the imagination can conjure up far more frightening scenarios than all the fx houses put together. After all, each of us has our own deeply personal, often subconscious, fears--which are seldom those of the filmakers. (Or, should I say, some Hollywood committee's idea of what is frightening.)Darkness--literal and that symbolic darkness which represents the unknown--is an effective element of Blair Witch; and the use of handheld cameras gives the 'documentary' an authenticity that no amount of slick, dollar-heavy Hollywood production values could create. One of the most original films to come along in a very long time. (I can almost smell the imitations coming...)",Null,1,2,22 August 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best kick-ass movies ever made!
","For adrenaline-fueled action & suspense, great FX, cast, soundtrack and more, it's hard to be T2. It's even got a love interest, although you need to view the director's cut or see the first Terminator movie to see this. With its apocalyptic, but not completely void of hope, vision of the future, T2 leaps off the screen and into your face and stays there. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, and I still watch it (I own the director's cut). Linda Hamilton's tough-tender Sarah Connor is one of the best female characters ever created for the screen. In order to get the complete story and appreciate her character's evolution, however, you need to watch both Terminator films--which is not to say that either film does not stand on its own; they do. Full of memorable scenes and great one-liners. Cameron's direction is fast-paced, the editing tight and the sound terrific. A classic in the sci-fi pantheon. Among the scenes cut from the final release is a dream sequence in which Kyle Reese visits Sarah Connor in the state hospital. In my opinion, it should've been left in: it reminds us of what she's lost and fleshes out her character even more.",10,1,1,18 January 1999
Enemy at the Gates," They may not have the luxury of time, but the schmaltz is flowing a-plenty...
","Oy! Spare me another Hollywood ending--I wanted to hurl when I left the theater. I won't give it away here, though. The only thing that kept this movie from sinking beneath the weight of all that schmaltz and expository dialogue (just in case we couldn't follow the action) was the performance of Jude Law as the Russian sniper. Law is a chamelonic actor whose performances in films as diverse as 'Talented Mr. Ripley,' 'eXistenZ,' 'Wilde,' etc., have been consistently excellent.
The other bright point in the film was the brief appearance of Ron Perlman as a fellow sharpshooter who is sent to help Vassily (Law). Perlman is always worth watching and isn't afraid to exploit his unusual looks. (Catch him in 'Island of Dr. Moreau,'--an otherwise dreadful film--'Name of the Rose,'--an OK movie--and the very odd, visually riveting 'City of Lost Children.' And, oh yeah--does anyone remember the TV series 'Beauty and the Beast'? Guess which part Perlman played...)I suppose the reason they put in the love triangle was to capture the female demographic. As a female myself, I say 'Shame on you, Jean-Jacques!' (Annaud--the writer and director.) Don't you think us women can't enjoy a straight war drama if it's done well?! Puh-leeze....Anyway, I was vindicated. I only went to this movie because my boyfriend wanted to see it. I had a good idea before I set foot in the theater that it wasn't going to bowl me over, but once the film rolled, and a voiceover came on to set us up, I knew we were doomed...Told ya so, sweetie!",5,0,1,18 March 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Stakes & coffins not the only wooden objects in this film
","I love the book 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker and have always hoped for a film version that would do it justice. I realize it's not the easiest novel to translate to film, but still...The biggest mistake (IMHO) that Francis Ford Coppola made was casting Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder as the Harkers. Keanu Reeves plays Jonathan Harker as if he were in need of a good enema. And Winona Ryder (while good in movies like 'Reality Bites') is clearly out of her depth here. I won't even mention their horrific attempts at English accents...What saved this film for me was Gary Oldman's sinister yet romantic portrayal of the bloodsucking Count. He made him more a figure of tragedy than horror. Two other factors are the set & costume design--atmospheric, beautiful. Sadie Frost and Tom Waits are a joy to watch. I always wondered about the inclusion of the character 'Quincey Morris' in Stoker's novel. Was he thinking of his American audience? This guy is a caricature, a Victorian Marlboro Man...which is exactly how Bill Campbell played him. Richard Grant has some good moments as the morphine-addicted Dr. Jack Seward, but those 3 Dracula brides? Puh-leeze! They were about as ghostly as lactating cows.Although, overall, I did like this movie, the 1931 Bela Lugosi version (cornball as it looks now) is still closer in spirit to Stoker's great novel.",7,0,0,30 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," Some length & redundancy problems, but much to recommend. . .
","My basic complaint boils down to one word: length. The film would be stronger and just as  visually beautiful with the trimming of about 30 minutes of footage. The first scene to go should be the Clooney scene on the beach--completely irrelevant. Second would be the scene where Nolte's character follows Travolta's around (like a puppy dog) aboard ship before the men set off for Guadalcanal. The point could've been made in 30 seconds or less. Next to go should be one, maybe two of the dying scenes. The film would lose no coherence by their absence. I would also shorten some of the 'nature scenes', cut a couple of soliloquies (Nolte's 'nature is cruel' speech was especially superfluous), and some of Pvt. Bell's misty flashbacks.That aside, let me say that I liked the movie. It was thoughtful, beautifully photographed, the characters were not the typical soldier outfit which seems to be recycled in so many war films and the movie did a good job conveying the insanity of war. There were many moments and one major scene in which this was conveyed: the taking of the Japanese camp. At what point does one side get to say 'We won!' How many people have to die, how many bullets fired, how many buildings burned...just how much is enough? The confusion of bullets, voices, smoke, faces, a soldier's hesitation when surrendering Japanese approach him. . .where does the killing machine end and the human being start? This movie also showed (a point usually ignored) that war is not just a human atrocity--it affects everything in the environment, even the insentient rocks.",Null,0,0,17 January 1999
