Lucky Number Slevin," Ten years later and I still love seeing this film
","Much like Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) Slevin tells the story about an average man (Josh Hartnett) who gets caught in an intricate and equally deadly web involving rival gangsters (Freeman, Kinsgley), a shady detective (Tucci), a world-renowned hit-man (Willis) and an irresistible girl-next-door type (Liu). I first saw this film when it was released on DVD. The sad part of it being that it was in the Wal-Mart discount bin, A display that everyone knows is filled with either really old movies or really bad ones. Being equipped with a five-dollar bill and no knowledge of the movie, I decided to give it a shot.Fast forward a few hours later, and I was taken aback by what I had just watched. Lucky Number Slevin completely took me for a ride.The movie starts off in an isolated airport terminal, with a wheelchair bound Bruce Willis telling a bystander a story about a horrific crime that took place years before. The story of the past crime deserves your attention as it will set up the rest of the movie and the events that unfold. There are a lot of elements that make this movie a joy to watch. First off, the acting talent. Hartnett didn't play his typical teenage heartthrob role, Freeman played a cold-blooded gangster opposite of Kingsley's conflicted Rabbi gangster, Willis did his thing and blew stuff up and Tucci played a hard-boiled detective with a shady past. And then there's Lucy Liu. Secondly, the direction. Paul McGuigan used his trademark style and perfectly blended action with suspense, mystery and the right amount of wit. Anyone who isn't familiar with his work should take a few days and binge watch BBC's Sherlock as he has been the one to helm a majority of the episodes. Lastly, the writing. Jason Smilovic, who has done only television before and after this film, really knew what he wanted to accomplish with a premise that's been played out. He successfully wrote a complex tale that includes the the twists and turns one would expect in a movie about mistaken identity. He was also able to pull off writing an ending that comes full circle without confusing the audience. In summation, Lucky Number Slevin teaches an old dog new tricks. The acting style of Hartnett is greatly complimented by two Oscar winners (Freeman, Kinsgley). Stylish action scenes don't seem over the top and aren't used as a filler (cough Michael Bay cough) and lastly the ending, while dark, will surprise and please the audience.IMDb gave Lucky Number Slevin a 7.8 out of 10. I'll agree with their score but why not just give it an 8? While it may have won the praise of critics, it was given a limited release that didn't allow the film to be properly recognized.If you haven't seen this movie before I highly recommend you do, it's a blast. This movie is definitely worth your time.",10,6,7,6 January 2016
Saw II," A lot more better for a few reasons.......
","I thought Saw 2 was a great action packed and wonderfully acted movie. It had a few connections with the first Saw which made it really cool. The acting in this one was a lot more better. No corny actors, it didn't have any famous people in it an I think thats one of the reasons why it was so good. The traps in this one were incredible also. It had a few twists which made it really good too. Basically this movie was great. I walked in there thinking the worst, but I was impressed. WARNING, IF YOU ARE UNDER 17 AND ARE NOT WITH A PARENT, IT IS A BITCH TO GET IN. I walked in, i had my friend by two tickets at two different booths, then before we walked in the movies, they had to check our ID's and of coarse I'm only 16, so i had to wait until the teacher of my school got to the movies and me and 20 others walked in behind him. Then before u walk in to the real movie, they still check your ticket stub and all that jazz. But all that pain and suffering was worth it. I highly suggest seeing it.",9,0,1,29 October 2005
Sicario," Not what I was expecting, and that's a good thing!
","While the trailers would have you believe that Sicario is drug war movie, and it is in certain aspects, it runs much deeper than that. We learn early on that the word Sicario means 'hitman' in Spanish. Quickly after that we are introduced to the main character that Emily Blunt portrays. She's a by-the-book FBI agent who becomes recruited to fight the war on drugs that are passing over the border. Once briefed on her assignment, we are introduced to a slew of characters from all facets. Shady, straight/innocent, morally corrupt etc. From the first op she runs with the agency that recruited her, we quickly realize that everything isn't as it seems. We are left 'in the dark' as much as her character is through out and it goes from being a seemingly action/thriller to a thriller/mystery in a short period of time. I'm not going to give anymore information away because I think you should see it for yourself. This movie has a lot going for it. Tension, violence, great acting from main and supporting cast and good cinematography. It may take a bit for you to really get into it but once you do, I highly doubt you'll fall out of the zone. Movie run- time was 2-hours, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) and has already been green-lit for a sequel. While I was keeping it at a rating of 7/10, once the final act started and some questions were answered, I'd have to jump the rating up to a 8.5/10",8,0,0,6 January 2016
Zombieland," a good, bloody, fun ride
","'oh no its a zombie! quick lets run away and try to survive this apocalypse' -every zombie movie made to this day. (thanks to george a romero) Zombieland however is the complete opposite. sure it may have four survivors trying to make a living in a world overrun by zombies, but they have fun while doing it. and when you go to see this movie you yourself will have one of the best times since Tarentinos Inglosius Basterds. the movie starring Jesse Eisenberg (almost a heir apparent to michael cera) Woody Harrelson, Emma stone and the young Abagail Breslin, takes you for a fun, bloody and a well executed ride. being a huge zombie fan i have felt let down from such recent zombie flicks like diary of the dead etc. zombieland didn't even come close to disappointing me, the whole idea of treating a world overrun by zombies like an amusement park makes this movie the gem it is. if you go see this movie and walk out disappointed, then im sorry but you sir/mam are retarded...bottomline go see this movie",9,0,3,30 September 2009
Munich," As good as it accurate
","When I first heard about this movie, I had no clue what it was about. So I researched it and I found myself interested in seeing it. When I went to see it I was expecting a long movie with only partial action. But I was surprised at the action and plot of the story. I definitely think that Munich was one of Speilbergs best films. I liked how the movie was almost 100% accurate and how it had a great cast. Although it only had two real famous actors in it, I liked the rest of the cast too. I think Spielberg did a great job at showing his view of the Munich massacre. The movie also has a great amount of suspense. There are things you will definitely expect when it comes to the killings and there are things that you wouldn't expect. Overall, I think this movie was excellent, I definitely recommend seeing it. Another thing I liked is how it shows a group of five ordinary men working for a secret service, taking out the men who planned Black September, later on you will learn that these five men are not alone and that there were many groups like them trying to accomplish the same goal in taking out the organizers. I said it once and i will say it again, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it may seem slow in the beginning but it only gets better with the action and drama. Definitely a 10 out of 10 film.",10,0,0,15 May 2006
