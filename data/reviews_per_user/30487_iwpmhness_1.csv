The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Money hunger games
","This is by the most boring movie I've seen this year. The production company just want to squeeze money out of people like me who apparently had nothing to do this Saturday afternoon but to watch a movie that maybe is okay~~ Alright, let me simply tell u why this is complete crap. Story is non- existent. Loop wholes as big as Twilight. Boring emotional scene with lame monologue.I think a law should be passed to forbid producing so many sequels for a single movie. It just make use of people's desire to finish something and the recognition from the first.. Frankly I would rate this movie zero star if I can. Yup, one more thing, Jennifer Lawrence performance was actually OK. But it is obscured by the laughable lines and story telling.",3,49,74,22 November 2014
