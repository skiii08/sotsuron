50 First Dates," An underrated classic. You all are going to say you were an adam sandler fan once he is gone!
","I saw this movie when it was first released and fell in love with it. I have probably seen it 100+ times since then. This movie is witty, funny, unique, sweet, romantic, thoughtful, well put together and sincere. The soundtrack is near perfect. Adam mastered this movie and it shows. I know adam sandler gets so much flack for no good reason. He is a true artist and even if his comedy is cheesy it is wholesome, quick, and sweet. It makes millions of people laugh and has for 20 years. 50 First Dates is a masterpiece. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are the greatest duo and have so much chemistry. Drew Barrymore is a sweet sweet angel who perfects this role. Also how could you not like a romcom based in Hawaii ?!",10,0,0,30 May 2020
