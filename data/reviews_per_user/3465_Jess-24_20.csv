The Blair Witch Project," the scariest movie ever made.
","i can not believe anyone who gave this one a bad comment.I hardly ever get scared at movies, but holy hell was i scared here! The haunting story of the death of 3 documentry filmmakers told through the eyes of a camcorder is the most brilliant idea to come along in ages, and it is played out as a non-typical horrer movie. There is only brief gore and one shot of it. the suspense comes from the fear of the dark more than anything else, unlike other horrer movies. Not since The Shining has fear been played out like it could drive you insane.  The story begins with 3 film students, all determind young people with an obvious knack for the art, and camping. They first destination is Burkittsville, formelly a town called Blair. But Blair has quite a colourful history involving a witch who likes to kill small children in the woods. She would often kill groups of them one by one while making the others stand in a corner. (If you didnt get the ending there you go.) The 3 would-be film students learn storys about it from locals in Burkittsville, which of course dont fase thier plans to film in the woods. Up in the woods their trip is all but cut off when of course they get lost. They turn against each other and themselves and are eventually drove close to insanity trying to get home. Thats all I'll spoil about the plot.Things I like about the movie: The idea of of mockumentry-horrer. No gore. (Well, a brief scene.) The scenes where they first find the furry stick figure hanging from the tree, and the house. Amazing acting. The best ending ever besides 'The Usual Suspects' Heathers confession-Powerful stuff. The scene with the two fisherman arguing.Things I didnt like: Way to much swearing, even for me. Sickness enducing camera. They would never keep the film running when all that was going on. Heather found time to do her hair a new way every morning. I go camping alot and I think this might stop me from continuing. As some commenters already said, they would have taken a guide or a cell phone. Thier footage was way to deep in the woods to be 'dug up.'
There you have it. the scariest movie ever made. Oh and by the way, I almost tore the cup holder off my seat when we first see the house.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Citizen Kane," Give me a break.
","**Spoiler** (But everyone who knows anything about movies knows the end anyway)Since I'm all of 15, I can't begin to imagine what kind of impact Citizen Kane had on motion picture history at the time. Frankly, I can't see any clear reason why this is the 'finest motion picture ever made in America'. Nothing about this film holds up today. The 'ingenius' camera work is merely shining a bright light over someones head. What's the big deal? Someone explain it to me please! At no point in this movie was I moved to feel for Kane in any way shape or form. Wells script is merely an altered version of William Hearsts rise and fall. Even if it wasn't intended to be a movie of the week style exploitation, (you know the drill-'Citizen Kane: The William Randolph Hearst Story; Sunday at 9:00 on ABC) that certainly the way it looked to me. Nice plot twist at the end too. Rosebud was his long-lost SLED. Maybe if I didn't know the end before I watched it that would have seamed a clever way to symbolize his lost childhood. Or not.
I'm just rambling, but someone please tell me what the big deal is with this movie? It's competing with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as the most over-rated movie I've ever seen.Go rent Casablanca, a true classic, instead of this sappy drama.",7,0,1,19 January 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," powerful moviemaking
","From the opening shots of the mountain town to the loving musical number in the finale, we are thrust into one of the best movie musicals of all time. The seamless plot has our young heros on a mission to save two juvinile Canadian actors from their exicution in a perfect 'Les Misarable' homage. The voices are terrific and the most is even better. (The rollicking 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?' being my personal favorite.) Granted, without spoofish songs it would not be the same, but hey thats what its all aboot.",8,0,0,21 November 1999
The Mummy," Let's bury this movie.
","'The Mummy' is horrible in every possible way. After seeing this, I stopped blaming people who say they lost faith in Hollywood.I've never seen such a mind-numbing, racist, overblown waste of time since 'Batman and Robin'. What do people like about these movies? They're fun? Is frying ants with a magnifying glass fun? In my short life, I've probabley seen about 300 movies with a spot of dialouge not unlike Brendan Frasers line 'Oh no, we're in trouble', when faced with a huge disaster mere seconds away. I've found better pieces of acting in my stool sample. What a cliche ridden, poorly acted, one joke piece of garbage. This is the kind of movie that 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' should feature. And their making a sequel? Who's staring? Corey Feldman?",1,5,12,16 January 2001
L.A. Confidential," doesn't parallel the novel
","This is one of the few movies I've seen that I can appreciate without understanding a lot of the idea. The writers filter just enough so you have to be paying attention. That's annoying to me, because the book was so weaving and sharp. I doubt James Ellroy had any say in the screenplay.The movie tried to be a slick, hit-straight film noir. While that was over all what the novel was on the outside, it was, inside, a deep story that was dark, disturbing, and sometimes sick. The tone down of this movie was necessary, but it tore away from the original idea. The novel was filled with pornographic detail and gore.A great movie . 10. A great book. 10. At the core, both very different.",9,0,0,18 February 1999
Taxi Driver," raw
","Taxi Driver is the kind of movie in which I'd like to have been beside the screenwriter while he was typing it out. It feels like it was written half out in one sitting, the other half two months down the line. We begin with Travis Bickle as a young, somewhat unthreatning character. He is unvilont, doesn't lash out or raise his voice, like he was uneffected by Vietnam. The odd thing is, somewhere along the line, he breaks down. But we don't see that as clear as we should, because we can't tell if he's disturbed to start with. All of a sudden, this calm little 'vigilante' lashes out in a violent way. What happened? He hates the city? He doesn't have to stay there. If he doesn't know that, is that why he's 'crazy'? Who knows. Then why, you ask, do i think its one of the ten best movies of all time? Because Mr. Bickle did what I would do if I were just a little bit crazy, and got away with it. Don't I just wish.",10,0,0,14 January 2000
Full Metal Jacket," great...to a point
","This is definetly one of Kubricks best and one of the best war films ever made....for the first half. After the bathroom scene and we finally head to Vietnam, the film seems to waver a little and concentrate on characters that should have been more developed int the first half, but wern't for one reason or another. It's defonitly a must for war movie and Kubrick fans but not for the casual movie watcher.",9,0,0,12 October 1999
Fargo," What is not to understand?
","This is definitely one of the best films ever made and certainly one of my favourites, but I've read alot of negative reviews here. One main whine among commentors is that they dont get it, stating they dont understand why people think it's funny. This is a DARK comedy, a BLACK comedy. The people who say this isnt funny are the same people who said Dr. Strangelove wasnt funny when it appeared.Why is it funny? The main comic quality i found, rests on Steve Buscemi's character ('How the F--k do you split a f-----g car you dummy? With a f------g chainsaw?') that still kills me. It's a display of every possible aspect of movie emotion. Comedy, romance, anger, greed... it's all here. As everyone knows, it isnt for everyone. But some people got it, and thats whats important.",9,0,0,27 July 2000
The Usual Suspects," excellent film
","This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen, if not the best. Although the plot may seem complicated, you really need to watch it from beginning to end. I've watched it many times and I understand the plot fully. Great movie. Go see it.",10,0,1,6 November 1998
Saving Private Ryan," highly overrated
","I can't see why everyone thought this movie was so great. The plot was improbable, and the whole movie was two big battles spewn together over 3 hours. There was no real drama to it. On the plus side, the acting was OKAY, and the characters were enjoyable, but overall, just a senseless war movie.",9,0,0,6 November 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Huh?
","#22? What's this?In a flashy, but extremely unbelievable martial arts outing, a jumpy band of swordsmen (and swordswomen) do battle over a flimsy-looking sword called 'Green Destiny'. Does anyone else think we lost some things in translation?By jumpy, of course, I mean this is like watching a 12th graders first green-screen course. Sure, it's interesting to watch a lengthy chase scene over some rooftops, but COME ON! They're jumping over lakes and hopping on 1 inch-thick branches! Now I'm not familiar with Chinese culture, so I don't know what 'wu-dan' (or whatever it's called) is, so maybe the movie should have filled me in? Is this common knowledge now? Is (A)'wu-dan' a martial arts system that somehow allows people to become lighter than air? Is (B)the whole movie some kind of elaborate fantasy that isn't intended to obey the laws of physics? Is (C)this just a boring, cliche ridden martial arts movie with no creative storyline or characters?My guess is (C)",Null,0,0,15 January 2001
Pi," Useless confusion
","'Pi' is unlike mainstream movies of all kinds, but for good reason. There's just no point in all this drivel, and Aronofsky treats the audience like idiots. Just like mindless cultists, people will follow this film down its narrow-minded path, searching for its devine meaning, but there is none. On the surface, Max searches for the meaning of life through a long number, like he's really going to find anything. In the core, there's nothing there; Max finds no interesting answers to any of the non-questions he searches for, just like anyone watching this over-indulgent garbage. There have been alot of good indie films about the meaning of life, but this is scraping the bottom of the manipulative barrel. Lack of color and a techno soundtrack don't make a film inventive, and the director would have you believe the plots very complicated, but in truth it's just very dumb.",Null,1,2,21 April 2001
Dumb and Dumber," one of the funniest movies ever made
","Clerks....Dr. Stranglove....Dumb and Dumber. A few of the funniest movies ever made. Each having a technique of dialoug for laughs. Tea and strumpets, falling off the jetway, its all perfect. Although not as gross as somthing about mary, its still much funnier. A pinnicle of american comedy.",7,0,2,21 September 1999
The Insider," Garbage
","The Insider is completely unworthy of all the praise it's been getting. 7 acadamey award nominations that could have gone to movies like Magnolia or Man on the Moon. First off, like I've probably said before somewhere on this site, when you make a movie the number one goal is entertainment. If you want to make a movie with a political point, people are gonna have to want to watch it. If they stop it half way through then you've failed. I've never walked out of a movie and i rarely turn one off before its done, but this was so BORING and without any form of emotion other than anger. All we really see is Al Pacino (in a role he's played a million times before) and Russel Crowe, who looks like a small water animal who cant fight for himself, banter at each other for some kind of betrayl. If its not each other its somebody else! What a waist of time.",4,1,2,30 April 2000
The Red Violin," emotional
","this movie, like a book of short stories, can hook you once and annoy you the next. The segments follow a violin for 3 centuries obviously shooting for a wide range of settings, thus a wide range of stories and characters. But they are all much different. The Red Violin will be rewarding for those who pay attention, and a pain for those who don't, because the transaction of the violin from person to person isn't smooth, whoever is not willing to pay attention should steer clear. I definitely recommend it to all big movie buffs, because those willing to see it, should. I really enjoyed Don Mcellars work before, and this is no different. Some segments, like 'Vienna' are very enjoyable and sad (in a good way, like bambi's mom getting shot) well some like 'Oxford' are dark and depressing. You may not leave thinking it's spectacular, but ya gotta respect it. Thumbs up.",9,29,41,6 December 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," it could have been a masterwork
","Any fan of thrillers, and (if it wernt for all the sex) Hitchcock, will probably enjoy this. I did to a point. What point? Well..... Have you ever seen a movie that was ruined by one scene? One brief spot of dialouge that sticks out? The final conversation between Victor and Bill. I'm just going to say that it destroyed the whole thing! It took all the mystery away! I left Eyes Wide Shut feeling empty and unthrilled, unlike i was for the first 3/4. And no, it's not boring for all you impatiant whiners who cant sit through a good.... well anything by the looks of it. 7/10 for one scene! could have been a 9!",Null,0,1,14 March 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," one of the best movies ever
","Every movie fanatic has to see this. It's not my personal favorite, but it is one of the ones I respect the most. The acting, directing and story are what makes it great. It's often sad, and often funny. It's much better than 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Titanic' (which sucked, by the way).A definite classic.",9,1,4,28 November 1998
The Matrix," whoa
","This movie has risen to fame faster than any other in resent history. And with good reason. It has once again raised the bar for sci-fi and special effects. The plot is somewhat old-hat, for if you've seen alot of sci-fi movies, the idea of parallel universes ain't all that different. But you must look past that. 1) the acting and dialouge are great. The actor who played Smith was excellent. 2) the special effects 3) the set directions and the costumes are great. The settings all very spooky. 3 good reasons beyond a good plot to appreciate the Matrix. It's 20 on the IMDB's 250 list and I hope it stays there. This has to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever. It should be compared to films like '2001' 'Star Wars' and '12 monkeys'. It will undoubtebly bring the directors to international fame. Did I mention you should go see it?",9,0,0,17 April 1999
Cube," It's gonna go places
","I have a feeling about Cube. This is the kind of movie that in 20 years, someone is going to catch on late night TV. Then a while later someone else is going to catch it on late night TV. There both going to recommend it to friends. Then those friends are going to see it and recommend it to two more friends. Then those.... oh i think you get it. We are in the midst of a cult classic people!What else can i say? The acting is great, the special effects are great, the suspense is the best ive seen in years.... ok ive written alot of reviews on this site and I'm running out of adjectives. Anyway, I loved this movie! Go see it!",9,0,1,18 March 2000
The Godfather," Amazing
","A fantastic movie. Its moving and gritty storyline takes you through a wide range of emotions: happy, sad, angry, and fearful, although you can never feel for the characters. (For obvious reasons). I liked the sequel personally better, but not by much. The series should have stopped at #2, because Mario Puzzo's novel spanned the first 2 movies. See it instead of sitting at your computer all day. Now.",9,0,1,28 November 1998
