The Monuments Men," Underwhelming
","Overall, this film looks and feels just like George Clooney himself - pleasing and agreeable from any angle but thoroughly underwhelming. An obvious spin off of the Ocean 11 franchise, this romantic-meets-history-meets-attempted action mishmash is based on a fantastic true story and features more first class actors than any recent films and yet... It falls flat on its belly. Touchy-feely almost to the levels of Dr. Phil, disconnected from the reality or historical facts, this film is a prime example of great intentions going nowhere. Even though the film is set against the World War II backdrop, the war itself feels more like a spoof, something you would expect to see in Toy Story, and the goofy banter does not save the day (though it helps to distract). Sadly enough, the actors don't have enough 'shoulder room' to play to their true potential, as their roles are rather schematic. Overall, it is not disappointing, yet not something worth spending time and money on. Wait for DVD",4,14,22,15 February 2014
