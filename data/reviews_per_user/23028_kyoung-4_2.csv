The New World," One of the worst movies I've seen
","While the cinematography was wonderful, it just couldn't pull this tedious movie out of its slump. This was boring, boring and more boring and it dragged on and on. I kept waiting for something of interest but alas, no such luck.It was as though the actors were half asleep the entire time they were shooting the movie. It was almost impossible to become invested in the characters and what was happening to them because the performances were completely one dimensional. No one was able to make me feel like I cared about what happened to them.Glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it - would have wasted $20. Thinking of seeing it? Don't bother.",2,2,8,22 January 2007
Children of Men," I was quite disappointed
","After all of the hubabaloo about this movie I expected a lot more.We couldn't see it at a theatre as it was only limited release here in Ontario Canada. We have no theatre in our town of 6,000. It didn't come to any of the towns a half hour drive north, east or south of us, nor did it come to the city an hour's drive north of us. We didn't want to drive on winter highways two or more hours to see it, but were quite disappointed not to see it on the big screen.That is until we rented it days after it was released. We'd read such great reviews and heard from relatives who had seen it that it stuck with them long after they saw it. So we anxiously put it in the DVD player and then spent the entire time waiting for something awesome that never came.It was an OK movie, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing special about it. What you saw in the previews was what you got. No deep meaning, no twists - just predictability. Maybe our hopes were too high, I don't know.It's not a total waste of time, but not a fabulous movie either. Wait until it comes on the movie channel - I wish we had.",6,2,5,31 March 2007
