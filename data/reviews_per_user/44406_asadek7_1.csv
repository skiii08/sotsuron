Catch Me If You Can," Hank's Worst Movie!
",Maybe this is the worst movie for Tom Hanks...In other words...It's the first bad movie for Tom Hanks.... as Usual..Steven Spielberg ruins the movie as he did with Minority Report and he turns out the actors into machines and takes away their ability to show us the great emotions and drama ...that's what he did with Tom Cruise and this time with the other great Tom....HanksSpielberg turned him to a lousy F.B.I agent with no creativeness at all..doing just his boring job to catch a boring kid and for what ?..to work in the next office to him in the end in the same boring job. that's itSpielberg turned the great actors to machines-like and ruined the whole beautiful emotionable story..so I don't think this movie is gonna win anything in the Oscar and I think it's a great chance for Tom Hanks to start thinking again about his Old movies and to try to get his high level back in the future...,1,4,19,8 January 2003
