Ford v Ferrari," Ford V Shelby?
","As someone who enjoys motorsports and LeMans racing in particular I was very eager to see this film. As far as historical accuracy, they just about nailed everything except for the Rolex 24 scene which is set in Daytona, Florida but was filmed at the LA area Auto Club Speedway. This makes sense and isn't a huge issue unless you are a racing fanatic such as myself. As for Ford V Ferrari, at times you really forget that Ferrari are the main antagonists. Ford V Shelby would be a more accurate albeit less marketable title. My issues with the film are that runtime is a little long and few scenes are somewhat cringy(Miles and his wife driving down the road and Miles and Shelby getting into a fight). Its Hollywood so you expect it but the movie could have done without both of those 2 scenes. Still as far as movies about motorsports and sports in general this sets the standard.",8,2,3,15 February 2020
