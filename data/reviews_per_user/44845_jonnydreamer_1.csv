It," A Masterpiece. My favorite film of the decade
","This was probably my favorite horror movie I've ever seen. And I've seen far to many considering my wife constantly plays horror movies in thr house. I came in not expecting much but left being blown away by the story, characters, comedy, action, cinematography and jump scares all wrapped together perfectly. The theater was either cracking up laughing or literally jumping out of their seat shrieking. It was a great experience hands down. 10/10 an absolute masterpiece. No question about IT.",10,7,17,8 September 2017
