Ford v Ferrari," Astonishing
","Ford v Ferrari is an amazing movie, the cinematography is stunning and the acting is so well done. The plot is based off the true story of how Ford motor company enlisted Carroll Shelby to build a racecar capable of beating a Ferrari. Matt Damon and Christian Bale have great chemistry as Shelby and racer Ken Miles. The storyline flows beautifully, the race scenes have stunning visuals and the characters are well played. Thoroughly enjoyable even for non racing enthusiasts.",10,1,4,18 November 2019
The King's Speech," Really brilliant
","The Kings speech is the epitome of an Oscar winning movie. A true story of a suffering monarch, the motivational but troubled relationship with his scruffy savior, and brilliant acting all around. The story told is truly powerful, that can't be denied. It felt historically accurate, which was quite lovely. The cinematography was absolutely excellent. It did feel a bit long, I could have done with a little less on the ancillary details, some scenes felt like fillers.",8,0,0,10 September 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Outstanding sequel!
","I really enjoyed this new installment of blade runner. The storyline is well developed, the characters have depth, and they are well acted. I thought Ryan gosling did and outstanding job as K. The main characters had great chemistry and it really made this film read so well. The storyline had a great flow and kept me captivated throughout the entire film. Great twist, left a somewhat open ending, all amazing!",9,3,17,27 February 2020
Angels & Demons," Comparable sequel, too long
","Plot was comparable to the first, the da Vinci code, but felt that it lacked the suspense or thrill in code breaking. The codes are in the forms of riddles and solving them to piece together the secrets of the Illuminati. But it didn't feel genuine. The twists are somewhat unpredictable but very traditional in nature, good guy turns out to be bad guy. That sort of thing. But even in that, I felt that the mastermind villains actions didn't really make sense when you thought back through the film.But just too darn long.",6,0,0,2 July 2019
Gremlins," Perfectly weird
","Definitely a weird 80s classic, with adorable gizmo, and diabolical yet comical gremlins. the animatronics/effects are out of the park for its time. A thoroughly enjoyable storyline, if not a bit more graphic than I always remember. The acting is okay and the lead up to the gremlins takes some time to get up and going.",7,1,2,22 April 2020
Miracle," Wonderful story
","A typical sports movie about a ragtag group of young athletes taking on the best of the world and coming out on top to the whopping cheers of the arena... and it was amazing! You can't help but get chills. One of the everlasting Olympic stories, the miracle on ice, is told in a really fantastic way. You can't help but love this movie for all that it represents.My only criticism is that it's a bit long. But we'll worth it.",7,2,2,11 July 2019
Sucker Punch," Unique
","An interesting way to tell a story, that's for sure. I wasn't always sure what was going on... but it works itself out in the end. Not very much dialogue, but it's not really needed. The cinematography is what steals the show, a visually stunning movie. Lovely dark vibes and kickass ladies.",7,4,4,2 July 2020
The Hangover," Hilarious!
","The hangover was truly the first of its kind, a main stream r-rated comedy. I remember seeing this in theaters back in the day and laughing til I cried. The story takes so many hilarious and unexpected turns as these lovable idiots unravel their night in Vegas. The first viewing is definitely the best, it looses some wow factor after you know what happens. But damn is it funny!",8,0,1,8 April 2020
Marie Antoinette," Interesting cinematic style
","The story of Marie Antoinette as told through quick snippets spanning her first introduction to France to her final night in Versailles. The movie certainly has an interesting / unique cinematography style. In that rarely are scenes longer than a few minutes and whole story lines aren't really played out. Instead it's glimpses into moments of Marie Antoinette's life as a French princess then later queen. The dialogue is very sparse, almost all the story telling is visual. All the music and language are modern, which makes it read as a revival (like that Romeo and Juliet with Leo).",7,0,1,29 July 2019
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice slays, as usual
","Alice was her usual badass in this installment in the resident evil franchise. The objective should never be to go in with high expectations, it's all about over the top action with a sprinkling of plot. This fits the bill. The storyline was a bit disappointing because it doesn't have much of a beginning or end, it all just kind of happens. Overall decent acting, good cinematography and zombie action. I thought Alice and Claire had good chemistry, and the newcomers held up as good cannon fodder.",6,3,3,22 February 2020
Minority Report," Maybe too much
","There's too much going on in this sci-fi thriller, leaving your brain a bit jumbled. Though it all basically works itself out in the end. The acting was good and the future technology fairly believable. The cinematography was a bit weird, everything had an aura that I'm not sure really fit the vibe. But, overall an enjoyable first watch.",6,0,0,16 June 2020
Mulan," Mulan, setting goals since 1998
","Mulan is by far the most kickass Disney character of all time, no contest. Taking on the entire Hun army, getting cast out, and still shows up to the final boss to end things right. Mulan is literal goals. The perfect mix of humor, action, and good old Disney magic. One of my favorites!",10,0,0,1 May 2020
Memento," Amazing
","The storytelling in this movie is absolutely stunning, the unraveling of the story as told from the end to the beginning, is so creative. There are so many twists and turns and I'm still not sure I have it all straight. I was blown away with how captivating this story is and how well it all plays out. Guy Pearce steals the show.",9,0,1,13 February 2020
Underworld," Selene!
","Kate Beckinsale owns this character, from the costumes to the acting to the down right badass action. The storyline is well developed, adding a sophisticated side to the werewolf v. vampire concept. The cinematography is dark and beautiful, the characters well cast and well acted, and the action down right cool. Can't ask for much more. Love this series!",9,0,0,3 May 2020
Elizabeth," Great setting, lacks chemistry
","The costuming and set departments knocked it out of the park on this one, truly beautiful. The acting was good, the storyline was interesting, but it all just sort of fell flat. I didn't think the characters had good chemistry and I didn't feel very emotionally invested.",5,0,0,20 February 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Surprisingly good
","I went in this with low exceptions, but found this surprisingly good. Rachel McAdams is so cute in this movie. It's the perfect mix of cheesy and goofy. Low key liked the songs and the acting was great from the whole cast. The storyline was well developed, though I could have done without the ghost of Demi Lovato. Otherwise, perfect.",8,2,5,27 June 2020
Knives Out," Great twist
","The ending was really awesome, with a perfect twist that I honestly didn't see coming. The plot was well developed and made for an awesome reveal. The acting from the whole cast was superb, Ana de Armas was perfect as Marta. There was great chemistry between the family members. I sort of felt like the story was slow going and the build up to the final reveal could have been streamlined.",6,3,8,29 November 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," Awesome action!
","The third installment in the resident evil franchise brings more zombie action and even bigger stunts for leading lady Alice. The plot takes place years after the second, which is a good choice, allowing new characters like Clair and K-Mart to be introduced. The storyline is well developed, the characters well acted, and the zombie action suitably amped up. Overall an enjoyable movie!",7,3,3,3 March 2020
Zodiac," Good acting, good plot, too long
","I felt that Zodiac was way too long. The plot was there (as its based on the true story of the Zodiac killer). But I just felt that some of the scenes could have been cut back on or taken out entirely. It moves too slow for my taste, especially in the first half.The movie almost seems split into two parts, the police trying to solve the murders, then jake gyllenhaals character trying to solve the murders. I found that the second half moved faster and was more intense and exciting. In the first half they focus too much on RDJs character.",6,2,2,21 June 2019
Ready Player One," Visually captivating
","A fun movie full of great 80s music and references. The adaption from the book is well done, keeping most of the key elements but pairing it down to make it more bite size. The concept is strong, the cgi is so well done, and the acting is pretty good. The bad guys are pretty lame which takes the suspense out. But it's a visually stunning movie.",9,0,0,30 May 2020
Corpse Bride," Pretty good
","A short Tim Burton film about a man who unexpectedly weds a corpse. The storyline is certainly different, but doesn't always flow well. The animation is creepy and cool, and over-exaggerated in that Tim Burton way. A great concept that could have been developed more.",6,0,0,11 March 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," Solid third movie
","A solid ending movie for the matrix, all plot points are wrapped up and it flows seamlessly from the second movie. This is a bit of letdown in the action department, the machine war and final boss battle are cool, but there's very little hand to hand combat. CGI and effects are well done and the acting's good. Great follow up in the series, but perhaps not so great as a stand-alone.",6,0,0,26 April 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Amazing graphics
","Epic movie! The graphics are out of this world. The voice is acting is on point, the plot is solid, the 4th wall breaks are subtle, and the characters are lovable. Oh, and the soundtrack and sound editing are amazing.
Literally nothing bad about this movie.",10,0,1,17 July 2019
Salt," Intense thriller
",Jolie kills it as Salt in this intense spy/coverup action movie. The action was well choreographed and kept up a good pace throughout. The storyline had a good flow and some twists were unexpected. The acting was good for an action movie. Overall a solid action thriller.,8,5,6,29 March 2020
Shrek Forever After," Fantastic!
","Surprisingly heartwarming for a Shrek movie. The animation is well done, the storyline has good flow, and it has all the classic Shrek charm. Though it deviates from the direct storyline, I find this to be one of my favorites in the series. Love seeing badass Fiona!",8,1,1,25 February 2020
The Fast and the Furious," Good acting, good action, poor plot
","The plot for this film is pretty weak, Brian is an undercover cop (is he a good one - umm not really) trying to bust a hijacking ring, falls into a team of racers and decides to choose them over the law. The acting isn't too bad, vin diesel and Paul walker hold their own, and the supporting ladies bring their A game. The action / car racing is pretty good, it's the early ages of CGI so the shots aren't the best, but most of the real racing holds its own. It's a fairly good movie, just lacks depth on the plot, jumps around and doesn't explore any of the characters too deep.",6,1,2,9 August 2019
Toy Story 4," Wonderful addition to the Toy Story Universe
","Absolutely a joy to watch, it have all the feels. Humor, heartfelt, and a little bit of scary. Had so much fun watching, laughing and loving until the end... where they always give you just a few tears. Loved having Bo Peep back. Honestly, Love the whole cast.",9,2,5,4 July 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great action
","The action scenes are absolutely awesome, the choreography it must have taken to nail those sword fights!
The plot is a little thin, lots of back and forth the intention isn't always clear.
But you don't really mind as the main intention is to pull off the supernatural samurai fighting for the perfect 'sword of destiny' and that totally works!",8,2,3,13 July 2019
Frozen," Disney magic
","Frozen is a pretty great example of Disney magic. The concept is fresh and interesting, breaking out of the typical princess storyline. A beautifully animated movie, with a great cast of characters.",7,0,1,19 January 2020
Ghost Rider," Pretty average
","Not a great movie but not a terrible movie either. The storyline is fairly well developed, the acting is pretty good, and the effects decent. Nick Cages 'accent' comes and goes and he delivers lines deliberately aimed at being southern platitudes which is completely unnecessary. Eva Mendes' character is underutilized and it's annoying that they make her so self conscious.",6,0,2,29 January 2020
Hellboy," Good action sci-fi thriller
","Hellboy is a great comic book adaptation, with a sarcastic not so superhero and his band of misfits. Acting is great from the whole cast, and dialogue flows easily. The action scenes are well rendered and the storyline easy to follow. Great make-up and cinematography make for a visually appealing movie. Really enjoyable.",7,2,2,15 September 2019
The Lion King," Amazingly beautiful
","I am a diehard fan of the original lion king, and I felt this was a worthy re-imagining. The 'live action' is a bit of a hoax, in that it's still animated. But it's still breathtaking and beautiful, I found myself smiling throughout. The visuals are just stunning. While most of the dialogue is the same as the original, there are some changes. Timon and pumbaa have their own riffs and jokes, and even play up a couple of references to the original. I thought the voice acting on both the kids and Glover and Beyoncé were great ( I couldn't help but say BEYONCÉ!). It was truly beautiful.",9,2,5,1 August 2019
Stardust," Wonderfully fanciful
","A really enjoyable movie. The acting is good, the cinematography vibrant, the storyline compelling. I can't really fault this for anything, it's not lacking in any area. The storyline is well done, and has a great flow. The characters are well developed and are fun to watch. Quite an enjoyable fantasy.",9,1,1,29 September 2019
A Quiet Place," Overrated
","I wanted to watch this because of all the hype, but I think this movie is a bit overrated. The first half is quite boring and a bit over dramatic (they're making nominal noise so why can't they whisper?). The second half is much better, once the action hyped up. But overall I didn't think the characters were well developed, the storyline was dull and lacked flow.",6,1,3,28 October 2019
Back to the Future Part III," An epic ending to a great trilogy
","A true action adventure in the west, the final installment in the back to the future trilogy delivers on action and adventure. The ending train scene is nail-biting! The storyline is well developed and flows easily from the second movie. The scenery is realistic and the old west characters feel authentic.",7,1,1,19 May 2020
The Illusionist," Boring
","I found this movie to be quite boring and the ending predictable. The illusions read too much like CGI to be believable. Overall, not my cup of tea. However, the acting and cinematography were quite good.",5,0,1,29 March 2020
Transformers," Awesome
","I remember this being so unique and cool when it first came out, and it still gives off the same vibes today. The action and CGI are amazing, the acting is well done, the actors and robots are well cast. It's a Micheal Bay movie, so of course it's just a bit too long. But the action keeps amped up throughout the entire movie. A one of a kind action/robot movie. Auto bots, roll out.",8,1,1,8 May 2020
Coco," Absolutely lovely
","Everything about this movie is wonderful. The characters, the meaning, the songs, the cinematography, the storyline. An absolutely lovely movie. Even as an adult, or perhaps because, I cried at the ending. Such love and such joy.",10,0,0,4 September 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Great action
","Action packed zombie goodness, but the plot leaves something to be desired. The characters are developed and well acted, but the storyline feels disjointed. In my opinion, the movie should have ended after the group escapes raccoon city, the last five minutes just serve to set up the next movie and don't add much. But Alice kicks ass as usual and it's a worthy resident evil successor.",6,4,4,3 March 2020
Jerry Maguire," Okay
","While the characters had depth and the concept was fairly straight forward, this just didn't land with me. Cruise and Zellweger didn't have the chemistry I would have expected, the storyline felt a bit disjointed, and the ending was a bit lackluster. Okay for a first watch. Regina King was the best part of this movie.",5,0,1,17 June 2020
Clash of the Titans," Amazing cinematography, strong story
","My absolute favorite thing about this movie is the cinematography and costuming. The outfits and visuals are stunning, it really makes the story unfold. The acting is fairly good, I think the roles were well cast for the gladiators and God's. Sometimes the storyline can be a bit sluggish and there are a few scenes I could have done without. But overall it's a good movie, with strong characters and storyline.",7,0,1,14 September 2019
Groundhog Day," Cute
","A quirky movie about a guy forced to live the same day over and over again. You watch the evolution as he firsts tries to use his powers for 'evil', then entirely gives up on living entirely, then decides to use his powers for 'good'. It's a really cute movie, the acting is great from everyone, and the characters are well developed. Really fun to watch.",8,1,1,30 September 2019
National Treasure," This movie is a national treasure
","One of my all time favorites. It's got good acting, good cinematography, and one hell of a storyline. One of Nick Cages best movies for sure. National treasure is the epitome of a wholesome adventurous movie. Combining history, intrigue, and treasure! A fun watch til the end.",9,1,1,27 January 2020
Total Recall," Good scifi flick
","A quintessential 90s sci-fi flick, total recall has it all. Aliens, cool gadgets, and lots of action. The acting is pretty good, but the dialogue a bit stodgy. Great FX for a movie of its age.",7,0,0,8 July 2020
Rocky," Yo Adrian - this movie should be more about boxing
","Pretty much everyone considers rocky a classic, with the penultimate scene as he runs up the steps in Philadelphia and proclaims dominance over the city in his quest to be the next champ. However, I wasn't all that impressed with the majority of the movie. The storyline is pretty simple, but spends way too much time on boring side stories and secondary characters. The scenes with Adrian's brother are boring and unnecessary, and he's crazy. The first half of the movie is rocky trying to hook up with Adrian, then about 2/3 in he actually focuses on boxing. Could have done without a lot of the beginning scenes.",6,0,2,28 July 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Pretty good... pretty long
","Was definitely intrigued by the code breaking and twists involved with the good guy bad guy routine. The ending was unexpected which I found refreshing, I didn't feel that each of the twists was predictable ( I haven't read the book)But it was just too long for me, and while they tried to convey a sense of urgency, it didn't really read well. The main characters were a bit lethargic and uninspired.",6,0,0,1 July 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," Amazing action!
","A great follow up to the matrix, reloaded adds more awesome Kung-fu fight scenes and killer action. The cgi and fight coordination are so well done, and comparable to the first movie. The storyline is well developed and has a good flow. The acting is good from the whole cast and the characters themselves well developed.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Burlesque," Awesome
","I have enjoyed watching Burlesque ever since it came out in theaters. Christina Aguilera absolutely slays in this movie. The storyline is well developed, if not a little slow, and sometimes goes off on unnecessary tangents. But it really doesn't matter, the singing & dancing bits are the main point, and are truly captivating.",8,1,1,20 December 2019
Scream 2," Worthy sequel
","As explained by randy, scream 2 follows the rules of being a proper sequel. Delivering more murders while avoiding the pitfalls of duplicating the plot of the first movie exactly. The storyline flowed well, the acting was good, and the 4th wall breaks just as funny as the first movie. My only complaint is that it was a bit long, some of the filler scenes could have been shortened.",7,0,0,22 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Scary!
","I was definitely hiding behind my jacket for most of the movie. The scares are for sure there, and the pennywise make up and acting are spot on. The storyline plays out well, and I enjoyed the transitions from the adults to children. The ending is a bit weird and doesn't always make sense. But I would consider the scare level on par and the storyline well developed.",7,0,0,28 September 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautiful movie
","Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?",9,0,0,5 March 2020
Scream," Horromedy.... Comerror?
","An enjoyable horror satire, that delivers on humor, gore, and scares. Scream capitalizes on horror movie cliches without being obnoxious about it. The fourth wall breaks and references to other horror movies are worked into the storyline perfectly. The acting is pretty good, and the storyline flows well. An awesome horror comedy.",7,1,1,18 October 2019
Back to the Future Part II," An incredible sequel
","Back to the future 2 is a incredible sequel in that it manages to interweave through the original while bringing in new storylines and characters. The storyline is well developed and well planned, the adventure keeps a good pace throughout and leaves you ready for more. The acting is pretty good from the whole cast, it's too bad they had to replace Jennifer, I liked the original better.",7,0,0,18 May 2020
Shrek," One of a kind
","Endlessly quotable and endlessly awesome, Shrek is the best anti fairy tell ever. The characters are well cast, the storyline well developed, it's just a damn good time.",9,0,0,4 July 2020
Black Panther," Some badarses in Wakanda
","Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie. Great action, great acting, and some good ole arse kicking. A superhero for the modern age, black panther gives us all the vibes. The ladies keep it real, redefining what it means to be a supporting role, and taking up arms in killer action scenes. I also quite enjoy a bad guy who is relatable and toes that line. Michael B. Jordan really shines as kilmonger, he makes the movie.",7,1,5,1 October 2019
Blade Runner," Pretty good
","I thought this was a pretty good 80s movie. It didn't blow me out of the water, and I don't necessarily feel the need to watch again, but it was enjoyable for a first time viewing. The acting was good and storyline flowed well and was fairly easy to follow. The characters had depth, and only said a few cheesy one liners. Overall a good movie.",7,1,3,12 February 2020
Space Jam," Mindless fun
",A fun looney toons / basketball crossover. Go in with no expectations cause there's not really much there.,6,0,2,12 March 2020
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Much better than the first
","I enjoyed this movie more than it's predecessor, the characters had more depth and the storyline was less confusing. The costume and set design are magnificent, the queens outfits are perfectly outlandish. The acting itself was quite good, Blanchett playing the older and more wisen queen, but Clive Owen kind of stole the show. Overall a decent movie chronicling the latter years of Elizabeth's reign.",7,0,0,4 March 2020
A Night at the Roxbury," Hilarious
","Funny in it's absolute ridiculousness! If you go in with your lowest expectations, you can have a good time. There's no plot, no point, and less than Oscar worthy acting. But the jokes are endless, will ferrel and Chris kattan have great on screen chemistry, and it has an epic theme song. It's a classic comedy born from an SNL skit. 'I broke the window again'",7,1,1,17 December 2019
The Matrix," Awesome sci-fi flick!
","A great send off of the 90s, the matrix is a one of a kind sci-fi action movie. The cgi and stunts are amazing, the choreography of the fight scenes are crazy good. The acting is great from both the good guys and the bad guys, Keanu is amazing. The outfits are badass and really send this over the edge, who doesn't want to look like Carrie Ann moss?!",9,0,0,22 April 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Amazing action
","Keanu Reeves slays as John Wick in this sequel. The action scenes are awesome, his character and acting are awesome, and the storyline flows well from the original. A mindless action thriller, with great cinematography, the final fight scene in the museum is almost poetic.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Gangs of New York," Too long, slow storyline
","I get why this has a high rating, it's an epic and lots of people go for that sort of movie. I however did not enjoy the movie that much. It was way too long, and the storyline dragged along. The acting is unquestionably good, and the costumes and cinematography are well done. But the directing style of focusing on small conversations and moments, for me is just boring. The action scenes are pretty epic but they don't come often enough. And the whole middle of the movie just takes too much time to go through. Its a historical piece, and while it's successful, there's no flow. This movie is just not my style.",4,1,13,24 September 2019
Back to the Future," A timeless classic
","I've seen this movie more times than I'd care to admit and I love it every time. The characters are well cast and well acted, they have great chemistry within the main characters. The storyline is unique and well developed, there are so many details it takes a few watches to pick up on. One of my all time favorites ... you made a time machine, out of a Delorean?",8,1,1,6 May 2020
