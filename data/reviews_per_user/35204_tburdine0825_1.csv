The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Riveting, thrilling, cliff hanger !
","I believe this one was actually a lot better than Catching Fire. It was a definitely one that keep you on the edge of your seat, constantly begging to know what is going to happen next. When watching this one, I felt myself a little more filled with emotion than I had been in Catching Fire. It gave the viewers a better chance at connecting with the main characters such as Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and even from Prim. They did an excellent job with graphics and south effects as well. The only thing that sort of upset me is how it ended, and the way it left us hanging. And also, the fact that we have to wait a whole year for the next part to come out. It was definitely worth the money spent, all in all a pretty good piece of work.",9,18,52,23 November 2014
