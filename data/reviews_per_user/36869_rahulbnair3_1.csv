Skyfall," SKYFALL did not rise up to my expectations
","1. The plot is shallow and very predictable towards the end. No surprises in this 'thriller' 2. Bond is getting old and physically unfit for duty. Many in MI 6 hence believe he is outdated. Yet he is employed for critical jobs (remember that the world is at stake here!)just because his boss M has a gut feeling that his field experience is more than enough. I feel little hard to digest this. 3. Only two fight scenes worth mentioning but has nothing innovative (Already saw similar sequences in Transporter series, Die hard 4 etc ) 4. Villain goes great extends with Hacking and Fire power. He pulls off a bombing at MI6 HQ and London subway with ease but had to struggle a lot to Kill M towards he end. Not adding up, if he is a master mind as portrayed in the plot. 5. Presence of Moneypenny (as a lead role in this movie) makes no difference to the plot.",4,12,27,7 November 2012
