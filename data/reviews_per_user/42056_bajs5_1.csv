The New World," Beauty is only skin deep
","I am always wary when the first praise of a movie is 'beautiful cinematography', it often hits of a lack of everything else. And 'The New World' is no exception.On the box it sounds promising, Native America Beauty falls in love with a Caption at a time where Settlers were make advances onto Native Lands, but Director Malik's handling of the volatile subject is weak.Worst of all Malik attempts to veil the film's short comings by artificially generating a 'sense of depth' by holding out. But there is nothing deep about this film, it's shallow.Beautiful cinematography doesn't make a film. It's a cop out.",1,0,4,10 November 2006
