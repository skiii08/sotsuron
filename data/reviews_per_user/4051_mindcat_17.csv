Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant and Brainy
","Today there is the Hollywood trash pulp horse dumps. These usually attract the lower IQ crowd who are not that deep in age of intellect.This film took a big risk. It was graphic, out of sequenced, not a lot of action and very stimulating.The risks are this film may not be a big ticket seller. It could have not broken even for what it cost to produce. The film was very much worth seeing.I have no needed to add anything about the plot as others have done that. The acting was first notch and the message clear. The dream and the reality often don't match. In certain instances the dream runs parallel with the addiction. The addiction wins and the dream dies.Graphic, heady and not a film for everyone. My rating 10. I can't fault it anywhere. It accomplished its ends.",10,1,2,23 February 2010
United 93," Powerful Drama
","Perhaps the best thing about this flick is it was difficult to find actors. The director honed the flick subjects to the point of total credibility.That said, we can recall the emotions of that day and its confusion. Although this was a creation of what might have happened, I found it well done.I couldn't help, wishing the flick could have the terrorists ousted and the innocent saved.I could not help wondering if this flight may have been saved with an earlier alliance of the passengers and the quick ousting of the terrorist from the flight seat. I sometimes think a third undisclosed emergency pilot should be on every flight. For example, what would have happened IF they ousted the terrorist and flip the plane's guidance computers back on before it was too late.I'll never know and neither will anyone, and of course such speculations are entirely moot.An exciting drama that should be seen.",9,4,6,6 April 2008
I'm Not There," Wish I could Rate This FICTION better
","Having grown up on the folkie Dylan and in fact growing from not caring for his music to a bold admiration for many of his early tunes, I was disappointed with this fictional piece of cinema.Dylan comes through as many people, but hardly the ones conjured up here. At some points his stomping and thin build remind more of Jagger than Woody Guthrie. The dark glasses and gimmicks, remind of Michael Jackson. The interviews where only double talk and gibberish are uttered, make one believe Dylan is a pot head, not a guru.So where is the real Bob Dylan? Can we honestly say Dylan really cared about the down trodden? If so there is virtually no interview where he can be so associated. One is left rather with the impression Dyaln is a ghost. Indeed, a man of constant contradictions within himself. And much of his poetry he admitted was gibberish, a abstract for write in your own impressions.Still many performances here were delightful, especially Marcus Fanklin's as 13 year old Woody Guthrie, aka Dylan on the road. Of course, it was all fiction! Dylan is a media created folk legend just as Oprah is an media hyped guru. Neither of them are really THERE.The most memorable line, someone accuses Dylan of being a ' c**k sucker', to which he replies, 'Ain't what is in a man's mouth, it's what comes out of it.'

Brokeback Mountain," The Finest Hour for Two Young Actors
","I have viewed Brokeback Mountain a total of three times on a 50 inch plasma. I spaced my views almost six months apart so I could grasp more completely and without prejudice, how I would rate this flick.It is beyond a doubt an American classic and looking back I regret so profoundly the death of Heath, who played Enis. The amount of acting skill and diversity it took to do such a touching and completely honest job, makes this young man, Heath Ledger, a legend.The scenes in the Brokeback were beautiful and allowed me to imagine somehow I was transformed back in time watch these young men.The truth is neither one of the characters was entirely gay, rather bisexual, but they did find each other as their own natural soul mates.Unfortunately cultural prejudice and homophobia prevented them from doing what Jack Twist had dreamed, ranching together on his father's spread.The final scenes are absolutely acted with such depth of character, the viewer is taken to tears. The Brokeback will not have Jack's ashes, since even in death, the culture denies him his final request, his ashes spread upon the Brokeback.Many of the bigots who have posted here on this fine cinema should be ashamed as they bray their ignorance for all to read.A fine film and probably one of the top love stories of all time in film.",9,20,22,10 January 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," A Very Wasteful use Of Digital technology
","I hope some of those that loved this video game stupidity will excuse me an intellectual and real movie lover. I will be merciful and let it die.I admit this sort of over done, quasi sci-Fi, something like Star Wars, just isn't my dish.I didn't watch what are apparently two previous additions of the Matrix.Now, if I could, I'd like an eight year old to explain it all to me, so at least I could make sense of some conceivable plot. None however is evident, not even a good vs. evil theme.Here is what I think its about. Somehow the star, Neil of who knows where, is a zonked out subject in some professor's lab that is attempting the merging of real human consciousness with a computer program. This will never happen, but I accept that this is science fiction.There appears to be good guys, Nieil (Luke Sky Walker) and a Indian woman (grannie) who is an Oracle spouting none sense. There appear to be villains that are really machine clones and dressed like an evil looking Jack Nickelson. OK, so then we see there are flesh and blood people wearing unbecoming ratty sweaters. These people want liberation and the dark machine side wants their extinction.Now, a machine killing a human is like a human murdering God, because where did these things come from if not human minds.Oh, well, I guess the major point can be over looked.There appears after this a lot of very classie special video effects, that must have cost a fortune to produce. OK, and maybe this showing off of how good computers have become in creating virtual back grounds with real actors somehow put in context, is the best aspect of this DVD.Now, in the end the human's appear to win, but win what. They live in a world less than hell would provide anyway.I guess I wanted to know if the dude who was running the program with his human brain ever go off the table. I did see that part.As for deep content or intellectual up lifting, forget it people with IQs bigger than room temperature. Its not there.",2,1,5,2 May 2008
The Shining," Best Horror flick even after almost 30 years !
","I had the opportunity to check out the DVD edition of this flick and on a 50 inch plasma was indeed almost as frightened as I was seeing it nearly 30 years ago.The flick is produced with great attention to detail and progresses slow enough to be compelling drama and fast enough to haunt ones memory.All acting was superb and with todays shallow directing, this flick remains at the top of the pile.The casting was also excellent from Danny LLoyd to Of course Jack Nick'.I did miss a few subtle things in my first screening of this movie and was fascinated by the apparent philosophical theme of eternal recurrence. Although this theory is said valid over huge amounts of time, this flick compresses it down from 1921 to 1980 !I also thought of another chiller that exploits ghosts and the same theme. Wind Chill. Both films are indeed chilling and enduring.",9,1,2,19 July 2009
The Patriot," So full of chestnuts it could have been a tree
","I assume anyone who watched this rather tear jerky and overly sentimental Hollywood chestnut are either neo cons or just plain stupid.I liked Heath Ledeger, but it was not a commanding part for his great talents. I think those crescendo in Brokeback Mountain.Now, aside from the stupid fantasies engineered to bring a glow to the old ladies sewing circle, the best part of the film was the cinematography.The script cheese and unbelievable.In order of chestnuts, Man with deceased wife raising a large number of all hand picked good lookers.Young love, brave men, children being murdered, old style villains.. my goodness what chestnuts did they leave out.The film is worth a watch, one time only.",5,2,5,24 July 2009
American History X," I wsih the director didn't have to preach
","This film began with such promise and toward center somehow lost its momentum and started to preach.The film had potential to move and defend without attempting to show how wrong rascism is. I ofcoure feel its wrong, but hardly needed a film like this to show me.The drama should just have unfolded without the Neo Nazi suddenly getting religion. Why not let the pieces fall where they will.It could have been a strong and powerful film, but turned into just another we want to show you why and please don't do this.It struck an almost condescending and proselytizing level. That why I gave it a six. Good, but hardly great.",6,4,9,27 February 2010
Legends of the Fall," Its so BAD its FUNNY
","Well, there are films and then there are turkeys. This thing doesn't qualify in that domain. So what could it be, a failed movie for TV or perhaps a farce fit to show neophyte directors and actors what not to do.Of course lover boy Pit does his hair thing and his acting is just so pathetic. But, then the entire story is so knee jerk predictable and hackneyed. It doesn't even begin to hold to the cultural standards of the period it was set it.Usually women who slept around too much in the early part of the century had secret visits to the helper lady. And, they were not respected, especially when they could not decide which brother's bed to entertain in.Especially funny was Anthony Perkins after his stroke. It was just too camp.It takes apparently very little of substance to entertain the public, as I am told this 'thing' was nominated for several Academies.Total waste of time and complete gibberish. I am glad I saw this 20 plus years after it came away in the Cinemas. Not worth even the cost the admission then.",2,11,22,3 June 2010
2012," This multi-million dollar flick was the Disaster
","If you IQ is under 100 and your age under 15, this flick is for you,otherwise its a waste of time. One moment it turns sickenly family values and the next funny as hell. What was the purpose of those slick comic lines, maybe relief so what audience was still watching would stay in their seats.On a science level this whole high tech Noah's Arc non-sensible flick was an F-. Neutrinos do not interact with matter much less cause a planet's core to melt.This movie was intended as entertainment for the not very bright and the not very old. I'm sure they would rate it at least a 7.The country and western music at the end which came way too late, tells what kind of audience the director was trying to reach.And by the way, if the world ever did end we could not be building arks, we would be building small space capsules with encoded DNA records for the life now all extinct. Funny how the phones kept working and lights stayed on even as the world crumbled.",3,0,1,1 May 2010
Rules of Engagement," A New Kind Of Racism?
","I bought this DVD, rather than renting, and am unhappy I paid even five dollars for it. The reason, is not that the flick is poorly acted or produced, rather the script is full of hung-HO American military mythologies.Lets begin, with the Marines in the Nam, doing whatever they can at not protecting the US, rather destroying a people. Later one of the North Viet Namese is seen, now a loyal American and in fact saluting the very man who was his enemy in 1968.That murder is OK, under certain battle engagement conditions. Our hero blows away the brains of a Viet Namese radio operator simply because the commander will not call off his men.Gosh, maybe Nixon and Johnson should have done that. A useless war is then used to back drop a massacre in Yemen. The plot seems to suggest, Marine always right, government officials always lie.Hogwash. A good flick made dirty by a bigoted and racist script.A don't bother flick, unless you're a red neck with an agenda.",4,1,5,29 December 2008
Paranormal Activity," The only thing horrible here is the movie
","I brought this film home thinking it actually might be scary. No way, it basically a film about two living together people and their rolling around the house saying banal and very dumb things.I suspect this format was to scare crap less people of high suggestibility and not very much sophistication.Bingo, you have the teenage weenies just sitting on the edge of their seats holding the significant other of the moment and screaming.It really trash and not worth even a rental.However if you've nothing really to do or plan other activity including deep sleep, during this flick, it could be for you after all.It did not scare me or my cat.",2,1,3,5 April 2010
Avatar," I must say this one sucked
","I had hoped with all the hype, this flick would be something other than a rip off for light minded teens and kids.I saw almost immediately plagiarism from Aliens Two. The dark glasses, the Marines, ah, sucks.. how did this guy get paid for copying this film script.Yes, the special video effects are enticing and actually charming, but a movie this alone does not make.One contributor of like minded view said the film writer took all of three weeks to write this copy cat work.Only a two from me.",2,2,4,3 July 2010
Super 8," Super Loser
","How could anybody, but a 12 year old and not a very bright one, give this so called blockbuster a rating better than 5? Its full of reused material from other grade B sci-fi from the past and only has the kids as a way to get an audience to believe this is good. Its a kids movie and if you keep it on that level, maybe its a 5. As an adult I could not bare to see the next foolish and predictable scene.If Spielberg can put this trash out and be a billionaire, there is something very wrong with American education. The whole story was foobar and way outside anything even remotely worth the price of a theater ticket if that ticket was more than a dollar.",2,1,2,11 February 2012
The Descent," A Very Bad Flick
","I guess, audiences today don't require too much in the way of plot, logical progressions and development of the characters and yes, believable acting.I bought this DVD to entertain some friends I have invited over and after previewing, think we'll pass.Why did I not like this flick. First because I am a generation or more older than most viewers that did and recall real suspense and terror in Alien. This flick wasn't on another planet, but had non-human terror makers, and a bunch of cheesy acting women who I could not root for the way I did for the female heroin, in Alien.Dumb and much too drawn out build up to the real terror parts of this flick, which really are too much special effects and lighting snafus to be sacry. I had trouble seeing where all this courage has come from in a bunch of trivial wise cracking women that take way too many stupid risks to feel sorry for.I thought this flick might appeal on a deeper subconscious level to some women who want to really give it to the male side of our species. The creatures to my view, all seemed more or less MALE in muscular development. But, this is of course my psychological training and a subjective impression.I was baffled by some of the ending scenes which seemed to make no sense.A grade A flick this isn't, but might make good light entertainment. On second thought, maybe I'll run this one by my friends and see if they need leave before its over.",Null,0,1,3 March 2008
The Happening," Finally Plants attack , and are found smarter than Teachers
","I watched this almost unwatchable flick this afternoon, and on the positive side, I did watch it all way through. I needed to do that to find what crack-pot science would show up as an explanation of plants turned terrorists. Now, we can always speculate, maybe it wasn't the plants or maybe it was the Russians. The end states to heck with science, somethings are just too natural to ever understand.You have heard of dumber than a beech tree or a fence post? These people are dumber than that.In any event some of the cinematic motifs used in the flick would have worked if the script were not so lame. By the way plants existed before animals and have a reverse metabolism. That is animals exhale carbon dioxide and plants reprocess this by product giving off oxygen. Oh, that was not an attack of the grass, was it?Well, we have plenty of people ending their sorry lives by various ingenious means, including being run over by a lawn mower. We have a cheating wife and a wide eyed really dumb looking biology teacher who attempts much like the scarecrow in the Wizard Of Oz, to put on his thinking cap. But, under the cap there is only straw so what could we expect.No truly profound acting here and a script so bad, well, it could make you laugh if your IQ is a bit over the boiling point of water, Celsius.I would say, this is a must not see for any child struggling with science in school. It might just push them below the D grade to the failure zone, not the Twilight Zone.",1,3,7,21 December 2008
There Will Be Blood," One of the Best Films I've ever seen
","This long film is not for children, the teen generation, under educated people or perhaps even Christians.I had to watch this film twice before I felt I was in anyway able to review it. I will only say, the viewer will take away something in them that stings and leaves them wanting.The drama could be viewed as the early robber capitalists of the early 2oth century. The stole, they lied, they did all manner of evil to gain more capital and especially control over society.The turfs are well cut, Eli Sunday, acted to perfection and Daniel Planview, the oil robber capitalist, also acted with precision and perfection.If you can think and want films that will make you do so, this is the film for you.The closing scenes reminded me of the Exorcist, where Satan attempts to weaken those who believe in God. With the exploitation and use of human frailties, Satan defeats Eli Sunday.See the DVD only if you are a mature viewer, otherwise you'll post here as soon lower level IQs have, the film was slow and a bore.",10,1,5,29 July 2008
