The Blair Witch Project," Most Over-hyped Movie I've Ever Seen
","I've seen worse movies, but not many.  Yes, I like horror films.  Yes, I can distinguish cheap, sensationalistic splatter-horror from from the more chilling, show-less-and-frighten-more variety (and I prefer the latter to the former).I still hated Blair Witch.  I don't lack imagination, but this movie certainly did.  I've seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear.  The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve.  I don't need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema.  For a real horror masterpiece, see Ringu (The Ring), which, though it was probably filmed on a larger budget, worked because of talented direction and great storyline.",1,128,215,16 February 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Vastly Over-rated
","I've loved horror films ever since I was a little boy.  I adored anything which starred Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney or Lon Chaney Jr., or any of the other horror greats from my childhood.  I later loved Dark Shadows, Night Gallery, and Alfred Hitchcock.  I've never enjoyed 'splatter' films, although I consider the first Halloween to be a minor masterpiece.However, I've seen only two films in my lifetime which actually scared me, and those were The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., and the Seven Faces of Dr. Lao. I don't know why they frightened my little-boy self, but they did.Blair Witch was so unhorrifying that I thought at first that those who expressed fright were pulling my leg.  I didn't need to be told that it was a fake; apart from the fact that the F.B.I. would have confiscated the film, and the murders would have been famous, the public outcry of a filmed murder would have been as enormous as if a snuff film had been released.  That, and the fact that there are no witches, and never have been (the claims of wiccans and neo-pagans aside), totally devalues the film.Remember that Dracula and Frankenstein were fictions that were presented as such, so the standards of judging them are different.Okay, I'll confess that I found Jaws equally boring.  No, I'm not jaded, but Blair Witch never once induced the willing suspension of disbelief necessary for a horror film (or any other) to work.All in all, the biggest cinematic let-down I have ever experienced.",1,2,4,17 October 2000
Cast Away," Boring & Trite
","I am not playing devil's advocate, but I cannot in good conscience read all of the hyperbolic praise for this movie without making a dissenting comment.First, Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks is not an actor.  He is a star, perhaps a superstar, and a comforting presence (much like Harrison Ford).  I am not an actor, and yet I could have easily done as good a job portraying Forrest Gump as Hanks did.  Tom Hanks is appealing in every film in which he appears, I acknowledge.  However, I find myself suffering from a Hanks-allergy.  This is certainly my loss, but I find Hanks too cloying to endure.Jimmy Stewart frequently portrayed the same sort of character as Hanks, but Jimmy Stewart had more than one facial expression.  Tom Hanks, unfortunately, comes from the Clint Eastwood/John Wayne/Harrison Ford school of acting - which means no acting is required at all, but only looking into the camera and quoting your lines with virtually the same emphasis on every word.  Of course, I know that these stars have more talent than that, but not much more.Second, Robert Zemeckis.  Has he really directed a good film since Back to the Future?  That film had a few surprises, but Cast Away had none.  Was anybody really surprised how it ended?  Was there a single element in the middle which surprised?  Indeed, if you took out the plane crash and the (admittedly humorous) roleplaying with the volleyball, was there anything about the film which even involved?Helen Hunt was, well, Helen Hunt.  If you are a Helen Hunt fan, then you were probably pleased.  If you find her plain and uninteresting (as I do - although my father finds her hot), then she added nothing to the movie.I have seen worse movies this year, but not many.  I hope that this review persuades a few people to spend their money on more worthy efforts - Before Night Fall, for example - and to reconsider the near-veneration that likeable, though not particularly talented, Tom Hanks inexplicably recieves.",Null,0,0,31 December 2000
Knowing," Profoundly Disappointing
","I'm a director fan more than an actor fan. Nicholas Cage I enjoy occasionally, though he seems to be in as many bad movies as he is good. Alex Proyas cemented my attention with The Crow and Dark City, and then earned my disdain with I, Robot. I hoped Knowing would be another winner --- after all, Roger Ebert liked it -- but it was not to be.The kiddie cast was largely pleasing, Lara Robinson (Abby / Lucinda) more so than Chandler Canterbury (Caleb Koestler). Our heroine, Rose Byrne (Diana) reminded me of a younger Jennifer Connelly. I meant that as a compliment.If you liked M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, then you have already seen Knowing, except Knowing wasn't as good, and I consider Signs to be one of the worst pictures I have seen in the last ten years. Only Transformers 2 scores lower on my suck-o-meter.It started out well, with an intriguing premise tautly directed. Then the whole thing devolved into the sort of twaddle that made What Dreams May Come such a bad picture. If you liked What Dreams May Come, then you might consider this review an endorsement.They dumbed down the concept of determinism to the point that it was egregiously wrong, but that's perhaps a minor quibble only interesting to philosophy majors.Profoundly disappointing.",1,4,9,5 July 2009
Paranormal Activity," Tinkerbell, Anyone?
","This is one of the best movies ever filmed on such a minuscule budget. Is it scary? Not really, but it does provide a satisfying adrenaline rush on more than a few occasions.I would have enjoyed it more if it had not been marketed to obvious idiots. If this movie had been about a guy buying a camera because his girlfriend had reported Tinkerbell sightings, would anyone ask if it was real? Living in this post-Ghost Hunters/Blair Witch Project world, the sad answer is probably 'yes.'The acting was very anti-Method. Stanislavski would have wept. However, as this film's topic already strains the limits of credulity, the natural, non-dramatic style of these young actors was particularly effective.",9,1,3,16 October 2009
Signs," Very Bad Movie
","I went to see Signs with something akin to hope. M. Night Shyamalan's previous directorial efforts were moderately entertaining, I had free tickets and free time, and my 15-year old daughter was eager to accompany me. So, with expectations of buttered popcorn and pleasant companionship, I headed to the movies.Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess) was marvelous. I don't know that I've seen such an impressive performance from a young American actor since Christina Ricci wowed us as Wednesday in the The Addams Family. Rory Culkin (Morgan Hess) did a credible enough job that I could almost forget his famous brother. The rest of the performances were adequate, but I can't say more than that.*SPOILER ALERT* The dialogue was embarrassing, the storyline maudlin (who didn't know that Mel Gibson would return to the clergy?), and the suspense was minimal. Okay, if you find reruns of Lassie or Flipper suspenseful, then this might have made you jump once or twice. My 15-year old didn't stir even during the cheap-but-(usually)-effective dog-snarls-and-leaps-suddenly-at-owner tactic.The movie attempted to be profound and address questions of faith, but all of the philosophizing was strictly at the sophomore level, and that is assuming that the sophomore is rather shallow. There will be some that say that I just didn't 'get it,' but I did, thank you, and what was to be had was meager fare.The film was occasionally funny, and I do thank Mr. Shyamalan for at least breaking up my tedium with a little humor.No, I don't need my monsters to be slavering, or my suspense to be served with buckets of blood, but I do need coherence and intelligibility. A movie about crop circles had seemed a weak starting point (15 minutes of research will demonstrate to anyone how boring and mundane the phenomenon really is), but I hoped that Mr. Shyamalan would surprise us. He is capable of it, but he was apparently was trying to make a 'message' movie on this occasion, in which he failed miserably.Oh, and what was it about the 'I'm melting' Wicked Witch of the West ending that convinced Mr. Shyamalan that it was a good idea?  Was it done as a homage? As other reviewers have pointed out, the movie was replete with other filmic references, and I do have to wonder whether they were deliberate.Two thumbs down, and a single star.",1,2,3,3 August 2002
