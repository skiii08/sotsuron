Blade Runner 2049," I'm A Convert
","I've tried to get into this film three times and finally succeeded. It was well worth the effort. Gosling plays against his natural charisma to be a convincing replicant, and it's difficult to follow him as a protagonist at first. Initially his performance seemed rather constipated to me but it pays off and you should take the whole ride before cursing this thing. Harrison Ford delivers the goods as usual and Ana de Armas is a lovely surprise. My initial problems: the pace, which is too slow for the material, Gosling's character, but that is a function of the script and it kicks in about 80 minutes into the film; and Jared Leto, a very good actor who unfortunately seems to have based his character on Ernst Stavro Blofeld - It's not fatal but it is disappointing. Give this one a good look and you won't be disappointed.",8,2,12,27 March 2020
