Vertigo," Hitchcock's greatest and most complex film
","An undeniably great film that had all the elements needed to make a classic. I am amazed at how complex the story is. I first saw it about a week ago and was confused, but after repeated viewings I understood it much better. Jimmy Stewart was great as always, but it was Kim Novak's excellent performance as Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton that was surprisingly effective. Bottom Line: If you haven't seen this yet, you're in for a spellbinding, suspenseful, and dark film. Too bad the reviewer below me couldn't see this and bashes it because there is not enough shootouts, explosions,and killings. 10/10",10,2,4,30 January 2003
Snatch," Cool movie
","While its not as good as LSATSB, it comes close. I love crime films and Guy Ritchie is England's Quentin Tarantino. His use of British gangsters and guns will be loved by those who saw the funny humor in Pulp Fiction. The film gets going fast with the heist of a huge diamond that passes through several hands during a series of complicated schemes involving bare-knuckle boxing, Irish gypsies, pawnshop owners, an overweight getaway driver,  a nasty criminal kingpin who disposes of unwanted bodies by feeding them to his pet pigs, and a dog who likes to swallow things. If you liked Tarantino's first two films and LSATSB, Snatch is a must see. 9/10",9,0,1,7 February 2003
The Patriot," Didn't Like it at all
","Even though I am an American, I find it truly despicable how the British are portrayed in this film. They are presented as ruthless killers, for example(Spoiler) in one scene Jason Issac's character kills a little boy for running towards his brother, whom the British were taking away. Then the British burned down Col. Martin's house(END OF SPOILER). In conclusion, I found this movie to be a true mockery of history. 4/10",6,2,3,28 October 2002
American History X," A movie that will stay with a long time
","American History X is a unforgettable film made even better by the exceptional performance from Edward Norton as Derek, the skinhead. He is absolutley brilliant and his performance in X makes him the best actor of this generation. Even tough the overall message of this film is a good one, you might find some of the parts disturbing and hard to watch. Great film, 10/10",10,0,0,19 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," And I thought Titanic was bad
","Oh, boy what an awful piece of crap. These kind of movies should be banned because they're influencing future filmakers to put a godawful love story in a film that deals with a major event in our Nation's history. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer should be ashamed of themselves. Truly a disgraceful film, especially to those who served in WWII. 1/10",1,1,2,16 February 2003
JFK," Stunning achievement from Oliver Stone
","Oliver Stone's JFK is a fascinating and throughly engaging piece of cinema about the, more likely than not, conspiracy surrounding JFK's death. I don't know if I believe everything in the movie but there are some things this movie says that I believe, a gunman on the grassy knoll, for example. Even if you still believe that Oswald acted alone(I don't see how) you can't deny how brilliant this film is and how riveting and thrilling it is. Oliver Stone's best and a film I would recommend to anyone seeking a good history lesson or just wants to be entertained for 3 hours and 20 minutes. The running time may seem long, but the story is so engaging, you won't notice. 10/10",10,2,13,1 June 2004
Kelly's Heroes," My favorite War movie.
","I first saw this movie when I was 12, around Memorial Day of 1998. I soon grew tired of it coming on TV all the time. Well, 4 years later I ran across it again and decided to rent it. I am literally addicted to to Kelly's Heroes. Its a one of a kind war film.",10,5,8,26 October 2002
Reservoir Dogs," One of the Greatest films of the 90s
","Tarantino demonstrated his talent for dialouge with his stunning debut masterpiece in 1992.Reservoir Dogs is my favorite Tarantino film and crime film. It is shocking, powerful, and very riveting with excellent acting, sharp dialouge, cool pop culture references. Tarantino could not have kicked his career off with a better film. It is a very violent and offbeat movie, however, anyone that has even the slightest interest in, not only crime movies, but in action/drama fans should definitley check this out. Great film !! 10/10 Oh, and by the way, the reviewer from Denmark thinks Jason X was a good movie, so I wouldn't take his bashing too seriously.",10,0,2,21 July 2004
Reservoir Dogs," My favorite movie of all time.
","**SPOILERS** I notice that the people who don't like this film say its because of the ear scene or its too violent. Well, first of all,(SPOILERS) you don't even see Mr.Blonde cut off the cop's ear, and although this film is indeed violent, its never glorified.Quentin Tarantino is a master of dialouge. He manages to make the most violent scenes humorous, somehow.  For example, the opening scene at the restaurant was brilliant and witty, then it goes(SPOILERS) right into the scene where Orange is bleeding in the back of Mr.White's car. Its like Tarantino was preparing us for the bloody scenes by putting humor in front of it. (SPOILERS) Also, it was MR.White who shot Nice Gut Eddie and Joe Cabot. 10/10 Brilliant Film.",10,0,1,11 October 2002
Pulp Fiction," A true original
","While I don't think its better than Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction certainly comes close. PF is definitley one of the 5 best movies of the 1990s and established Tarantino as an accomplished filmmaker. Everyone knows the screenplay, acting, and direction are top notch, so I won't get into that. Bottom Line: Classic film that everyone should see. 10/10",10,5,11,3 November 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One of the best crime films out there
","This is Guy Ritchie's first and best film. Any film that involves crime or mafia I love it and this is no exception. I love how funny and fresh the film is and although Tarantino's influences are evident, Ritchie never rips him off to the letter. If you like this film, see Snatch, Guy Ritchie's follow up to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I give this a 10/10.",10,0,1,4 February 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," How can anyone hate this movie?
","Its understandable, I guess, to dislike this movie, but how can anyone truly hate this movie. There is nothing to hate. Anyways, did anyone notice in this movie that the warden aged a little, but the captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) did not. The story started in 1947 and ended in 1966. Did anyone notice this?10/10",10,0,0,5 November 2002
Casino," Almost as Good as Goodfellas
","I should have not been surprised at how good this film was, since it was directed by Martin Scorsese. Anyways I was reluctant to see this film because some people say its just another Goodfellas or Scorsese is trying to hard to rekindle the magic from his 1990 masterpiece. But this did not disappoint. Robert De Niro gave, in my opinion, his best performance yet and Sharon Stone was great, although psychotic near the end. Now on to Joe Pesci. While he was great in Goodfellas, he was sometimes annoying in Casino. I'm not offended by profanity, but just about every other word out of his mouth is the F word. His performance in Casino was good, but doesn't beat Tommy in Goodfellas.I give Casino 9/10",9,0,1,3 January 2003
The Godfather," Perfect. As good as movies good
","There isn't anything more to say about the Godfather that hasn't already been said. Words simply cannot describe fully how good this movie is. Has arguably the greatest acting ever, excellent direction, screenplay, storyline, everything is perfect. 10/10 A masterpiece",10,0,2,16 March 2003
