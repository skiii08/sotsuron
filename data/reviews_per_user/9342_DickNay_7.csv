Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Still in Shock
","'Borat' is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time - probably since 'Blazing Saddles.' This is acting to the ultimate extreme, as Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a Kazakhstani reporter sent from his government to learn about the culture of the 'U, S, and A.' And what's truly shocking about this film is not the content (although some of it is ridiculous), but the fact that Cohen did not break character once; in a story in Entertainment Weekly it says the crew was pulled over by the cops more than once, and even then did Cohen stay in character. Although I don't think Cohen should get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, he should get his own category. Because this film - the message, the execution, hell, the whole idea of the thing - is completely original. No one will say this is the best movie they've ever seen - and it's probably not. But what everyone can say is that it's the most impressive feat in the film industry any of us have seen in a long time.",10,9,28,4 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A (Disconnected) Heart, A (Missing) Brain, and a Little Dog, Too
","'At World's End' opens with the stark image of a noose hanging limply, unoccupied, in a sunny breeze. At first this seemed a highly inappropriate image to impose on the viewers of this third (and possibly final) 'Pirates' film. However, upon further thought, it seems Gore Verbinski, the helmer of all three films, has brought into the spotlight a theme shrouded in the background of the previous two films: hanging, gallows, and general death. In the first film, Jack Sparrow paddles by an area near the port, where a small clan of pirates (they are now skeletons) are hung, with a sign across all of them: PIRATES, YE BE WARNED. And since that, there have been encounters, and near interaction with the gallows and the nooses, but none have proved fatal just yet. In showing us the stark image of a noose, Mr. Verbinski also mentally prepares us for a heady film, full of swords, brine, and a surprising amount of pathos.At the end of 'Dead Man's Chest', Jack Sparrow dives into the awaiting mouth of the Kraken, sacrificing himself for his fellow pirates. We then learn that it is the mission and determination of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and the apparently-undead Captain Barbosa, to rescue Jack, and in doing so, the world. This is a brilliant set up for the next film, but it is not used in 'At World's End' as well as it could have been. And the film's producers are not trying to convince you otherwise; in trailers for the film Jack Sparrow is heavily featured. This is understandable, as he is rescued (by his cohorts and by himself) within the first hour of the film, of which there are nearly three. From then on, it is the mission of Jack and his crew to find Davy Jones (the always-awesome Bill Nighy) and set his record straight with the man; however, it is Will's determination to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) from Davy Jones' locker. Those are the two main plot lines, and they are constantly intertwined with the other more diminutive ones, like those involving the elusive East India Trading Company.As was proved in the first two films, Mr. Verbinski has an adept hand with CGI effects; his combination of live-action photography and computer animation is seamless, to say the least. I mean, a major character's face is completely computer-rendered, and yet that character is the most emotionally readable of them all! However, Mr. Verbinski's talent is not equaled within the writing staff. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who co-wrote the first film with two others, and co-wrote the second picture themselves have penned this most recent script, which is long, contrived, and generally unfunny. The plot takes the first hour of the film to really kick into gear (it is supported mostly by a long action sequence in Singapore to jumpstart the film) and even when it does start to move, the film always seems tired and deflated. The 'Pirates' series has evolved much like the Kraken monster: in the second film, it was smooth, intense and supremely entertaining, and the third film is a dieing pile of skin and suckers lieing on an empty beach somewhere outside of Aruba; the breathtaking visuals are still intact, but, thanks to the actors and screenwriters, there is no spirit behind them, and the film is just a gaseous treatise, exhaling its final guttural moans, giving the world a few final toots of its horn, before its penultimate extinction.",7,1,3,27 May 2007
The Prestige," The Most Original Movie In Recent Years
","Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE is one of the most shockingly-original films I've ever seen; rather, the book of the same name by Christopher Priest is really the most original. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem ingeniously cast, with Bale as the inwardly-focused, pensive, quiet magician, and Jackman as his rival, a boastful, flashy showman. These characters also mirror the two actors' styles; Bale is more of a deeper character actor, and Jackman is, and always has been, very entertaining to watch, but his acting has always been like a bucket of buttery popcorn; it tastes good when you eat it, but you feel slightly sick after you eat it, and it has no nutritive value. Having said this, the two actors have never been better. The story is ultimately clever, albeit quite confusing at times. Much like the TV show 'Lost', the pertinent, plot-heavy duologue is intentionally vague, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. Just like a good magic trick - or a good Prestige, rather - the audience willingly immerses themselves in this twisting, creepy world; you WANT to be confused. (This is also the last line of the movie.) AWESOME.",8,4,8,2 November 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," A Vehicle for Streep That Breaks Down Every Few Minutes
","As many people will tell you, Meryl Streep is one of the best actresses ever to be recorded on film. And I'm not going to disagree with that opinion. In fact, I wholeheartedly support it. In the case of 'The Devil Wears Prada', it seems as though the original novel, written by Lauren Weisberger, was written for Ms. Streep. The character of Miranda Priestly is so perfect for Ms. Streep, it's scary. And, yes, this is to say that Ms. Streep pulls off the performance of her perfect-fit character with seemingly great ease, and a lot of brilliance. Anne Hathaway, who gets second billing, is Priestly's new hire, a bright-eyed young woman who knows nothing about fashion, but applies for an internship at Miranda Priestly's magazine (go figure.) The film sputters and starts, and it seems as though all the juciest writing has been saved for Ms. Streep, and everyone else gets the flip-side of the coin. The scenes that Ms. Streep is not in (about half) are tearjerkingly bad; you just can't wait for Miranda to return and steal the show again. Stanley Tucci turns in a superb performance as gay fashonista Nigel, who befriends and helps Andy, Ms. Hathaway's character. Entourage's Adrian Grenier is sleepy and dull as the token boyfriend, and he and Ms. Hathaway have an almost-negative amount of chemistry on-screen. The film's plot is almost nonexistent, and is almost immaturish in it's lack of structure and pacing, from its director, David Frankel (whom I hold in high regard for his helming of Part 9 of 'Band of Brothers'). To sum it up, Ms. Hathaway is upstaged by Tucci and Streep, even when they are not on screen. And that's about the highest praise I can give to any performance.",3,1,2,2 January 2007
The Departed," Finally!
","Finally, Martin Scorsese returns to the gritty underworld of crime in the United States. After 'Casino', he left it - for whatever reason - and made a few bombs, followed by 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator.' One could say that after so many years away from the crime underworld (over 10) Scorsese could have lost his touch. This is just not so. The camera flies around just like in 'Goodfellas' and keeps us on the edge of our seat for the two-and-a-half-hour run time. The violence, Scorsese's trademark for so many years, is kept in check by the director up until the bloody end - and that's not a British-ism; it's quite gruesome at the end. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as the rat of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the rat of the Boston PD inside Costello's crew, respectively. The plot is simple, but through his mastery of the camera, Scorsese keeps us interested and engaged. William Monahan's script is simple, but relatively well-done (this is only his second produced screenplay; his first was 'Kingdom of Heaven.') The supporting cast is excellent; Martin Sheen plays a high-ranking official in the Boston PD, Mark Whalberg plays his slight subordinate (Whalberg's Dingam is a real prick, but ultimately, a hero - kind of), Alec Baldwin plays the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who's tracking Costello (Costello's mole is within the Unit.) Scorsese has brought us back to the American crime underworld, and it is a journey that makes us realize: films like these are why we go to the movies in the first place.",9,2,4,12 November 2006
1408," A Very Smart, Strong, Brainy and Brawny Movie
","Did you see 'Derailed'? Yeah. Not too good. But Mikael Hafstrom is back, with an 180-degree-turn-around of a movie, starring John Cusack and Samuel Jackson. Adapted from the Stephen King short story of the same name, '1408' tells the story of Mike Enslin, an acerbic, acid-tongued writer traipsing around the world, proclaiming everywhere that ghosts don't exist. He also does so in his books, which aren't particularly well-received; it's more like they're not received at all, really. The film opens with Mike checking into a supposedly-haunted bed and breakfast on a dark and stormy night. Hafstrom doesn't even try to trick us into believing something scary will happen; he runs the opening credits during Mike's stay at the hotel. It's this kind of assurance and strong-handedness that makes '1408' so compulsively watchable, and entertaining on many levels. In watching the film, you feel like you're watching a film by a director who knows what he's doing, and who is confident in the final product. This isn't always a good thing (Michael Bay is one example) but Mikael Hafstrom, at least in this film, is very much rock-solid. Mike gets a letter in the mail which leads him, by way of his local library, to The Dolphin Hotel at 45th and Lexington in New York City. In the hotel is notorious room 1408, which has caused over sixty deaths. Why would the hotel still be in business? We don't know. But it doesn't matter. It's Mike's prerogative to check into the room and prove, once and for all, that 'ghosties and goulies' don't exist. Mike is able to check into '1408', despite much confrontation between himself and The Dolphin hotel's owner, played by Samuel L. Jackson. As you may guess, the room is full of nightmarish activity, and John Cusack is suddenly in a hotel room alone, and he gives a superb performance. Overall, '1408' is a very entertaining movie. Stephen King provides great material for film, stories that are frightening, but also full of insight into the human condition. It hasn't been since 'The Green Mile' that Stephen King's material was translated so well to the big screen; the writers take the characters, story, and emotional insight, but also something decidedly King-ian: his sense of play and fun amidst the horror. This becomes very apparent in the film's twisty ending. The really only solid performance in the movie is Cusack, the rest are so-so. But it really doesn't matter; Cusack shares the screen with only a few ghosts, and for only a few seconds. Combine that with Hafstrom's eye-popping visual effects, and the detectable presence of Stephen King, and you've got a brilliant film.",9,2,4,24 June 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Intense!
","'The Pursuit of Happiness', directed by Gabriele Muccino (who I thought was a woman by hearing his name), and Italian-born director, who, until now, has only done Italian films, is about just that: pursuing happiness. The funky spelling in the fourth word of the title is taken from a daycare center in the movie, run by Asian-Americans, who have a less-than-perfect understanding of the English language.Will Smith (that's right, the Fresh Prince) plays Chris Gardner, a dedicated but unlucky and unsuccessful up-and-coming businessman living in San Francisco. In 1981, when the film takes place, he is selling an X-ray-like machine to doctors, most of whom turn the product down. With his wife (Thandie Newton) working double-overtime, the three person family barely makes ends meet. (The third individual is Christopher, a five-year-old played by Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith's own son.) When Chris' wife leaves him, he makes the elegant but crazy decision to take care of Christopher, while trying to get a competitive internship at a brokerage firm. Because of the lack of need for Chris' medical equipment, and the fact that he doesn't get paid for the internship, Chris and Christopher leave their apartment, move into a motel, and, eventually, and only for a night, into a public bathroom at a BART stop.What makes 'The Pursuit of Happiness' such a great film to watch is because of Mr. Smith's performance. It is so intense, so utterly watchable, that it makes the film. Many scenes in the film, however, involve Mr. Smith running from place to place, without a lot of time to spare. I question the necessity of these scenes; they clog up the film, and make it seem as though the filmmakers were not confident in Mr. Smith's acting ability, so they shot a few minutes of his sprinting. Well, they are proved wrong time and time again over the course of this 110-minute film. Will Smith should garner at least an Oscar nom for his brilliant work in this film.Steven Conrad, whose last screen writing gig was 'The Weather Man', a much darker, more cynical and crass black comedy, seems back on track with this film. However sappy the film is, and it is some, Mr. Conrad reins himself in whenever he feels the urge to uplift, and, as Chris says at one point, 'bring me back to Earth.' While this 'Earth' is a moderately over-dramatized and somewhat-silly one, it pulls us in, and keeps up the pace for nearly two hours.This is a sublime film, though it is a little dramatized, and somewhat overly sappy. I won't spoil the ending here, but let me tell you, the ole' waterworks were going at a milllion miles per hour for the last ten minutes of the film. When Chris' wife is walking out the door, he tells her to 'get happy.' When I saw this film, I did.",8,3,6,22 December 2006
