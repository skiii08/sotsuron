The King's Speech," Stupendous
","I offer this film as evidence that 2010 was NOT an awful year for movies. Whether you consider Colin Firth's Oscar-worthy performance (and if he doesn't win for this film, I don't know what the man will need to do in order to finally garner an Oscar), Geoffrey Rush's inspired and brilliant portrayal of a freelance, unconventional speech therapist with a profound understanding of the psychological roots of speech disorders, Helena Bonham Carter's outstanding turn as Firth's wife, the incredibly well-written screenplay, or the overall production values of 'The King's Speech,' this film ranks among the finest cinematic portrayals of the power of friendship. Firth, as 'Bertie,' the second son of King George V of England, must assume the throne after his brother abdicates in order to marry the divorcée, Wallis Simpson (an American, no less). In addition to battling his brother's popularity even after his abdication (as Firth's character notes, most monarchs throughout history succeeded a dead predecessor), Bertie must also master a very non-regal stammer that has plagued him throughout life—and he must tackle these obstacles as England stands on the brink of WWII. This he accomplishes with the assistance of Lionel Logue (played by Rush), a commoner (and an Aussie, no less) with outlandish methods and a rather modern conception of equality—he refuses to call King George VI anything other than Bertie, a nickname used only by family members, and he insists that the King call him Lionel, not Doctor Logue. I cannot attest to the film's historical accuracy, but its depiction of friendship is powerful and endearing. This is a great film.",9,1,2,16 January 2011
Black Swan," Frightening look inside the artist's psyche
","'Black Swan' is an excruciatingly intense psychological thriller that evokes disturbing questions of identity and the dangerous lengths to which a performer (in this case, a ballerina) will go in order to nail a role. Natalie Portman is painfully good as Nina Sayers, an up-and-coming ballerina who finally gets an opportunity to dance the role of the Swan Queen in a production of 'Swan Lake.' But can she abandon her perfectionism (which suits her well as she dances the technically demanding role of the white swan) and embrace the wild passion required to dance the role of the black swan? As she attempts to master these dual demands, her psyche begins to unravel. She battles a demanding, controlling mother (played with calm menace by Barbara Hershey), a brutally harsh director (Victor Cassel), a provocative, carefree rival (Mila Kunis), and ultimately her own doubts, fears, and violent misgivings about her ability to be 'perfect' in both roles. This is the role of Portman's career, and I fully expect her to garner an Oscar nomination, along with Darren Aronofsky's directing and the film itself for Best Picture. 'Black Swan' is mesmerizing and enthralling.",9,5,11,22 December 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A snarky charmer
","If you don't mind the use of cutesy coincidences to drive a plot, this entertaining film just might charm your socks off. True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love—and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his 'soulmate' and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway—except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know—and 'click' with—another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place. If this film doesn't make you smile, then you've probably never felt your pulse quicken or experienced butterflies in your stomach when you lay eyes on the object of your affection.",8,0,1,26 December 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Powerful exploration of human nature
","This 2010 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film is one of the most powerful explorations of human nature to come along in the last few years. Through the story of Benjamin, a retired criminal investigator who has decided to write a novel about a murder case that has haunted him throughout his career, the director examines just what it means to hold on to one's passions, to maintain love and devotion in the midst of failure and loss, and to seek retribution. This film deftly weaves together a tale of mystery, political intrigue, unrequited love, and vengeance—all tempered with unexpected scenes of comic relief. Rarely are such epic themes explored so powerfully in such a small, personal story. Highly recommended.",8,0,0,22 May 2011
127 Hours," A remarkable story
","When I heard that Danny Boyle, the director of films like 'Slumdog Millionaire,' '28 Days Later,' and 'Trainspotting,' was directing '127 Hours,' the film adaptation of Aron Ralston's first-person account of his entrapment under a boulder in a Utah ravine and subsequent escape by cutting off his own right forearm, I thought, 'What an odd choice to direct that movie.' Now, after having seen the brilliant '127 Hours,' I just can't imagine anyone else having directed the film. Boyle's jerky, spasmodic approach, tempered by long moments of stillness and reflection, paired with the superb music of A.R. Rahman (the same composer who provided 'Slumdog Millionaire' with its unforgettable score), suits Ralston's story—and his character—perfectly. Of course, James Franco's tour de force performance as Ralston (it's not technically a one-man show, but Franco is alone on screen for the vast majority of the film's 94 minutes) contributes greatly to the film's incredible impact. Boyle and Franco, faced with the challenge of creating drama and tension out of an event that almost everyone watching knows will happen eventually, pull off the task admirably—'the scene' itself is almost impossible to watch, but somehow we must. By that point in the film, we have so much invested in Ralston's story that we simply have to see how it all happened. Ralston's triumph is so amazing, so remarkable, so inspirational that tears of joy (and yes, relief) will conquer the revulsion most viewers might experience as Ralston amputates his own arm in order to survive. This film is mighty tough to watch, but the reward is well worth it.",9,0,2,1 February 2011
Midnight in Paris," The charm of romance
","Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris' is a sweet and charming examination of romance—not only romance of the heart but also romance for the past. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a hack Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write serious literature. He and his fiancée, played by Rachel McAdams, are visiting Paris to spend some time with her parents before they get married. Gil obviously adores Paris—as does Allen, who shoots it as lovingly as he shoots his own beloved Manhattan—and wonders whether he and his fiancée should move there permanently. As he escapes his insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and a host of other literary and artistic figures. He falls for the lovely Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and he is ultimately forced to reconcile his romances with his reality. Allen's script is, as we have come to expect, witty and insightful and intelligent, and the film itself will win you over with its charm and its honesty.",8,0,1,18 February 2012
Horrible Bosses," More than funny enough
","This movie scores points for originality and the clever use of crude humor. For example, how hilariously disconcerting and squirm-inducing is it to hear Jennifer Aniston, whom we came to know and love as the sweet Rachel on 'Friends,' tell her befuddled male underling exactly what she wants to do with his schlong, grab his crotch, and behave like the horniest cougar on the Serengeti? VERY. Aniston plays one of the titular 'Horrible Bosses,' and her storyline masterfully turns the whole stereotypical sexual harassment scenario on its head. Colin Farrell (near unrecognizable a la Tom Cruise in 'Tropic Thunder') plays another horrible boss, although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. And Kevin Spacey, who never seems to do a bad job in anything, is the quintessential boss-from-hell. The high concept here is that Charlie Day, Jason Bateman, and Jason Sudeikis—as the unjustly abused underlings—will kill each other's bosses in a comically bizarre take on Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train.' They enlist the help of M*****f**ker Jones (Jamie Foxx) as their 'kill mentor' and hijinks inevitable ensue. Funny enough, and definitely good for more than a few laughs. Don't miss the gag reel at the end of the movie.",8,1,3,22 April 2012
The Town," Intriguing tale of crime and conflicting loyalties
","Better than your average caper movie, 'The Town' focuses on a group of four career criminals (led by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) from Charlestown in Boston. They're smart and good at what they do—until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always under-appreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting. Not quite sure this movie is Oscar material, as some have argued, but it certainly affirms that Affleck has matured considerably as an actor and a director.",8,1,2,23 January 2011
Shutter Island," Not Scorsese's best...
","I'm not sure exactly what is was about this film that didn't work for me—perhaps the fact that I've read the book and knew the 'twist' at the end ruined it for me—but there was something about 'Shutter Island' that never quite got up to speed. DiCaprio was solid, as always, Ben Kingsley did his usual classy, impressive job, the film looked great (some very Hitchcockian tones and textures), the music was good, and the script was well done. The flashback/fantasy sequences might have been somewhat over the top (Peter Jackson indulged himself in the same way in 'The Lovely Bones'), and overall this movie was just not as good as the sum of its parts. Not Scorsese's best, but even that's better than the work of most directors.",6,2,6,19 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A tease, as expected. Also quite good, as expected.
","I was prepared to be disappointed with this movie, but I resolved to see it anyway. I'm a completeist—I've read all seven Harry Potter books, and I plan to see all eight Harry Potter movies. I steeled myself: 'Just get through it—the final one will be GREAT.' Well, I'm kind of disappointed that I wasn't disappointed. After all, the final book in the series is definitely not one of my favorites, and I knew the almost total absence of Snape, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts would certainly diminish this film. What we're left with is Harry, Hermione, and Ron on the run for almost the entire film, with prolonged cameos by heretofore minor characters. But what this set-up does (and more effectively than the book does, I might argue) is foreground the relationship among these characters and how it has evolved throughout the series. There is nothing childish about their complex entanglements with each other, and the intensity of their performances (especially Rupert Grint's) is very impressive. The film is, by necessity, incomplete—the conclusion is more like a dramatic pause. And yes, the entire thing is one huge tease—but it's the best kind of tease, because you know there'll be a great payoff well worth the waiteven if it is seven months away.",7,2,2,24 November 2010
Hugo," A kid's movie for adult kids
","The themes that Martin Scorsese addresses in this film—the thin line between self-recrimination and nostalgia, the effects of advancing technology on thriving art forms, and the lasting effects of a father's love—would seem misguided in a typical children's film. 'Hugo,' however, a children's film directed by Scorsese—one of the greatest American film directors of all time ('Taxi Driver,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Aviator,' 'Raging Bull,' 'The Departed')—is no typical children's film. Scorsese has made a children's film for adults who still experience the joys, wonders, mysteries, and painful epiphanies of childhood.First of all, the 'exotic' setting of a 1930s Parisian train station establishes the wistful tone. The film is beautiful to behold—the colors, the cinematography, the set design, and the art direction are all stunningly beautiful. The plot itself focuses on the titular hero, a young boy who lives in the rafters and bowels of the station and spends his time adjusting the station's numerous clocks, evading the menacing pursuit of the Station Inspector (played by an appropriately surly Sacha Baron Cohen), and searching for parts that animate the automaton left to him by his dead father (played by Jude Law in an unfortunately brief appearance). Through the course of his quest, Hugo encounters an elderly shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley in another masterful performance), the shopkeeper's god-daughter, and a film historian. Through these connections, Hugo begins to piece together not only the mystery of the automaton but also the impact of the beginnings of cinema as an art form.The film is sumptuous, the plot is charming, the actors are magnificent—yet somehow the film amounts to far less than the sum of its parts. I found myself bored at many points during the film—the story seems to linger a bit too much, allowing the viewer to appreciate (almost excessively so) the aesthetic and nostalgic beauty of the film. Overall, I'm glad I've seen it, but 'Hugo' is not a film that I plan on ever watching again.",6,0,0,3 June 2012
The White Ribbon," Somber. Moody. Slow.
","It's not often that a film leaves me perplexed ('Inception' notwithstanding), but I must admit that I had a very difficult time understanding what was going on in this film. The children in this movie play a key role in the growing sense of menace and fear that permeates the small German village where they live. Someone is terrorizing the village, committing brutal crimes, and no one seems to be able to figure out what's going on. The children seem to be implicated in much of the mischief, but it's nearly impossible to tell them apart—which child belongs to which family. Is this kid the steward's son? The pastor's daughter? The Baron's child? It all gets too confusing. Maybe it's too much to ask of a contemporary German film (yes, it's recent, despite the early 20th-century setting and the black-and-white), but I would appreciate a bit more clarity, at least when it comes to differentiating the characters. I know the ambiguity in the plot is intentional and the whole thing is supposed to be some sort of extended allegory for the domestic roots of German Fascism and the titular white ribbon symbolizes childhood innocence and so on—but please. Enough already with the heavy-handed artiste-ry.",4,5,12,27 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," Worth the reboot
","Despite all the hand-wrenching and teeth-gnashing over the idea that it's just too darn soon to remake Spider-Man, this film proves that there's no time like the present. Andrew Garfield, who seems born to play the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, delivers a nuanced and multi- dimensional performance that will erase the memory of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man from the minds of all but the most hardcore fans of the original. The fact that most American film-goers aren't very familiar with Garfield (if they do know him, they might have a vague memory of his performance in 'The Social Network') seems to work in his favor—he doesn't need to shed the baggage of any earlier roles to convince the majority of the audience that he is indeed Peter Parker.As for the plot, it's pretty standard comic book hero/action hero/monomyth hero action fare—but the plot isn't really the reason you go to see a movie like this. The supporting cast—Emma Stone, Denis Leary, martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Rhys Ifans— is top-notch, and the action sequences are artfully balanced by dialogue that develops the characters and adds insight into their relationships. The 3D effects are very well done and used judiciously so as not to overwhelm the film, and Marc Webb (what a great name for the director of Spider-Man) does a masterful job directing just his second feature film.Be sure to stick around after the first round of credits—there's a teaser scene that hints (very obscurely) at the sequel.",8,2,13,4 July 2012
Bridesmaids," A smart and funny movie--not just for women
","A very funny movie, 'Bridesmaids' is more than just a female take on 'The Hangover.' Although the movie did contain some thematically Hangover-like elements (general silliness and buffoonery), one scene in particular—and I'm talking about the scene when the bridesmaids all go shopping for their dresses after having dined at a questionable Brazilian restaurant—manages to outgross even some of the raunchiest 'guy' movies. Kristen Wiig is hilarious (as always) as the main character whose life is spiraling to rock-bottom (loser boyfriend—played by an uncredited Jon Hamm at his absolute smarmiest, lousy job, bizarre roommates) just as her bff (Maya Rudolph) is planning her wedding with the assistance of a new buttinsky bff, played with appropriately haughty aplomb by Rose Byrne. Melissa McCarthy is offensively hilarious as the earthy sister-of-the-groom who lacks any sense of tact, and Jill Clayburgh (in her final film role) is quirkily earnest as Wiig's mom. Although the film devolves somewhat into a typical happily-ever-after master narrative (Wiig's character really can't be happy until she finds a man—luckily, that man is played by the handsome and charming Irish actor Chris O'Dowd), its sharp sense of humor and caustic wit definitely make it worth seeing. And just try to resist singing along to Wilson Phillips' 'Hold On' during the wedding scene.",8,1,4,22 June 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A worthy addition to the Apes oeuvre
","I admit that I'm a huge 'Planet of the Apes' fan. As a child, I loved all of the original films, and I even 'went Ape for a day' when movie theaters showed all 5 original Apes films back-to-back in one day back in the mid-1970s. I'm also a fan of the Tim Burton 'Planet of the Apes' film (which is far more faithful to the source novel than the others). So it was with a sense of trepidation that I viewed this latest 're-imagining.' As it turns out, my fears were for naught. This film, which pretty much reconceptualizes 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' (the 4th film in the original franchise), is a smart, exciting, and surprisingly sophisticated take on how humanity could engineer its own demise at the hands of another species. James Franco is solid in the lead as a researcher with a strong sense of ethics and a passion to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that plagues his father, played by the always brilliant John Lithgow. The real star of this film, however, is Andy Serkis, who gives life to Caesar, the chimpanzee who is torn between his love for humanity and his duty to his species—and whose performance is surely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Don't worry if this all sounds a bit hokey—it plays a lot better than it sounds. Add a star if you're a die-hard 'Apes' fan.",8,1,2,14 January 2012
Insidious," Beware the gas mask
","'Insidious' is 70 minutes of good old-fashioned horror movie creepiness. The story is familiar to any fan of classic horror movies. A happy family moves into a new house, and weird stuff starts to happen—books appear where they don't belong, odd noises emanate from the attic, apparitions appear and disappear. And then one of the sons lapses into a mysterious coma. The wife/mother (played by an appropriately distraught Rose Byrnes) implores her husband (Patrick Wilson) to move—she insists that the house is haunted. He acquiesces and they move to a new home, only to find that the haunting continues. For a brief time after the move to the new home, 'Insidious' looks as if it's destined to become a contemporary horror classic, reminiscent of 'Poltergeist.' But then there's a fateful scene involving a gas mask, and the movie rapidly goes downhill. The remaining 30 minutes or so of the film focuses on astral projection and other dimensions, and 'Insidious' seriously loses its way. The ending telegraphs an almost inevitable sequel, which I'm sure will be a disappointment. Too bad—I had high hopes for this one.",Null,0,2,11 November 2011
Kick-Ass," Pretty much its own genre
","This is the best 'fake superhero who stumbles upon a crime syndicate that ruined the career of a cop who's now seeking vengeance by training his pre-pubescent daughter to be a lethal killing machine' movie that I have ever seen. The script is clever, the action is intense, and the violence is cartoonishly operatic. I was disappointed to see Nicolas Cage (hands down, my least favorite actor, especially since he robbed Sean Penn of his first Oscar—I mean, 'Leaving Las Vegas,' REALLY? Anyway, I digress) in this film, but I was satisfied with his fate. I'm not usually a fan of violent chopsocky flicks, but 'Kick-Ass' was definitely a cut above—not your run-of-the-mill wannabe teenage superhero flick at all—I'm eager for the sequel.",8,1,3,6 September 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Excellent thriller
","This superb cinematic adaptation of the novel captures all of the intense drama and intrigue of the main story while justifiably (and mercifully) abridging the details of the rather mundane and yawn-inducing narrative frame that sets up the central plot. The film, however, is rather long (over two and a half hours), but it definitely rewards the time investment—the performances are excellent, the story is engrossing, and the plot graphically illustrates the original Swedish title of the film ('Men Who Hate Women'). I suspect that the length of the film, combined with the need to read subtitles (along with many Americans' cinematic chauvinism), explains why most Americans will not see this movie but will instead wait for the altogether unnecessary American remake (starring Daniel Craig). Their loss. 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is one of the best intelligent thrillers of the last few years.",8,2,6,9 August 2010
Clash of the Titans," Another disappointing rendition of the classic myths
","I was desperately hoping that this version of the film would improve upon the original by remaining faithful to the myths it used as its source materials and focusing more on the inner struggle of Perseus, a quintessentially conflicted Greek hero who initially refuses the call to adventure but ultimately triumphs over adversity to benefit his community. But rarely have I seen such monumental talent—Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Sam Worthington—so monumentally squandered. The CGI special effects are definitely impressive, but the story is muddled (what the heck is a djinn doing in the middle of this movie?), the action sequences are almost impossible to follow, and the dialogue is weak. In fact, the most entertaining aspect of this film is its one sly reference to one of the silliest parts of the original version—that ridiculous mechanical owl. Unfortunately, if anyone should be brave enough—or stupid enough—to remake this film yet again at some point in the future, this flawed version will also provide many opportunities for mockery.",4,1,3,26 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," Excellent no-frills scary movie
","This is your basic no-frills scary movie. But oh my, how very effective those simple techniques can be. The last movie to scare me as much as this one did was 'The Strangers,' another film that proved high-tech special effects and exorbitant budgets are not necessary in the production of a genuinely scary film. The documentary style this film uses definitely creates a sense of credibility and realism. Comparisons to 'The Blair Witch Project' are inevitable, and BWP probably paved the way for films like this and 'Cloverfield.' I simply see it as the development of a genre--and that's a good thing. If you like to have the s*** scared out of you, rent this one, turn off all the lights, and prepare to be spooked.",8,2,4,13 February 2010
Super 8," More than the sum of its parts
","Essentially a pastiche of numerous other movies and film tropes you've seen countless times before (think 'E.T.', 'The Goonies,' and 'Close Encounters' with a dash of 'Romeo & Juliet'), 'Super 8' is that oddly appealing kind of film that amounts to more than the sum of its parts. There's actually nothing original about this film that focuses on a group of middle school students making a zombie movie in their Midwestern town in 1979. Their quaint enterprise is disrupted by a cinematically epic train crash (the most impressive sequence in the entire film) that signifies, of course, more than meets the eye. The titular camera plays a pivotal role in unraveling the mystery behind the train crash, as do our intrepid young hero and his star-crossed crush (the daughter of the town drunk/ne'er do well who may or may not have been responsible for the death of our hero's mother). Despite the clichéd ingredients, this film boasts a strong heart and a dedication to classic narrative and character development—elements that make this film much better than your typical mindless summer blockbuster.",7,3,8,12 June 2011
Thor," Solid comic book movie
","I suppose any review of *Thor* ought to begin with the reviewer's expectations—if you're expecting a solid comic book/mythology movie with a strong sense of the comics ethos, a solid leading man who thoroughly inhabits all aspects of his character (from bathos to boorishness), a rather one-dimensional villain, and lots of rock 'em-sock 'em action encased in a simple, mediocre plot—then you will probably be satisfied with *Thor.* If you're expecting anything else, you can pass on this one. The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile. Despite these two casting mistakes, the film is an enjoyable diversion, and it works well—as long as you're not expecting it to be something other than what it claims to be.",7,0,1,30 July 2012
Zombieland," Funny-scary
","Horror movie spoofs are becoming pretty common—some of them are great ('Scream'), while others are just forgettable. The really good ones manage to both spoof the genre and simultaneously exploit its effectiveness. 'Zombieland' does just that. The main character has developed a list of rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse, which we can easily assume he has developed from watching lots and lots of zombie movies. These rules flash on the screen at strategic moments, and we come to appreciate their wisdom. The plot, although clever and amusing, is subordinate to the characters here—Jesse Eisenberg as our hero (who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a definite handicap when one is fighting zombies), Woody Harrelson as the bad-ass who's hiding deep sorrow, Abigail Breslin (yes, the girl from 'Little Miss Sunshine') as a rough tween who fears nothing, and Bill Murray in a hysterical but all-too-brief cameo. This one is good scary fun.",7,0,1,29 August 2010
Crazy Heart," Engaging portrait of a flawed talent
","Jeff Bridges' incredible performance is not the only aspect of this movie that deserves praise. Bridges—who will most likely win an Oscar for his performance (sorry, Colin Firth, it was just your bad luck to deliver your best performance in the same year)—inhabits the character of Bad Blake so thoroughly and convincingly that you forget you're watching Jeff Bridges; he truly gives life to this alcoholic but talented country singer who is searching for some joy and redemption at the end of his career. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful in a supporting role as Blake's girlfriend, and Colin Farrell is a genuine surprise as Blake's protégé, Tommy Sweet. (By the way, who the heck knew that Farrell—and Bridges, for that matter—could sing so well?) Bonus: the soundtrack is awesome. Interesting cinema synergy—Robert Duvall (still a working actor at the age of 79), who produced this film and has a small supporting role, won a Best Actor Oscar in 1984 for playing a character similar to Bad Blake in 'Tender Mercies.'",9,38,52,29 January 2010
Burlesque," A campy, fun hot mess
","'Burlesque' is definitely the campiest film to come along in a long time. Before seeing this film, I suspected that it might be the new 'Showgirls,' but alas—it was much better than that. It truly embraced its lack of originality—small town girl with tons of talent escapes banal existence in Iowa and heads to LA to seek fame, fortune, and love. There were, however, some very 21st-century elements added: Stanley Tucci as the benevolent gay sage (Hey, Stanley, aren't you in danger of being typecast in this kind of role? Just sayin'), a hot—I mean HOT—I mean HAWT—male love interest for Christina Aguilera, played by Cam Gigandet (and not only is he Hot—or did I already mention that?—but he's also quite charming), and Cher in all her surgically reconstructed glory. I must admit that Cher's appearance was sometimes so distracting that my mind wandered from the story (not to worry though—it was quite easy to re-orient myself to the achingly simple plot) and I began to wonder whether Cher's enormous lips would go rogue and devour her face. At any rate, for a singer, Christina Aguilera proved to be a pretty good actress, although I doubt her 'skill' could stretch beyond this type of role. The songs were adequately entertaining, and there were some clever bits of dialogue amid the mostly clichéd script. Overall, a campy guilty pleasure.",7,2,4,25 November 2010
Inception," Worth a second viewing...and probably a third
","Although 'Inception' is certainly an entertaining film, I suspect that Christopher Nolan's primary purpose in creating this labyrinthine and intriguing work of cinematic art was not entertainment. I believe Nolan wants to provoke our preconceived notions of reality and self-will and tease us with the idea that we can never be certain of the nature of reality—or our ability to conceive an idea wholly independently. The plot of this film is almost beside-the-point—that's not to say, however, that it isn't clever or exciting. It is in fact a complex tapestry of narrative layers and dreams within dreams, dreams that feature characters who engage in the legendary struggle between passion and reason. But the plot and the characters are there merely as tools that allow Nolan to examine his grand themes. I've seen this film just once, but I strongly suspect that a second viewing will yield a far more satisfying experience.",8,2,6,9 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," Very entertaining and very well done
","This latest installment in the X-Men franchise—technically a prequel, another 'origins' story—features lots of action and thrills. Not only is it a worthy addition to the series, but it also manages to transcend many of the clichés that often hamper prequels. Many directors of prequels try to cut corners, assuming that the audience already knows the characters and just wants another story featuring those familiar characters. And although we do know most of the major players in this film—well, if you've seen the original X-Men films, you know them—we don't know how their relationships started and how the dynamics among them developed. 'X-Men: First Class' is a genuine comic book action adventure film—and, considering that it's over two hours long, it moves at a very brisk pace—but it's also the story of how a community of 'others' began, how they developed their identities, how they related to each other, and how they ultimately became divided into the opposing factions we've come to know. If you detect sociocultural metaphors within the story, that's all well and good, but the director is not interested in conveying some profound cultural message here. He's interested in making a fun-filled action movie, and he succeeds very impressively. The performances are top-notch, especially Michael Fassbender as the young Magneto and the always-solid James McAvoy as the young Charles Xavier. And be on the lookout for Hugh Jackman's brief but highly amusing cameo as Wolverine.",8,0,2,4 June 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Just plain bad
","I suppose I was naïve to think that this third installment of the Twilight cultural phenomenon would be any better or more interesting than the first two 'films' in the series. To be honest, I watched this (and read the first three books) out of a sense of pop culture obligation—I do need to stay abreast of the popular trends in YA literature and culture. Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special? That the only thing worth looking at in this entire film is Taylor Lautner's bare torso? I shudder to think that the final installment of this series will be divided into two films. Please, have mercy and end this entire Twilight fiasco already.",2,7,10,29 May 2011
Moon," The alien within
","'Moon' is an intense little movie that will probably knock around inside your brain for a while. Sam Rockwell, in the performance(s) of his career, plays a technician who has spent three years working in isolation on a moon base. As his time at the base nears its end, he begins to discover some inconsistencies in what he's been led to believe by the energy company that employs him, and he begins to doubt his very existence, along with his memories of life on Earth. Kevin Spacey supplies the voice of Gerty, an ambiguously helpful computer (and a direct descendant of HAL, from '2001: A Space Odyssey'). Produced by Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) and directed by Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son), 'Moon' is a sharp, smart, and understated film that delivers a scathing message about our willingness to sacrifice humanity in the name of efficiency.",8,0,3,22 February 2010
The Fighter," What makes a fighter
","Despite the inevitable comparisons to other movies about boxers ('Rocky,' 'Raging Bull,' and even 'The Wrestler'), 'The Fighter'—although its protagonist is a pugilist—would still be called 'The Fighter' even if he weren't. The toughest of Micky Ward's fights do not occur in the ring—they occur with his family and himself. This is ultimately a film about fighting against the restraints that prevent us from achieving our potential (those self-imposed and those imposed by family members who claim to have our best interests in mind). Mark Wahlberg delivers what is probably the most understated and effective performance of his career, Christian Bale is astonishing as his crack-addicted brother who insists on perpetually reliving his own singular moment of boxing glory, Melissa Leo is amazingly detestable as their Medea of a mother, and Amy Adams—best known for playing meek, sweet, likable characters—displays impressive range as Micky's feisty supportive girlfriend who's battling some demons of her own. Everything about this film is utterly great—from the performances to the script to the directing of David O. Russell. 'The Fighter' is, so far, my favorite movie of the year (and yes, I'm including 'Inception'), and I see Oscar nominations for everyone.",10,3,5,17 December 2010
