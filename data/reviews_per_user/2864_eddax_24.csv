Whip It," Drew & her cast whip it good!
","Okay, finally I see why Ellen Page deserved an Oscar nomination for Juno. Her performance in that movie was pretty much obscured by its overwhelming dialogue, but here, she really shines in a similar role of a teenager growing up and discovering herself while facing adversity. It is a lovely story too, how she joins a very physical roller derby in Austin to get out of her little town and makes good friends while she's at it. And it's a nice balance of comedy and drama and action, with just enough of each genre to keep the movie going at a good pace.There is a great supporting cast in this movie. Marcia Gay Harden is her usual perfection as Page's ex-beauty queen mom. Kristen Wiig gives a surprisingly tempered performance and even has a scene in which she shows that she's ready for a dramatic role. Juliette Lewis is more fun as the villainess than I've seen her in a long time. And Drew Barrymore is charming as usual in an otherwise small role, since she was the director of the movie as well. I hadn't even realized she was the director till the end credits and I was wondering a little about why her part was so small. Great first work, Drew!",10,2,6,6 September 2010
Changeling," Some quibbles but still a brilliant movie by Eastwood.
","Clint Eastwood doesn't do happy endings. For the last half-hour of the movie or so, he strung my emotions out hoping against hope that he would go against tradition but no. Gah. And yet, like his best works of late, Changeling is an amazing watch.Set in the 1920's, a single mother loses her son only to find herself saddled with a boy the police claim - no, insist - is her son. When she actually stands up to them, they denounce her and eventually lock her up in a mental asylum.I think the 20's must be a time alien to most viewers nowadays. I was quite annoyed with many of the movie theater's audience giggling at inappropriate moments. In this day and age, it must be hard to imagine how the police can be so overtly corrupt, and how women were supposed to know their place and remain meek and subdued. Admittedly, even I thought some of the events that took place bordered on the ridiculous.What makes this movie not quite at the level of Eastwood's Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby for me are a few minor quibbles. The pacing seemed somewhat off for me: the initial focus of the movie was on how the mother and her missing child, but then it switched over to spotlight the kidnapper and his abettor, as well as their dastardly deeds, and then over to the corruption of the police and their subsequent exposure, all for a bit too long before returning to mom and her child. And while the last-hour of the movie was effective in that it was emotionally draining, it did get a bit trying how Eastwood would tease over and over as to whether he would reveal the child's fate or not.The child actors could've been better. For the most part, I couldn't see their emotions on their faces, and everything they said seemed overly rehearsed.And there's the refrain. Eastwood's scores for his movies usually sit fine with me, but here, whenever the music comes back in, it's always the same refrain, so much so that I had it stuck in my head even after the movie. A movie's score is supposed to be complementary, not annoying or distracting. But like I said, these are all minor quibbles that don't really affect how powerful the movie is.With all the constant hullabaloo about Angelina Jolie and what she's up to, it's easy to forget that she really is a great actress, and this movie is immeasurably elevated by her talent. Right from the start, Jolie exuded maternal instinct - perhaps the most important quality for this movie - and convinced me of her dedication towards her child. In the next 2+ hours, Jolie's character would suffer torment after torment and yet she never fell into the traps of over-acting or melodrama. Not to mention she emoted everything as a 1920's woman.I have to say that Clint Eastwood is my favorite still-living director today, even if all his movies are as depressing as heck. Here's hoping he stays around to make many more.",9,1,2,27 May 2009
The Young Victoria," Needs more beheading
","It is a tricky thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other, she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds, since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line. Emily Blunt is quite radiant as Victoria, but it's not as full a performance as I'd like, no blame to her. I can't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth. Hence Blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions, at least not to the full extent, since she's, y'know, the young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs Brown.Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie. He last did C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and propelled him to fame. It was quite a different movie but I remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was by Julian Fellowes, and though I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. I soon got lost with all the governmental politics. Maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy. I'm just saying.",7,3,4,18 February 2010
The Ring," Nowhere near as scary as the original
","Remakes of movies are often considered to pale in comparison to the original. In this case, The Ring has gone beyond pale. It's practically transparent. Case in point: I gave the original Ringu a 9; this movie I'm giving a 2. To be fair, if I had not watched the original movie before this one, I would probably give it a few more pointsSo where does this movie go wrong? I would say most of the fault lies with the director, Gore Verbinski, and his, well, chosen direction for the movie. He's taken one of the best horror movies out there, and art house-ified it. The result is a movie with luxurious cinematography but horribly inopportune splicing. In virtually every scene that's supposed to build to a scare, the movie ducks out before the payoff. And the montage that's on the cursed video simply looks like a collection of random shots, whereas the original montage looked appropriately like a portent of doom. The screenplay for this movie mirrors the original significantly. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the deviations the writer made. I don't recall too much of Ringu, having watched it years ago, but I'm pretty sure the horses weren't part of it and the boy wasn't psychic. I felt they were diversions that distracted from the main Samara plot. And oh yes, 'Samara' doesn't sound half as creepy as 'Sadako,' not to mention how much creepier Sadako looked too. The only thing I liked about the plot was that it managed to explain the aspects of the curse decently, including stuff I didn't catch in the first movie like the symbolism of the ring.It's terribly frustrating, trying to understand The Ring's appeal, particularly since most of the people who've seen it say it's scary. I reckon that if they ever watched Ringu, they'd have a heart attack.",2,0,0,22 November 2002
Inglourious Basterds," Essential Tarantino
","It's kinda hard to describe Inglourious Basterds if you don't understand what makes a Quentin Tarantino movie because that's essentially what it is. It looks like a war movie, or a Brad Pitt vehicle, but after watching it, you know it doesn't fit into either mold. Tarantino is... irreverent yet worshipful. His movies tribute the most obscure of classics, or 'classics,' but with his own unique spin. There is a lot of violence but those scenes don't have the gratuitous feel like they're there to provide cheap thrills. Rather, they're always creative and often with a good suspenseful build-up and infused with his twisted and wicked sense of humor, and all quite exhilarating to watch. Basterds was mesmerizing in just about every way. Set in WWII, it plays like a WWII action drama, though the story is offbeat enough for you to soon realize that it's not. It's a fascinating tale that's brought to life by diverse talented actors from the US and EU and filmed in gorgeous locations around Germany and France. And though I was captivated by the movie enough to not have spent any time wondering about how it would end, it was still a doozy of an ending (that pretty much confirms that it's not historically accurate). PS I wish the deleted scenes featuring Maggie Cheung would surface!",10,0,7,16 February 2010
500 Days of Summer," A rare insightful romantic comedy
","Well this was a rare insightful romantic comedy in which the guy doesn't wind up with the girl. I'm not sure if the movie required non-linear editing - not sure what that accomplished - but I like the story that was told. I find both characters very plausible and likable. The guy's a hopeless romantic but resilient enough to get over heartbreak (though not before a bout of depression), and the girl's a secret romantic who hides behind her motto that she doesn't believe in love (till she finds it). And even though they have a nice romance, relationships don't always work out, often because one party is just not as into the other, and it's really no one's fault. C'est la vie and moving on. And it's great that the movie ends on an appropriately positive - if not cheesy - note. Downer finales don't really befit romcoms.",9,0,0,18 February 2010
Shutter Island," Not sneaky enough
","I realized after that Shutter Island is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote the stories behind the good Gone Baby Gone and the great Mystic River. All three movies definitely have parallels in terms of darkness and... film noir-ness. From the trailer, I was expecting Shutter Island to be a supernatural thriller but I wasn't disappointed that it wasn't because it's still a very effective and engaging thriller. Scorsese set up the ambiance well, though sometimes the score felt overhanded and heavy. The story - an involved mystery - is interesting and twisty, but for all its sneakiness, the Big Reveal doesn't come as a huge surprise and afterwards, I didn't have that feeling of 'Omg, I have to watch the movie over again to see what hints I missed' as I did with The Sixth Sense. And while the cast was good, there weren't any standouts as with Lehane's other two book-movies.",8,0,1,6 September 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Half-intelligent, half-silly, but great George Clooney
","With such a title, and with actors like George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey as leads, you pretty much know where this movie is headed. I expected an intelligent comedy and I did get one for the most part, when the movie didn't wander over to silly territory, which happened all too often for me, and when it didn't get bogged down by unnecessary - and possibly unintentional - drama, which was fortunately just occasional.George Clooney gives my favorite performance of his yet with this role, which had him doling out both witty and slapstick humor with perfect deadpan-ness. I would've sooner given him an Oscar nomination for this than for any of his dramatic movies. Jeff Bridges is... uninspired casting. This role is too similar to his very memorable one in The Big Lebowski. The casting of Kevin Spacey is quite uninspired as well. I'm quite tired of seeing him as smarmy villains. Actually I think he comes across as smarmy in most roles, which is probably why I never really liked him. Ewan McGregor was in the movie too but as the straight man, he was all but eclipsed by the others and I can't recall any exceptional scenes from him.",7,1,4,6 September 2010
District 9," I just don't see how it's groundbreaking
","I wish movies would come with motion sickness advisory warnings, even if the only person who ever seems to get struck by it is me, probably because I tend to sit closer to the front of the theater. Although, if they had the warning, I'd know to sit way back.I had heard a lot of raving about how good District 9 is, especially since it features an unknown cast and director and doesn't have a huge budget (relatively). And yes, if I consider all those factors, it's quite impressive. If I didn't though, I'd think it overrated. I get what it's going for, using aliens to stand in for unwanted, uneducated immigrants and all, while being a pretty good sci-fi movie - I just don't see how it's groundbreaking. It's all been done before, though perhaps not in this combination of elements. But I don't mean to put the movie down - like I said, it's a good sci-fi movie, even if I'm SO VERY SICK of 'reality' hand-held motion sickness-inducing camera work.",8,5,10,16 February 2010
The Hurt Locker," Acclaimed because of its timeliness?
","I'm a little undecided about The Hurt Locker. On the one hand, it's undoubtedly a good movie. I might not be into war movies but I can at least recognize them when I see them. Director Kathryn Bigelow keeps the action and suspense scenes tight, replete with the lack of a soundtrack during the particularly tense scenes. The story, which focuses on the soldiers of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, feels plausible and the characters are interesting, though I have to say the focus of movie is definitely its direction. On the other hand, I have to wonder if this movie is as acclaimed as it is because of its timeliness on two accounts. The first is obviously that it's a good movie about the war in Iraq and that war is still going on, with more US troops dying all the time. Thus the movie does have to resonate with at least the American viewers. The other is that it is past due for a female director to win the Oscar and well, Bigelow is as good a candidate as it gets, what with this well-done movie that not only has the perfect subject but is also a war and action movie - male- dominated genres that she has broken into. So I don't know if this deserves Best Picture but it sure has got great momentum for it.",8,1,4,16 February 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," More than anything, Benjamin Button seems like the kind of epic movie made for collecting Oscar nominations.
","More than anything, Benjamin Button seems like the kind of epic movie made for collecting Oscar nominations. Nominations, I say, because its merits stop short of allowing it to win the big prize. It wants to be this year's The English Patient but is instead more like The Aviator, which was visually impressive but not emotionally.I hate to use Cate Blanchett as a yardstick because of my bias for her but she really is the consummate actress and any 'big' movie that doesn't score her an Oscar nomination is seriously flawed one way or other. Here, I believe it's the story, which never really touched me. It's told like a fairy tale, with wistful narration and glowy cinematography, but it's a story that is bizarre and distant and thus doesn't invite empathy. How does one empathize with a man who's aging in reverse or a woman who loses the love of her life because he's getting too young for her? Actually, done well, a movie could have me empathizing with any character. But the character of Benjamin Button was played with a sort of detachment by Brad Pitt. With most scenes he was more like an observer, watching the people around him. I don't quite understand his Oscar nomination, seeing as how in most of his scenes he was upstaged by his makeup.It is no surprise though, that Taraji P. Henson too scored an Oscar nomination, since she provides the warmest moments of the movie, though unfortunately they're over too early. She plays a woman who's unable to have children and so adopts the aberrant and abandoned Benjamin Button - a very sympathetic role.Blanchett feels unjustly misused here, as she comes across as more like Button's mirror than love interest, serving to just reflect his aging process through the years.The movie does look impressive though, in terms of cinematography and set. It's hard to comment on the makeup, seeing as how no matter how real it looks, you'd know it's not real. While I think director David Fincher did a good job here considering the span of the work, I still prefer him directing thrillers.",7,0,2,27 May 2009
Ip Man," Great action, simple story
","I'd heard a lot about Ip Man before finally watching it, and I think I was a bit biased by expectations though I tried to watch it objectively. I can understand why the movie was as popular as it was. It's a tale of a real-life hero and features incredible martial arts choreography. Wing Chun, a seemingly defense-oriented style of kungfu, is amazing to behold, and surprisingly, I don't recall ever seeing it on screen before this movie. The movie's two action choreographers - one of whom is Sammo Hung - took home the awards in that category in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The story, unfortunately, I found a bit too simple and bordering on hokey. Ip Man kicks butt, rallies the Chinese people, the end. I would've like to see some kind of background on him. He just simply exists and is a rich kungfu master with a wife and kid, or rather with a family that can be used against him to force him to fight. There's really not much else to his family. Or to him, for that matter. Donnie Yen seems perfect for the role. He looks like a perfectly charming, non-threatening fellow, until you get him to fight and then you're on the floor with your nose bleeding the next second. He's also capable of looking as though in profound thought, even when there's nothing much to think about. Watching brilliant kungfu thrills me as much as the next guy but I'd prefer to watch it either in an all-out action movie with a throwaway plot or as a masterpiece of direction with an engaging story to boot. Ip Man is the latter with a story that doesn't work for me, sadly. As such, I'm not too enthused about catching its sequel or unofficial prequel.",8,1,1,13 January 2012
Clash of the Titans," Adequate but unremarkable
","I'm pretty sure I watched the original Clash of the Titans and forgot to rate it. Now I have no idea what I thought of it. Anyway, there is enough of a deja vu from having watched Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.This movie was quite adequate in terms of special effects and action, but unremarkable in every way (I say that now that it's been 3 weeks since I've watch the movie and I'm hard-pressed to remember any good scene). Sometimes the special effects were too obvious - as with medusa and the kraken - but at other times it looked pretty good. The story, meh. I don't know which bits were the original mythology but it all felt too manipulated towards its inevitable conclusion. And I'm pretty sure Zeus can't resurrect anybody without getting Hades to do it. I'd like to comment on Sam Worthington but I can't. If he had been painted blue, I would've thought I were watching Avatar. He hasn't really been given a chance to progress beyond emo action hero. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are both hammy and disposable. I think they really should've gone with legends for the roles of gods, like how they had Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith in the original.",6,1,2,6 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," Better watched at home
","I want to compare this movie to The Blair Witch Project - as everyone else has - but honestly, I think I only watched the first and last 5 minutes of Blair Witch. The rest of the time I had my eyes closed trying to quell the motion sickness headache that had developed. At least I had the sense to watch this handicam movie on the small screen instead. This movie has been quite divisive - people either love it or hate it. I find myself more in the love-it camp, though I have to admit that it might because I was less bored with the many chatty scenes in which nothing happens since I was at home and multi-tasking some. And I quite enjoyed the scenes in which stuff did happen. It was really quite simply done - a video camera set up in the couple's bedroom to monitor unusual occurrences - but sometime simple works great. I found myself tensely watching, waiting, and when paranormal activity did happen - even when they weren't big scares - I wasn't disappointed, especially since they built up to a doozy of a finale.",8,3,6,18 February 2010
Avatar," Like a roller coaster - you know where it's going but what a ride
","Gosh, where to begin.I went into the movie with much trepidation, since I didn't want to sit through three hours of wearing 3D glasses watching CGI effects. Well, I'm glad I did. The 3D was a little dizzying for me with the swift action shots but Avatar was just about perfectly done in 3D, with the movie not being all about the effects but instead both being complementary of each other. And what effects they are. The money and time James Cameron spend has well been worth it. The forest scenes get a bit too pastel for me at times but everything else is just mesmerizing. It's hard to imagine watching the movie in 2D (though I think I might try).For better or for worse, Avatar is another Titanic. So many parallels to make. There is obviously the big budgets and long years spent on both, and they're both great spectacles, for their time and for at least a long time to come. And both look to be to popular favorites and critical mehs. Titanic, despite sweeping the Oscars, received relatively few of the critics' awards that year, and this year, most of the latter has gone to The Hurt Locker. Both were written by James Cameron, which is my main criticism with the movie. You'd think that despite 14 nominations and none for screenplay that Cameron would realize that he's not the best screenwriter and at least have someone co-write with him but no, his ego is king of the world. But I'm making the issue bigger than it is. Like Titanic, the plot and characters are simple, though Avatar has a more interesting background story for sure. But while watching this movie, I could easily foresee where events were headed, and what each character was going to do. 'My grandfather rode the big-ass pterodactyl and united the tribes in times of sorrow.' Hmm.. I wonder if that tale will be relevant to the climactic battle scene later.No matter, that battle scene is glorious, like most of the other scenes. Also like Titanic, Avatar isn't about the story itself, rather how it plays out. Watching Avatar gave me the chills I get whenever I watch a remarkable movie. Like a roller coaster, you can see the track and you know where it'll end, but gosh, the ride will send your heart a- fluttering.",10,0,1,16 February 2010
Drag Me to Hell," I was surprised to like this, since I'm not an Evil Dead fan.
","I haven't been a fan of writer/director Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead trilogy, and his track record with Spider-Man has been spotty (I only loved the second one), so I was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy Drag Me to Hell.This movie isn't unlike The Evil Dead series in terms of humor and camp, but this time, with a bigger budget and I think more of an inclination towards horror than comedy, it appeals to me a lot more. There's a good lot of suspense and a coherent story (that's definitely unlike The Evil Dead), and I liked the change in acting style too. As opposed to Bruce Campbell's OTT tongue-in-cheek acting, Alison Lohman went for straight- faced naiveté that could've almost be mistaken for bad acting until she started ghost-wrangling. As her beau, Justin Long also plays it straight, and it's refreshing that his character is not an arse who stubbornly refuses to believe she's being haunted. And it's nice to see Babel's Adriana Barraza get gainful employment, even if it's for a kooky medium role.",8,2,4,15 January 2010
Invictus," Straight up with no frills, Eastwood-style
","Clint Eastwood has got to be my favorite director. No one can tell a narrative like he can. A good story, straight up with no frills in direction or extravagant special effects, and actors giving it all they've got either because Eastwood tells them how to or because they know they're working with a legend. Man, I hope he doesn't retire. I can't believe I teared up in a movie about rugby! Okay it's not all about rugby but still!The movie's about Nelson Mandela and the significance of the rugby world cup in that first term of his presidential tenure. I've heard of the man but honestly, before this movie I couldn't even tell you who he was and what he did. Eastwood provided sufficient background to the story of Mandela and South Africa without dragging the movie down with too much history, and he kept a good pace so that I wasn't never bored. I can't say I know more about rugby now, but with a sports movie, you don't need to know the sport to feel the emotions that a good movie captures from the athletes and spectators (hence my tearing up at the big finale). Having never seen Mandela on TV, I can't say if Morgan Freeman did a good imitation, but no matter - he's a consummate actor who embodied the character. I wonder if Matt Damon got nominated because this is his least showy role ever. It's pretty cool how he almost disappeared into the performance but I don't think that the role is substantial enough to warrant an Oscar win.",10,2,4,18 February 2010
Up," Inspired casting in Ed Asner
","I don't know why other people loved Up but I'm sure most of them don't share my reason, which is that Ed Asner was the voice of Carl Fredricksen. I'm a huge fan of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and I would recognize the gruff teddy bear voice of Asner anywhere. It is that quality that makes him the perfect voice for the role. What inspired casting it was. Maybe they wrote it with him in mind.I also think Up is more poignant (and thus more adult) than past Pixar movies, what with the early setup of Fredricksen's wife passing away before they have their last great adventure together. It really moved me, the way they captured the couple's happy marriage and the big dream they shared. The rest of the movie... meh.Heh, I jest. While I have to say I wasn't a fan of the kid, he didn't get on my nerves a lot - not more than a real kid would - and Asner anchored the movie well enough so that it didn't wander into overly juvenile territory. As with the other Pixar movies thus far (except maybe, Cars), Up is movie magic - a great melding of story, humor, and gorgeous animations. But Up, with its more adult-inclusive story, has now supplanted Monsters, Inc. as my favorite Pixar.",10,0,2,16 February 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Surprisingly spectacular use of 3D
","Oh this was surprisingly more enjoyable than I expected, especially since I had to either watch it in 3D or not at all. But at least the movie's landscapes scenes looked really good in 3D - I saw in the credits later that Roger Deakins, the cinematographer for No Country for Old Men and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (ain't that a mouthful), amongst others, was the visual consultant. The main story itself was trite, but then it's based on a children's novel, and most of those are structured rather the same way. The characters were fortunately quite endearing, and the dragons were cute and looked unique. More importantly, there was good flow to the movie - I don't recall being bored at any time - and the action sequences were spectacular. I can't say for sure if I should credit it to the 3D or the directors but watching the characters zoom around on their dragons was quite thrilling. I'd probably give this movie credit for being the second movie that makes good use of 3D (the first being Avatar of course).",9,0,0,6 September 2010
The Happening," I held my faith in M. Night Shyamalan for as long as I could but I give up.
","SIGH. I held my faith in M. Night Shyamalan for as long as I could but I give up. It's been like a downhill slide all the way. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies; Unbreakable was intelligent; I still think Signs is cool; I even thought The Village was okay. Then came the WTF movie Lady in the Water. I didn't watch it because it didn't sound interesting to me, but everyone going 'wtf' didn't exactly help persuade me otherwise.And now, The Happening. This was supposed to be Shyamalan returning to form with a cool sci-fi thriller premise, but geez, it falls flat in so many ways that this might as well have been a Sci-fi channel original movie with generic director, screenwriter, and actors.Omg, how miscast is this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays earnest so painfully that he comes across as a douche, all wide-eyed and speaking deliberately in a 'hear how earnest I am' voice. Zooey Deschanel, in all her sprightliness, comes across more like Wahlberg's daughter than his wife. And John Leguizamo as a math nerd? Well actually he was good enough to pull it off, but the character and all his math-spouting just got annoying.Like The Village, this movie starts off more intriguing than how it ends. Why were people killing themselves? And the frozen people? Quite classic. Then the reveal. Oh, it's... plants. I can buy the explanation, actually, even if it sounds like Al Gore produced the movie, but it just didn't make for a very good movie. I mean, the characters were just running from the wind. Not gusty tornado-type winds or anything, but just everyday wind-blowing-through-the-trees wind. I just couldn't feel the menace from the shots of trees. And geez, you'd think these people had never heard of SARS and how everyone took to wearing masks for fear of contracting something airborne. For fuck's sake, they don't even have the sense to hold their breath to go from one house to another.SIGH. What a waste. There were moments of cool, like the various ways in which people killed themselves and Betty Buckley's insane but irrelevant old recluse, but the lameness is just overwhelming and unredeemable.",4,2,3,27 May 2009
The Wrestler," The perfect comeback vehicle for Mickey Rourke.
","I wonder if this movie would've been as high profile if it weren't for its lead. Even its critically popular director, Darren Aronofsky, wouldn't have been able to draw as much attention to The Wrestler if it weren't for Mickey Rourke.Hollywood loves its comeback stories, and The Wrestler is perhaps the best comeback vehicle that Rourke - a former championship boxer whose face has been rearranged many times - could've hoped for. It's about a wrestler who has only known professional wrestling all his life, but after a heart attack, has to come to terms with retirement. He subsequently - and unsuccessfully - tries to maintain a regular but demeaning job, woo a world-weary stripper, and reunite with his estranged daughter.It's a huge role that requires a man to exude tremendous amounts of both masculinity and vulnerability and Rourke manages to, which justifies all the accolades he has garnered. Complementing him are the supporting actresses, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood as the stripper and his daughter respectively, though they are much overshadowed by Rourke and Tomei's bare boobs.Though I probably wouldn't have watched such a movie if it weren't Oscar-nominated, it was worth watching for its performances, and also for its insight into pro-wrestling - how it's faked and how its fans are rabidly in denial about it. The ending was also particularly poignant and memorable, and I was surprised to realize how much I had come to sympathize with the wrestler, much to Rourke and Aronofsky's credit.",10,2,4,27 May 2009
Sherlock Holmes," So, who else was hoping for Holmes and Watson to make out?
","So, who else was hoping for Holmes and Watson to make out? That's the problem with making Watson sexy I guess, as opposed to being the rotund goofball he used to be. The movie was all I expected it to be, with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as leads and Guy Ritchie as director - there was plenty of wise- cracking and many cool action sequences. The story was fairly interesting too, though I have to say I didn't pay as much attention to it. But I liked that there was a big Reveal at the end where everything is explained. Very traditional mystery story.I think the only letdown was Rachel McAdams, whom I usually like and think is talented but fails to keep up with the two snappy leads here. I also wish she got to kick more ass, especially while wearing the bustly dresses. I don't think I've even seen any women do Jackie Chan chopsocky in bustly dresses.",9,4,6,18 February 2010
The Blind Side," Yes, inspirational, but thankfully not cheesy
","'Another inspirational sports film,' was what I read on IMDb before watching the movie. Not exactly what I like so I went into the movie expecting cheese, or worse, boring cheese. Hence I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie, which could've fallen on the wrong side of 'inspirational' but didn't, largely thanks to the charms of Sandra Bullock. The movie was undoubtedly fluffy despite it being based on a true story, but I thought director John Lee Hancock did well in not creating any overly-schmaltzy scenes in which I would cringe. I really don't mind feel-good movies as long as the director doesn't get heavy-handed with heart strings-tugging techniques. The star of the movie is undoubtedly Bullock, who is radiant and charming. It's not a big dramatic role that requires all sorts of emotions but neither was Erin Brocovich, and that got Julia Roberts her Oscar. Sometimes all it takes is the right vehicle for an actor's brand of luminescence.",9,0,0,18 February 2010
Up in the Air," A rather genteel movie
","I definitely enjoy the Jason Reitman touch, though I have to say of the three movies that he's directed and I've seen, I prefer Thank You for Smoking, which was a dark comedy. Juno was comparatively too... light. This movie is kinda fluffy too, and I think that I'm disappointed that it's not more subversive.At the onset, I thought I would love it, since it began with witty banter between two people who are essentially homeless because they are travelling constantly for work. Their flirtation composes of comparing frequent flyer and car rental clubs elite statuses. Hot. But I soon realized that the focus was on George Clooney's character soon being grounded and his life being ironically up in the air while he has to adjust to redeveloping social and familial relationships. There's also social commentary to be found as Clooney works as a professional firer, so to speak. Big companies hire him to retrench their staff when they don't want to do their own dirty work. Hence, it's pretty relevant in the current economic climate. It also adds some spice to an otherwise genteel movie.George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, as the two frequent flyers, give radiant yet understated performances. Anna Kendrick, the uptight young upstart, is fun to watch, especially when she has her little breakdown. I don't know; I liked this movie well enough but it doesn't feel like a Best Picture to me. I think it's more likely to just net Reitman a screenplay win, as with Sofia Coppola and Lost in Translation.",9,1,4,18 February 2010
