The Devil's Advocate," Very Good Twisting Plot Movie.
","Every part of this movie is good.  The opening scene with him defending a pervert and winning, is what got you intrigued.  The ending scene with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves was great too.  I can't say anymore or I will ruin the movie for you.This movie deserves the highest rating you could give it.",10,0,0,12 July 2000
Mission: Impossible III," It was good.
","Okay. People it wasn't meant to be a fantastic movie but Jesus it deserves better than 6.6. I would give it at least a high 7 or 8. I liked it better than the others. Main reason. Teamwork had a bigger part in this one. You saw all the other characters about as much as you saw Cruise. Yes the story was centered with him in the middle but it was like the old TV shows. I mean the acting was good for an action movie. I also liked that there was about as much drama as action. Referring to the acting, Hey, Tom Cruise cried. Yes he has cried in others but this was an action movie. He briefly cried in Minority Report but this was different. The movie was well made and deserves a views",9,1,3,6 May 2006
Fight Club," Not what you expect from the previews shown.
","When I saw the previews to this movie I thought it looked stupid.  When it came out on video my brother said it was a very good twisted plot movie. A week later I saw the movie and thought it was great too.  I've seen the movie three times and see things you never saw before in the last time you watched  it.  It was the best film of 1999 in my perspective.  I say The Beach is the best movie of 2000.  I am reading Fight Club right now and it is good.  I read The Beach and loved that book too. Now honestly when you first heard of this movie you expected it to be a lame-brain fighting movie, right?  That's what I thought.  At the end of it, I said Oh, My God.  This was a great psychological movie.  If I say anymore I will ruin it for you so I'll stop here.  I would give the movie a 10 though.See it, please, it change the way you think about a lot of things.",10,0,1,30 June 2000
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The movie wasn't that bad...Actually thought it was pretty good
","The movie did feel rushed but there were many things I liked.The credits sequence at the beginning. It was very quickly rounding up to meeting William Stryker which I thought was well done.I think the escaping from the actual facility should have been longer but the action sequences that followed immediately after it made up for it.It was darker than previous x-men films.I did like the brothers storyline between Wolverine and Sabretooth. It did seem kind of like how brothers would act. Only I can kick your ass but when you need help I am there for you but don't expect me to stick around after. They still don't get along but it was well done.I thought Gambit was great. So his eyes turn red when he is doing his powers instead of all the time. Oh well. That wasn't so bad. I didn't like his accent changing back and forth to where partly Cajun to nothing. But the way Taylor Kitsh portrayed him otherwise was spot on. I don't know where people were saying they gave him telekinesis and running on walls. He ran up the walls and kicked off them. So what? A Gambit solo movie with this actor portraying him would be awesome.My major gripe is the ending about how Wolverine loses his memory. If you have a 300+ person in midair coming at you, a shot from a gun isn't going to make him go head over heels. If anything Wolverine would have landed on him. It would have probably been better to go with the original idea for him losing him memory. Sabretooth...done great as well. I honestly would like to see his origin story too.Overall the movie was good. It was rushed. But good.",6,4,8,1 May 2009
X-Men," Very Entertaining.
","The movie was very good.  I also thought Bryan Singer's Apt. Pupil was quite good too.  There was two scenes that I really loved in this movie.  They were when Wolverine attempts to regroup and succeeds by calling Cyclops a dick.  The second one was when Wolverine sliced the bartender shotgun in half.This movie was action, thriller, drama, and sci-fi all put together.  A lot of Wolverine's wisecracks were hilarious.'Just couldn't wait to get my shirt off again, huh?' 'You call that a landing?' 'You are so full of s**t.' 'And what do they call you, Wheels?' 'This is the stupidest thing I ever heard.The movie was really good.  Hugh Jackson played Wolverine really well.  I gave it a ten.",9,0,0,17 July 2000
Crash," First off, whoever thinks this movie did not touch enough racism or oppression issues. Give me a 'F'ing break.
","This movie wasn't supposed to sit there and say there is a lot of racism in the United States. WE know that as somebody already said. But, the thing it was trying to get across is that every single one of us no matter of race is racist. Yes, that means not just whites. We all have our prejudices and if you are really being honest with yourself you will agree. People talk about this saying that the oppression wasn't covered. It didn't matter. The point was blacks like everyone else can make a name for himself and not just on the criminal side. Terrance Howard's character was a TV director. Yes he had white people over him or whatever but the point is he made it there himself. That is why he makes the comment. You embarrass me. You embarrass yourself. Everyone goes through a metamorphosis in this movie. Every single person. Some went bad. Some went good. It also touches the black secretary got all offended with the comment that Dillon's character made to her. The actress's name was Loretta Devine so I don't my ass jumped into because i can remember the white guy's name but not the black woman's. You find out by the end she is just as prejudiced and racist as he is. The point is everyone is racist and if we take a step back and look at ourselves maybe just maybe we can do something about it. I hate all the racist crap but like this movie is actually trying to show you, everyone hates it. 99% of us including all races make absolutely no effort to do anything about it. All we do is whine and cry about it and expect someone else to do something or for it to fix itself. It's not going to. If we want all the bs to stop we need to do something. Whites, Blacks, Mexicans, Asians and all other races.",10,1,6,10 April 2006
The Beach," Very Good Movie.
","After I saw this movie I asked other people what they thought of it and all of them say they surprisingly really liked it.  I read the book after I saw the movie and loved it just as much.  The blood and gore could have been used in the movie but I think it would have gotten more people not to like it.  To me this movie was like Fight Club in the way it was viewed where I live in Vacaville, Ca.  F movie.  When both of these movies were very good. Both books are about people who go on psychopaths and have an imaginary friends who they actually conversate with.  Both movies show the steps of someone going mad and then realizing what they did or are doing then trying to become the person they once were.  Both movies deserve a 10 in my perspective.See both movies even though.  They are the same but then completely different.",10,0,1,30 June 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Good, but really does drag on after boot camp.
","The boot camp stuff was great. POSSIBLE SPOILERS Follow but I don't really give specifics on who. Some of the stuff following it was alright and how the 3 or 4 guys that got shot at the end with the sniper was just stupid. I understand the squad leader sucked and the squad had no respect for him but that was just ridiculous. One guy gets shot three times before one guy even heads out there. The second guy gets shot. And then a third guy goes out there. Luckily he is a little more intelligent. But that was just really stupid. I had been told Full Metal Jacket Boot camp stuff was great before I watched the film and I had seen bits and pieces of it before actually watching the movie from beginning to end all the way through. My opinion, the movie overall is about a 7 as it is well acted and the boot camp stuff was great. But after that the movie just loses something and I felt like my time was being wasted. Watch the boot camp sequences and then turn it off after that.",7,0,2,18 August 2011
American Beauty," Two disfunctional families. We can all relate, can't we?
","American Beauty goes on an even line with The Breakfast Club.  A 10.  The Breakfast Club covered the kids' points of views.  American Beauty covers the family point of view.  No other movie has even come close to the TBC other than this movie.  I think all that they have left now is just the parents' point of views.  American Beauty covered about every genre.  Comedy.  Drama.  Romance. Thriller.  Okay. It didn't cover horror, sci-fi, and Action/Adventure. 
The Breakfast Club covered the same.  Comedy.  Drama.  Romance.  Thriller. 
The acting in both movies are superbly done.  My favorite quote from both are the following.AB - 'Don't interrupt me honey.'TBC - 'What do you care what I think anyway?  I don't even count right?  I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference.  I may as well not even exist at this school, remember?...'10. 10. 10.",10,0,0,24 October 2000
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," This movie set out exactly what it wanted to and did it well.
",I found this movie great. I went in not expecting a great plot but a simple one. I went in expecting the lines to be kind of cheesy and they were. But I didn't care. I thought it was great for many reasons.Did they accomplish what they set out to do? Yes Did they do it well? Yes Did it have the best dialogue? No. But was the dialogue saved by the delivery of the lines? Yes. Was the ending great? Yes. Does it call for a sequel? No. But that is a good thing. It set out exactly what it was meant to. There is no need for a sequel. It would be extensively repetitious. The movie is 88 min long. That is great. It doesn't drag on and its not too short. It accomplishes what it set out to do. No less no more.,10,4,9,31 January 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," yes it deviates from the book but so what
","I am a fan of Tolkien. And thus far in this trilogy I have not been disappointed. People are complaining about Beorn's section being shortened. Umm, it wasn't very important in the book. It was a stopping point for the dwarfs to rest and then they move on. Just before they enter Mirkwood Gandalf leaves as was done in the book. The Spiders of Mirkwood was actually shortened and done better for cinema. Also how the dwarfs came upon the elves was done better. If they would have done it as done in the book it wouldn't have been as good. There are some things that work better on paper than visually. Things had to change. The love triangle Evangeline Lilly apparently didn't want but was done in reshoots. The Kili and Tauriel thing was there from the beginning. But the Legolas wanting her was added in later. I don't find a problem with it. Jackson said that there will not be a romantic angle between Tauriel and Legolas. Legolas may want her but I think Tauriel seems him as more of a brother than anyone she would want to be romantically involved with. I also think that Tauriel may die in the next movie as to explain why she isn't in LOTR. She is being used I think to actually have Legolas's tolerance of dwarfs be increased and explains the drastic change between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings of how he acts. I also think it is better to have the orcs in constant pursuit of the dwarfs than to have them just show up at the Battle of the Five Armies. I think it makes more sense. And I also want to see The Battle of the Five Armies. That was the one part of the book The Hobbit that disappointed me. When you mention The Battle of the Five Armies. Don't just mention it and say its over and then tell me who lived and died. Have me experience the battle. This was probably going to be rewritten as the orcs pursuing the dwarfs. Since Tolkien was rewriting the Hobbit when he died it would be nice to know what he would have possibly changed. I do think the Dol Goldur and Necromancer stuff would have been added instead of the footnote in the final chapter of the book. All in all while yes the movie deviates from the book but I think it had to. There was a plot, the plot was actually in the action. So the people saying there was no plot need to rewatch the movie. Peter Jackson has followed the book closer than people realize. Yes there is more action but so what. That really is the only thing that deviates from the book. Tauriel and Legolas were not in the book but they very well could have been in the rewrite. The Orcs in constant pursuit of the dwarfs wasn't in the book but it should have. The dwarfs trying to kill Smaug wasn't in the book but maybe it should have. And its not an insult to Smaug to make him not very intelligent. There is no evidence in any works that Smaug was particularly intelligent. He was greedy and he was lazy.",9,1,5,9 January 2014
Moulin Rouge!," Funny, Sad, Romance
","I think the movie was so funny, because it took an original look at something.  Nicole Kidman was the only actress I believe I have seen in any other movies.  Ewan McGregor looks familiar though.  All You Need Is Love. John Luguiziamo I saw in Lurhman's Romeo and Juliet. Richard Roxburgh is M: I 2.  The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.  Watch the movie once and then once more to pick up what you think you got because chances are you missed what the whole point of the movie was.  I am going to watch it again also.  Watch it again even if you liked the movie.  Because you probably missed something.10 out of 10",10,0,1,9 July 2001
The Departed," Great movie. Doesn't feel like 2 1/2 hrs at all. I wanted more.
","Everybody cries about the ending. Honestly I believe everyone got what they deserved to. Even the so-called good guys. They had a choice and they made a bad one. The ending was perfect. It brought complete conclusion to everything. Mark and Alec played wonderful off of each other. And the dialogue with everyone was just brilliant. If this movie is not nominated for best picture I would be shocked. Leo is starting to more and more show himself as an adult actor and doing some exploration with characters. I happened to see a preview for The Blood Diamond which looks good as well. This movie was very well done. I praise them all. DiCaprio, Nicholson, Walhberg, Baldwin, Sheen, Damon and Farminga. It was perfect.",10,0,0,13 October 2006
