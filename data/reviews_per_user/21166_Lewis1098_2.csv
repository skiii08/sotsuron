The Blair Witch Project," Nerve racking, scary and tense
",This Is an original scary tense horror but more scary. This is one the only films that has scared me properly. It's one of my favourite horror films and one of my favourite films of all time :) you have to watch it :) but please if you watch this and think the sequel will just be as good. Think again the sequel is awful. Nothing like this. There is no special effects what makes the film more realistic. You don't see the witch. Which in my opinion is better as your imagination goes wild to think what actually the witch looks like. I hear they are making a new Blair witch sometime this year or the next but I don't know and it will never match up to this perfect original horror film. Please take your time to watch and do not talk through it as you need to listen to the film. :),10,2,4,25 March 2013
Rise of the Guardians," One of the best films I have ever watched :):):):):):):)
","Absolutely brilliant!!!!!! The animation is amazing but its the characters what make this movie amazing. The story line is really good and is quite sad in some parts but it is uplifted by its humour. The only downside to this fantastic masterpiece is the length of the film. It could of been a lot longer with a lot more fights and a bit more story. But putting that aside its amazing. This is also on my list of best animated films of all time.... I placed it 2nd. Just behind a bugs life and one ahead of toy story. If I didn't make the list of best films of all time before this. This would be on their along with my favourites kill bill 1&2, alien, a bugs life and requiem for a dream. Probably even higher than those. If I was you I would buy this film. Whatever the cost is and watch it. :) It's AMAZING :):):):)",10,2,4,3 April 2013
