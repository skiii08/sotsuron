Blade Runner 2049," this movie should never have been made
","The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is a masterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and for the time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.Not sure what is going on with Ridley Scott first with is Alien Convenant he destroyed the series there and now with the new addition of blade runner.I feel that all the positive reviews for this movie are fake, because the movie is a sad excuse to make money and makes no sense at all, no surprised it failed this weekend at the box office.The acting is good so are the special effects, but the story is weak and none existent, Tyrell corporation is gone and there is a new company that makes the replicans, and tyrell had found a way for them to reproduce and have babies.This is where the story gets weird, Deckard is brought back into the mix because he had a child with Rachel.The movie also lack action and in the end does not explain anything. I felt like a huge waste of 2h and a half.35y in the making for this wow just wow.",3,263,498,8 October 2017
Your Name.," one amazing movie
","I almost did not see this movie because i tough it was about a romance, but far from it the story is very good and the ending too.",10,2,4,18 February 2018
It," The good thing is its not a remake
","Its not a remake of the Stephan King 1990 version this one last 2h but its all about the kids, its not set 20y after when they are adult like in the first one.The effects are good, but you almost don't see Pennywise i was hoping to see more of him.Kind of felt like how Freddy Krugger haunts in is victim in is dream a bit.A lot in this movie does not make sense, but in 2017 what does, everything was rushed, the kids find Pennywise easy, they have a map of the swears how did they get that, and it all points to that old house that was burned.A part from saying that those events with disappearing kids happen every 27 years that is all nothing is told about Pennywise this is kind of a let down... and there should have been more explanation on this.Pennywise looks fantastic, but even then not enough for me to give this movie a higher rating then 6. Horror is gone its quit sad but the good old heavy metal plus horror of the 80 is done for.Its sad but we will never ever get great movies like Night mare on elm street 3 and 4 or Friday the 13th 6 and 7.",6,19,37,10 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Another boring useless long dialogue a la Tarantino
","If there is a director that is over rated its Tarantino, this movie is no different, i wanted to see a war movie not act upon act of useless long boring dialogue.I turned it off after act 4 in the theater i had enough.",3,2,7,26 January 2020
Captain Marvel," I am MGTOW and i enjoyed this movie
","I know there is a lot of hate toward feminist, and i do understand, the red pill MGTOW..Captain Marvel is a tie in to all the other marvel movies and a must see before the last Avengers movie.Yes i read the bad reviews, and i was not sure i wanted to see it, yes Brie Larsen is a feminist and she said some nasty things about men, but at some point we need to get pass those things, its like a rock start that you like but keeps doing bad things.Brie as been very well casted and she does a pretty amazing job as Captain Marvel, of course the FX are amazing and the story is very good, gotta love Goose yes i do have a soft spot i am a cat lover.Don't believe that bad reviews this movie is quit good. Just need to shut your brain off and have a fun ride.",8,1,4,9 March 2019
Us," One weird movie
","Its not bad, but its a bit too much, story wise, they should have explained the cloning a lot better then this.How the hell did so many clones get loose, how where they generated, for what purpose those questions are unanswered in the movie and i feel would have been very important.So the movie did feel rushed.......",5,0,1,23 May 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Weak minds love this movie
","I was looking forward to this movie a lot, but in the end it made little sense.There is a good link between the events of the first avenger movie and this one with the space material being used to create weapons, the vulture was quit amazing, the shockers where not.They clearly made this one for money, Iron Man is in it a bit, they keep an hey on Spider Man but they always push him away, like he is too young to be an avenger.Why this movie is an 8.2 is beyond me, must be all the fake reviews out there or the small minded society we live in.Being an adult middle age teen movies interest me the least and this one was dumb, in the world we live in there is no such thing as love anymore or being faithful so seeing Peter Parking trying to impress da babe was boring as hell for me.And is fat Chinese friend who cough him coming in is room dressed as spider man that was supra dupa lam because the rest of the movie he is always on him etc........All in all this is the first spidey failure after all the boring Sam Raimi crying drama crap we where fed in the first 3 spider man movies.",7,7,16,9 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," star wars milking the cow series
","For some odd reason i was never excited to see any of those new star wars movies the force awaken, the last jedi, both did not even feel like real star wars movies just sci fi not very well done.From the first frame of Star Wars the force awaken it just did not feel right, i did not like Poe at all and even worst Finn.The fact that Finn rebels himself we can do this we can do this we are doing it come on... they looked like 2 lost idiots.Rey was the all time jedi never suffering defeat nor nothing... bringing back an old Harrisson Ford Carrie Fisher etc did not do it for me either.The only good scene in the last jedi was Luke at the end and is hologram.I saw rise of skywalker with very low expectation and its exactly what i got . When are they going to realize that this feminist thing does not work and men won't give into this thing. Having movies making men look weak while women can conquer all, are invincible, like Terminator Dark Fate where John Conor is now a women, Sarah Conor hunts terminator at 70y old etc.. and another female lead modified half cyborg half human.... and making Arnold look like a former shell of himself...This is the image the movies want to show the billion of growing young men, that men are weak ..... this needs to stop at some point",8,46,103,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I am MGTOW and this movie has been judge way to hard
","First off the disgrace was The last jedi, with its useless dialogues, and endless quests, the only good part from that movie was the ending.After reading all those bad reviews i went into this movie with a bad taste in my mouth, i was expecting the worst, a bit a la Charlie's Angel bad where i left 10 minutes after the start of the movie.But no the FX are top notch and the story is quit good.Ok Ray is like that ultimate Jedi she can heal etc.... but the force could have been in anyone.... yes its a female but this is also science fiction so better then atomic blonde who wins fights against 250 pound hitman in real life......I really enjoyed this movie minus its flaws, what i though would be horrible turned out to be quit enjoyably.",8,1,8,21 December 2019
Dunkirk," What an amazing movie
","Wow beautifully filmed locations where amazing, the true story.... superb.",10,0,1,25 January 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman = action
","I have been a fan of spider man forever, read the marvel comics, all the animated series and more.When they decided to do the movie back in 2001, i was very excited. When they casted Toby Macguire has spiderman i was afraid to see the movie and very disappointed. This guy has a face the tells drama, crying and sadness. When they casted Kristen Dunst that put the nail in the coffin for that movie. I just hate her has an actress. I did watch all 3 spiderman movies. The action was good, but too far a part, the whole series turned out to be a big drama, like the walking dead series, a poor excuse to be a drama. Just sad. How did we suffer for Peter Parker running after Mary Jane on all 3 movies, how did we suffer for Mary Jane mistreated by her father and a failed actress. Ha all that agony.Well i am here to tell you that this crap is all over and i am soooo glad they decided to reboot spiderman, Andrew Garfield is the perfect Peter Parker, he is cocky, he looks a tone better then Maguire, he is funny, this spiderman sort of dropped the drama and got into the action right away. OK they could have spent a bit more time with the morphing into spiderman that was very very quick, they did less character development, but i rather have that then all 3 other spiderman movies, and all that dull drama.The lizard is amazing, the effects are amazing and i really hope they continue the series with all theses actors, finally we had to wait all that time for a decent spiderman movie. Way to go the reboot is far better then all that drama crying crap we been subjected too in all 3 other spiderman. Three thumbs up",10,3,9,10 July 2012
Avengers: Endgame," Very over rated ending
","The movie does have lots of people in it, but Thor is a real joke, and under used, and Hulk too, what where they thinking, also Captain America uses Thor hammer.....The movies lacks what all other movies had action, lots of it, now its replace by useless long and boring chats, the action is missing in most part of the movie.... Also the fact that the movie is 3 plus hours long........Very over rated movie.",5,10,26,25 April 2019
Aladdin," they put in all the money to produce this
","Honestly stick with the animation, it was a zillion time better then the real life movie.Will Smith as the genie did not cut it at all, everything fell out of place, after watching this movie i popped in the Aladdin 1992 blue ray and enjoyed it even more..... what a great anime what a terrible movie this ones is.",2,168,362,23 May 2019
The Lion King," I am glad this movie is doing so well all the little whiners
","Please don't believe the bad reviews, that bash Disney and this movie, they took the Lion King 1994 and they just made it better. The story is the same but the CGI is astounding, and every character is in is place.All i have to say is BRAVO and WOW",10,2,11,26 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," They will keep making them because of money
","Since i got some free pass to see this awful movie i left before the end.Its the same old boring thing with Jack Sparrow who lost is touch, being drunk all the time, its seems this series is stalled i enjoyed the first one it was new and fun the second one too, the third one with the endless sword battle and boring story i guess i lost touch with this series.This one brings nothing new to the table, and is quit deceiving i went into this movie backward, i did not watch On Strange Tide til the end, i stop the DVD before because i felt bored and i did not go into this movie with high expectations either they where quit low, and i got exactly what i was expecting i guess a boring story and un entertaining flick.",2,23,38,30 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," People today try to understand all the hate
","Well this got me thinking when i read all the bad reviews about the movie..... just to show you never to thrust anyone because i loved this movie.It was great to see the cast back together again old and new, Ray Finn, Luke Lea, Chewy, Poe and a few really cool new characters.The movie followed a good flow mix of action drama and great special effects.I feel people today are overly critical of many things in a world where everything is fast food.This is yet another great addition to the star wars saga and i am looking forward to the next movie.We are spoiled its star wars been a fan since 1977........ and we are lucky we are still getting star wars movie in this day and age.",2,1,4,17 December 2017
Logan," Really sad it had to end
","I was really not sure about Hugh Jackman when he was casted as wolverine in the first x men movie, but he was quit impressive, the role grew on him and its really sad that he decided to quit the part.Logan is a very emotional movie, funny in parts, sad in other, but its a great finish for the wolverine.Lots of action too. That little girl is quit amazing as well she got a great career ahead of her for sure. Lets hope they do more mutant movies with this type of quality.",10,0,3,9 March 2017
Midsommar," way to long for its own good
","This movie is way to long over the 2h mark, and this might be why it get soooo boring at some point before something happens.Its been done before many times, its not a bad movie but simply does not deserve is cult status.",4,5,9,4 October 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Awful sequel to a great movie
","The first transformer movie was amazing, well done well written, this one is a gigantic bore-fest.The movie drags on and on and on, now there is a special team of humans that track down evil decepticons, there are so many new transformers that you can't keep track.I tried to get into this movie, i really did but i gave up each time due to lack of interest and i always go back to the first one.The movie is way to long and nothing happens for a good part of it, endless dialogue, worthless dialogue and so on.In a perfect world they would have done only 1 movie and that would have been it.",1,2,5,25 June 2017
Prometheus," What went wrong
","I have been waiting for a year to see this movie ever since i heard about it and Ridley Scott directing it.I got to see it last night and all hell broke loose.From the very first frame of the alien on earth drinking who knows what and dying into that water fall, to the almost none existing character development, to the awful story.At least in AVP they recruited the team, in Prometheus everyone is inside the ship within 5 minutes of the movie, for a 2 and a half trillion dollar mission to find out where we come from.The casting for the movie is incredible, that makes it a lot worst. Charlize Theron was amazing has the bad women, Fastbender also. Noomie Rapace (strike 2 for her in American soil, her role on Sherlock Holmes games of shadow was terrible), did what she could with what she was given.For me Prometheus has no emotion, no scares, absolutely nothing going for it to relate it to an Alien prequel.A part from the special effects the rest is terrible and a great disappointment.Stop the alien ship or we won't have a planet to go back too, (that simple phrase was enough to convince the captain and 2 other pilots to crash the Prometheus into the alien space ship).Elisabeth Shaw gets an abortion, she got infected by an alien parasite, she gets into an operating machine and 3 minutes later she is up and running like nothing happened.At this point nothing can save Prometheus and its up there with my list of worst movie ever.",5,22,36,14 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Average movie at best
","I will not tell any spoiler other then what you have seen in the trailer.Gal Gadot is a great wonder women, she is spot on.The story sadly is what you would expect from any new super hero movie starting from childhood, rebel and wanting to do more, nothing special here.Also the movie does suffer from long period of talking and no action which at some point makes it a bit boring but when the action picks up its good.People who are used to those type of movies will spot the bad guy from the start it was so easy, its like they did not even try to conceal him.Other then that i guess we are ready for justice league next year not sure why they did not release the flash, aqua man, cyborg and batman story first but marvel kind of did the same with its super heroes.",6,3,10,7 June 2017
Black Panther," So much better in Captain America civil war
","I was very excited to see this movie, but found it for most part boring, the futuristic world they live in on today earth, there advancement in scientific knowledge, and the new but hated black panther suit.Black panther was so much better in Captain America Civil War, than in this whole movie....",8,8,14,17 February 2018
Life," From all the bad reviews i was expecting total chaos
","Now this movie should not be compared to alien at all, really not the same setting and the space station is very narrow to navigate in while the spaceship in alien was big and there was a lot of space.From all the reviews i was expecting total chaos and one of the worst movies ever, well never listen to people. To each is own that is what i am saying, i enjoyed this movie for what it was, entertainment and that is all, its not going to win any Oscar its not going to be movie of the year either.The first thing that is surprising is the cast, they manage to put a great cast together for a single sci fi horror Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, i was fairly sure theses actors would not touch a project like this a mile away after the success they had with bigger production movies.The alien: from what i read i was sure it could be compared to the blob type, with jelly form, but i was surprised it mutates and at the end looks pretty cool.The death scenes are also good, and some people you would not expect die first in bad ways.Far from what i read that the alien raps them up each time.......There is a lot of hate for this movie, i guess that its all because it was compared to alien or a type of remake and it should really not be.Like i said not the same context nothing. Yes the crew does make stupid decisions at some point but when things escalate, people are nervous and they do make bad decisions.All i all i enjoyed this movie and will buy the blueray when it comes out to had to my sci fi horror collection.",8,3,9,1 April 2017
Alien: Covenant," This crew is so stupid they all deserve to die
","Being a huge fan of this franchise i saw the first alien 1979 movie when i was around 12 years old, it was on TV one night and i was scared to death.I since then liked much of the alien predator movies.Prometheus was a huge step back, they tried to explain some but failed, and now we get covenant that manages to destroy a legacy of almost 40 years in 2hours.The movie start off with David and its creator Waylen with the most useless conversation of them all... this should not have been part of the movie since they left out a 4 minutes explanation extra video with David and Dr Shaw and the last supper.We then jump to the huge space ship covenant, who is on a mission to colonize 2000 humans and a small crew of the worst idiots in space, to take care of this huge ship only one cyborg humanoid clone of David called Walter with a very bad suttern accent.They also manage to lose 49 other colonist. They decide to repair the ship and from there Tennessee one of the crew members receives a strange transmission from a planet not far away.Now they also decided to go with the couples here so every crew member is a couple but we never really get to see who is with who because there is no character development, so its hard to care for a bunch of idiots like that when they die.After reviewing the transmission and its human they take the decision to go and explore the planet since from all the data they gathered it seems quit habitable. There is a small argument among a few but a small team of morons get to the planet. They get into a storm and land on water, instead of the huge terrain of grass........So without any space suit they go out and explore this planet, not knowing that David planted the alien seeds almost everywhere, 2 of the crew members are infected with a new so called breed of alien smaller but more lethal, the alien dust if you can call it this way sets into the body and not long after that alien burst out of the body, we get a cool back gory scene and more dumb idiots that manages to blow up the ship.After this encounter the second crew member infected gets it outside the mouth, from there the crew should have called the covenant and ask to extraction, or the covenant should have left them behind.The crew of morons get attack by the new bread of aliens and this is where David the flute player with is flash gun chases them away. So the dumb crew instead of calling for an extraction decide to follow David into is hideout, they see tones of dead body and more but never ask any question all seems normal........From there on we learn that David killed Dr Shaw and experimented on her, that he created the aliens that we know due to experimentation with the alien dna found in Prometheus, and that upon arriving to the planet of the inventor he killed them all.........he plays flute and tries to get Walter to side with him since he as gone mad. Right there, there is no explanation on why what happened for this artificial intelligence to go all Hitler on everyone and wanting to kill of the human race.The new captain Oram sees David talking to the new breed of Alien and sees one crew member as been decapitated but instead of shooting David he kills the alien and follows David where he put the eggs, that idiot gets infected by a facehugger and we get the alien that we know.After reading this by now you think that things cannot get any worst... but believe me they do Daniels who is suppose to replace Ripley, but fails miserably at her job drops lots of the F bomb, she sends a message to the covenant that things go haywire and to come pick them up..... now the Tennessee guy who gets approval from another higher placed crew member to disarm protocol dives into the storm with the 2000 colonists on board to go save 3 people............David and Walter battle it out in a cyborg battle but you know that David won right, and he takes Walter place.That idiot Tennessee dive in with a construction ship to go pick up the rest of the idiot crew they all board, an alien is there that fight is kind of cool, there was on idiot that got semi infected by a facehugger.They all get back to the ship covenant, that crew member is taken to the infirmary, a few minutes later there is an alien on board that killed both of them in the infirmary, there is a couple who are having sex in the shower below with the music playing out loud.... they don't hear the alarm and get both killed, idiots..........They manger to get ride of the alien, get back into cryo sleep then Daniels ask Walter a question and she learns its David... she falls asleep and David as 7 years to experiment on the 2000 colonist with is eggs that he brought on board.As you can see this movie is a total mess, of course the high rating are fake because this movie does not deserve more then a 3 but its Ridley Scott so,,,,,,,,,",1,46,87,25 May 2017
