Blade Runner 2049," Overdone
","Let's start off positively. For me, Blade Runner 2049 is Villeneuve's best achievement. His blurry fogginess blended quite nicely with the world of Blade Runner set by creators of the original movie. The overall audiovisual experience was good enough for me to rate this movie 6/10. And the rating might have been much higher if the creators of BR2049 haven't had decided to turn the milking machine off the reasonable limits. So yes, I've enjoyed it, but......they've decided to milk one of the best sci-fi films of all time. And should we review Blade Runner 2049 in the light of the previous Blade Runner, it's obvious a lot of reviewers (and fans) are sharp. And rightly so.To be frank, I don't like Villeneuve's movies. So far, apart from Blade Runner 2049, I've seen Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. So only three movies, but all of them resemble a perfect definition of the term 'polished t#*d' - great acting, great camera, great editing, everything fits, yet it feels hollow, distant, forgettable. I haven't had any hopes for Blade Runner 2049, since doing a sequel to something like that, whoa, that ain't an easy one. And surprisingly, as noted above, Villeneuve improved a bit. But let's not blame just the director.Don't read on, if you haven't seen the movie yet. SPOILERS ALERT!Let's see the script. The writing. People, please keep in mind, that simplicity is the key. Look at the original Blade Runner - you can summarize the story in one simple sentence: 'Replicant killer falls in love with a replicant, while on a mission to kill another 4 replicants'. That's it. It's the acting, soundtrack, camera, execution, in one word cinematographic, which takes the 'simple' and transforms it into art. Now try to summarize the story of Blade Runner 2049 in similar fashion. It's a mess! 'Replicant is a replicant killer and is on a mission to kill some old replicants, while having a romance with a hologram girl... and maybe he's a 'chosen' one, a 'born' replicant... and maybe not... and Tyrell successor wants to fill the world with replicants... and the outcast replicants want that too... but in a 'human' way... and maybe Deckard is our hero's father... and maybe not...' See? The whole story is way too much overdone. And what's worse, they've even tried to alter the original story! That Deckard back then had been chosen for Rachel deliberately to produce an offspring! How about that?Unnecessary bits. The movie is stretched to 164 minutes. I don't mind longer run time, but only if it's not filled with confusing/useless scenes. Some examples: Wallace is piercing with a knife (probably) the reproduction organs of a new replicant. Why did he do that? He's trying to develop a replicant with a reproduction ability, but because he's not successful yet, he pierces the wombs of the new replicants instead? And what about this idea sending Deckard to off- world colony to inflict 'more' pain to extract some information? Really? In fact, most of the scenes with Wallace might have been cut out. Much like the ones with Joi, a character almost useless in the whole story (oh yeah, K's pet and that much needed connection to the 'lower' class replicants, which are in fact useless too). There were also some cringe-worthy scenes, like the one when K is entering the LAPD building in the beginning and is being mocked by humans. Or re-creation and then killing Rachel (that was really a pointless scene). Or K's rage after visiting the memory maker. I like Ryan Gosling and I think he fits the character of a replicant Blade Runner well, but sometimes his performance have been overdone here.Just like the whole movie - in one word: overdone. Audiovisually satisfying, but nowhere near the original masterpiece.So, you have a lot cliffhangers there, when's the next cash cow (sequel) coming out? 2019?",6,1,5,31 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The best SW movie since Return of the Jedi
","Watch out, there are some heavy spoilers ahead!After I've seen the episode VII (basically garbage), I've almost gave up seeing any other new Star Wars movie. But based on the recommendation by a co-worker, I gave this one a try and boy was I pleasantly surprised! Rogue One has everything the other post episode VI attempts lacked. It's original, but not overdone. It's intense, unpredictable and holds this delicate touch of surprise. The funny character (K-2SO) is witty, yet not annoying. And its finale might be even compared to some of the original SW episodes, also with a connection to the beginning of the episode IV. so fluent and fitting, the other new SW films can only dream about. There were some cringe-worthy moments, like the clich√© and somewhat chaotic start of the movie, which eventually moved along into very nice cinematic experience though and there's also the much debated CGI characters of Tarkin and princess Leia. While the later mentioned was done much better (has also just about 2 seconds of screen appearance), Tarkin's face has this classical 'CGI look' of a computer game character and in my opinion the effort of bringing the original character didn't add up the desired value for the whole picture. Apart from that, Rogue One is a great Star Wars film and restored my faith in the force. ;)",8,4,8,15 January 2017
The Dark Knight," People, get back on the ground, will ya?
","This is what happens when a good movie appears in the mainstream. People who are used to Hollywood junk stand in awe now and praise this movie as a masterpiece. Well, it is a good movie, but it has nothing to do in the TOP 10! I don't care much about that non-realistic stuff, it's a comics already, however there some flaws which keeps my rating in the middle. Joker steals the show. No doubt about that. I found myself bored between the scenes without this villain. And the second thing which lowered the score was that pathetic would-be moralistic message. People wouldn't kill others to save themselves? Am I supposed to believe in a all-of-a-sudden-kind prisoner who will make the decision (on a boat full of prisoners!) not to blow the other ship (full of of oh-so-innocent people) in the air? And vice versa? I said I didn't mind the unrealistic bits, but this was just laughable. But all in all, it was quite entertaining even though the story was somehow flat.",5,4,8,21 January 2009
Avatar," Eye candy, NOTHING MORE
","PREAMBLE: This review has been deleted. It was done so based on another user suggestion. I'm not sure why, so I deleted some dirty words that might offend some 'users'. I'm reposting it now with slight changes and some notes in brackets {}.I'm not going to try call the art 'where are thee?' because Avatar isn't trying pretend to be deep anyway. However I'm very concerned about the amount of the 10/10 reviews here at IMDb. It probably shows something. People don't think anymore, they want candy. So they got it. But you can't feed on candy only, you know. At the time when I'm writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West.OK, so what's wrong? Story - Main character, Jake, infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet. This tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral. The tribe must be wiped out because of it. Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature. He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri. Battle between humans and aliens. The end. -- Well, not only has been this around thousand times over and over again, but it (go figure!) might have taken some bits from the history as well. Dances with Wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and I can think of even more accurate example - Enemy Mine (1985). Wiping the native Americans was a damn shame from any angle, but please, we all have got the point that it was wrong, OK? Get over it and don't breed the hate among the... {offensive words removed}. If you need some movie history lesson from this area, go see the Little Big Man (1970), the plot is exactly the same, only you won't need the 3D goggles.Script - None. The pattern could have been written by anybody, who has seen the standard action flicks. First few minutes, we get the direct explanation about what, where, who and why. And you know this type of explanation, right? Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before. The lecture from Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) given to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, why?) in their first dialog raised my palm to my face. The intellect of the audience has been lowered down again. Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too. The aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them. Duh.Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we've got CGI? I was in the theater with my brother, who plays computer games a lot. After we came out of the building, he named me several things, which have been taken out straight from several PC games, like Command and Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and so on. So another rip-off.Visual effects - You've got this right. But wait another 20 years. It's like silicon breast. Now it looks good on your 20 years old body, but wait another 20. I still can't believe the score on IMDb is based solely on visual effects. It's so wrong! I have a theory about the whole thing. I think Cameron has been paid a fortune to do this. Why? Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right? So the industry needs a new type of movies. Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless. I've got nothing against this strategy. I don't give a damn about these mindless flicks, but they just don't belong among the TOP250, that's why I went to see Avatar. Out of curiosity. And my jaw did drop. From a shame where the intellect of the majority is going. I'm also ashamed that I went there and paid the money to see it. It's utterly trash. {section with 'dirty' movies has been removed}0/10.",1,11,17,23 July 2010
Inception," Nolan returned, thank god!
","I was so very disappointed when I saw the previous stuff from Nolan (Dark Knight), I thought Nolan lost it. So I went to see Inception with a slight doubt. But it turned out to be much better than Nolans last attempt. Yeah, the flaws mentioned in the negative reviews are right. The characters are empty, non-developing, the viewer might find himself even with the characters. However one premise of the movie has been completely fulfilled; Entertainment. Inception is VERY entertaining. It's the kind of movies where you don't know what's going to happen in few next minutes... well kind of. ;) Especially when the main mission has been launched, from that point, my breath just stopped and I enjoined every single minute almost until the end. I could pass the few last minutes in the end. The happy ending with glorious music in the background, corny anyone? But as I wrote, it's entertaining. Nolan went back to his roots and chose to play with the viewers mind again (yep, Memento). You'll walk from the theater and you'll THINK! No, it's not just a boring visual effects blockbuster, however on the other hand, there's no big message behind it either, so I'm going to write it once more, 'it's smartly entertaining'.8/10.",8,1,4,23 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A very strange kind of disappointment.
","I couldn't find more appropriate title for this review. As I walked out of the cinema, I just felt this strange kind of disappointment. It wasn't like I was watching a bad movie. This was different. Star Wars: The Force Awakens isn't a bad movie. It's just not a Star Wars movie.Now the three prequel episodes I. II. and III. were bad Star Wars movies. But to some extend, still 'Star Wars' movies. They were overdone by an overgrown kid with a bucket load of money, but still somehow felt like Star Wars. I saw the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS when I was 5 years old. That was in 1986. And all three episodes drew my attention with this magic feeling of a dreamy adventure, which George Lucas tried to lever up with his prequels and special editions, but somehow didn't meet not only his, but also SW fans expectations.The episode VII. is not a bad movie, but for a SW fan it feels like a flat soda. There's no Star Wars feeling at all. Could it be I'm not a kid anymore? Maybe. But let's look closely, maybe it's not just me.*** Watch out, some spoilers ahead! ***Ripoff. Some reviewers come with a word 'reboot', but this clearly isn't a reboot. A reboot is telling the original story in a new modern cloak to please the new generation. However The Force Awakens isn't telling the original story. It takes only the pattern of the original story to make a new one. That's called a ripoff. Or also lack of originality, plagiarism, copycat. The storyboard and the script for the prequels were bit of a mess, but nonetheless, still original. This one is really just a ripoff. The similarities with the episode IV. are so bright it hurts. The predictability of this movie is awful. Remember watching the original series, how you didn't know (to some extent) what happens next? Forget that. Here you not only know how it ends, you basically do know what happens next. All the time.Time compression. There are a lot things going on here. It almost felt like two movies being shrunk into one. It felt like everything is done very very fast. Even though the story pattern was exactly the same as in the episode IV., the fast pace of the VII. episode was somehow disturbing. Even though it's fast, I started yawing somewhere in the second half of the sitting.The new lead characters. Don't get me wrong, some of the new faces were even a pleasant surprise. I haven't had high hopes for Kylo Ren, but it actually turned out to be the best new Star Wars character. Funny how some complain about the similarities between episode IV. and episode VII., while disliking Kylo Ren for not being the same cold, ruthless and powerful villain like Darth Vader. The personality of Kylo Ren is the one aspect, which does not go along completely with the original story/character pattern. And I think this is good! I disliked Fin in the trailers, but he fits overall in the movie pretty well. Even though his role feels prefabricated. And that's the problem. He's like a fifth wheel on a car here. The idea of a rebellion storm trooper is interesting, but it doesn't go well with the logic of a cloned warrior, who is genetically prepared for the role of a mindless warrior. Similar with Rey, who should be apparently the new Luke Skywalker here. Not a bad character, but for some reason I couldn't believe the connection between her and the force. The rest of the new crew is somehow poorly developed. Poe Dameron is supposed to be one of the best pilots among the rebells, but he doesn't get much time in the movie and leaves a hollow picture of a character. Quite a thing if you imagine he's the one who blew up the new Death Star. And the others are ripoffs. BB-8 is a R2-D2 ripoff, Snoke is a emperor ripoff, Maz Kanata is Yoda ripoff. Not good. Oh yeah by the way Luke Skywalker? Do you know how many lines he has in this movie? Yep. Zero. He appears only for few seconds in the end of the film. Last but no least, the third Reich wannabe scene with general Hux triggered a face-palm effect on me. This was really bad.I mean, all in all, if there were no Star Wars films in the past, then The Force Awakens would score a lot higher in my book. But it presents itself as a Star Wars movie, even a sequel, so it's hard to take this one out of the context.It's one star from IMDb, one star for bringing up the old Star Wars characters and one star for being quite a nice and enjoyable movie. The missing stars are because this is trying to be something it isn't - a Star Wars movie, sorry.",3,78,130,18 December 2015
