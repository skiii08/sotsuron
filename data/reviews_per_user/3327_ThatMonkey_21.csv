Deja Vu," Stop me if you think that you hear this before!
","I think this title was based on the right stuff. If was out there a bit, but not so much that it wasn't believable. THe premise was fresh and the technical side was easy to follow.I found myself really wanting to see what was going to happen, how and when. The pacing was good, the drama unfolded and the conflict was exposed. I like the movie pretty much right up to the end.Without giving things away the fresh, concept appeared to go out the window and the same predictable Hollywood formula reared it's ugly head.I'd recommend that you see this and my guess is you will enjoy it. If you value your dollar like I do I suggest you catch a matin√©e, I don't know if it's worth a tenski.",8,8,16,25 November 2006
Star Trek," Warp Factor 10!
","I have to admit, I was completely skeptical of this film. I enjoyed Alias, but it got a bit stale and cheesy towards the end. I tried to watch Lost, but it didn't move me, then JJ came along with 6 degrees which was a departure from his Sci-Fi roots and it was an incredible show that was cut far to soon from the ABC schedule.I was not impressed with Mission Impossible 3 and didn't even consider spending a penny on Cloverfield. Fringe is amazing TV and possibly the best Sci Fi on TV since X-Files.It's because JJ and his Fringe staff stepped up to the plate here that I spent my dollar. This movie was amazing. Short of an early sequence of a 10 year old Kirk, I enjoyed the film. I think the actors paid an amazing homage to the original stars and JJ and writers managed to bring a great amount of conflict, struggle and drama to the screen while maintaining the comedy and action from the best of this series.This film has turns you never see coming and manages to bring you up to date on characters in a single film. This is not your fathers or grandfathers Trek, but that's a good thing. Much like Dark Knight, they finally got it right. I'm not a Treker, Trekie or anything to that account. Just a guy who loves movies and I can say well done indeed.",9,5,12,12 May 2009
Creed," 1st Round Knock Out!
","About a month ago a friend called me from L.A. sobbing and slobbering like a baby. Once I got him calmed down, I asked him, 'What's the hell was going on?' He said, 'If you are wondering if J.J. Abrams did it, he did!' For those of you not in the know. J.J Abrams is famous for being the creator of Alias, Lost, 8MM, The Star Trek reboot and most recently The Force Awakens. Due to his Screen Actors Guild affiliation, my friend was able to see an advanced screening of the film. He told me for the 1st time in his life, he felt like a kid again. Although I couldn't really identify with the statement, I believed I knew what he was saying and where he was going and eagerly awaited seeing the film.I experienced this first had today. No, I haven't seen The Force Awakens, but I did see Creed. It amazed me how many people I talked to over the past few months were unaware of this reinvention of the Rocky franchise. No question the series came off the tracks after Rockey IV, The War. However, this is the first movie in the series to not be written by Sylvester Stallone and although you know the character, you don't know the man, at least not yet. By the third act, I found myself crying uncontrollably; literally vision blurry from the emotional flood. The story was stirring and flawless, the drama, conflict and tone were far beyond real. This isn't the Rocky, or the struggle you remember. I challenge you to see this film and not be moved and that goes for men or women and franchise fans or not.Imagine Michael Keaton in the Batman Begins role. That's what this film did. They took a familiar face and name and moved it into a rough rugged and raw, realistic world. This is the second film from Oakland native Ryan Coogler. His first film Fruitvale Station was a sobering tales based on an actual event that produced L.A. Riot destruction in the Bay Area. This up and coming writer and director is Oakland born and raised and his urban city upbringing casts a light on the film that makes you understand the journey in a way that pulls at your heart.Visually the film is staggering, light, texture and motion all draw you in. Ironically the fight music from the Rocky franchise is called, 'Alone in the Ring' at least twice I was drawn into this film deeply that I would have swore I was in Creed's corner if not in the ring myself. The soundtrack, although rap will motivate you. The lyrics may escape you, but the beats and fluidity and actually match the pace of your film and much like the thump of 'We Will Rock You' your pulse and breathing will start to match the pace of the film. The acting is so strong, you won't miss 'Yo Adrian' and you will remember that Stallone is an Academy Award Winner and that much of Hollywood thought that the director and star of this film should have got Oscars for their collaboration on Fruitvale Station.By the movies end I was on such a euphoric state that I was fully prepared to leave my car and the theater and do a little road work and run home. Now, I wasn't alone, so leaving my car wasn't an option and certainly a block into this legendary run I would have realized that I'm a heavyweight in size alone and no longer a competitive athlete out of breath, would have walked back to my car with a Slurpee and fast food burger in hand.Now, how often will a grown man admit to crying when it has nothing to do with the size of Kim K's ass. I can tell you this, fella's. There is The Godfather, Scarface and Creed. The movie is just that Gangsta.I fully expect a nomination and win for this film. It's hands down top 10 in my book and the 1st movie to make me cry since E.T. re-boarded the mothership. Both this film and Straight out of Compton are strong arguments for Black Cinema and although race is not the issue here, we all have a story to tell and if it's only told from one perspective, you are missing out on details that may shape your belief, but then again, that might be 'The Mans' fear.I am moved, my soul is refreshed and I'm rejuvenated by the notion that great storytelling still exists. Rocky was the original story of the underdog, and this retelling of his tale is overdue.A bit of trivia, the original Rocky was released 40 years ago to the date of this release and Sylvester Stallone is the same age as Burgess Meredith at the time of that release. Full Circle!",10,19,40,27 November 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Teen Wolf!
","I am going to start out by saying Marvel makes some really bad films. I had a girlfriend tell me that if I ever took her to see something as horrible as Ghostrider again, she'd dump me. Lucky for me, I knew that bad movies weren't the issue, so it was not a serious loss when the relationship didn't work out.That doesn't change the fact that Fan 4, both Hulks and other Marvel titles have almost completely turned me off from Marvel having the potential to deliver. Iron Man was good, but nothing to base your entire empire on. It was a huge hit, but I'm sorry, takes more than one big hit to win a game unless you've been in it long enough for your legacy to speak for itself.I have to say out of the previous X-Men titles, 2 was the best and that was C- in my book. Last Stand was a flat out F and I was close to skipping this title all together.I am going to give Wolverine a B+. Two things kept this title from A status and might prove to be the issue keeping Marvel from greatness. #1, Cheesy special effect. Some effects here were good and other looked like they were straight out of Roger Rabbit. Part of making the fantasy believable is looking at the screen and not have it be so obvious that it's a sound-stage or CGI. That completely takes you out of the fantasy and puts you back in the theater. This franchise is too important to cut corners in post production#2, I'm really tired of seeing films that are dumbed down for the son I don't have. Wolverine is known for going berserk and it still hasn't happened! Wolvie did use his claws quite a bit, but for some reason slashing and stabbing produced no blood. I'm sorry, you don't save the world without mopping up the place with some bodies, even Star Wars did that.On the other hand, the story was amazing and the acting was good. It's the technical side that kept this movie from being every bit the classic that Star Trek will go down as.",8,2,6,12 May 2009
The Prestige," Worst movie about magic, EVER!
","This movie was terrible. Based on the talent including the director I expected a lot more than what I got. I was tired and this movie put me to sleep. Batman was pure genius, but I now have to wonder if Nolan is capable of making a solid move that doesn't revolve around deception or confusion like Momento.The acting wasn't impressive and the plot is almost a complete mirror of The Ilusionist. We are staving for a good story, but it appears that people like Nolan, and that cat that did The Departed have to rely on their fan base to hype projects that are not worth the price of admission.I'd say skip this all together, the only magic you will see is $20 disappearing from your pocket.",4,3,15,23 October 2006
Schindler's List," Remarkable
","I couldn't believe how this movie took me in. I didn't think the struggle of the Jewish people would move me. In addition I didn't think that the combination of black and white film and three plus hours of film would be good, but this title proved to be a soul searching work of art. I bought this film after seeing it, that's how good it was.",10,9,13,18 December 2003
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Way too much cheese to please!
","This movie was a tough watch. I actually liked The Amazing Spider-Man because with all it's flaws, it showed potential, but this movie was a complete face slap to the marvel camp and on the same level as the Fantastic Four Films. Sony really needs to let this franchise go, because true fans are not going to continue to come out for or support this kinda crap. Very little humor, the action went no where and the liberties taken with character back story just made me wish this ride would end.Best thing about the movie was the CGI, worst this was every last actor in the film. If you are older than 12, save your dime and your time, this is just another in the long line of comic book let downs.I don't plan to see this again unless I'm being punished.",5,14,31,2 May 2014
Big Fish," Salmon Days
","Somewhere east of Seattle is a small town called Issaquah. Annually in this town they celebrate the return of Salmon. If you can't tell, the word Issaquah has an American Indian history. Native American people have a rich history of storytelling, and I would like to believe that this was one of their stories that got away. Mr. Burton took the pages from this fairytale and wove a tapestry of adventure, love, patience, suspense and forgiveness. This all-star cast went back to the root of entertainment by telling a story. This was a story about a story in a story. Not since `The Princess Bride' has anyone been able to tell a seamless tale of love, life, and adventure. For fathers, for sons and family's everywhere, this was a tale of big life, big love, and Big Fish!",8,0,0,6 January 2004
Inside Man," Inside Joke
","I was really excited to see this movie. The cast was top shelf and I truly enjoy Spike when he's not trying to force a cultural message down my throat.Movies tend to be predictable. In many cases you know what's going to happen, the story unfolds as you figure out how. In this case all you know is people are in a bank and a robbery appears to be in progress.As the story unfolds, you wonder why are they there, how will they escape and what are they after. It's this fans opinion that those questions are never truly addressed. To me that made this film and 'Inside Joke'. Somebody out there must have got it, but for my date and I, we left unsatisfied.Denzel was funny, but could have been funnier with a better scripted character. Jodi Foster looked a career best as a character that made little to no sense and Christopher Plumber had what is most likely the most believable character in the movie.Clive Owen is a season actor who is gaining fame domestically, but I can't say that I was overly impressed with his character.I wouldn't recommend this film. The premise is hot and the potential is high, but ultimately is a disappointment.",7,1,2,26 March 2006
Hoosiers," Hall of Famer
","This movie teaches respect, discipline, and redemption. Their is no doubt in my mind that this title is far and away the best sports film of the last 25 years. The heart that these guys show in this title is all the inspiration needed to fuel film that only uses basketball as a vehicle. You get a great man once again looking for greatness, and a town of hopefuls believing in what can only be described as Indiana Basketball. Forget Iowa, and cornfields, Hoosiers is the only sports title you need in your collection. Hopefully now that this titles has been recognized by ESPN, a new transfer with 'where are they now, and cast and pro athlete interviews will be put into production.",10,0,1,10 July 2004
Mystic River," Wade in the water
","There are good movies, but this was a great film! Mr. Eastwood captured 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' in all of us. This movie will serve as a reminder of the evil that men do and how it effects us all. 5 Stars for the cast as well. I hope they all have places on the mantel to showcase their awards.",8,1,2,14 October 2003
Love Actually," The Love of a Lifetime!
","Love is tender.... Love is kind.... Love is a felling that you must feel to express. This film manages to take several tales seldom told, and weave them into a timeless classic. The Beatles may have said 'Love is all we need', had they seen this film the title would have been changed to 'Love Actually, is all we need' My hat comes off for the Writer, Director of this piece. This was an effort worthy of career in the industry. A+, 5 Stars and two thumbs pointed towards the sky.I think this movie will be come a Christmas staple and every years it comes on your will realize that more and more of these actors have gone on to critical acclaim. Get in on the ground floor of an amazing film. With love, actually, your motion picture monkey!",10,6,10,15 December 2003
There Will Be Blood," There will be sleep at There Will Be Blood.
","I have to say that this title had some solid performances. D Day and Rev Eli will amaze you with their collective abilities to draw you in, but the story is just too bizarre for words. So many things don't make sense and aren't explained and a great deal is so far fetched.I can truly appreciate a great many things about this movie, but clarity and quality are not two of them. Boogie Nights grew on me. Magnolia had me from jump, but this movies is a hodgepodge of confusion and does not deserve to be on the IMDb top 250.I think there is a reason more people are not talking about this film, it's not a classic by any means.",4,15,26,2 February 2008
Shooter," Still Invincible
","I was surprised in many ways by shooter. #1, I was surprised by the release. I follow movies and I didn't hear about this title until early this year. #2, I was amazed by Marks ability to sell me on his acting skills. #3, By the fact that the most established actors in this title, Ned and Danny may have given career killing performances. I think Tony Todd and Stephen Root would have been solid choices, but my guess is the two poor performances were bought for name recognition.To me this had Eastwood written all over it. At times I thought I was watching Line of Fire at others Unforgiven, but in the end it was just really good entertainment, much like The Bourne movies.I think it's worth the watch and the story although not new was presented in a fresh manner. This one will go in my collection when available. I'm sure it will have a host of deleted scenes and alternate endings.Solid film!",8,203,311,23 March 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Forgivness
","Forgivness is releasing a prisoner, and realizing that prisoner is you. This movie might be the best movie that I have ever seen. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to hug somebody. It is so hard to believe that this tale came from the horror novelist of our time. Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It's a keeper.",10,0,1,18 December 2003
Black Panther," Pink Panther is a better film!
","This movie was a huge disappointment. It started slow, then rushed through the movie robing us of some great character insight. Michael B Jordan was a great villain, unfortunately Marvel ruined it by turning this tough contract killer into a clown. The jokes were few and far between and as out of place as a DC film. The action was bathe in bad CGI reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded. A great story was ruined with an unnecessary love story. I don't know why critics are turning their back on Blade and Spawn. these movies were the first black Superhero films. Spawn was also flawed, but even with it's shortcomings, it's a far better movie than this. Blade on the other-hand was extremely well done and Black Panther doesn't come close to capturing the action, energy or excitement of Blade. I really hated this film and Coogler had been on a streak. Who knows, Black Panther didn't impress me in Civil War either. He's strong in the comic books, but I honestly don't care for Chadwick Boseman. 42, Get on Up, Draft Day, all really bad films. This guy appear to be the black Shia Lebeouf. I guess Hollywood is planning to shove him down our throat like they are doing with Josh Gad. We are limited with strong black talent in Hollywood, that doesn't mean we should be using just anyone for pivotal role. My 5 stars for this film are generous.",5,64,139,18 February 2018
Mother!," No Question, This Movie Was a MOTHER!
","This film was beyond horrible. I don't know what Aronofsky is trying to accomplish, but no wonder his name is attached to projects, then removed. This is one of the oddest, most absurd wastes of time I have ever seen. By the third act, everybody in the theater was talking to each other about how bad this movie was. The only reason I stuck around, was to vent with other movie goers about how terrible this abortion of a film was.You have been warned, this isn't artistic, horrific, or dramatic. Its two hours of organized confusion that will most likely leave you upset that you threw your hard earned money after it.This film was garbage, garbage, garbage!",1,53,100,15 September 2017
Creed II," Creed II delivers an unwlecome gut punch!
","Creed was not only the best Rocky Legacy film, but possible the best sports film of all time. Hell, I can tell you now that Creed is in my top films ever made, period!Nothing about this sequel does this franchise justice. Creed had drama, conflict, humor and action, and from the opening sequence, it continued to build until that climatic end. The sequel makes you fight to stay awake, and cross your fingers that there will be a payoff. Once the closing credits rolled, that track was best part of a terrible film.This film was cursed from the jump and despite efforts, everyone involved dropped the ball. Stallone write a script and was set to direct. Wiseley, they took the reins from Sly, but I have to say Stephen Caple was the wrong guy for this job. There was no excitement, no comedy and no true gripping conflict. Everything about this film was forced and rushed. The story itself had great promise, but they just couldn't tell the story in a way that stirred up emotion. I have seen a couple honest reviews of this title where the reviewers advise how bad this movie is, but claim true Rocky fans will appreciate the message and story. Sorry, I don't have that appreciation. I don't think they could resurrect the story because they threw too many twist into this in order to stir drama, but since it was poorly planned and executed, you are left feeling like the director didn't know the stakes of what he was taking on.I honestly don't know what happened to Coogler. His name was never mentioned early on, then he advised that he was working on Black Panther, but the productions timeline for Black panther and production schedule for Creed II didn't overlap. I don't know if Creed was a one off story for Coogler or if he had a fall out with the studio, but they murdered the franchise by not allowing Coogler to continue his vision.There is nothing like great promise going to waste and this title fell far short of the goal. My nephew thought the movie was epic, but he also thought Venom was the best action film of the summer.I gave this two stars. It would have been a single star, but I will carry one star over from the original film to give this a second star. Please save your time and money, this was a heartbreaking attempt in film making history.",2,7,16,25 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," May the Hype be with you!
","Listen, I gave this film an 8 and that is both generous and fair. I went into this movie with a hunger, and left feeling like I was served and appetizer. JJ killed it with Mission Impossible and Star Trek, but instead of leaving with that same 'Belly Full' feeling as those films, I felt like I paid for a fuller meal than what was served. Ultimately the 3 trailers built a hysteria that the film didn't deliver.It hands down is a worthy sequel and better done than any of the prequels, but much like a sequel, it just didn't live up. It was refreshing to see an edge to the characters and story, but again, it just didn't pack enough punch.My favorite part of the experience was when the Lucas Film Limited logo came on screen. A single person scream out a yelp. Someone else asked, 'Why are you screaming'. The yelper, (I assume) said, 'because George Lucas didn't write or direct this.' THE THEATER ERUPTED! By All means, see this film, but don't expect your life to be changed in any way.",8,1,13,19 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Lord of The Bling
","The images in this film were very powerful. It was quite slow at times, but was a pretty good end to the series. The Two Towers is far and away my favorite, but this really did a good job of tying it all together. I'm anxious for Mr. Jackson next project.",6,0,1,18 December 2003
Fast Five," Not As Fast, But Five Time The Fury.
","Short of the last installment of this franchise I have been pretty satisfied. I enjoyed the sequel. I think the combination of J Singleton and Tyrese made for a humorous follow up, but I think it was a little too chocolate for a vanilla audience. I was reluctant to see Tokyo Drift and mostly because of the Bow Wow factor, but it was a really good film, much in the spirit of The Karate Kid going to Japan. No, not the weak one with Jaden Smith the original and only Karate Kid in my book Machio! This time around, Fast 5 grabs you by the tailpipe and delivers a supercharged, high octane blast that Detroit never saw coming. We finally find out why Vinnie's last name is Deisel. The movie was riddled with a lot of bad one liners, but the action is so rough rugged and raw, you can overlook the fact that these guys are too old to be living life one quarter mile at a time. The Rock is a menace and from an action sense steals the show. Paul Walker further proves that he was never qualified or even capable to have been a federal agent, but is perfect of the do anything for a buddy, pop the e-brake kinda cat.It might sounds like I'm not a fan, but I think with a few tweaks this could have been great instead of really good. If you are expecting over tuned cars with all kinda of tricked out features, this series has matured and it's more about the story than it is the accessories. It's had to talk much about the film without revealing twists and spoilers so stay through the credits for another 2 piece combo that will leave you saying 'Keyser Soze'!
