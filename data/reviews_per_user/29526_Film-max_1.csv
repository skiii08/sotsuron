Come and See," Moving
","I have seen a lot of war movies and of course, Steven Spielberg's Shielders list, Compared to that movie this is a really moving movie, it makes you feel right through your spin, and what a loved most about this film is the acting from Aleksey Kravchenko. He did an amazing job, he put you in a spot that was unbelievable, you really felt for him, both as a person and a character. He made the film though his expression! And what he saw, we felt at the same time. Director Elem Klimov makes this film so powerful, that it is kept within your mind for a while. Not that we do not know war, but they way he shows it is amazing, the colors, the camera movement e.t.c. When you watch this movie, you tend to live in there moment, more then you do for another movie, and when the movie is over, you have a weird feeling, like something just happen And I guess that is the hole point with this movie, It kind of leaves a scratch in the back of your mind.",9,1,1,18 December 2010
