Black Swan," Self-discovery
","Have you ever got a feeling that your are caged in your body, in your look, in your style, in the image you created for years deliberately or notHave you ever wanted to see a different reflection? Have you ever let your dark side be in charge, your black side, your free side... Have you been a black swan? In a tiny café while waiting for the movie we were glancing over some booklets featuring the cinema's event guide. A small review on 'Black Swan' by Darren Aranofsky was illustrated with the Natalie Portman's image. She was wearing a tutu – a ballet dancer marbled in a graceful pose. I thought – a movie about ballet? Interesting.But ballet and this century-old story of struggling to become a 'prima ballerina' is just a cover of the film, its scenery, its curtain It is just a decoration the protagonist is set into. It would be totally ignorant to say 'Black Swan' is about ballet. Though there is a lot of ballet, a beautiful ballet by the way, marvelously performed by Natalie Portman as Nina.I would say this film is about transformation and self-discovery. It is about growing up and getting independence and inner freedom. It is about self-harmony painfully attained through the torturing acts of unlocking smaller and bigger doors in yourself to let your passions out, to let your demons live side by side with your angels, to find a black swan in yourself Natalie Portman absolutely succeeded in showing this stunning soul transformation. In all the details, with all shades and colours, deeply and persuasive. Her acting is over-the top and all awards and nominations speak for herself. Portman won Oscar as an Actress in a Leading Role and if you still had doubts about her outstanding talent – forget them! And if you had doubts about Aranofsky – shame on you! 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Pi', 'The Fountain', 'The Wrestler' It is something unstoppable about Darren. Something that squeezes its way to your heart even through the complete dubbing, capturing it even on the small screen of your 13'' laptop. This 'something' is often called a signature style, I would call it Aranofsky's touch. You are always touched and always touched in a different way.",10,1,4,22 June 2011
