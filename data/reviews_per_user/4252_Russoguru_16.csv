Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Somehow 3 stars still seems WAY too generous for The Phantom Menace
","Back in the day, some of us LOVED the Phantom Menace... then a couple weeks later I think the sickening realization sank in.... The Phantom Menace sucked... it sucked, and even today when some people are trying to reevaluate the film, there's no way around how much it still sucks. It's not just that the characters are the most underwhelmingly written in the history of Star Wars, it's also that the story is pretty unremarkable, which is inexcusable in a universe that gave us awesome intergalactic wars, hence the title STAR WARS.Part of the problem with the film is the tone. Don't get me wrong, Jar Jar isn't the problem, the problem is that George went a little too far in some places with the comedy and the jokes. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there can't be comedy in Star Wars, but there is a certain line you don't want to cross, otherwise your movie starts to become something downright cringeworthy, which unfortunately is how I feel pretty much every second of this goddamn movie.Qui-Gonn Jinn is a super-weak character. He completely lacks personality, any sort of charisma, and he's a good guy solely because he's a Jedi even though he does ethically questionable things... like trying to force trick Watto into accepting currency he can't use, rigging a dice game, and yet at the end telling Obi Wan of Queen Amidala 'We cannot use our powers to help her.'.Ewan Macgregor is terribly wasted in the role of Obi-Wan. his role in TPM basically amounts to swinging around a lightsaber, 'picking up another pathetic life form', and fighting Darth Maul and.... that's it. There's no insight or anything interesting we learn of his character in the film.Anakin Skywalker is... just the worst. To be fair, that has nothing to do with Jake Lloyd. George Lucas just from using a little common sense should have had the power of reason to realize that of all the things in Star Wars, we did NOT need to see Anakin Skywalker as an annoying little kid. Because in the next episode, we'll see him as a whiny emo hormonally charged murdering annoying teenage brat! Character development!!!Natalie Portman is just... close to intolerable for her role as Padme Amidala. She's just... terrible. It's almost like George Lucas used all the edits where Natalie was half-asleep while delivering every other line. There's nothing memorable or interesting about her character.People like to point at 'Dual of the fates' as the reason why this movie is great. Okay, fine, the music is good, but the scene where Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan fight Darth Maul is pretty... lame actually. We don't know anything about Darth Maul, therefore we have no investment in his character, therefore the whole scene comes off less as something fun and dramatic and more as eye candy that the fan boys crave.From what I have heard, the book adaptation of The Phantom Menace was SOOOOO much better. Maybe if George worked from that, TPM might have been a better movie. WOW, imagine a universe where The Phantom Menace is actually a good movie! Because it sure as hell isn't ours!I feel like the movie's ultimate message is that you can succeed in spite of your own incompetence. Think about it, Anakin blows up a ship in spite of the fact that he can't even see over the canopy of the Naboo Starfighter. Jar Jar repeatedly does things to attack the droid army as a result of his bumbling like a clown.So to sum up... terrible characters who either suck or are just completely wasted... and a story that's just... not interesting. The Phantom Menace just doesn't engage the viewer like the original trilogy or even the new movies do. George was founding this whole prequel trilogy on the premise that it would be about the fall of Anakin Skywalker... boy, what a mistake that was.",Null,0,1,3 November 2019
Captain Marvel," I had more fun with Captain Marvel than I was initially expecting
","The MCU has been for the most part pretty solid here and there with the very rare missteps such as Iron Man 2 and 3. What really helps a movie out a LOT in my opinion is getting some grade A talent to be in your movie. Jude Law is great, It's nice to see Djimon Honsou come back and making her debut appearance is the lovely Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel.The trolling against Brie/Captain Marvel was absolutely amazing in how plentiful it was. You couldn't go anywhere online without some troll making a fool out of themselves trying in vain to diss Brie Larson and Captain Marvel. Before the movie I kept asking myself... 'Why?', then after I saw the movie I asked myself 'Why?' again!!To be perfectly honest, Brie Larson is awesome as Captain Marvel and Carol Danvers. People love to nitpick and say 'see??? She's a terrible actor!'. See, here's the thing, apparently a lot of trolls think good acting is solely about every expression going on between your nose and chin. Acting sometimes has to be subtle, and Brie in my opinion does it very, very well.I'm not going to be the one to try and come to Brie's rescue, because as she says in Captain Marvel 'I have nothing to prove to you.'. Captain Marvel doesn't need my help, evidenced by what she did in the final act of Avengers: Endgame.Anyway, Captain Marvel starts off working with the Kree, a race of aliens bent on wiping out the race known as the Skrulls, who can take on any form. Chronologically speaking this film is our introduction to Sam Jackson as Nick Fury, who is a little softer in this film than we saw in later(again chronologically speaking) MCU films. I think the lesson is clear... the years and many wars later will really do some bad things to you.Side note, I remember plenty of people getting hurt over a deleted scene where Captain Marvel crushes a guys hand. Okay... so Superman can crush a helpless opponents hand but not Captain Marvel? Sounds like a pretty typical example of sexism to me.Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, between the great story, the idea of a hero discovering their true identity, Captain Marvel is an absolute win. Is it as great as Avengers Endgame? By no means... but then again, what is? That's like asking me 'Okay, but is it as good as The Godfather?'",Null,8,11,14 October 2019
12 Angry Men," Saw this when I was a young teen... loved it then, loved it now.
","Old movies probably don't get the kind of respect that they should. There was a time when being an actor was more than just a sign you were wealthy, it was a sign you were talented as hell. The whole cast in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Between that and a great story, 12 angry men although made in 1957 is just as culturally relevant and important today as it was back then.The story finds 12 nameless jurors(at least until the end anyway) deliberating over a boy who is supposedly guilty as hell over the murder of his own father. Suffice to say, almost all 12 men(remember, this was the 1950's) want to convict this boy. The lone holdout wants to go over the evidence a little more because something inside him says maybe it's worth it because they're deciding a boy's fate, and that it's not something to be so casual about.The ensuing two hours of the film features some great twists, great turns, and remarkable humanity on display by all these wonderful actors, portraying very flawed but very relatable human beings. In the end, what really makes this movie works is that 12 men understood what responsibility truly means... so I guess this is kind of like Spiderman... times 12.All jokes aside, 12 Angry Men is a classic and is worthy of being shown at film schools not just because it demonstrates compelling acting, great story, amazing emotion and even character growth... by most of the main cast. Show me a movie that has such a transformative narrative(Transformers doesn't count).",Null,0,1,11 November 2019
Knives Out," An engaging, tense, fun murder mystery!
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into the Icon Cinema movie theater in Albuquerque earlier tonight to see knives out. Knives out is... astonishingly good. I have seen my share of murder mysteries, and this thing is ridiculously fun. Between a well-crafted murder mystery, a great cast and wonderful performances by them all but ESPECIALLY Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer and Jamie Lee Curtis.There's a lot of mysteries set up in this movie and strangely enough, the tail end of the murder part of this mystery is actually revealed near the end of the first act. But from there there's still a lot for this film to reveal, like who did what, why did this happen?(I know I'm being vague, trying to avoid spoilers).As of my writing this review, I can see that 591 people have given this movie a 1 out of 10. My guess is that those 591 people have in fact NOT seen this movie and are little more than pathetic trolls trying to downvote this movie because of their comically overblown intense hatred for The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson.This is sad, because Knives out is a genuinely great film. Some elements reminded me of Agatha Christie's 'Appointment with Death'. Anyway I guess what's most important is that I had a great time. I was emotionally engaged by everything, and the funny stuff ALWAYS worked. Within the last 10 minutes you might find yourself laughing as hard as you ever have in your entire life. That being said, I HIGHLY recommend Knives out. It is an utter delight. This movie rocks!!!",Null,3,12,30 November 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of the best sequels of all time, ranking up there with the likes of Godfather 2 and Empire Strikes Back
","For years I was wondering out loud how a Captain America film would work without it coming across like a colossal joke. Fortunately, Captain America the first Avenger worked beautifully... which begs the question... how do you make a sequel to Captain America work in modern day without it being a colossal joke? The answer is simple... you bring back the brilliant writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely and the Russo brothers to direct.The Winter Soldier is a comic book/political thriller. While in part being a commentary on today's world that's very relevant to our current social climate and fight against terrorism, it also serves as a cautionary message as to how easy it is for evil, powerful men to fool people into believing they are the good guys... I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there.Chris Evans continues to be amazing as Captain America. The man somehow is absolutely perfect despite his resume containing characters such as Johnny Storm and that guy from Not another Teen movie. Sebastian Stan is also awesome as The Winter Soldier, and the beautiful Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow, and newcomer Anthony Mackie is really awesome as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. I was slightly annoyed he wasn't fighting with the Avengers in Age of Ultron. Before I forget, the absolutely lovely Cobie Smulders returns as the smuldering hot agent Maria Hill... get it?And of course Sam Jackson returns as the charismatic Nick Fury. Between this amazing casting that also includes Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce... who would later return in Avengers: Endgame, a great script, fantastic direction and great character stuff... The Winter Soldier is an absolute win for the MCU.",Null,1,4,9 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A wonderful, fantastic, teary-eyed end to the saga that I think all fans will love
","It's going to be hard to not write about this movie without spoilers. I'll try and keep this short and sweet. Star Wars the rise of Skywalker is beautiful. It has a LOT of story, and a lot for the viewer to absorb. It contains a lot of very wonderful themes that this new trilogy has been building towards... and I can't talk about that either without spoilers!!!I'll just say that they did everything they could to have great character moments for everybody that's a main player in this movie... especially Rey and Kylo Ren. But there's also wonderful scenes with Poe, Finn, C3-PO, R2-D2 and Princess Leia... and... that's all I can say!!!Anyway, try your best to go in cold. Avoid spoilers at all costs. If you are a Star Wars fan, this movie will give you much to celebrate, much to cry about and much to laugh about. I think you will have an awesome time. May the force be with us.",Null,4,11,20 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Unbelievably bad in 2002.... more or less the same 17 years later.
","Sequelitis has a number of different definitions, one of them includes thinking a movie is great, then the realization setting in later that what you saw... was actually pretty damn bad. You know, a lot of people really want to re-assess the prequels as being not nearly as bad as people once thought. No... I'm sorry prequel fans, Episodes 1, 2 and 3 are still bad, they will always be bad and no amount of special editions will ever change that!!I think the biggest problem of all is the little turd that is Anakin Skywalker. I mean forget that he looks more like the pretty boy in a guess jeans ad, not only does he look completely wrong for the part and Haydn Christensen was an awful choice.... George Lucas just in my opinion had no idea how to make the fall of Anakin Skywalker work on a level that would appeal to the average viewer.That's the biggest problem, it's not just one or two awful lines of dialogue, it's the whole damn love story between Anakin and Padme... nothing that happens in this trilogy, let alone this movie gives their love story any sort of viability. Anakin comes off as a leering who flips his crap and murders a whole tribe of sand people('The women and the children'). After confessing his mass murder to Padme, her response is a face palm-worthy 'To be angry is to be human'. Gotta tell you George, writing a line like that in response to what Anakin did tells me you have no damn idea what the hell you were doing!!!Yet... after everything Anakin does, staring creepily at Padme, dissing her constantly, saying to her the kinds of things you might hear from a stalker, then hearing that he just murdered a bunch of sand people... Padme all of a sudden about 3/4 of the way through the movie decides she's fallen madly in love with him... WHY?!This is a BIG problem because it completely undermines our characters. The ONLY way I can believe a strong woman like Padme(who obviously makes terrible life choices) would fall for Anakin is if he mind tricked her into falling in love with him. Honestly, he is such a horrible person I would not put it past him.Also... up until the time Anakin becomes Darth Vader, Obi-Wan constantly told us in the original trilogy that Anakin was a Good friend, a good man. Okay Obi-Wan, where in the hell in this entire trilogy is that good man you spoke of??? Because from the moment we see 20 something Anakin in Attack of the clones, he's basically an intergalactic jackass. He has no charisma, he is only appealing in a superficial manner. Take somebody like Ash from Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. He's charming and funny. Anakin... is neither of those things. He's not a compelling character! He's an annoying whiny brat!Was Luke whiny? Yes, Luke was whiny, but Luke was strong, brave, bad-ass, someone we ALL want to identify with. If you want to identify with Anakin... I don't want to know you!!!This is all very important because Anakin and Padme are the main characters in this story, if their characters and their romance is weak, then the overall story suffers. The B-plot is Obi-Wan investigating an army of clones being manufactured on the planet of Kamino.It's... visually stunning, but very little else! Boba Fett's daddy was brought into the picture for no other reason then he looks like Boba Fett. Also... who the hell thought we wanted to see Boba Fett as a little kid? George... for the last time, for the very very last time, we don't want to see our favorite villains as kids!!!!So anyway Padme, Anakin and Obi-Wan all meet up in an arena and even though there are dozens of Jedi swinging around their light sabers at stupid CGI airborne critters I feel... absolutely nothing, maybe a little dizzy, but that's all. Nothing set up in this movie or The Phantom Menace gives anything here any kind of emotional weight. It's just kind of... there, and I guess we're supposed to think this is great because George was concerned so much with maxing out the processing power behind this movie's CGI.You prequel fans really have some nerve. You think The Force Awakens is bad? Rogue One? Last Jedi? Solo? I'm sorry.. there is nothing in any of the new Disney films that is remotely as bad or worse than the colossal amount of garbage and crap infused into the likes of Attack of the Clones!!! I should know! I grew up not just with the original trilogy, but with the prequels too! You know, I WANTED to love the prequels, but the rational side of me just couldn't find any redeeming qualities in episodes 1-3. Unfortunately, no matter what argument you make, the bad far outweighs the good in all three of these colossally disappointing installments.I strongly suggest sticking with the original trilogy and the four new(soon to be five) Star Wars films.",Null,2,4,11 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I didn't care for it... but maybe I am missing something.
","The first time I saw Into the Spiderverse... no kidding, I walked out. I freaking hated it. I didn't care for Miles Morales and his stupid uninteresting family dynamic BS between him and his felonious uncle, I didn't care for the ugly, choppy looking animation, nor did I like the stupid, overly cartoony ridiculously goofy tone. I don't care that this movie has all the spidermen in it, by the time all these other guys start showing up... it's too little... WAY too late.I watched it again recently and sigh... I still hated it. Seriously, I freaking despised this movie. Why people love this movie is beyond me... and yet... it won the OSCAR for best animated feature!!!! Slow year for animated films maybe?Well, maybe, or MAYBE I'm just missing something. I just find absolutely nothing of redeeming value whatsoever in Into the Spiderverse. You've got to also bear in mind I LOVE the MCU Spiderman. I think Spiderman Homecoming and Spiderman Far From Home are really good movies. It's just very difficult for me to take this movie seriously when it's so overwhelmingly goofy. I think that's my problem.And yet... kids and adults alike SOMEHOW like this movie! So maybe I am missing something, and maybe I should concede that this just isn't a movie for me. I didn't like it at all, but hey I guess chances are you and your kids will.",Null,1,2,9 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The best comic book movie of all time and the best movie ever.
","After Infinity War there was one thought floating around my mind... how in the hell can they ever hope to top that? The answer? Avengers Endgame. For the bulk of the first act there's a sense of doom and dread, and there's a difficult balance the filmmakers the Russos and writers Stephen Mcfeely and Christopher Markus had to maintain: The balance between drama and appropriate doses of humor.Not every superhero movie can accomplish that, but it seems like this being the fourth collaboration between the Russos and Mcfeely and Markus, they know the Avengers just as well as us, the audience do. There's several things that make this movie work so beautifully, first and foremost the writing. The Avengers interact better than ever, going from a team to sounding like best friends. They are united by their bond, by their loss and they all feel a moral and ethical duty to do everything and anything in their power to fix what Thanos did, last seen in Infinity War.The other thing that makes this movie work so great is that there's a point to which the Avengers are at their lowest point... like they look like they are on the verge of absolute defeat... then suddenly... SUDDENLY... something happens and when it does it's the most amazing feeling in the world for us, the audience.Markus/Mcfeely and the Russos know how to create great tension, which keeps you on the end of your seat and wondering... what's going to happen next?! You might think you know what's going to happen next, but the tension in this film is so great you find yourself wondering because how... how could the Avengers possibly win this time?! I've watched this movie at least 30 times now, and I think I can safely say this movie will never get old for me.In the end, there's a lot of tears, a lot of smiles, and all around great feelings because after so many decades of being a DC fanboy, the Marvel Cinematic universe has now and forever surpassed DC as the king of Comic book films. Avengers Endgame is an outstanding event film, one that will not be topped for a long time.",Null,2,3,14 October 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Finally, an Avengers movie that actually maxes out the potential of an Avengers movie!
","When I saw the trailer for Infinity War I was like any other MCU fan boy...I squealed and screamed and I was like HFS this is going to be amazing!!!!
It is no exaggeration to say that Infinity War delivers on every level despite having the unenviable task of telling a HUGE story and somehow balancing this story that takes place on two planets with more super heroes then there have been in any super hero movie before or since.This is a task that would be difficult for even the most seasoned of film makers. Fortunately they brought on the writers from Captain America The First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Of course the one thing that made this whole thing work was the Russo brothers. At the end of the day those two guys and all the talent involved pulled everything together and delivered something truly special.Infinity War finds Thanos and his Black Order: Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian searching for the Infinity Stones. Along the way, the Guardians meet up with Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-man in an effort to stop the mad Titan.Coming back from his self imposed exile is the man himself, Captain America who realizes that even though the Avengers are scattered, him, Black Widow, Falcon, Bruce Banner, War Machine, Black Panther and the armies of Wakanda are the only ones who can possibly stand in the way of Thanos carrying out his plan to destroy half the life in the universe.Infinity War is a staggering sci-fi, action-packed, highly emotional piece of cinema that will bring out the tears in even the staunchest of movie critics. The finale of this movie is... something to behold. You know this movie worked when it leaves you thinking 'My God... NOW WHAT?!'.Avengers Infinity War has everything I wished the first two Avengers films could have been, and it's obviously necessary viewing for anybody who wants to see Endgame. Obviously though, a LOT of MCU movies are mandatory viewing for going into Endgame anyway.Filmmakers will be hard pressed to make something more compelling for many generations to come.",Null,1,1,14 November 2019
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Probably the best Fantastic Four movie... yes I know that's not saying much.
","There was a Roger Corman Fantastic Four movie... that was terrible but had a low-budget charm to it. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie was terrible... but at least it was probably in some part responsible for Chris Evans becoming Captain America later. Then we got the Silver Surfer... which was not very good for a variety of reasons. For me, it's more of a middle of the road movie, not bad enough for me to give it a one, but not good enough for me to give it anything higher than a 5/10.Rise of the Silver Surfer does several things wrong, like the presentation of the villain Galactus... FFS make him a giant guy in Blue and Purple armor or just GTFO okay??? The design of the Surfer was good, but this movie's 'comedy' just came off as weird and awkward, much like in the first movie.As for the rest... the team involved in making this thing did... an okay job at best. This movie had SO much potential, and it ended up being about as mediocre as superhero movies get... not horrible, but certainly not good either. The actors did the best they could with the material they were given, the chemistry between the characters works, but only just barely.I would not recommend this film, or the horrible Josh Trank FF film... but that's a review for another time.",Null,0,0,11 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I honestly don't get the hate. Watch it and judge it for yourself.
","First off, I would honestly like to say if you loved or put up with the Star Wars prequels, I honestly believe you should have no problem with the newest Star Wars films, otherwise... you're in my opinion a hypocrite.I humbly ask that you'll indulge me a little bit because it's hard for me to review this movie effectively without addressing the major issues people seem to have with this movie. For the last two years I have seen every variation of every complaint about The Last Jedi and they basically amount to one of these four things: 1) Rose Tico, 2) This movie having a 'agenda', 3) Leia's force powers and 4) They didn't like Luke in this movie.First off, I don't understand why people have a chip on their shoulder about Rose. I've watched The Last Jedi several times, scanning carefully for what people might be irritated about. In the end... I could find nothing. I mean, honestly Rose is not the bad character everybody keeps telling you. She's a good guy and because of her loss in this movie, I think she feels a burden because of the events early in the movie she has a legacy to live up to. I mean at least she doesn't go around stepping in piles of feces, or shouting 'exsqueeze me!' or 'Maxi big da force!' or succeeding in spite of total incompetence. She is a good character.As for the 'agenda'? I just don't get it. Why is it such a bad thing that women are being leaders and doing heroic things? Why is that bad? Seriously!
Maybe people thought that the small subplot with the Fathiers was some kind of strange message about animal rights? Okay, again, why is that a bad thing? I mean there is a point that such a thing could potentially wildly unbalance a movie but I don't feel there was a disproportionate amount of time spent on that.Why is Leia using the force a bad thing? I mean... I've seen all kinds of cynical people making all kinds of memes about her using the force in the certain scene I'm referring to, and again I don't know why people have such a hard time accepting this. Again, if you loved the prequels, you should have ZERO issues with anything in the new Star Wars movies!!!As for Luke... the moment I saw the first trailer for The Last Jedi I said to myself 'Damn, this poor guy has been through some stuff.'. People got SOOOO enraged at the beginning when Luke tossed away the lightsaber Rey handed him. Instead of getting angry though, I got curious, I thought 'Oh my God what happened to Luke?'. People also claim they don't like how he was, and I thought you know what? If any of us were in his position we might have the same internal discussion or conflict. I mean... we wouldn't follow through hopefully, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't consider taking a certain... action if it meant the fate of the entire universe.See, for me my primary concern for any movie are two specific criteria: the characters and the story. Rey, Finn, Luke and Poe Dameron are great characters. Rey, Finn and Poe were set up as great characters in The Force Awakens. They are all good people who would fight for what is right until the very end, even in the face of death. That's what makes them compelling and interesting and people you want to identify with.As for the story? It's reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back, but instead of focusing on a Luke's training and Han and Leia's budding romance, we focus more on the remnants of the resistance barely being able to outrun the First Order. There is a good amount of suspense because these few ships are all that is left of the Resistance. They are being gradually being picked off one by one, and that creates a lot of suspense, putting the pressure on Rose and Finn to sabotage the First Order's tracking systems.Rey's story is compelling. Luke is hesitant to train her because he is afraid of history repeating itself. Rey just wants answers, because her past is basically a complete mystery. In spite of the fact that she has nobody to support her but Luke and Finn, she has to find her own strength. Luke points out to her the failings of the Jedi in the events of the prequels and... yeah, he was absolutely right! Were Star Wars prequel fans put off that Luke was pointing out the truth about the events in the prequels?When all is said and done, The Last Jedi is a great, suspenseful entry into the Skywalker saga that is fun, exciting, moving and intriguing. I am looking forward to The Rise of Skywalker.",Null,4,17,3 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," An astounding sci-fi entry into the MCU
","If you want to describe Guardians of the Galaxy to the uninitiated, I guess you'd describe it as Star Wars, except there's no force and everybody is either Han Solo or Chewbacca... or both.Before 2012 I never even heard of the GOTG. I was introduced via the character Rocket Raccoon who was in Marvel Vs Capcom 3. When I saw the trailer for GOTG I was... kinda blown away. I was like hmmm, this could be damn good!I was wrong. This movie isn't damn good, it's frickin' AMAZING. I guess another way of describing Guardians of the Galaxy is that it's The Avengers... except they're all anti-heroes. Although Joss Whedon's Avengers is really good, I'm not sure it's as great as GOTG.What makes this story work is the characters... starting with actor Chris Pratt as Peter Quill. Chris Pratt (to use a perhaps exhausted phrase) is this generations Harrison Ford. Before 2014 I never even heard of Chris Pratt. I never saw Parks and Rec. This was one of those cases where I instantly fell in love with the character of Peter Quill, which I heavily credit to Chris Pratt's awesome performance. Chris Pratt pulls off the funny, charming scoundrel personality very very well.Zoe Saldana is amazing as Gamora, the adopted daughter of an intergalactic despot, our big baddie that you love to hate... Thanos. Karen Gillan is also amazing as Nebula, the real daughter of Thanos. Dave Bautista is a lot of fun as the very lunk-headed Drax.To be honest though... one of my favorite characters in the MCU is Rocket Raccoon, voiced by the fantastic Bradley Cooper. Guardians is such a great movie, in that it made me feel real emotions for a computer generated, gun-toting anthropomorphic critter. Rocket Raccoon is bad ass, and I frickin' love him.Oh yeah, and I guess Vin Diesel does the voice of Groot. If I am being fair though, GOTG had a very hard job. This movie has to establish all these great new characters, have them straddle the line between being heroes and out-laws and make us the audience tear up during the final 15 minutes of this scene.James Gunn did an INCREDIBLE job. It also helps that the soundtrack to this film is incredible and immerses you into this fun and vast universe. People like to complain that the character of Ronin is kind of a typical villain, but in my opinion that doesn't hurt the film at all. Why? Because this film is all about the Guardians and their consciences motivating them into doing the right thing... even if that doesn't mean them doing the right thing ALL the time.Guardians of the Galaxy is in the top 5 of MCU films thus far(As of November 2019), and I highly recommend it for anybody who needs a cold introduction to the MCU. Adults will love it, and so will the kids... although just be aware the kids might ask you what Star Lord was talking about when he mentioned Jackson Pollock...",Null,0,0,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Barely better than episodes 1 and 2 does NOT make it a good movie!!!
","Here is the end of the 'fall' of Anakin Skywalker, which actually took place long before he became Darth Vader! As I said in my Attack of the clones review, Anakin is a morally bankrupt little bonehead, and they take it a step further by having him murder a defenseless old man by chopping off his head in the first 15 minutes of Revenge of the Sith. Instead of having an actual emotional reaction to what he just did, Anakin just plainly says 'I shouldn't have done that'.See, here's the thing, in having Anakin being this way, the prequels rob us of our ability to emotionally identify with Anakin! Had he actually been a good man and legitimately seduced by the dark side, his fall might have actually been interesting, tragic and heart-breaking! But I think I can say with all honesty his 'fall' is none of those things!Between Anakin and Padme being so poorly written(yet again), the movie has barely any impact, any resonance, and as a result I feel nothing for any of these characters. Obi-Wan has a dual with an asthmatic unintimidating villain named Greivous. I guess there was a lot about his character in the Clone Wars TV show but I'll never know what that information was because I don't care about seeing the show. All I care about is the movie and Greivous was and is... one of the least intimidating villains in film history. I've seen frosted mini-wheats that are scarier than him.In any case, Revenge of the Sith yet again reveals nothing interesting about Obi-Wan Kenobi! Going back to A New Hope, we saw a charismatic and endearing old man! In the prequels, Obi-Wan is just... Bantha Poodoo. I'm sorry Prequel fans, but it's true.I'd like to take this opportunity to point something out. If you love the prequels, good for you, it's good somebody can get joy out of those movies. Just don't expect that you're ever going to change my mind about them.So the empire rises, and Padme says 'So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause.' Ummm, Padme you do remember you were in part responsible for the Empire rising in Attack of the Clones, right? Padme just strikes me as somebody who makes terrible life choices, between marrying Anakin and handing control over to Jar Jar, Padme's legacy is in my opinion one of absolute shame and embarrassment. I find it a HUGE insult that this terribly written character should be the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.Had Leia or Luke known of their mother's legacy they might have not been so inspired to fight against the empire!!! I mean, forget the fact that they both remember her despite Padme dying shortly after childbirth, Padme being their mother was just... very bad writing.Oh, also Anakin flips out and becomes Darth Vader... even though he was already an evil little moron in Attack of the clones.Revenge of the Sith is surprisingly beloved by the Star Wars fan community, something that disturbs me very, VERY greatly. Again, between terrible characters, awful writing and a story that again in my opinion fails to engage... the prequels as a whole are a complete waste of time.If you want a true Star Wars experience, I say just stick with the original trilogy and all the latest Disney films. The Rise of Skywalker is bound to be thrilling and exciting, unlike Revenge of the Sith.",Null,2,5,3 November 2019
Looper," Interesting, weird, and mind-bending.
","It seems like every other franchise these days dealing with time travel tries to adhere to certain... 'rules' behind time travel. Doesn't matter if it's Terminator, Star Trek, Timecop, Quantum Leap, Looper, Back to the future, Doctor Who, X-Men: Days of future past, Hot Tub Time Machine, Die Hard, Somewhere in time, or the best movie of all time Avengers: Endgame, they've all done it successfully because they're all really great films/TV shows. Turns out unfortunately that Back the future is a bunch of crap though(#sarcasm).Make no mistake, Looper is a pretty violent film with LOTS of F-bombs so it's not for kids. It is a fascinating film though that is absolutely crazy good. The performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are really good, and Rian Johnson is an excellent director/writer.There's also a lot of cool surprises and plot devices in store that in similar circumstances in other movies might not work, but fortunately it somehow works in Looper! Ever since I was a little kid I've loved the concept of time travel in movies, and Looper does a great job of being a compelling, interesting story with heart and humanity in the end. I highly recommend it.",Null,0,2,9 December 2019
Easy A," Not compelling, not thoughtful, but most importantly... NOT FUNNY!!!
","The most important element in a comedy is one I think most people can agree on... is it funny? Easy A... is not funny. True, it does have some things going for it, including a fairly strong cast, consisting of Emma Stone, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Malcom Mcdowell... it's just too bad this movie thinks awkward=funny, because if that were the case Easy A would be one of the funniest movies of all time.The movie is appealing on an emotional level to some extent... but like I said this is supposed to be a comedy, and I sat down and watched this thing solely because I wanted to laugh my ass off. That is NOT what I got. What I got was 90 minutes of disappointment mixed in with a little bit of confusion. Like I said though, Emma Stone is good, she's just not given much to work with. As far as comedies go... this movie is more like an Easy F.",Null,0,2,11 November 2019
