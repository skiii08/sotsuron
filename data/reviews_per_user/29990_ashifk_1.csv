Mission: Impossible III," Welcome to the Tom Cruise Show
","I was reluctant to see this movie because of Cruise's antics. But I happened to be free for the opening matin√©e. I was struck first off that Cruise's name appears, then the movie title, and then the names of others involved with the movie. I was also struck by Cruise's limited dramatic range and his goofy running scenes. (I had to check myself from laughing out loud). Despite all this, there are many seamless and engaging action sequences. Moreover, the movie is well-paced and keeps your attention for almost all of it and the two hours flow by quickly. However, I have no desire to see it again and I certainly won't be purchasing it. For Cruise fans, MI3 delivers but for those who want to see something original, save your money.",5,4,10,6 May 2006
