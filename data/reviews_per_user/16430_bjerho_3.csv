The Blair Witch Project," A pretty good movie...
","When I first saw this movie (I think it was two years ago), I had only heard bad things about it. A summary was: nothing happens, nothing happens, something about a map... and that the movie ends... but it wasn't. The fact that there is no music, everything is filmed with hand-cams and that there are no special effects in it didn't bother me. Instead it made this movie better. If all those components had been added it probably wouldn't have been scary at all.The actors also did a great job acting scared, sad, desperate and tired. It creates a very realistic atmosphere. If you like realistic  dogma type of movies you should probably see this one.",8,0,1,14 February 2002
Dumb and Dumber," Samsonite! I was way off!!!
","This movie is about two friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). They are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Everything they do seems to go wrong. Jobs, women.. I mean everything. One day Lloyd drives a woman to the airport (he works as a limodriver at the time). He falls deeply in love with her. Her name is Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) and she is going to Aspen. She leaves her bag in the airport-terminal. Lloyd and Harry decides to go to Aspen to return the bag. The rest of the movie is very much a roadmovie. This is the best movie the Farrelly brothers ever made.",10,0,0,29 January 2002
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," perverted, twisted and sick!
","Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom is about a group sick fascists who takes a group of young boys and girls to their mansion. They then rape, torture and finally murder them. Before they are killed they are forced to listen to sick, perverted stories and pleasure the fascists. Every story has a sick theme, which the fascists enjoy. A few of those are: eating human excrement, sodomy, urination ... etc. Pasolini must have wanted to upset people when he made this movie. I think it was very disgusting and it made me really angry. It's a very strong movie for those who can stand the vile scenes. I give it 7/10.",7,0,2,14 May 2002
