Hereditary," Still freaked out
","Best horror movie I've seen in a really long time. And what's crazy is that I don't remember there being a single jump scare. I think maybe that's why some people didn't like it. I guess you could say this was a psychological horror, but I usually find those movies boring. This one really messed with my head, there are scenes that are seared into my brain. 3 days later I'm still seeing these disturbing images. I even had a really weird dream where I woke up because I felt something pull my foot. In my dream, my room had like 10 different weird lamps and all I wanted to do was turn every single one on. Seriously man, this is why I'm writing this at like 4 in the morning. Was this movie based on actual stuff from the occult? That's what it seems like. The ending was insane and felt like I was in a dream I couldn't wake up from. Can't wait to see it again lol",10,6,13,11 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Don't trust the incels - This was nothing like the Last Jedi
","First off it was fun watching her mop the floor with her enemies. Ive noticed this appears to be the main criticism people have. She's pretty much Marvel's Superman so this wasn't surprising to me. Just sit back and enjoy the light show.Don't listen to the people trying to make this political or who are say she didn't show emotion. She did smile and laugh a lot with Fury. It was like a buddy cop kind of thing going on there.This movie was nothing like the Last Jedi and it's funny watching people try to make it seem that way. The plot of this movie was not based on some kind of political message about feminism. Yeah there was a scene at the end where a little girl says something like who knows maybe I'll build a rocketship one day! But in no way did that have anything to do with the plot. This is Marvel's first movie with a female lead, of course there's going to be little inspirational lines because they knew little girls would be watching this.Another scene I've seen criticized is a quick flashback to a male pilot who asks Carol if she knows what a cockpit is. Keep in mind that during that time, female pilots were not allowed to fly in combat in the USAF. It was simply an accurate portrayal of that time. I don't see how this stuff equates to feminist propaganda.As usual with the MCU, the comedy was excellent and the fight scenes were very amazing/satisfying to watch.If you look at my reviews, I only take the time to review/rate things I either really liked or really hated. I freaking loved this movie and honestly can't think of anything bad to say. If you're a Marvel fan or just a comic book fan in general, you'll enjoy this movie.",10,4,14,11 March 2019
