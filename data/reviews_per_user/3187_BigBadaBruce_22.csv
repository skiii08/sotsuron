The Devil's Advocate," 'Paradise Lost' John Milton
","Look past the acres of flesh and the history of Keanu Reeves and his bad-acting, look past the idea of this is how Charlize Theron got noticed, just sit and watch a masterpiece. Keanu Reeves put's in a surprisingly good performance, Charlize Theron does brilliantly but the true gem is the master, Al Pacino, who steals every single scene he's in and nearly steals the ones he's not in because of how brilliant he actually is. It's just too bad that Al Pacino has put in so many brilliant performances and the one he get's an Oscar or whatever in is just about him being blind. He is truly great in masterpieces that aren't recognised by the industry giants. This movie also has a brilliant ending, and a true brilliant ending is one where it isn't spelled out for you, but you can think it over, like this one.",8,0,1,24 October 2005
Alien 3," Lot better than expected
","Many people give this movie a bad rating, which on one level I can understand and on another I can't. This movie had the right pace of tension and drama to suit this movie. AlienÂ³ was about character build-up, which it did with the first 40-60 minutes, where we learnt history of some of the convicts, doctor and the guys in charge. It's very late in the movie that the alien actually properly appears and starts killing.The acting was quite good with the likes of Charles S. Dutton and Pete Posthlewaite lending in good support, Sigourney Weaver had the chance to no longer have to act the hard-a**ed bitch and instead act more human, seemingly growing close to the Doctor. These help to make Ripley seem the most human I've seen in the series.David Fincher shows us his potential for future movies such as Se7en, The Game and especially Fight Club, all movies that I've enjoyed viewing. My favourite scene that showed his potential was early on when Ripley and the convicts are doing a funeral for Newt and Hicks which is beautiful and moving, contrasting to the inter-cuts of the birth of the alien, and Dutton's characters prayer of new life. Brilliant scene.",7,2,5,17 August 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Harry Potter The Previous Generation
","The Chronicles Of Narnia was a revelation when it was released in book form, and none more so than The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe, and the transition from book to screen was always going to be a difficult job, and when announced there was tales of people both excited and worried. Thankfully, any worries there was are easily disbanded. It is not a film that would be in the Top 10 movies of all time, but if you want a movie to watch with the Family on a Saturday or Friday night, this is a beautiful movie.The Witch is brilliant, and will easily creep out any young child, while the animations of Aslan are brilliant, with Liam Neeson getting a home-run, as his voice easily replicates the power that Aslan is meant to represent. The children are well chosen, with the uneasy mix of youth, bravery and actual acting ability.A good comparison to The Lord Of The Rings, but will never exceed the Lord Of The Rings, but you can be confidant in the fact that, should you be missing the Lord Of The Rings, you can turn to The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. Well done, Andrew Adamson.",7,0,1,6 May 2006
Troy," Flawed At Best
","Achilles: (to his men) Myrmidons! My brothers of the sword! I would rather fight beside you than any army of thousands! Let no man forget how menacing we are, we are lions! Do you know what's waiting beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It's yours!That speech, I find ironic as this was the movie that could have become infamous as a film, a proper classic, in the vein of 'Spartacus', 'Gladiator' or even 'Jason And The Argonauts'. This is the movie that could have made Wolfgang Petersen into a Steven Spielberg-esquire Director, a star of Eric Bana, a leading man of Orlando Bloom, brought Brad Pitt up to Tom Cruise's (figurative) height and left Diane Kruger as a potential superstar.Instead, this movie flopped. BADLY. Now the reasons can be either obvious or mystifying. I'm in the middle. As an action-adventure movie, I want big action type and kick-ass battle scenes. It has action and battle scenes, but they're disappointing. Really you would have expected so much more in the action scenes, it could have been so much better.It has good acting from Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Eric Bana and Sean Bean, Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom do well, the most disappointing was Brad Pitt. In this movie he was supposed to be the hero and I thought he was a prat. Eric Bana, really, was supposed to be the villain and yet I preferred him to Brad 'Arm'Pitt.It no longer had c Gods in it, which would have really tipped it over the edge. Instead Achilles was just a brilliant fighter. This movie was more steeped in realism, which gave it that extra edge.Watch it if you want, but prepared to be disappointed.'In the year 1193 B.C., Paris, a prince of Troy woos Helen, Queen of Sparta, away from her husband, Menelaus, setting the kingdoms of Mycenae Greece at war with Troy. The Greeks sail to Troy and lay siege. Achilles was the greatest hero among the Greeks, while Hector, the eldest son of Priam, King of Troy, embodied the hopes of the people of his city.'",5,0,12,27 July 2005
Ed Wood," Movies were his passion. Women were his inspiration. Angora sweaters were his weakness.
","Despite being based on real life, as usual Tim Burton is able to turn this movie into his own slice of quirky and imaginative yarn. This is Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's second collaboration (if my memory is right) and could possibly be their best if Charlie and the Chocolate Factory doesn't provide the chocolate good.Johnny Depop is his usual self in a Tim Burton movie: great acting but one weird looking mother******. He doesn't look like a Michael Jackson lookalike but still mildly out there.Supporting actors: Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker are both putting in a solid, agreeable performance that doesn't steal the show but still good.Bill Murray is a brilliant performer who usually brings the goods and does in this movie. Martin Landau is just hilarious and I'm hoping to find more of his work to view in the future. He certainly added something to the movie. The relationship between Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood was just heartbreaking and yet completely real and believable.(Impersonating Bela Lugosi) Dr. Tom Mason: I want to suck your blood. I want to suck your blood! Bunny Breckinridge: Let's hear you call Boris Karloff a ****sucker. 'A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D.Wood, Jr., concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made 'Glen or Glenda', 'Bride of the Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', and focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.'",8,1,2,14 August 2005
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket, fast start, slows in the middle, and cuts quickly over the finish line
","Well, I seen Platoon and thought that was brilliant, and I know of the reputation of one Stanley Kubrick, and when the movie started, the Drill Instructor instantly put fear in me, and I thought he was brilliant, Leonard, AKA Gomer Pyle, i felt was really good, even Joker, at the beginning was very good. The movie does very well to start off with, the depictions of the recruits and how they develop into killers, and the suffering for Gomer Pyle, was well made, and Gomer Pyle in particularly did very well, maybe not given as much credit as deserved, to me, he was one of the two best bits, along with the Drill Instructor, the battle between these two was brilliant, and really showed the gradual mental break down of Leonard. Brilliant scenes and storyline.And then we go to Vietnam.....downhill completely, sorry, I know loads of people love this movie, but it just grated from here on in, it got awful. Yes, its supposed to showcase both the horrors and the boredom of Vietnam, but it was still s***, sorry, it was that awful. It was saved by the Sniper incident, that saved it for me, it was good, but until then it had become shocking. And then, just as it starts getting good again.....its over. Bit of a limp over the finish line. Sorry, but this movie is overrated due to the end and beginning, the middle is awful, and if it wasn't for the middle, I would have liked it. Maybe some time in the future I will appreciate it, but it still bored the c*** out of me. Disappointed.",7,0,1,6 April 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Yes, I am a Male, Yes, I saw this Movie, And Yes, I wasn't Impressed
","Now, I know that anything I say here will probably be ignored as I am, shock, horror, a male, but I have enjoyed Mean Girls, and I don't mind certain chick flicks, just quite frankly, I didn't think this was any good. The comedy, r what supposedly passed for it, was worth a giggle or two, if that, it wasn't a case of 'not getting it', it was just plain Shiite. The acting, from Meryl Streep, is supposed to be spellbinding, unbelievable, everything that makes the film worthwhile. If thats true, the film, is worse than I originally thought, as I didn't think she was all that special, bit over-hyped to be honest, and I thought Ane Hathaway could have been better, I preferred the Gay Assistant, he seemed to save it more for me then bloody Meryl Streep and the bitchy assistant, forgetting names, sorry, but apart from them, awful, awful.",3,1,2,17 January 2007
The Thing," Man is The Warmest Place to Hide.
","'An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog crashes leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realises that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.'When I first heard of this movie my first thought was that it would just be big explosions, loads of deaths and great effects. Well, it was all that and a great psychological piece that has had an effect on many similar movies since. It is scary, full of mystery and a true thriller of a movie. You get a quick idea of the characters and then you go straight into the action and don't stop. Nice mix of science to the pot gives it great believability and plausibility. The ending is great as well and was better than the other ending they had planned. But at the end of the day, it just misses that little bit extra to get it to a possible Nine or Ten.",7,1,2,15 May 2005
Meet the Fockers," Compared to Meet The Parents?
","To compare the two would be grossly unfair to Meet The F******, which is not as good as Meet The Parents, that is obvious. But watched on it's own merit, and it's brilliant. Ben Stiller is brilliant as Gaylord F*****, battling to make sure that he's in Jack Byrnes' good books, while also trying to stay close to his parents. Teri Polo, is adorable as his wife and is more likable then in the original, which was a slight problem in the original. The Byrnes' convey well their family unit and the idea that their marriage has slowly fizzled, while on the complete opposite of the spectrum is the F******, who are absolutely brilliant, where else could you get a rambling lovable stay-at-home-dad and a sex therapist as your parents. A great ensemble cast, that provide the laughs and keep the movie rolling. One To Watch",7,0,0,8 June 2006
Saving Private Ryan," 'Except this time the mission is a man.'
","That and 'FUBAR: Fucked Up Beyond All Repair' are two great lines from this movie. The writing is both believable and nowhere near approaching any worry of clichÃ©s polluting the movie. The direction is superb, probably what started out the usage of hand-held cameras which have now been way overused in movies since then. Steven Spielberg really brought his A-Game to this one. Jeremy Davies as Corporal Upham was good in this movie as he was able to portray cowardice in a war movie, which people rarely do and did it very well. Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Wade almost stole the show when he talks about how his mother would come home early just to see him and he would pretend to be asleep. This ties in to something later on. Vin Diesel as Private Caparzo seemed very much like a weak-link, only there to get killed. OK performance, but nothing really to write home about. Adam Goldberg as Private Mellish who i've only really seen otherwise in 'Friends' as Chandler's roommate Eddie. Didn't really expect he would be all that good but he put in a great performance as the Jewish soldier and when he gets stabbed later on in the movie, heartstrings are pulled. Barry Pepper as Private Jackson has worked with Tom Hanks in both Saving Private Ryan and the magnificent 'The Green Mile' and in both of those movies he has held his own against the star Tom Hanks and that is good work. Best when he goes to shoot someone with a rifle and says a couple of prayers. Edward Burns as Private Reiben isn't that bad, he does well and was touted as the Next Big Thing but hasn't fulfilled it yet. Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath is extremely good, definitely became a fan after this movie, both thumbs up. Matt Damon as Private Ryan is the macguffin of the movie and actually has a small part in the movie, less than an hour and becomes just as much a part of this movie as the others. And the star of the movie,Tom Hanks as Captain Miller does a magnificent job leading his men as they attempt to rescue a guy that they know nothing about that is thought of as just another number until Ryan tells Miller about the last night he and his brothers were together and Ryan became another human. That should explain the ending.",8,2,4,10 April 2005
28 Days Later...," 3 Years Later
","It's been three years since I first saw 28 Days Later and still get the creeps over this movie. It has plausibility and has great elements of psychological horror. Cillian Murphey is good as the hero, someone who wakes up to a world where a disease has taken over the majority of people living in the United Kingdom.My favourite is actually Christopher Eccleston, who is actually extremely creepy in this film. The third act has hints of Freudian techniques with mans need for females in a harrowing scene which almost includes a 14 year old girl being forced to have sex.The end is a bit flat compared to the rest of the movie but is kind acceptable as the end of a roller-coaster ride that is this movie. A lot better for a horror than half the movies out there.'A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realising that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.'",8,1,2,1 May 2005
The Incredibles," Wow, really disappointed actually....
","'Metroville was once flooded with superheroes saving the day. One of the greatest was Mr. Incredible, who found himself annoyed by the young chatterbox fanatic of his, Buddy Pine, who referred to himself as 'Incrediboy.' As Mr. Incredible fought crime, he met another legendary hero, Elastigirl and the two superheroes wed. shortly afterwards, a string of lawsuits banned superheroes from ever saving the day again! 15 years later, Mr. Incredible, now known as Bob Parr is itching to become a superhero again. Mrs. Incredible, or Helen Parr, is trying to persuade him not to. Their son, Dash, who has the ability to run extremely quickly, wants to try out for sports, but he can't because of his powers being revealed. Violet, the Parr's daughter, wants to be normal and fit in as a teen. And the baby, Jack-Jack is only itching for a good time. Then, Bob hears about a top secret assignment regarding a powerful machine attacking Nomanisan Island. Thinking this is his way to become a superhero again, Bob accepts and yet again becomes Mr. Incredible...however, this anonymous villain has a grudge...' Waited two years to see it, finally borrowed the Special Edition DVD from my cousins, got me Popcorn and Munchies, got me drinks, and sat down to watch it. 52 INCH SCREEN TV, huge sofa, lights off, home-made cinema, sound turned up high, and pressed play.IT WAS S***, I was so disappointed it was unreal. I was 30 minutes in and was already checking the time, willing it to end, it was just dragging.The problem is, i feel it could been so much better for me, but i just found it boring. And i loved Finding Nemo and Toy Story and that, so it wasn't the genre, just the movie. It was just bad, i felt. The story was interesting, the characters was interesting, Mr. Incredible seemed good, Elastigirl was very believable, The kids were actually acceptable and not grating as usual. Freezo was very cool, the few good spark for me, Samuel L. Jackson always seems to do well. Syndrome was a very believable bad guy, felt he had a good background and wasn't just the average super-villain but a kid who felt wronged, lost his Childhood Superhero and searched for an answer. Unfortunately it included murder, death and destruction. It had all this, how could it not be a classic. Unfortunately, it just didn't seem to connect and would just plod from certain scene to scene. There were some great scenes with great potential but it just didn't seem to hit the buttons, and that just leaves me very disappointed. Oh well, can always dream of what could have been.",5,2,5,28 August 2006
The Illusionist," A Major Shocker
","The first time I heard of this film was around the same time The Prestige was released. The Illusionist seemed to end up swept under the carpet, unnoticed, especially with me. Two nights ago, I sat down on my sofa, and saw it on Anytime TV, thought give it a go. I thought there was a couple of good actors, should do well....I just didn't realise it would this good. The script is extremely good, slowly building up the storyline through a flashback by Paul Giamatti's character, with good dialogue and character introductions, the script loves the small uses of characterisation to build up the characters. Now the performances: In the last year or so I have become more and more of a fan of Edward Norton, his performances so well layered, brilliantly understated. In this role, Edward Norton plays the role of a mysterious magician, able to spellbind audiences with ease, creating magnificent shows. His performance carries the majority of scenes. Jessica Biel is one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen, and radiates the screen when she appears. It's believable that Edward Norton will risk everything to be with her, and then, be crushed and wounded following her murder. And Rufus Sewell, showing anger and an ego that destroys everyone around him. Sewell is actually a small understated role but gives the slight edge needed to make Norton's character better. But, the film is stolen, by one Paul Giamatti. The Detective who investigates Jessica Biel's murder, Rufus Sewell as her possible murderer, and Edward Norton for 'defrauding' his audience, he is the key to the movie, tying them all together and also showing different actions with each actor, showing slight changes, showing how a Police Dectective would possibly really react to different classes. He also is intelligently self-coerced from a slightly corrupt Police Detective to a true Chief Of Police, and his narration is like a Morgan Freeman, easily listen-able whilst creating a better story. I would recommend this film, and also the performances, which really make the film",8,0,0,21 October 2008
Transformers," Let me paint a scene
","Its a a Saturday night, myself, 2 mates and one of mates room-mates, are sat around drinking, when the room-mate mentions he has Transformers...within minutes we are all sat down, ready to watch, all of us fans from a young age, just hoping it would at least be good, as we sat with high hopes and low expectations. 2 and a half hours later, we sat there, as the credits rolled, and looked at each other. None of us want to say anything, all to scared. Finally, I speak. 'That...was....f***ing...amazing'. Next thing i remember, its an hour later and we had been discussing the movie nonstop, saying how good we thought it was. There is no perfect movie, before anyone starts saying against this movie, but, I walked in, wanting a action film with good characters. The action - breathtaking, the robots are seamless in their movement and look beautiful as they do battle, as realistic as I could have ever dreamed and fit in the picture like a glove. The main characters, while their may have been too many with the army and the computers geniuses, were complimentary to the story, and the action seemed to do so well cause of the many characters, the army and Transformers, led by Optimus Prime, against the Decepticons, manned by the evil Megatron. The story, original in its depiction, is a great 'MacGuffin' as Hitchcock coined it to the story, and was perfect for setting up great battles. Sam; Shia LaBeouf was amazing, plain and simple. Many action movies have to have a hero whose muscle mad or a member of MENSA. Sam, is different, he is neither, and yet better, he is a human character full of emotion and fear, and yet feels he has an obligation to help the Transformer,s this is his breakthrough role, look out for him. I don't want to give away any more, because I feel like I would be spoiling it, but, I hope this slight teaser, may be sufficient enough to convince you, this film is worth a try, and is very entertaining, just have fun it.",9,0,2,23 January 2008

Now his grandfather believes that the forefathers' buried a treasure somewhere in the country and have placed clues everywhere but unfortunately the clues are highly cryptic and scattered all over the place. Now Ben thinks he has found it but it only leads him to another clue which is on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Now one of his associates Ian wants to steal it so that they could get the clue but Ben refuses to do it so he tries to kill Ben. But Ben evades him and tries to warn the authorities about Ian's plans but they don't believe him. So Ben takes it upon himself to steal it in order to protect it. And he does but Abigail Chase the curator of the National Archives, where it is kept, discovers what he has done and tries to stop him but gets caught in the crossfire between Ben and Ian, so Ben takes her with him. While she doesn't believe him, he is determined to prove he is right about the treasure. But it won't be easy cause Ian's always a step behind him and he is being hunted by the FBI.' I'll be honest, when this came out, i didn't think much of it and didn't go out of my way to watch. I watched it two weeks ago and still remember how good it was. Typical, hey?Right, this is similar to the Da Vinci Code, get that out of the way. Nicholas Cage (hit and miss actor) suits it well. Diane Kruger is beautiful and lovely and suits her role. Sean Bean show's how to play a convincing villain who you slightly feel for. Harvey Keitel cameos more or less well and added to the movie. Riley, who wouldn't find him lovable. The action scenes, beautiful. The acting, acclompished. The movie, a worthwhile watch.",6,1,2,20 June 2006
Reservoir Dogs," 'That Reservoir movie'
","I first heard of this movie before I went to Secondary school 4 years ago. I had heard of it from wanting to watch Pulp Fiction. I wanted to watch it but I was not given permission, as it was 'too violent'. I wanted to watch it still but eventually decided to just find a screenplay. I read the screenplay and it sounded brilliant. I finally got the film on video and got permission. I sat down in anticipation and turned it on.It was OK. I think this was a case of too much excitement left me feeling let down. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I need to take the time out to watch it a second time without the over excitement.So this isn't an actual review. More as a warning. Don't let yourself be caught up in the height. Watch it apart from that area. I hope I'm going to be able to.",5,1,3,12 June 2005

Three days later Dave is found in the woods, 'damaged goods'. From that moment on, all three of their lives are changed. So begins one of the best movies of the 21st Century. A movie that is not afraid to deal with paedophilia and it's effects, this benefits from some brilliant acting from Sean Penn (Jimmy,an ex-con out of prison who's daughter is killed, which sparks off the events that occur 25 years after that ill-fated ride) and Tim Robbins (Dave, the poor bastard who is taken by two guys and years later still suffers from the consequences). I am not surprised of the recognition Clint is getting for this movie, along with 'The Million Dollar Baby'. My only question, Clint's done paedophilia and euthanasia, what's next, abortion?",9,0,1,7 May 2005
The Green Mile," 'Walking My Very Own Green Mile'
","A true masterclass in movie-making. Faultless acting, a running time that speeds along and a cracking story. Well-paced with enough time to make the characters 5-dimensional. No worthless characters, Tom Hanks brilliant as Paul Edgecombe, with Brutus, Harry and Dean his back-up guards all well-thought-out and researched. Percy, the weak and cowardly guard,is well acted and very good in his role. Edward Delacroiex, a evil prisoner who gets redemption with the help of his pet mouse, Mr Jingles. The Boss, Hal, and his unfortunate wife struck with a tumour add a cold touch to it and helps the movie emotionally. Wild Bill, by the end of the movie you would wish you could kill him yourself, Sam Rockwell does so well. But running several green miles ahead with a absolutely wonderful turn as John Coffey, the black monster-man with a heart of gold and the Hands Of God, brilliant stuff. Don't miss.'Paul Edgecomb is a slightly cynical veteran prison guard on Death row in the 1930's. His faith, and sanity, deteriorated by watching men live and die, Edgecomb is about to have a complete turn around in attitude. Enter John Coffey, He's eight feet tall. He has hands the size of waffle irons. He's been accused of the murder of two children... and he's afraid to sleep in a cell without a night-light. And Edgecomb, as well as the other prison guards - Brutus, a sympathetic guard, and Percy, a stuck up, perverse, and violent person, are in for a strange experience that involves intelligent mice, brutal executions, and the revelation about Coffey's innocence and his true identity.'",10,0,2,31 July 2006

But for once, he makes the movie. He is the one the movie relies upon and makes it tick. His monotone voice suits it very well and the sudden energy he projects comforts the film well. The movie itself, is brilliant. It's very compelling, very addictive and very entertaining. The plot doesn't sound much but it actually works and with a good supporting cast, especially Ethan Hawke, it's a good movie for a Saturday. And the Bullet scene rocks!",8,4,7,25 July 2006

Casino Royale," Its dark, gritty and original, And Brilliant
","The latest James Bond movies, have been laden with technology, bad guys getting more and more ridiculous, plots more and more unbelievable. Lately, I have gone from being a fan of James Bond to being bored of it, too unbelievable, and many fans agreed. The Bourne Identity came out and was instantly loved, it was something you could believe in, no invisible cars or whatever. The producers took that on board and realised they needed a change. So what to do? You start again, get rid of your original Bond, get a younger one in, you lose the gadgets, you go back to basics, get a storyline in, and make it action packed with a dark and gritty style, you make the story about the beginning, and show the evolution of James Bond. What comes out of that? The best Bond movie in over a decade, if not in two.Now, the movie, i admit, could have been better, but this movie, is about Daniel Craig, and how does he handle the role?? Like a duck to water. His early arrogance and cockiness in his ability to do things, and the fact hes more a thug than a renowned killer. This movie, you gradually see Daniel Craig grow as a person and an agent in standing, his natural intelligence coerces him into using his abilities more wisely, and gradually morphs into the James Bond we love.This movie sticks closely to the book, there's many scenes lifted from the book, which makes it look good. Le Chiffre as a bad guy is an interesting one, he is more of an intellectual battle, which gives it a different look on things. The main climax is no explosions, no big fights, instead.....it's a game of poker. This is actually better as it shows its more brain over brawn, show the intelligent side to Bond. The love interest Vesper is more of a present day woman, very sure of herself, and doesn't instantly fall for the cold Bond, making their romance more believable. And I just want to give special mention to, THAT torture scene, which Bond comes through admirably, which truly shows the strength of mind and character of Bond.Brilliant movie, get it now.",9,0,3,19 April 2007
300," A new age has begun, an age of freedom. And all will know that 300 Spartans gave their last breath to defend it!!!300, *****
","One of the most exhilarating films I have seen in a long time. I saw it on trailers on you-tube in January and have wanted to see it. Yesterdy I watched it. Now, lets have a look at it.Story; Story is simple and yet brilliant, a tale of sacrifice and honour, a pure story of true greatness.Inspired, not based, on similar occurrences from an old age, this is war to the max, as overblown and cartoonish as possible, and yet brilliant.The Scenery; we all know they used CGI, pretty obvious, hard not to notice it. Everyone has a go at it. I say, who cares???? It just gives it an interesting realism look similar to that you expect in a art-piece, and to some degrees, this is art redefined, and looks brilliant, it looks like a Dreamesque world as the Golden and Red sands and creations blow over you, pure brilliance.Gerard Butler; Supposedly he just shouts a bit and walks around topless. The truth is, he has charisma in abundance that breaks through and has you believing in him as a KIng. He battles hard for his men, and treats them as equals, and due to this, makes him a King your willing to follow, he is the bets bit of the show.The Queen; beautiful, and yet a true feminist, she leads the Spartan army alongside her husband and is treated as an equal to her husband in a world of men. Women are just as tough as the men, and at times, more vicious, and she demonstrates her power over the men. Good actress.Characterisation; I wont lie, the characterisation isn't great, it ain't the main subject for the directors. But who is surprised? You learn these people as you go along, you bond with them on the battlefield and learn about them in the heat of battle, which is how this movie works. Characterisation is enough to pass-by, but your here for the battle-scenes.Graphic Violence; The women are naked, tits are shown, and blood is a necessity. Violent? yes. Worth it? Definitely!!!! The Battlescenes; What you came to see, and my god, ain't they worth it?? You have fights against wolves, against Rhinos and Elephants, against magicians, against Ninja types, and against monsters. Its like fighting against a real 7 Nation Army, you have different styles of mies you face on the battlefield, which makes it oh so much better. The blood flies, the dirt grains, the body parts slash and dice, this is a war, and looks f****** amazing, you have to see it to appreciate it.If I have missed out any bits, i will come back and redo this again, so don't worry. Basically, this is the SEX, when it comes to movies, a real roller-coaster of a ride, and you will love it. Watch it and love it.",10,4,10,6 April 2007
