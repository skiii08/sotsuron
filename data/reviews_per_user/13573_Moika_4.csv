Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fantastic movie!!! If you can get past the first half hour!
","When the words 'Star Wars' popped up on the screen at the beginning of the movie, I got chills down my spine.  I could feel that I was in the presence greatness.  However, I thought I was going to hate this movie once it got into it.  It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.  Once it really got into it, though, after they met young Skywalker, the film really started to feel like the others.  I was extremely pleased.  I think that Lucas may have got carried away with the special effects, but I was pleased to see that Yoda was still a puppet.  I left the movie theatre with an extreme feeling of joy and I felt like I was let in on some big secret.  It was a great feeling!  If you're a real Star Wars fan (as I'm sure most of you are) please go see this film.  I had a blast!",4,0,1,21 May 1999
Unbreakable," Pathetic!!! Horrible, Horrible Film!!!
","This movie is extraordinary for one reason!  It has inspired me to try and come up with the top ten worst movies I've ever seen.  I'm sure this one will make the list with no problems.  Please spare yourself the agony that I went through!  Do not, I repeat, do not see this film!!! 
I think M. Knight Shyamalan should be banned from film making for the rest of his days on earth!  Sixth Sense was okay, but I have a feeling (if this movie is at all representative of him as a director/writer) we can expect nothing from him except a nice long piece of film with which to wipe ourselves.  One last note!  This is the worst writing I've seen in five years!  Why does everyone speak in the same tone of voice throughout the film? 
Shyamalan!  You've done it!  You've made me and almost the entire audience in the theatre I was at hate you with a passion so strong, it is unbreakable!1 out of 10.  Don't See this movie!!!",1,7,14,23 November 2000
Remember the Titans," Not Good, Not Bad... Definitely Not Good
","If you enjoy movies where you can guess exactly what is going to happen next, then this one is for you.  There are no surprises, it follows a formula which Hollywood has successfully used over and over again. 
Having said that, I assure you it isn't a horrible movie.  In fact, at times it is entertaining.  It just isn't a movie we can expect to be remembered, and it doesn't deserve to be remembered.  When you don't want to think and you want reassurance that the world is a perfect place after all, then rent this movie.  If you're looking for something more complex and centered (even if just a little bit) in reality, then this picture is not for you.A final note:  Denzel Washington has confirmed that he can play that character.  He has confirmed it several times... recently, in fact.  Now it is time for him to convince us he can pull off other roles.  Not to take anything away from him.  Although the movie was hardly worthy of praise, his performance in 'The Hurricane' was.  I would just like to see him challenge himself with a role new to him and his audience.Anyway, 'Remember the Titans' is a simple person's movie, I gave it 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,4 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," Interesting, but Crowe doesn't live up to his potential.
","I don't want to give anything away, because this film certainly is thought provoking.  There were parts I really enjoyed and parts, I felt, left something to be desired.  Cameron Crowe proved that he was a worthy film maker with 'Jerry Maguire' and that he was an exceptional film maker with the astonishingly good 'Almost Famous'.  That said, 'Vanilla Sky' just didn't measure up.  At times I felt the acting was sub-par (with the exception of Cameron Diaz, who is always good), and that the film didn't know what it wanted to be.  Is it a romance, a mystery, or a science fiction film?  I think part of the problem stems from the fact that this was not really Cameron Crowe's movie, unlike 'Say Anything', 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Almost Famous'.  Instead it was a remake of a 1997 film, which I haven't seen but understand to be quite good (why would a film maker want to remake a film which is only four years old?).  His earlier projects were films about people.  That is what is so wonderful about them.  With the release of 'Almost Famous' it seemed that no one was better a putting real life on the screen than Cameron Crowe.  'Vanilla Sky' however, is not about people, and this is most likely where it falls short.  There was no Cameron Crowe within the film, unlike 'Almost Famous', which is all Cameron Crowe.  All of the world's best art comes from within the artist, this film came from within the guy who directed 'The Others'.With all of that in mind (and I realize it is a lot), 'Vanilla Sky' is not a bad movie.  As a Crowe fan, my expectations were naturally quite high, and the film didn't live up to them.  However, I certainly suggest that you go see it, and draw your own conclusions.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.  The film is visually beautiful (not to mention the cast) and it will serve as a good conversational piece, if nothing else.",7,0,0,16 December 2001
