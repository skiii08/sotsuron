Child 44," Good story, good acting, not a great movie however
","First off, if you want to see a movie about the actual story Child 44 is extremely loosely based on, see Citizen X. That movie is far more graphic in the detail it shows of the murdered children and follows the story and timeline of the actual events.Child 44 actually at times seems to forget that at essence it was supposed to be about a sick serial murderer in the Soviet Union.What this movie did very well was show the fear and moral bankruptcy in the communist regime in the Soviet Union. I think for that reason, everyone should consider watching this movie. Liberals and feminists probably will not like such a raw display of what life would be like if they were given free reign to destroy traditional American values and replace with theirs.That said, the ending is just ridiculous, really detracted from what could have been a strong movie. Spoiler - Don't read this part if you don't want the movie spoiled!So at the end of the movie, the literally just had this horrific monster get shot in the middle of a personal dispute between to rivals in a clandestine secret police force who now wanted to kill each other.That left the audience disappointed, to say the least. We wanted to see this guy tried and then executed for his crimes.Finally, I don't believe this movie knew exactly what story it was trying to tell. Was it a story of a frustrated secret cop who struggled with what he was regularly forced to do? Was it a story of a terrible series of crimes and the effects on those who weren't allowed to investigate it?Was it a story of a man and a woman who come to understand each other and salvage real love where there was no love before?Sadly, this movie does do a great job in any of these areas.",6,1,3,12 February 2016
Molly's Game," Stunningly Awesome Movie
","I just finished watching this movie and was amazed. I recently told a friend I don't think Hollywood could make a good movie anymore with the PC/SJW culture ruining everything that's good in America today. This movie has proven me wrong. What a wonderful movie!The acting was fabulous and well cast. Loved the Actress who played Molly of course but Costner was great too.If you have a chance and haven't seen a good movie lately, you should give this one a view. Well worth the time!",10,1,3,3 August 2018
Gone Girl," Good? No. Horrible? No. Just meh. Could have been really good.
","I can overlook that they cast Ben Affleck who I think is always a bad fit for a movie, any movie. He's a pretty face who can't act.But the movie was really really interesting for the first 2/3 of the movie, the way she set him up. I was really expecting a great finish.But the ending, wow, really disappointing and frankly I simply don't believe he would stay with her.I mean she just put him through heck, proved herself to be a psycho Klinder horror show and I just couldn't not believe that he would even spend one minute alone with her, let alone the rest of his life? Really? I mean everyone knew she murdered that guy. Her explanation for all the events were not even a bit plausible.How about all the blood in the kitchen of her house? If she wasn't dead, where's the wound that caused that blood scene only 7 days before? Really, this movie had some major huge wholes at the end. It just couldn't get the parts to match up.Too bad. It really was an interesting idea and a good start.They just limped into a bad ending. Very disappointing.",6,4,9,14 December 2014
