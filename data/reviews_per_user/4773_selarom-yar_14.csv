The Avengers," Go and see it.
","I just seen this movie. What a roller coaster ride! To those who say it is a waste of time it is not. If you want to see a movie that is 'hard' comic book superhero lore, then don't go. If you want to be entertained and what a great time them go. The move does take liberties with the and at time it slows down, but it is needed. Over all a great ride. Two things you keep in mind when you go see it:1) The 3D was done in post-production so this movie was not filmed for 3D standard def is just fine and bit more clear in the standard def.2) OK for families and small kids. I have seen children from 4 on up. You might have to explain somethings like 'big words' and certain situations, but nothing major.Enjoy!",10,1,4,6 May 2012
Men in Black 3," A good Time Travel Movie MIB Style
","I have to say that when I saw the flick that it was a good one. It has some moments that were great and there were some that was not great and slowed down the pace of the move. There is a great twist and revelation in the movie and once you know what it is, it will clear up many questions that you might have had or just wondered about. All together it is a well made movie and it was well worth the cash that you will plunk down. The 3D was post production and thus it is a gimmick to get you to spend more money, see it in standard and save the money.Enjoy!",8,1,3,26 May 2012
Iron Man 3," Oye! What happened?
","Just saw Iron Man 3 . . . what a snore fest . . . Iron Man 2 and even 1 is better. From the director the brought us 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' - what you have never heard of it? No worries hardly no one has. While 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' is in itself a great art-house movie, why in the world would they give such an important franchise into the hands of a novice in the action/adventure flick? Oye! Would have rather have the John Favalora directing rather than Shane Black . . . he is a better writer than a director. And if it was not for the cinematography of John Toll the movie would have been flat. If it was not for the saving grace of cinematography the movie would not have as successful. So why is the movie make insanely large amount of money at the box office, not to mention all of the DVD, Blu Ray, toys, Video Games and merchandising and licensing. Because of all of the hype that it got from the other two Iron Man movies and Avengers and Thor movies.",6,3,6,4 May 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," Tintin at 10:10
","I saw this movie last night at 10:10pm. It was truly a great movie. Yes, it is not photo-realistic like, for example, Avatar, but is it motion-capture heaven! When Spielburg does his trademark 'rush close-up to the eyes, you see the wrinkles and even the translucent fuzz on the face of Tinti. The set designs the art work and the action as well as the drama parts are well done and crafted.Ah, the music. I have to admit that if it were not the masterful music of John Williams ting the scenes together and pushing the plot long the story would have been lost. At times when the plot slows down and it is looking for either a way out or to change in a different direction, John Williams music comes to the rescue.I have grown up on the movie of Spielburg and the music of John Willimas and I have seen all of the movies, I have to say that they have a working symbiotic relationship to film making. When one needs help the other is there to provide assistance. A question comes to mind, can Spielburg make a movie without that symbiotic relationship with John Williams? Can the filmmaker survive with the composer? Oh, yes, the story line. It maybe that the story is based on 2 or even 3 of Tintin adventures, but what a masterfully telling of it all. Some will be against about it, but remember just like Lemmony Snicket where that have to interweave 3 books together to make a movie longer, besides the adventures of Tintin were times interrelated like any good serial are. The writers had to intertwine the stories together to make and sensible whole. If they were to make a movie out of one, like some people will say that it should be done that way, then it will be a 'short movie' and not a 'feature movie'. Now what fun will that be that you have to come back to the theater to see part two, three, etc. Yes, it will be a great money maker but it will destroy the theme of the movie and the story line.) So even though have not read Tintin, or have not even heard of Tintin, this is an excellent introduction to him and his adventure.Why 8 out of 10 stars? At times (rearely) the story stumbles and if it were not the music of John Williams to the rescue, we would have been lost in the thicket.Long live Snowy!",8,3,6,2 January 2012
Pacific Rim," Quintessential Del Torro Movie, WOW!
","Del Torro hits it out of the ball park with this flick. The Controlled balance between story and action is perfect. A solid movie in all fronts. If you like robots, monsters and mix of good drama (no matter how superficial it my be) then this is a movie is for you. The little ones will not like it so much and the movie is very loud and there is a lot going on the movie that they will easily get lost. The older children it is fine and may appreciate more the movie that the little ones. How I know this? Standing in line and see what type of people are in line helps, and while the movie is playing you can hear the little fuss during the quiet scenes and the cry during the loud. While the family behind me the boys said 'wow! awesome!' a couple of time. GO and see it! Can't wait for Hellboy 3!",10,1,7,12 July 2013
District 9," The Most Original Sci-fi movie ever.
","I just came back from seeing the movie. There was not many people, but it did not matter because I can pay attention to the movie better than having people climbing around you just to get popcorn.This movie was a big sigh of relief for the summer movie dribble that has been coming out. This movie is not a remake making you say to yourself that I saw this movie before. This movie is not a book to silver screen type either. Complete originality oozes from every frame of this film. This film is going to in the Oscars you watch.There are people that will look at this movie and say what is it? Trust me you don't want to go for that proverbial pop corn run, if you do you will miss something.Here is a film that is shot in a quasi 'point of view'. No, it does not have the annoying camera shaking that some directors think that it shows frenzy of action or create tension for example Quarantine, Cloverleaf, and even Transformer movies where a still camera or establishment wide shots are not the norm. Here in this film there is shaking and POV shots, but they are controlled and used very infrequent only to be used on those shots that enhance the plot. You will not get dizzy heading for the barf bag in the first hint of action.This movie is shot perfectly, pace is perfect, direction, and art direction are spot on. Worth the $7.50. Go . . . go . . . see it you will like it.",10,1,4,14 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Did Nay Sayers See The Same Movie As I Did?
","Reading the reviews and I see negative after negative reviews for the purists and nitpickers of the universe that left me scratching my 'cabeza'. I have went and see the movie, paid my $10.50, saw it in 3-D with my movie buddy and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was entertaining. I bet that the 'nay sayers' sat there and kept there critical glasses on and ripped apart the movie at every turn. While on the other hand, I and I am sure others, did not have it one and let the movie do its thing and take us on a ride in the Star Wars Universe. I am sure that if they did that, they would have seen the movie for what it is, a masterpiece of cinematic history.Now after that gush, I have listen to the JW Soundtrack that is streaming on Apple iTunes, a couple of times while waiting for my hard copy order to come from B&N, and I have to say that while John Williams uses his old original iconic music to tell the story, it was the glue that really held the movie together. It was a perfect marriage of sonic story telling. If it was not for the music, the feature would have fallen flat, and the audience would have been disappointed. So, Disney had better kiss the feet of Williams for holding the movie together, since John knew enough that he had to incorporate easily recognizable character tunes (leitmotif - a recurrent theme throughout a musical or literary composition, associated with a particular person, idea, or situation.) to help guide the audience as to what to expect. If it weren't for that, then the audience would have gotten lost. To enjoy the move, you will have to understand that it was a variation to the theme of Empire (Johnson even said that). While the story of TFW, JJ Abrams keep the story clean, Johnson kept the story not so much clean, but complex with 3 sub plots merging into one beautiful story line. Put it this way, as TFW was pulp fiction: TLJ was literature. The question of who is the last Jedi is answered by Luke warning the world about the movie, 'it's not going to go the way your think.' Keep that warning from Luke, and just enjoy the film and its music, and kiss the Porg.",9,13,39,16 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," Great Entertainment and pure Adventure
","I just came back from watching this movie . . . and I have to say that the production is a marvelous updating and re-imagining of the original. Growing up with the original (the time that the original was released with was state of the art) I have to say that this re-imagining of it is perfect. The simple plot line of the original is kept somewhat intact, but the addition of the Magi was wonderful and a well needed addition.But there are two setbacks to the movie that made me give it a 9 instead of a 10. 1) Pegasus is black (in mythology he is supposed to be white). And they called it 'the pegasus' (as a noun, a thing, an animal) instead of Pegasus a proper name the horse of Zeus. 2)Gone is the golden owl for a companion of Perseus (which make a very brief appearance in the movie, you have to go see the movie to know where. But it was used in the original as the comedy relief) Besides for the two things mention above this move is for the OLDER CHILDREN and not for the young ones. There are some parts that are very intense and scary images for the young ones, but OK for the older children.For what is worth, great story, action balanced with just the right amount of CGI makes this movie for good entertainment. For what other reason do we go to the movies?",6,3,6,5 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Perfect Burton not for Children.
","Let me start off by saying has anyone ever read both Alice books written by Lewis Carol? If you have not, then the comparison that some make to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and calling the 'Queen of Hearts' the 'Red Queen' has not read those books.Like in any adaptation, the source material is just the blue print to build the house on; and there is going to be a change in it when it gets to the site to be built. Well the same goes for the Alice in Wonderland.This Movie is not for children it is for older children. If your child had a problem seeing 'Coroline', then this movie is not for the little ones. This movie is pure Burton at his finest! With all of the whimsical, Gothic humor and noir.There are many reviewers that dispatch this movie to the trash, but they either have not read neither of the books nor have understood that to be silly and to be part of a world that does not make sense Is what makes this movie what it is. Like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when Mike T.V. says that what he seeing does not make sense Charlie says (paraphrasing) it is not supposed to make sense after all that is what candy is. Don't try to over think through every frame, but take it as a good story being told by a master story teller through glasses of Gothic noir. Oh yes, if you see it in 3D be careful with the little ones, there are some sequences that, as true to form for Burton, there are at times creatures that come up 'at your face'. Other than that little bit of warning, grab on to your our popcorn and get ready for a wondrous ride through Wonderland (Underland, see the movie and you will know) Yes, Jonny Depp he is the Mad Hatter after all he is supposed to be mad and zany even with orange hair.",10,6,14,9 March 2010
Despicable Me," What great family fun.
","We just came back from seeing this movie (my wife and me)? And we have to say that we liked very much. Great animation and great moral story line that will make any parent smile. The jokes both spoke and visual were tastefully done with out any offensive humor. One of the best aspects of the whole movie are the Minions. Go see the movie and you will laugh your head off.There many families with young children about 6 years old all the way up to those that are children at heart laughing and having a great time with the movie. There was nothing offensive at all with the movie and it is a MUST SEE IN 3D! No worries with the children, just good family fun movie. There are some jokes and situations that was clearly written for the adults and we got it while the children where blissfully unaware.Good, good, good movie for a family outing. Go and enjoy it especially in 3D.",10,2,4,24 July 2010
The Woman in Black," A Haunted House Flick Done Well!
","First, this is a great break away film for Daniel Radcliffe! No more Harry Potter character for him. Yes, his stint on the stage, and Broadway were great, but still does not give him the audience reach that this film gives him. He needs to make more films that will give him the audience reach that he needs to break free from the 'bi-speckled' character of Harry Potter that he was been playing for all of these years. Still he is a joy to watch. See and notice as I did that he was the bluest of eyes that really stand out. Is it done on purpose, I don't know but kind of make you think. With his body language he creates a tensions and mystery that this movie needed to work well. To give that creepy and haunted 'look over your shoulder' type of performance.It is 'A' typical 'Hammer'(look up the production company) move that will will give give that creepy feeling of 'you should not be there' entertainment that is traditional to every haunted house movie. Dark, creaking floors, dim dusty nooks and carnies, squeaky heavy doors, and jiggling door nob and a twisted story line all done with taste. Is this a 'Oscar' winning performance, nah, but maybe for sound. You have to see the movie to understand. Don't over think it when watching this move and see it for what it is, a haunted house flick that you have to see with the lights off, a bowl of popcorn, a drink and your other half next to you. And get ready for the twist and turns. Enjoy.",8,0,1,27 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Did Every Mom's Basement Troll See the Same Movie?
","Folks! I just don't understand the amount of negative reviews that are out there! What where the Mom's Basement Trolls looking for in the movie, a complete exposition of the 30 years that have passed since Return of the Jedi? If you were expecting that, then we would have a 3 hour plus movie.In this latest installment history always repeats itself, with the adage if it did work the last time then lets build a bigger one. Only to find out that it will only but fail. Remember that this is the start of the 3rd trilogy, and the introduction of new characters, plots and world must take place in the first act, if you don't, then you will not know what it is all about for the other installments.Solid script, direction, story, production and especially the soundtrack. It is easier to be negative than to be positive and those that write negative reviews are only looking for their 15 minutes of fame.To wit. This movie is perfect getaway.",10,6,36,1 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Wonderful conclusion!
","I am going to keep this short and sweet. Photographed beautifully and the movement of the camera done with great precision and tastefully done. The deviations from the plot line OK. Besides J. K. Rowling was executive producer through out and that means that she had the final say in everything. CGI done perfect, so much so, that the membranes of the dragon's wings fluttered in the wind, wow! Only thing that I wish is that they should have released the film as ONE complete whole (Part 1 and 2 together). I hope that they will release it in Blu-ray as one complete film. Yes, to make more money split it in two, but for the purists no parts please! The reason? The emotional arc of the movie is lost in the second part that is found in the fist. What lacked in the first the second had and what the second lacked the first had. If we can sit through over 3 hours of Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Rings we can sure sit through a 5 hours of Harry Potter!",9,0,1,22 July 2011
Godzilla," Godzilla: King of the Monsters
","Today I saw Godzilla. I have to admit it is a great movie! I am so happy that they finally did a reboot of the franchise. Smart, well acted, solid storyline and plot, the dialog is not quirky or gimmicky. Just a good, good movie all around from the special effects, sound, dialog, sets, and art. to that point, the movie's soundtrack ties in everything nicely together. The question arises, is it good for families? Yes, for families that have 6-7 years old. Younger children have have a problem of the loudness of the film. Still it is well worth the $11.00. Oh did I mention that it was loud . . . and for obvious reasons.",9,4,11,17 May 2014
