Hereditary," What did I just watch?
","You get the sense when you watch this slow moving, listless twaddle that it is going somewhere that maybe interesting. It's not. It's going somewhere else. It ends up arriving at that place, having confused and annoyed the viewer, and appears to be surprised to find itself there. Don't go on that journey with this film.",1,1,3,15 September 2018
