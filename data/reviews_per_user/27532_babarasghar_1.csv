Ford v Ferrari," Excellent movie, stupid title
","It was more a battle within Ford rather than Ford Vs Ferrari. 'Miles' would have been a better tribute to this unsung hero of this story. We hardly ever see a Ford Vs Ferrari battle except few scenes of on track race.
From very start it was all about Shelby n Miles duo who brought fame to Ford n how Ford internal politics played out.
Le Mans '66 is much valid title but Ford v Ferrari is a commercial title for this movie.
Bale did wonderful as always, excellent character development.
Over all movie is superb, my only gripe is with the title.",8,1,2,30 December 2019
