Minority Report," So much smarter than most
","This is film is so much smarter and more intense than 99% of the films Hollywood cranks out, particularly at this time of year, that I was more than willing to forgive the few flaws along the way.  But why does Spielberg feel compelled to slap a pallatable ending on even his dark films?  This premise killed A.I. but it manages to only slow down Minority Report from Warp Speed to merely Supersonic.",9,0,0,22 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Horrible.
","This movie was some of the most horrible crap I have ever seen.  Apart from the fetching Natalie Portman and a 5 minute light saber fight involving Yoda, this movie was simply unwatchable.  Needless to say, I will still see episode 3 but I really hope that Lucas hires a screen writer for that one. The dialogue here was so flat that it makes Phantom Menace seem like a Hollywood classic.",2,0,0,18 May 2002
Duck Soup," Hail, Hail Freedonia
","When I was a Social Studies teacher, I used to show this right before Easter break to show the kids what movies used to be like and to give them some sense of what the Marx Brothers madness was all about. The first time I showed it, I was more than a little surprised to see just how many of them laughed.  I just thought it would be a little too dated for them, or not spicey enough.  But there's something about Groucho's delievery.  The insults are one thing but I think it's the fact that he's always taking upward swipes at some icon or person of priviledge that even now a teenager can get what he's all about.",10,0,0,25 December 2000
Jerry Maguire," dreadful
","I remember leaving the theatre feeling badly for Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise (not that either of them particularly need my pity).  My girlfriend surprised me by saying she liked it.  Then over the ensuing months I was continually shocked by positive comments, great box office and ultimately Oscar Consideration for this film.This movie is simplistic, vapid, humourless and at times offensive.  I wouldn't think it possible to make a movie with significant amounts of Football in it, this bad.At least 'Almost Famous' flopped.",2,11,26,25 December 2000
Donnie Darko," Very cool.
",This is a very cool movie that manages the always difficult balance between a Fantastic premise and strong chracacter development.  Some really great performance by Donnie and the young love interest really raise this movie a notch above most films of this ilk.I also appreciated the way they managed to make the movie look authentically 1988.  (Was Blockbuster around then?  That's the only problem I sniffed). I'm sure there are a few nitpicking slips but the clothing and slang were authentic without being obvious sources of Era-comedy.,9,0,0,28 October 2001
The Godfather," 20th Century Shakespeare at its finest.
","I am one of those dorks who knows virtually every line to this movie? Why? Because the characters move with that timeless, understated intensity that no other director gets quite right.  Coppola manages to give these brutal men a razor thin layer of humanity, and we're hooked along for the ride. We despise Tattaglia, Brazzini, Carlo-everyone who threatens the dynasty.And of course it ends with sublimely just revenge.  Who can ever forget Carlo kicking at the windshield while Michael looks out from his window?",10,0,1,25 December 2000
