Catch Me If You Can," A delightful movie to enjoy
","Based on the fantasizing story, this movie did a fairly good job. Seems everything is in motion and the director, photographer, all the amusing actors did very well. I am not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but this movie he sure is in his best performance.  Chris Walken is excellent, Tom Hanks and even Amy Adams all showed their talents.One thing I would like to change is NOT to show the France scene at the beginning. It gave out the plot throughout the movie so I knew he will never get caught before France, which is bad for a suspense film like this.I give it 8/10.",Null,0,1,23 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," OK but
","So I know you are going to watch the movie no matter what others say. This movie for sure worth watching but(1) The music is little bit overdone comparing to the first one (2) The humor touch: don't like it. This is a serious movie, so get serious. (3) Dialogue long and boring: seems the brothers want to put more philosophy spin to the movie, but not nature and everyone has to give a 5-min speech. (4) Do we really need the love-making scene?? !!I gave it 7/10 and really hope the last one would get better.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
