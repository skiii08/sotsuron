The Incredible Hulk," Hulk.... Smash!!!!
","This movie was awesome! For those who think this movie to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 The Hulk... think again. This movie is a reboot, and a freakin good one too. The Incredible Hulk is more or less progressed with the story, not the characters. Edward Norton is far better than Eric Bana as Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Liv Tyler is not bad as Bruce Banner's girlfriend, Betty Ross, but for some reason and I don't know why, but I like Jennifer Connelly as her in Ang Lee's version better. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy, Emil Blonsky a.k.a. Abomination and the William Hurt plays General 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who isn't half bad at the part. Bruce Banner has been on the run for five years and he lives in South Americ, trying to find a cure for what turns him into the big, green, fighting machine. The U.S. Army finds him and he has to go back to the United States to find the cure. He meets up with his old girlfriend Betty and they go to this scientist who Bruce had been talking to on his computer so he could help him find a cure. Emil Blonsky, after going up against the Hulk twice for the U.S. Army, wants to become as strong as he is. After Bruce and Betty are taken away in a helicopter, the scientist, Dr. Samuel Sterns who becomes the Leader, a villain, in the comics, injects Emil with the same stuff Bruce has in him. Emil becomes Abomination and he and the Hulk fight in a battle that is full of smashing and punching and kicking and more punching and so on and so forth. The action scenes in this movie are some of the best I've seen in most comic book movie adaptations. The story may not be all that great, but this is definitely a movie for action film lovers to go see.",9,2,5,14 June 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Oh Crap!....
","Hellboy 2 is far superior to the first one in almost every way. In the first one, I didn't like the John Myers character that much. I thought he slowed the movie down, and I'm glad he's not in the second. Of course, he wasn't the only problem with the first, but many things in the second are far better than in the second. One of my favorite things with this film is the creatures that Del Toro created for the movie. The elves, trolls, goblins, fairies and others were just so freakin' awesome. The best thing of the film though was Hellboy himself. Ron Perlman, as in the first film, plays him with perfection. There is plenty of humor in the movie which is refreshing and the action is phenomenal. The supporting characters, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, and the newcoming protoplasmic Johann Krauss, are excellent in there roles. Prince Nuada, played by Luke Goss, is probably one of the best characters in the movie. One problem with the movie is how it hardly develops some of the characters, such as Princess Nuala and Prince Nuada. Another is that it sort of felt rushed, even though in some points it didn't. Either way, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is an excellent action/fantasy film and one of my favorites so far this summer.",9,1,3,19 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Best Movie Ever!!!!
","The Dark Knight has to be, by far, one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time. The performances were phenomenal, especially the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. His performance alone could make the movie. Christian Bale as Batman is not just as good as Batman Begins, it is a thousand times better. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman reprise their roles as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, and are better than before. The Dark Knight is much more of a crime drama than a full fledged action flick, but is still excellent. The Joker is terrorizing the city of Gotham and finally sets into motion, his plan to bring chaos and anarchy to the city. As he does this, Harvey Dent played by the awesome Aaron Eckhart, helps try to bring the city hope alongside Batman and Gordon. Eventually, though, Dent becomes twisted in his ways of chance and because of the Joker becomes Two-Face. All in all, this movie is not just the best of this summer, but one of the greatest movies of all time.",10,5,11,14 August 2008
Iron Man," A Super Hero Classic
","When I went into theaters, I didn't think Iron Man would be all that good. I thought it would be another comic book-turned-movie mess up like The Hulk, Ghost Rider, or X-Men (excluding X-Men 2 of course). Yet this film is one of the greater super hero movies I've seen. With its superb visuals to its magnificent main character played by Robert Downey Jr. who seems like he was born for the role of Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. It begins when Tony Stark is in Afghanistan on an army convoy when it's attacked by terrorists. He is captured and is forced to build a missile of his own for the terrorists to use in dominating Asia and possibly even the world in time. Instead, he secretly builds a suit of armor that helps him escape ultimately leading to his rescue. When he gets back to the U.S. he decides to no longer build weapons and put people in harms way. He builds two suits, the Mark II and the Mark III that he uses to fight against the same terrorists that captured him. Eventually Obadiah Stane, who is sort of second in command at Stark Industries, uses his own suit and becomes Iron Monger, trying to kill Iron Man so he can rule over Stark Industries himself. The movies' combined action, visual effects, characters, and humor make this movie one of the top three super hero movies of all time.",9,2,4,17 May 2008
