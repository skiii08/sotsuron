Moneyball," A very true story
","If you like business or baseball, you're going to love this one. I am a baseball geek myself and all of this was a true story and not even overstated the least bit. It's the story of how the Oakland A's with the smallest player payroll budget during the 2002 season made it to the post season with the help of a computer and a nerdy guy with a degree in economics. Ever heard of the 20 game win streak? Ever heard of the names such as Jermaine Dye, Scott Hatteberg, David Justice, Eric Byrnes, or Tim Hudson? No? Well you need to watch this movie!",8,2,3,29 January 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Tom Holland? Really?
","I'm sorry but the new Spider Man just ruined it for me. Tom Holland portrayed Spider Man as this geeky, nerdy, and immature basically little kid who doesn't know how to control himself or what to do in a superhero situation. Andrew Garfield was the best Spider Man of which he portrayed him as a controlled teenager nearly young man who's faced some problems and wears his emotions on his sleeve. While Andrew Garfield has become too old to play a teenager and I have respect from Tom Holland, he just wasn't the best pick. I think Josh Wiggins would've been a better pick for Spider Man. I hope Tom Holland can turn it around in the future movies.",5,1,4,29 January 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Pleasantly surprised with this movie
","Being that this movie's main focus being mental disorder and that it's Hollywood, I really didn't expect anything special but this movie is really a diamond in a bunch of coal. I have dealt with emotional disorders such as portrayed in this film and its representation is very accurate. Just as the movie plot goes, therapy only goes so far and you have to come to a point where other people help you out. My uncle was bipolar just like Pat in the movie and how Pat turns to others for help is the same way my uncle did. The acting was awesome, the cast choice was perfect, the plot was exciting, and was very Oscar worthy. One of the best films I've seen in years for sure.",10,1,2,29 January 2018
Dunkirk," Meh... it doesn't deserve the hype.
","All my friends were saying this movie would be awesome but I was not impressed. Not only were their multiple plots going on at different time intervals that jumped around at the worst times but everything was very overstated, too. There's only 2 emotions you'll feel watching this movie which is sad and very confused. Don't waist your money on this one. There's much better out there in terms of war themed and historical movies.",6,1,2,29 January 2018
Tropic Thunder," Best comedy I've seen.
","Good lord, this movie is hilarious and epic. The characters with their own insecurities being thrown into the most random and dumb situations ever is just so funny. The dialogue had me and my dad crying in front of the TV. Anybody who likes comedies or war movies, check this one out!",9,6,10,3 April 2018
Good Will Hunting," Powerful film
","This film is just simply powerful. It states the situation of a man many people can relate to but few understand what's happening in his mindset. Any man out there who's gone through those motions of stuffing down emotions and bad feelings know how hard this hits home. Ladies, this movie is just simply a great flick and will give you an idea to how us men think. The plot of this movie is great, acting is fantastic, and it's moving. Matt Damon and Robin Williams killed it.",9,1,2,4 April 2018
Into the Wild," Dreadful and Depressing
","Just to sum up, this movie is about a man who justifies his poor upbringing as a reason to rebel from society and relationships. In short, it was dreadful and depressing. Most of the movie, you feel confused, sad, and it stays this way all the way until the bitter end where he dies in the wilderness alone and in the cold. My only stars go to production quality which is spectacular and comparable to the movies of today.",4,0,0,10 March 2020
Sausage Party," The ultimate adult animated film.
","WARNING: NOT FOR KIDS! This movie is really hilarious! Me and a friend of mine went to see it and we did all we could not to cry from laughter in the theater. This movie is raunchy, it's offensive, it's atypical, and that's what makes it totally awesome. I've never had such a good time at a movie then I did with this one. If you got the most dirty mind you know of or you like movies that go against the grain of Hollywood then watch this one. Seth Rogen is a genius!",9,2,2,29 January 2018
The Reader," It's a curveball but it's original.
","While this movie seems odd because the plot occurred in 3 different stages, it's really well done. It takes all of the social taboo's of the 1900's along with the cultural affects from World War II and pieces them all together in this awesome film with the character of Michael who had an affair with Hannah, a woman nearly twice his age as a young teenager and while we may forget things like that as a teenager, she's thrown right back in his life some years later as a college law student who he must defend her while she's on trial for her actions partaken with the German Nazi regime efforts. This movie is intense, exciting, and arousing in a very original plot. This movie really gives a perspective of how detrimental the consequences of life decisions can be.",10,1,1,29 January 2018
The Wrestler," Well Produced Movie and Incredibly Relatable
","The Wrestler is an absolutely amazing movie. Not only is it amazingly accurate of the wrestling culture and community, it's incredibly relatable. People generally have passions, hobbies, and interests because of what it serves to them. Not only do they like the subject or field that they can enjoy, they serve as a distraction to the real world and the hostility reality can present to us. The Wrestler embodies this with a washed up man who's past his prime and has made hard mistakes in his life. If you're looking to watch a movie that strikes painfully close and is a reminder to all of us of what's important in life, you'll love this flick!",8,0,0,21 April 2020
Pitch Perfect 3," Just...why?
","I'm a very masculine dude so I wouldn't have seen it unless my girlfriend hadn't asked me to see it when I took her out for date night. Feminist comments aside, this movie was just god awful. The dialogue was less than adequate, the general plot was far fetched, and their attempt to seem like a cool movie was all for nothing.SPOILER ALERT: No woman or man for that matter can move that fast for that long during that scene with the boat kidnapping. All the feminists and fat acceptance people will '*LOVE*' this movie for that.",5,7,14,29 January 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Move over, James Bond, you've got company.
","With how stupidly long the 007 series has been running, I finally decided to move on to another series. Here's the thing about spy/secret agent gone humorous/sexy movies. It's an old fashioned idea and an acquired taste. The morals are old school, the plots are old school, the ideas are old school, everything is old school but it doesn't mean those who decided to produce those kinds of movies can't put their own spins on them.Kingsman is the perfect example of that kind of movie. The plot gets your attention, the dialogue is witty, and the dull moments always turn sexy. That's how it's supposed to be. It's about the macho, bad@$$ dude with some confidence in himself with women and courage in the face of danger no matter how realistic the idea is or not. Kingsman just took it to a whole new level and taking the gamble with not very well known actors payed off well. It was, in my book, the best film of 2014.",9,0,0,4 February 2018
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Greatest satire in film history
","You're crazy if you don't love comedy movies or at least one of them but perhaps the most misunderstood sub section of comedy is satire. Satires are hard to execute, work and flow right, and bring to the big screen. Will Ferrell's acting and Adam McKay's directing just made the greatest satire movie ever. It fits the bill and hits the checklist in every category. It makes you laugh, the dialogue is extremely quotable, the scenes are memorable, and the stereotypes are just oh so perfect. NASCAR, which is arguably the most joked about sport in the world, was the perfect way to root a satire movie and this movie nailed it. Even a NASCAR fan myself, I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the movie. You gotta watch it if you love funny stories or if you're a race fan.",8,1,1,4 February 2018
