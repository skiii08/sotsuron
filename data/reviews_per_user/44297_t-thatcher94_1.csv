The Avengers," My review of The Avengers
","The Avengers is a behemoth of action that comic nerds and casual movie-goers alike can enjoy in the same vein. It's not only action packed, but the humor, and the script altogether, was well written and compliments each character completely. For example, Captain America speaks like how you would think: a bit dated, not exactly knowing much of his surroundings yet. He speaks as anybody who just woke up from being frozen for seventy odd years. Bruce Banner, also known as The Hulk, speaks in a sort of timid, nervous way. He mumbles a bit, and is constantly scared that something will happen that makes him very, very angry. Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays Banner/Hulk, pulls this off gracefully as he truly is Bruce, and not just an actor playing him. Brilliant performances from the cast are a major driving point for this movie. Tony Stark is as sarcastic and witty as he normally is. Thor is awkward with his mythos and his stories of battles and what-not. In fact, Thor would be the only character that sort of didn't mesh in with the rest of the team. The actor who played him, Chris Hemsworth, didn't convince me that he was actually the character he was playing like everyone else did. Even though Thor was powerful and awesome, the actor who played him was a hit and miss for me.More praises aside for the other actors, the action of this movie raises the bar for how a superhero movie should be made. Explosions, gun fights, jets, super powers, and martial arts can make for a summer blockbuster if done right. The Avengers is done right. They do a good job in accurately showing each characters different abilities and strength levels (in the fight between Iron Man and Thor, Thor is clearly shown be stronger than Iron Man's armor, but Iron Man's repulsors are shown be as powerful as they are in the comics, knocking Thor off of his feet). Hulk is portrayed as the unstoppable beast that he is, utterly destroying everything in his path as he fights the alien antagonists of the movie. He even pummels Loki, and to a much lesser extent, Thor, who were both worshiped as gods at one point. Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye are shown to be proficient in martial arts and that shows that normal people can be a super hero too.The editing of the movie, along with the plot, action, special effects, and the pop culture references, make this movie out to be one of my genuine favorites. Being a comic book fan, I am truly pleased with this movie and I'm very excited for the future of Marvel Studios. They pump out action-packed super hero movies all the time, and if The Avengers is any indication of what's to come, they have my vote.  Plot-A  Special Effects-A+  Sound-A  Humor-A  Real world references-A  Comic Lore-A-",10,1,4,18 November 2012
