Blade Runner 2049," Not quite sure what to make of Villeneuve
","I was waiting for this movie, pretty much everything seemed to be in place for a good movie, even the ratings were good. When I finally got to see it I wasn't too thrilled.I've seen four movies from Villeneuve now, Prisoners, Enemy, Arrival and now this. Best of them have been Prisoners, which is a super solid blockbuster drama thriller with superb acting and Enemy, which is more of an indie curiosity. I wasn't blown away by Arrival like many, but thought it was just 'pseudo smart' thinker sci-fi wrapped up in nice package. Bladerunner 2049 falls a bit into the same cathegory. Both seem to have deep characters and the slow pace makes the movies seem smart, but something lacks and especially Bladerunner feels shallow. Ryan Gosling is a good actor, but I felt zero connection to his character. Harrison Ford couldn't re-connect to his portrayal of Deckard either in my opinion. The characters just didn't work.The package is nice, no doubt about it, very very nice imagery. I may watch the movie again just for the pics, maybe I'll get deeper into the characters next time too. Overall I now feel that this was overly stylized and long where proper character direction was forgotten. It's kind of shame as Ryan Gosling pulls of very good scenes here and there, but they weren't enough to salvage the whole. Especially as the ending, in my opinion, isn't very rewarding.",7,3,6,21 August 2018
It," Fun horror in style of Stranger Things
","I enjoyed watching this. I'm a huge fan of Stranger Things, The Goonies, Stand by Me etc. It's somewhat weird movie as all the main characters are children, but the movie is definitely way too intense for smaller kids. There are some seriously spooky moments as well as very well made fx.Acting is good all the way through, even tho some of the characters are a bit under developed. It's strange considering the movie lasts for over two hours and is definitely long for it's style. It doesn't feel long tho, it entertains very nicely, but you'd think some more substance would fit all that duration. I can't honestly say where all that time went.So the story. I'm puzzled what or who the clown was or what did it represent. What was it's intention? What was this floating thing? Maybe it has something to do with growing up as the clown seemed to manifest when fears often concerning parents and growing up surfaced. The girl was getting her periods and there's all this blood her dad can't see. But not all fears seemed consistent with each other, so I was definitely a bit puzzled. Maybe the sequel wraps the story up.Entertaining and very well made, but not perfect.",8,1,2,10 September 2018
Hereditary," Super intense horror, but still not quite the masterpiece I expected
","I watch a lot of horror movies, especially like ones with psychological drama and religious undertones. I'm not into blood and gore, that's not horror imo. That's not to say this movie didn't have it's graphic and bloody moments.Well, there was a lot of talk about how good this movie is and to a certain extent I agree. It's super intense and well made, genuinely creepy and unsettling. But there was a lot that did not quite work. I'm all for movies that require thinking, but to me it feels like this movie expects viewer to make a bit too many conclusions based on clues and even if they seem logical after explaining, they really are not. There is also a lot of 'supernatural' stuff, which is handy for script continuity and creepy factor, but doesn't help making 'logical' conclusions easier. It's not exactly complicated movie, but to assume that pretty much everything we saw was pre-planned and happened for a reason is quite a lot to put together on a single seating.For example I very well noticed the symbol on the pole by the road, but why make one part of the 'summoning' so super complicated and insanely random, other than just for the sake of making a shocking and unexpected scene.I like the fact that it wasn't just mental illness in the end this time, but I feel Annies (Toni Collette) character was somewhat off. Or maybe it was the fact that even tho Annie played like the lead, she didn't play a huge part when it comes to the story. Other than being the unwanted daughter. Peter (Alex Wolff) on the other hand wasn't as big a part of the story as he eventually ended up being. His looks were also very misleading as he didn't quite seem to fit the same 'hereditary'. Steve (Gabriel Byrne) was basically just a bystander and had no purpose other than being 'the sane one'. Charlie (Millie Shapiro) was an interesting character, but very much under used.Seemingly good, but quite unbalanced as a whole.",7,0,1,23 January 2019
Gravity," Not exactly what I was waiting to see
","After all the praise and reviews, great IMDb score and Oscars, I was waiting for a different movie. I figured this would be a realistic sci-fi 'talkie'. Instead it's highly unrealistic Hollywood action. Actually I'm not sure if action is the right word, but a lot of things happen.I was seriously waiting for an intelligent movie where Bullock would be drifting in space - something that would make you think, but instead we get to see how Bullock saves herself from running out of oxygen, space debris, fire on a space station, figuring out which button to press, flying around in space, lot's of tense scenes where she's trying to grab on to something etc.Even tho it's quite tense at times, the breathers are quite boring. Bullock does OK and the movie looks good, but that's it. There's not much else to it. It's very unrealistic, at least feels so. I'm not an expert on the subject, but I would much rather see Apollo 13 again than this.Not a bad movie by all means, but I was disappointed.",5,4,6,13 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I expected it to be good and it was
","I grew up with the original trilogy and all the merchandise in the 80s, so I have lived and breathed Star Wars, it's a part of me and I know the originals inside out. In the 90s I was a young adult and interested in other things, so the second trilogy passed by quietly - altho I did see each film. I liked Force Awakens, it was a trip back to childhood and a well made Star Wars movie. Rogue One had my expectations high for a couple of reasons, #1 it being a new original Star Wars movie, but close #2 being the director Gareth Edwards. I absolutely loved his movie Monsters. Godzilla wasn't quite as good, but the atmosphere was there. I think Edwards has a great eye for cinematography, use of close ups in contrast to wide open spaces and great locations. He also clearly understands the need of drama and buildup and not going for straight up action. This was very clear in Monsters, which is basically a talkie, not much action there. Even Godzilla has relatively little action and a long build up, but the whole movie didn't work quite as well as Monsters.Rogue One looks amazing, everything is spot on. Cinematography, locations, fx, the cast and how they look. It was great seeing men with sideburns and vanishing hair, it was of course obvious to style them according to the first Star Wars movie made in the late 70's for continuity, but it was very well done. The cast doesn't look like they are superstars, they look real and gritty.The story works. In the beginning the movie moves quickly from one place to another, but it sticks together quite well. It's basically quite a straight forward movie, even to a point of being maybe a tad too long for what it has to tell. I was surprised how much this movie mirrors todays conflicts in middle east and the fact that it clearly takes the terrorist point of view. I'm also quite surprised how easily people have accepted this or not seen the connection. There is even a holy city by the name of Jedha and there is a real city of Jeddah close to Mecca. It really is not that far fetched to see rebels as extremist terrorists and empire as the 'world police'.Acting is good. While Felicity Jones' portrayal of Jyn Erso is not quite as interesting as it could be, I'd say Cassian Andor by Diego Luna is a well written and portrayed character. I also liked Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic as the villain, very well acted. K-2SO as the C3PO style comic relief works perfectly, this is really a perfect example of a well done comic relief. The rest of the cast - while quite big - are all good and interesting, well portrayed characters.Actions scenes are amazingly done, even tho I'm not a huge fan of action, but here it works.After the amazing use of music for atmosphere in Monsters, I was slightly disappointed with the soundtrack in Rogue One. The John Williams connection is there, the original themes when ever Vader or a familiar character is on screen, but the rest of the themes are a bit so-so. There are variations of the original themes, which made me think 'that's not how it's supposed to go', slightly distracting. And the themes didn't feel emotionally that fitting. I understand you can't go with an electronic soundtrack for a Star Wars movie, but I may have tried a bit different themes and orchestrations for a movie like this.All in all highly recommended. Stands on it's own, but there are spine tingling moments for Star Wars fans, especially in the end. While Force Awakens was a bit of a pastiche of the originals, this one takes it's own approach for most part. It's more of a sci-fi war drama, but with a proper dose of Star Wars we know and love.",9,2,5,17 January 2017
World War Z," Great movie
","I made the mistake of reading a few reviews here before watching this film. Or actually I don't know if it was a mistake, because I was positively surprised. There were lot's of bad reviews, from different aspects, and therefore I postponed watching this for quite long.Glad I watched it tho. It's a very well made movie. Pretty much everything is good here, from acting to soundtrack to visuals. The script is maybe the weakest link. I haven't read the book, so I can't say how this compares, but there are few things that bothered me a bit. First, it's a bit of a mess, a lot of things happen, places change, people change. It does manage to stay quite consistent, but it at times feels like it's multiple episodes of a series edited together. Kind of James Bondy in a way, they don't stay in one place for too long.The beginning is tense, it goes full throttle quite quickly, but then changes pace back to normal quite soon. Korea and Israel are parts of the story that feel a bit rushed, and there's a scene in Korea that goes a bit 'Pulp Fiction' and doesn't exactly fit the atmosphere, a weird decision from the film makers if you ask me. The Israel episode is a bit ho-hum also, not bad, but .. I don't know.The finale in Wales is very different again, that episode goes much deeper into characters and stealth action, very well made and enjoyable.People have said it's not a proper zombie movie without blood and gore. It's true that there's very little of it. I don't mind, since I'm not into gore. Actually this was really good choice, since you don't need to look away from the screen all the time and wait what disgusting stuff they thought of this time. Only downside of this is that there are a few scenes, which actually look censored, you'll snap out of the movie and you get conscious of the camera. There is a scene which is quite long where Brad Pitt 'takes care' of a zombie, but it's kind of like softcore porn where the camera man is bit too careful for the camera not to 'below the waste' so to say. It's a bit obvious, which is not good, even tho idea and intention is good.Anyway, I really enjoyed it, it's very well made in general.",8,2,3,28 August 2014
Ted," Not for everyone really
","I don't usually make wrong judgements when deciding what to watch, thus I don't often stop watching a movie in the middle. This on the otherhand was not what I expected. With a score and reviews so good, I expected a decent comedy, but I stopped quite quickly - and that is really really rare.Smoking pot, drinking, junk food, anal jokes, bullying, fart jokes. It was cliché after cliché after cliché until I just decided to watch something else. It's amazing what cheap crap people consider a good comedy these days.I wouldn't be so baffled if this was about a younger generation, but Wahlberg is older than me and from the 80s intro I'm guessing his character should be around my age in this movie.",5,0,0,12 February 2014
Knives Out," Ok entertainment, but expected better
","I'm a fan of 'whodunnit' genre, really like to work my brain and Clue in all it's craziness is one of my all time favorites. Not to say I don't like the more serious ones, I loved Gosford Park, Name of the Rose etc. This seemed like a great movie to see.Starts out pretty good, fast paced and quirky, the cast is great, but for me the movie fell apart as soon as they showed the murder/death/suicide. It was quite early to the movie and you know at that point that this can't be the whole truth, even tho you've just seen exactly how it happened. After that it's just guessing what lead to it or how they cover up for it.There are tons of clues on the way, a few of them very obvious ones and you kind of know quite early on who actually is to blame, you just aren't sure why. And it's a bit problematic for a whodunnit as the rest of the cast don't really seem very probable murderer. There is basically just one very unlikable character (ok, maybe two, but the other is too small part to be the murderer).But even tho the clues are quite obvious, the path to conclusion is everything but. It was somewhat interesting to watch everything unfold, but a certain key character had such a small part (Fran) that guessing everything seems like a very difficult task.What comes to acting and direction I think most did ok, but what started out as fast paced quirky show, went somewhat flat in the middle. Pace slowed down, Daniel Craig in my opinion delivered quite stale performance after starting out being more interesting. Direction wasn't quirky enough to be a proper comedy after all, only delivering a few good laughs. Most of the time the movie was just a crime drama.Could've used some trimming at over two hours long, I did feel drowsy halfway.Then the political part. Unnecessary in my opinion in a movie like this.I do like the fact that 'good guys win and bad guys loose'. It was a good movie anyway, but not really a masterpiece.",7,4,8,6 December 2019
Yes Man," Recklessness equals happiness?
","As a mind numbing comedy this is fairly enjoyable. Jim Carrey is a bit too old already for the role, but he is funny, can't deny that. Deschanel is always Deschanel, which is good.In the past years I've learnt that Americans are probably not that happy with their lives. Most comedies that are aimed to be spirit raising feel-good movies end up promoting some sort of recklessness, risk taking and general individualism. This movie is a prime example. Since when did risking life equal good living?This theme has raised it's head a lot in the recent years, but do these movies really help anyone in the long run? They're like a pain killer, you feel good for a moment, but they don't dig any deeper and really cure the cause. Good as it is, but not really my cup of tea.",3,0,1,12 August 2010
Bird Box," Entertaining and tense, but quite meaningless
","There have been a lot of this kind of apocalyptic road movies. World seems to be coming to an end with weird events and at some point they embark on a journey to get to a safe shangri-la kind of place. Usually a child is involved. Recent Cargo comes easily in mind as similar. From older movies The Road and Happening are also quite similar.I watch a lot of horror and sci-fi so Netflix recommended this to me immediately and I also went for it almost immediately. I have to say I did enjoy it, but in the end it doesn't mean it's a masterpiece of a movie.The story is interesting and also scary at times, but in the end there are really no answers to anything. Nothing is revealed about why the 'happening' happened nor what it really was. This goes pretty much for Sandra Bullocks character too. She's very distant and negative for the whole movie and atleast I didn't figure out why. Maybe I dosed off at some significant scene, but to me she was mostly just annoying. It seemed she never even wanted a child, but why. How did that guy she met at the house eventually tolerate such character for years. She didn't even name the kids. There was this scene between Malkovich and Bullock where she stated her dad was similar 'asshole' as Malkovich's character, but if they based Bullocks character on that only, it seems a bit far fetched. Her sister was totally different after all.Despite Bullocks character being annoying, the acting in general was pretty good. As were rest of the production values.So all in all it kept me interested, but don't expect a huge payoff in the end.",6,0,4,16 January 2019
The Village," Work of an artist
","To me, three movies from Shyamalan stand above others. The Sixth Sense was scary, Signs was extremely entertaining and finally The Village is a work of audiovisual art and emotion. Rest of Shyamalans movies didn't have as much impact on me, altho I may need to return to Unbreakable one day.There are summer movies, winter movies, and of course spring and autumn movies. The Village is a definite autumn movie, like Hitchcocks The Trouble With Harry. The color scheme is amazing, all the tones of yellow from cold bleak woods to warm light of the candles. Everything accented with dark shadows and occasional reds. This is one of the most beautiful movies to ever hit the screens.The soundtrack is also amazing with the violin played by Hilary Hahn. The sounds are a perfect companion to the cold late autumn visuals. The 'Those we don't speak of' scene may just be one of the greatest moments on film. The combination of sound and visuals is breathtaking.The story has been bashed many times. In a movie with such powerful artistic touch, I don't see the plot that important, but I also don't see many faults there. There are a few scenes, which may seem a bit 'fantasylike' and one unnecessary explanation, but despite these, it's a very clever and well thought of story. Shyamalan must have exercised his brain really hard to make the story work, and in my mind he succeeded very well.Even tho there is a twist in the end, the movie is not completely dependent on it, unless you yourself put all emphasis on it. If you do, you may feel a bit let down, because it's not 100 % in your face revelation. If you only expect the movie to drop you off your chair in the end, you will miss a lot, as this is a movie of emotion and subtle nuances.It would be fun to see this movie again, without ever seeing it before and never having heard anything about it. Now I feel the first time I saw it was ruined a bit by all the negative hype. As it is, I find myself returning to this movie at least once a year, even if I know the story already.",10,2,3,18 October 2010
21," Smart subject, dumb movie
","Kevin Spacey, IMDb average score of 6,8 and a subject involving smarter-than-usual people doing some gambling mathematics sounds like a good movie. And was I fooled.The story starts out fairly nice, Massachusetts and the university locations are nice to look at and the basic setup of using your special brain skills to make you rich is intriguing.Only, little by little I noticed that all the interesting stuff is left to the minimum. Secret signs, the actual card counting and mathematics, fooling the cameras, face recognition. There was so much to play with, but the movie was basically all about loosing yourself to money and hi-life. Your regular 'too much, too fast' story we get to read about up and coming film stars and musicians alike.To me this just doesn't quite match up. At times it was like watching Britney Spears with an IQ of 160. Still, somehow, the story managed to be very predictable until maybe the very end.I think the biggest let down here was, that I was actually looking forward to a smart movie that provokes some brain activity, but it was a simple popcorn movie afterall.",3,0,0,2 November 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," An American comedy
","Being a huge fan of the comedies from 80's I can't help but compare the current gang of Apatow, Phillips, Rogen, Ferrell, Reilly, Black etc to Reitman, Ramis, Landis, Murray, Chase, Candy, Aykroyd, Belushi, Martin etc. Funny enough, always appearing Harold Ramis seems to be the only connection between these two generations. I didn't know this was an Apatow production before the end credits hit the screen and I have to say I'm quite happy I didn't, because I could now see it without much prejudice, as I haven't really connected with any of the Apatow-era/gang comedies. I did find it somewhat funny. I also found it very American, very formulaic and very this millennium. Everything that the mainstream comedies from recent years are.The movie made me laugh mostly just because of the explicity of the jokes. Yes, it was funny when a mans private parts appeared on screen (should I put a spoiler tag?), but only because it's a major Hollywood production, not done this explicitly before? And you can easily see it's there 'just because'. Nor can I remember when they so openly and straight forwardly praised dope, even tho it's done in almost every comedy that is produced lately. These two always re-appearing and boundary stretching subjects are what I can't connect to, and at times it seems this is what the movies are all about.Being a European I don't find nude men funny, per se. Being kind of traditional, I don't find drugs very funny either. Then there's John C. Reilly - who I actually find an enjoyable actor, is doing the lead and trying to run a comedy. He just hasn't got the comedic charisma of Ferrell, Black or let's say Murray or Chase. He's sort of the Dan Aykroyd of the first decade, a good actor, but more of a wing man rather than a leading man.I was left with mixed emotions. The movie made me laugh quite a few times and it did have fairly good production values, but when the running joke is your path from mild drugs to stronger drugs, I can't say I liked it, even if it made me laugh.",4,4,7,18 January 2010
It Follows," A modern retro horror movie hits the spot
","In short, I loved it! I'm a bit of a horror movie fan, but most of all a movie fan. Even a geek. This movie is good on many levels.There's a quick introduction, which leaves quite a few things to be answered. Once you figure out what's going on, it's quite mind tingling. The plot does fall a bit out of pace here and there, but it keeps interesting all the way to the credits. At modest 90 minutes, it's actually quite a slow movie, but that's a good thing here. Gives you time to think, without getting boring. Many times I was just looking at the casts small expressions, looks and loving the fact that the movie doesn't spoon feed everything. There are a few scenes with a bit more action and jumpy scares, which in my opinion don't all work as well as the more slow sections. At one point 'It' kind of gets out of character in my opinion, just for the sake of 'being scary'.As a horror movie it's quite effective. There's not much gore (goriest images are in the beginning) and relatively few jump scares. But the tone of the movie is grim. No jokes, nothing is funny. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and builds a great atmosphere. The same can be said for the most part about the soundtrack too, which is quite 80s inspired synth driven - almost chillwave (without over compressed beats). There is one theme in the soundtrack tho that sticked out as almost like a parody. It's a bit too over the top and would better suit a Scary Movie kind of spoof. Otherwise it's perfect.The acting is great. The cast was all unknown to me, but did very well. One nice touch is the timelessness of the movie. There is modern technology used, but for the most part it's quite timeless without being overly retro either (except maybe for the soundtrack). And the ending, I kept thinking how will they end this without it ruining the movie - and they didn't! It's as good as it can be.A very pleasant surprise, but now that I read about this it has gathered good reviews and I don't wonder why. Recommended!",9,1,5,16 December 2015
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Interesting concept, but fails on most parts
","I was somewhat intrigued to see this, as I really enjoyed Little Voice - the only other movie I've seen from the director. I was also interested in the different view of a very well covered subject and I'm yet to see a bad performance by David Thewlis.Quite quickly I noticed it's not going to be as sincere as I figured it would. You can easily spot so many underlinings that I knew it's not gonna be too subtle. Kids playing war, bleak new house, rain when appropriate (you even see the sun is actually shining) .. the list goes on.Some have praised the child actors, but I wasn't convinced. I can't quite pinpoint what it was, but I didn't find them very believable. I'm quite sure the script played it's part here.David Thewlis makes an OK performance with what is given to him, but watching (the now very popular) Vera Farmiga as his wife is a painful experience. Her performance was way over the top at most times.This movie felt like it was just going for the Oscar's by being politically correct in every sense, but there is nothing that would really grab and twist your mind to think of the holocaust any differently than we are used to. Maybe we are not supposed to either, but I just felt the movie didn't serve much purpose, other than dig for a cheapish emotional response from the viewer. It's emotional, just for the sake of being emotional.. blah.",5,6,12,8 February 2010
Jurassic World," Solid popcorn movie, altho way too violent
","I was a feeling a bit old watching this movie, which isn't very common at all. The movie does a good job tho in bringing the franchise to next generation. The transition and references work quite well. I was pleased how solid and well directed the movie in whole was. In the very beginning it felt as if it might be awkward, but once it started, it worked quite well.Acting was pretty good. I don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore, so wasn't familiar with Chris Pratt, but he makes a good Indiana Jones style lead. Bryce Dallas Howard is a bit over the top at times, but her character works in a blockbustery clichéd way. The kids were OK, altho a bit underdeveloped.What I didn't like was the violence. In my opinion the movie is way too bloody and violent, even warlike. It's been a while since I last saw the original, but I kind of remember it being more on the scary side than action violence. I personally prefer a few tense scary scenes to full throttle violence. This movie does not have the same suspense factor - in my opinion - as the original with raptors. Then there is one quite prolonged death scene, which isn't too graphic, but you have time to feel the despair.I also felt that there were a bit too many different themes thrown in. There's a very under developed divorce theme, the military theme, the profit theme, the marketing theme, love story theme etc..Seeing this movie made me both slightly worried and also intrigued of how Trevorrow will direct his Star Wars IX. He seems like a capable director, able to handle a lot of stuff including surprisingly working jokes amidst action, but also seems to create a tad violent stuff.Not showing this to my kids yet, but pretty good movie otherwise.",7,3,6,16 May 2016
Paranormal Activity," I was left disappointed, very clichéd
","I was under the impression this was a good and somewhat well received movie when I caught this on TV. I'm a fan of supernatural and paranormal movies which do not rely on cheap scares or blood and gore, so I was actually looking forward to this.Well, good things first. There was very little blood and not really gore at all, thumbs up for this, there's never too many horror movies of this kind. The story was somewhat interesting, I like stories that don't go full throttle all the time or are too traditionally structured. There's a genuine feel of not knowing what will happen next when watching this. You really keep an eye on the screen, because you want to see if something happens. If there is a small freaky clue or anything really. I was pretty hooked.What was wrong with it then? I didn't find the movie very believable nor the characters very genuine or likable. The guy continuously does what the girl doesn't want him to do and it gets kind of annoying. She's telling him to turn of the camera all the time, so you are also aware of the camera all the time and while this may be unavoidable in a movie like this, I still felt it distracting.The movie is very clichéd and most of the stuff doesn't make much sense. A lot of stuff happened just because they are commonly felt as freaky, ie. the attic, lights turning on and off, everything happening during the night. What if the couple were working on a night shift, would the entity then have done the actions daytime? The ouija board scene was especially cheesy.The biggest let down was the ending, while it was partly freaky, the very very ending ruined it. You'll know when you see it, completely unnecessary choice to make the camera (and audience) so obvious again.I'm surprising myself saying this, but this movie was actually a bit boring. I'm OK with slow paced movies, but you need some food for brain to make it interesting even if it's slow.It's all done better before (Poltergeist, Entity). Even the more recent movie The Fourth Kind which utilizes somewhat similar idea is so much better and more engaging, only it's about aliens rather than geists. There's also a movie called The Collingswood Story (2002) which I also think was a lot better than this.",5,0,0,30 January 2012
Friends with Benefits," Not a bad 'remake' of When Harry Met Sally
","Well, it's obviously not a remake of When Harry Met Sally, but it's impossible not to make the comparison. There was even a straight homage/reference to Nora Ephron in one scene.I haven't liked many new movies coming out of Hollywood in this millennium and have therefore not watched many lately, I'd rather been catching up on the classics I haven't seen. I watched this one without any expectations and it caught me by surprise, it had a heart which very few new movies have. The two characters were actually pretty likable and that's a key factor to this kind of movie. There's no point watching this kind of movie if you don't like the characters.I read a few reviews stating Kunis and Timberlake didn't have chemistry, but I strongly disagree. I think this couple here is a real pleasure to watch. I've previously seen Timberlake only in The Open Road - one of the only movies I have actually stopped watching in the middle - the acting was just horrible. Here the story is totally different, Timberlake makes a great performance. Kunis has made a great career, something one might not have expected after the 70s Show.The writing is nice for the most part, the dialog works. What I had a small problem with were a few dialogs that went 'under the belt' so to say. It's a pity, since this is somewhat classy movie, even the sex scenes were done in a kind of tasty fashion. We don't need to know where someone's finger went or why it's difficult to pee at a certain occasion.The dialog and pace is at times a tad too fast, resulting in bad editing. In a few occasions there is a clear jump cut, where a characters position changes noticeably between two consecutive images.In any case, this was a bit of comeback for Hollywood in my eyes. It seems they can still create likable characters after all. Being the age where I remember When Harry Met Sally as a new movie, it's a great achievement that I could actually enjoy the 'same movie' made for a new generation.",8,0,3,4 November 2012
Sinister," Great horror, really liked it
","This is old school gore-free horror, just the way I like it. It's got great story, great acting, great style in direction. So many horror movies these days are a let down, but this one delivered big time.Story is not the most original. It's got elements from a lot of other horror movies, some pretty bad ones, so I was a bit skeptic on how the story would evolve. But it does hold together and actually delivers by the end quite well. I never felt being betrayed by cheap red herrings, it just worked.Acting is great. It's Ethan Hawke most of the time and I really think he makes a lot of this movie. He's both likable and quite believable. His character is quite humane in all it's fragility. The scene in which he has fallen asleep watching an old interview of his and his wife finds him is actually quite heartfelt. There's only one scene - pretty important one - which I think Hawke slightly overplays, but otherwise everything is spot on.Scares are delivered quite sparingly, but they're effective. I watched this in the middle of the night and I did jump a few times. Some of the 8mm films are quite disturbing to watch, even tho there is no actual graphic gore involved. I really liked the fact that they spared the graphic images and went for psychological terror instead.The direction is solid. It's stylish. Music and soundtrack choices were quiet interesting here and there. Makes me feel like I want to watch this again just to concentrate on the soundtrack once more. They even have a Boards of Canada tune playing over a scene - what's not to like?Great movie, really really good. Old school horror ftw!",8,7,8,14 September 2013
The Secret Life of Pets," Horrible stuff for kids
","Started watching this with my kids based on trailer. I actually very rarely do this, but research the movie well before pressing play. Based on trailer I figured this is a harmless cute pet movie. It isn't. I don't know what sick twisted mind thinks this is good family entertainment. Starts off amusing, nice animation, cute characters, it's basically what the trailer showed us. I started grinning already when the two main characters didn't get along, but when they get out of the house, the things get really twisted. They loose their id tags and run into dogcatcher and a 'lost pets gang' and go down to sewers.There's a lot of detailed talk about pets killing their human owners, with a blender, the discussion comes up twice and is really long. The lead characters are made to act 'tough' and they make up horrible stories the 'gang leader' disturbingly enjoys. Then there is a scene where a pet literally beats out answers from another. A lot of scary action, cute bunny turning scary hostile etc etc.I don't know who this film is for really. Kids don't need to see and think of this stuff as entertainment. Kids don't need to think about murders. They don't and I'm pretty sure the whole idea went over their head, because it's not how kids think - thank god. But why feed them this hostile crap?What eventually made us stop watching was the snake in the sewers. My 7 yo said he doesn't want to watch anymore and I agreed.I'm sure the ending is all nice and friendly (atleast I hope so), but I really really despise the idea that you can do what ever to create dramatic structure in the movie, just to sort of make up for it in the end with a 'good message' (I don't know if there is one tho). At that point the film makers have already served the ideas to kids so you can't take them away anymore.You can do a proper - dramatic, even scary - kids movie without the themes served in this movie. Look at Totoro and other Ghibli movies. You don't need baddies, violence and murder.Come on film makers, you can do better.",1,1,2,5 June 2017
Arrival," Not quite the masterpiece I expected
","I'm all for 'thinking mans sci-fi', it's actually probably one of my favorite genres. I love Cube, Moon, 2001, Gattaca, Children of Men, Contact, Ex Machina was absolutely wonderful. There are many fine 'real' scifi movies, but Arrival just didn't hit home for me.Looks great, acting is pretty good, soundtrack OK. The idea is kind of OK in general, but the first real problem for me was that I kept thinking (no pun intended) that why would the aliens have spoken and written language to begin with. Why assume aliens would have that much in common with us. Like they used to paint actors green to distinguish them from humans and make them alien. I kind of needed more than decoding different style of writing.Acting like said is pretty good, but like has been said in other reviews, everyone except for Amy Adams' are very thin characters. Renner shows promise, but it's a shame his character is so under developed, especially due to the ending 'twist' of the movie. There's no revelation there, just a somewhat predictable twist, but with more in the script for Renner, it might've been better.I have to admit even I felt this movie was a bit boring at times. I kept looking at the watch and thinking now would be a good time to thrust the script, and often it did find a new twist to it, but it never really gets very interesting.I don't know, it didn't work for me at least in the first viewing. The part with social chaos, soldiers vs personal growth, how we perceive time etc didn't feel at balance. I may need to watch it again to see what the fuzz is about. I actually liked Enemy (2013) a lot more by Villeneuve, haven't seen anything else by him. Looking forward to new Bladerunner tho.",7,1,3,2 October 2017
Prometheus," Sadly not what I hoped for
","This is one of those movies that confirms that you should never really look forward to any movie. Call me pessimist, but it's very very rare that a movie you really wait forward seeing actually delivers. I love Ridley Scott's movies from past decades, Alien, Bladerunner, Legend. They're great movies, but I can't say I liked any of his movies as much after Black Rain.The good things. Well, it looks pretty good and the general plot is thought-provoking. Noomi Rapace. I wasn't really sure about her being the leading lady here (after seeing her in the original Millennium trilogy), but she really makes this movie, she outshines everyone with Michael Fassbender, who also does a great role.The not-so-good and bad things. Everything else, starting from the script. It's pretty interesting in the beginning, but a lot of stuff goes unexplained or are left as a mystery. I'm OK with movies that leave space for thought, but I feel they left too many things open here (like 'Lost' btw..). You can have a mystery and an explanation in the end. I always loved the way the original Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) was written. It had a wonderful plot and the way things unraveled in the end, it was great. I guess those days are gone. In the end of this movie you'll just be scratching your head.Having said that, this may be a case of heavy editing. There must have been an explanation or justification to every single scene in this movie, I'm sure the writers are not dumb. There are so many elements which kind of fit in the story, but are very loose and/or left as a mystery. For example the scene which reveals that Vickers (Theron) is Weylands (Pearce) daughter and showing their troubled relationship. This fits perfectly in a story about creators and creations, but it's completely irrelevant to the movie as it is now. As does the part where Shaw (Rapace) is impregnated. Did David plan it, what was the purpose? It's a pretty huge thing to carry an unknown lifeform, isn't it? But didn't seem that important to writers. There are lot of these things that would kind of fit the story, but are not really explained enough to fit the whole. Who should one blame, the writer, editor, producer, director? I don't know.Then there's the cast, which is relatively big. I felt there were too many characters and I understand that in movies like Alien and Aliens, where they are on a routine mission or assignment, you have sort of 'misfits' in the crew, but this was a billion dollar expedition to make first contact. Not buying it, sorry. The crew was full of morons. A tip to movie makers. You don't need to add 'regular' people for movie-goers to relate to. In this movie they are totally out of place, unlike Aliens, which was handled with perfect tone by Mr. Cameron.Then they had this side story of believing in god. Way too much going on.While the soundtrack in general was OK, I didn't like the main theme (track 'Life' in the OST). It had a 'something wonderful' celestial vibe to it and was very out of place, I really disliked it in this movie. The movie was about mostly hostile beings and it wasn't friendly at all. Maybe would've fit in an early Star Trek movie or so, but not this. Horrible contrast, horrible.I only hope there would be a (super)extended directors cut and maybe a sequel to explain things, otherwise this is just a torso of a movie. Shame on you all for producing this.",5,2,3,7 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Loved it
","Being born in the 70's I'm part of the generation that grew up with the original trilogy. It was basically my childhood, the movies, action figures, magazines. I know the original trilogy inside out. I still watch the originals every two years or so, they still work for me, haven't lost any of their charm. I was almost 30 years old when the second coming was, and while I did see them at the movies once, I never really returned to those movies. I tried to watch them before Force Awakens, but didn't get past The Phantom Menace. I remember the two following movies were better, but still never got around watching them again.I was waiting forward to seeing The Force Awakens like any other Star Wars fan. I'm not a huge fan of JJ Abrams and have been disappointed by quite a few reboots, prequels or late sequels like Indy 4, Star Trek and Prometheus, so I went to the theatre open minded. I was eager to see it, but I wasn't thinking if it would be good or bad, tried to stay neutral and thought that I don't HAVE TO like it at this age anymore.But I loved it, totally loved it. It was quite close to being perfect in my opinion. Sure the story is a bit recycled, things happen quite conveniently and sometimes rushed, but the movie feels Star Wars. It feels very familiar without being tacky. It's just what Star Wars franchise needed in my opinion. It's difficult to know how new generations feel, but for those of us who lived the original trilogy, this was like coming home. Meeting old friends and immediately getting on like back in the days.I had three major concerns before seeing this, even tho I tried to stay neutral. First being that it would be overly complicated, clever and tricky like I feel Abrams likes to do his TV and movies. Instead we got quite a straight-forward story without any unnecessary complexities or trying to be overly creative. Star Wars doesn't need a mind-boggling plot that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. The other concern was that it would be made too violent and realistically grim. This is what has happened a lot of times with reboots and since movies and TV are completely different today in terms of violence than they were back in the day, I was fearing the worst. The first 10 minutes made me feel even more concerned as they may be quite intense (for the younger audience), but luckily the rest of the movie is quite tame. I have a son who is still a bit too young to see this, but who really waits forward to seeing it and this is the main reason I was a bit worried about how harsh they had made it. I'm happy they kept it the way it is.The last concern was that it would feel forced, unnatural and cringe-worthy in terms of the acting and the old crew getting together. I was quite sure Harrison Ford could pull off his role as Han Solo, but Carrie Fisher as Leia and Mark Hamill as Luke were and are somewhat wildcards. We had no idea how they would do. Stop reading here if you don't want to read spoilers. Harrison Ford really IS Han Solo, he did absolutely perfect job. Carrie Fisher was still surprisingly Leia, I was a bit worried having watched a few of her interviews on youtube and not really seeing her act since The 'Burbs (1989). The scenes with her and Harrison are slightly on the stiff side, but they work OK, given they're characters past. Mark Hamill on the other hand. Well, we still have to wait and see.The new cast is good. I especially enjoyed Adam Driver acting as Kylo Ren. Daisy Ridley is good too. Oscar Isaac is a capable actor as seen before, his scenes are quite brief here, but I'm sure there's a lot more to come. John Boyega was OK, but for some reason his character is not quite as interesting as the others. Domhnall Gleeson makes a great bad guy. Interesting to see if Max Von Sydow will be featured more in the next two episodes. It's amazing how long his career is as I just watched him on an Ingmar Bergman movie from the 50s!Visually the movie is amazing. It works great, the places feel real. There are a few surprisingly CGI looking characters. Even one quite major character. Not saying they don't look good, but they look as if they are CGI, which is rarely a good thing. Lot's and lot's of references to old trilogy. Never out of place tho. I'm going to see this again in the movies, and that's the first time watching the same movie twice in a theatre since the Return of the Jedi. One great thing about this new Star Wars episode is that it made me want to watch the original trilogy again, even tho I've just watched it last summer.",9,5,36,10 January 2016
Godzilla," Slightly disappointed, after directors previous movie
","I didn't watch this as a godzilla movie, but rather the new movie from the director of Monsters. Monsters was one of the best movies to come out in a long time for me. Perfect mixture of drama, visuals, sci-fi and great soundtrack.Godzilla started well, interesting plot, good visuals, intriguing. The atmosphere was great. Only it kind of lost the charm half way through. I can see what the director was going for, but the problem is that the drama and human factor fell flat. Yes, sounds quite weird for a monster movie, but big part of the directors Monsters charm was the chemistry between the leads and the fact that there wasn't that much of the monsters, but rather it was about the characters and their story.It's quite fair to say that the turning point is when the dad dies. The plot was interesting up until that point, but after that nothing interesting really happens plot wise. It goes into action genre, although it's kind of slowish action.Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't very interesting as the lead and clearly did not have that much to build on either. You might say he doesn't even have that much of a purpose in the whole movie, even the scientists - who also were seriously under- developed - were more interesting. Elizabeth Olsen is a good actress, but she also had quite little to work on. The director went for a low key action drama, which works up to a point, but the script is a bit weak towards the end.Atmosphere and style very good, drama and human factor not too good.Still looking forward to seeing Gareth Edwards' Star Wars entry Rogue One.",6,0,2,28 April 2016
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Mixed bag, great sets and atmosphere
","I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. I had recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. I liked The Crying Game in particular and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all either. So I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.)On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful.One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.",8,0,1,21 January 2013
Alien: Covenant," Liked this much more than Prometheus
","I'm a huge fan of the old Alien movies pt 1-3 especially, even 4. Where as I could say that I as much as hated Prometheus, I actually liked this latest Alien movie. I wasn't sure what to expect anymore, but I was positively surprised.Prometheus was a mess. It had too many themes added into a single movie (might've worked better as a tv series). It had too many and too dumb characters and none of them was very likable. A lot of things happened way too conveniently. The soundtrack was totally inappropriate, it belonged to a whole different movie. There was no suspense at all, everything was rushed.Covenant surprisingly gets pretty much all of these things right, or atleast does a lot better. The cast is small enough to be manageable with the time given and they are much more likeable this time around. The soundtrack is more fitting and suspenseful (similar to the original Alien, altho it does feature the horrible Prometheus theme). Locations are nicer to look at and really awe-inspiring. The story doesn't try to cover quite as much this time, but continues the creator theme. My only gripe is probably that some things don't seem to get proper attention (if you consider what the crew actually finds), but this was a problem with Prometheus also.I had to force myself to re-watch Prometheus for the second time before watching Covenant. I had to make sure I didn't miss anything crucial first time around or that I just didn't watch it on a bad day. Well, I didn't, I think I liked it even less the second time around. But I'm seriously considering watching Alien: Covenant second time within the 48 hrs the rental is watchable.Alien: Covenant isn't a perfect movie, but it is highly enjoyable, moody sci-fi horror.",Null,0,0,22 January 2018
Up in the Air," Portrayal of current American culture?
","It was good until the wedding part. Before this I wasn't really thinking about the movie, because til that point it was straightforward entertainment, a comedy with maybe a slight romantic twist and a touch of drama.Then came this fairly drastic change of tone and my mind started wandering. I began to really think about the movie, scenario, characters and the fact that once again comes a highly praised Hollywood movie where I can't seem to connect with anyone.I started wondering if the movie itself turned sour, or is it just me who doesn't understand what's going on. Then I had a piffany with Clooney when he was giving his pep talk to a guy having doubts about his future as a married man. It struck me that the movie seems to take for granted that you are not happy with your life and that most people are craving for something that they don't have. It assumes that you need to have some kind of an adventure or danger all the time to feel alive. If you are happy or content with your life, you are probably a cheater or otherwise senseless. To me it's pretty depressing.But.. there would be nothing wrong if the movie actually made a point about any of these things. We have movies like American Beauty which really are social commentary, while on the other hand we have movies like this which are disguised as feel good entertainment. You cannot be 100 % sure if it's a big commercial for, well, a couple of hotels, airlines and car rentals, but also the American way of life.Actually this whole movie and it's success (best movie of the year nomination, really?) got me really confused. I've felt the same with a lot of Hollywood movies lately. Most of the characters actions and thoughts were well beyond me. Were they meant to be jokes, social criticism or thoughts that people can connect with, I truly don't know.The movie is not all bad, it's well made (altho some characters seem to come and go pretty arbitrarily), well performed, funny and hits a few thoughts here and there. It's propably the context as a whole that I have difficulties swallowing.",4,1,1,2 August 2010
