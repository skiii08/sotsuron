Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not What I Wanted, But I Received Better
","The thing about these 'Pirates' movies is that somehow they are historically related to classic tales, in this case, it was to the famous Blackbeard. I think that he was the best choice as a historical figure. Blackbeard is very known and already sense the evil in him by hearing his name. Another thing that is related to the other movies is that there are the bits of humour throughout the entire thing. Some of the fight scenes were very very similar to the previous ones. This was worth the watch in 3-D. Recently there haven't been many good 3-D movies, but 'On Stranger Tides' was one that really was worth seeing. Johnny Depp yet again played another amazing performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. I hope to see another series being released in the near future.",7,1,2,28 May 2011
Hot Fuzz," Funny, Ridiculous, A Total Blast!
","There was so many positive things about this movie. Like great chase scenes, ridiculous shootouts, and the music that completely fits the scenes. The chase scenes in 'Hot Fuzz' were so good, they became amusing and hilarious at the same time. As funny as this movie was, it was also had it's disturbing scenes along with the serious ones. All the music used was very well placed. The movie was ridiculous at most points, it came to the point of hysterical laughter. 'Hot Fuzz' wasn't stupid funny like most comedies are, it was random and had it's silly moments that you couldn't help but laugh at. There were very minor characters that were important in the bonding between each character. The story worked out quite well throughout, and was funny, disturbing, and entertaining in the end. It was a total blast that is a must see.",9,2,3,28 May 2011
Edward Scissorhands," A Beautiful Work of Art
","This is a spectacular tale of the man who just wanted to be normal. I first saw this recently, but not surprisingly it was a great movie. The story gets summed up pretty quick, gets told through a quick narration.By far this is one of Johnny Depp's best roll. I can't think of anyone else who can play Edward Scissorhands like Johnny Depp did. Almost as if he was made for the roll. The use of make-up and costume design for Edward was amazing, creating the belief that he was actually a created experiment. It proves that Johnny Depp can play almost any roll, but this is the most significant.The way each character changes throughout the course of the film is amazing. Like everyone thinks he's some beast, but inside he's a nice person who just wants to fit in. The character changes swing around a lot, along with their feeling toward each other.One of the great parts about this movie is that it actually made you feel the emotion intended, unlike some other movies where it fails to actually effect your emotions. Edward Scissorhands can make you feel anger, happiness, and sadness towards the same emotions that Edward would go through.I don't think I have ever seen anything accomplish this as good as this movie has.Overall it is a good movie. I would rather like to see more background story to Edward's life than it showed. But other than that it was quite good. If yet you haven't seen it, see it as soon as you can.",8,1,2,8 May 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," One of the Best of 2010
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' was executed from a graphic novel to a film very nicely but didn't make it a better film. The movie was great but from comic to movie really didn't make it any better although it probably wasn't intended to make it better. This film exceeded all of my expectations and actually surprised me that a comic like this type could be made into a movie so nicely done. I immediately picked up the graphic novels and it explained a huge amount of references that never got displayed in this movie. I really really liked Michael Cera's performance in this and he continues to be exceptional. The film's tagline 'An epic of epic epicness' really defines the film for what it is. It was funny, intense, and serious while it has it's own style of a film itself. 'Scott Pilgrim' had it's own type of humour, the intense fight scenes that were really fun to watch and see the creativity of the authors point of view. This is a fun movie and must see.",9,34,68,21 June 2011
The Usual Suspects," Greatest Movie of All Time
","There are so many things about this movie that were just amazing. To start off were the performances. Every actor played their roles amazing and were flawless with their acting (especially Spacey and Del Toro). This could be Kevin Spacey's best performance and very much deserved to win best supporting actor. The ending is possibly one of the most mind blowing, unsuspecting, and by far the greatest thing in all of movies. You get told all the information but then all of a sudden the writers throw a right-hand and knocks you right off track. My jaw dropped and I was speechless after watching this. If there was something that could ever top this movie it deserves to win every award that has ever been made. There was too much that was thrilling, suspenseful and jaw dropping that is worth every minute of your life. Now it's understandable why I could watch this movie 15 times and never get tired of it!",10,1,1,13 June 2011
Resident Evil," Better Than I Thought
","Resident Evil is an action-packed horror fest. Some people love it for it and some hate it. I'm on the 'love-it' side, but there is no in between. You love it or you hate it. Most of the criticism about the RE film is that it doesn't stick true to the games. This is true, but to be honest, it doesn't effect my opinion on the matter. I love it, but a lot of people hate it. This is why I like it.'Resident Evil' never struck me as a video game that could be made into a movie, but it did seem nicely done. Besides the bad acting throughout most of the movie, it was a pretty good movie. There was a lot of repetitive music but it was good because it totally fit the scenario and was pump-up music that was light then progresses to heavier and more intense. It was a bit slow at first but it gradually got faster, eventually I couldn't even notice the time passing by. The creatures were unique. There were interesting zombie-dogs and a massive four-legged creature in which I can't compare with anything running all over the place, it was quite freaky. The zombies were just typical zombies, no different than any other zombie movie you would see. 'Resident Evil' was entertaining and worth the 90 minutes you are spending,",8,1,2,11 June 2011
Insidious," One of the Scariest Movies I Have Ever Seen
","Without a doubt, this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. It isn't a movie that only makes stuff jump at you, 'Insidious' combines sudden creatures jumping out at you with disturbing, creepy figures you can't even bare to look at. I personally can't remember the last horror movie that actually mad me scared, but this I will say is the first to succeed. Plot is very good, when a kid goes into a coma and his soul gets trapped in another world where demons roam, and attempt to possess his body in order to escape to the real world to live again. It may not seem scary, but trust me, it was really, really horrifying. The way they looked, with their weird smiles and close up images of them make you jump and scream.It was clear that 70's and 80's horror films inspired this movie. With high pitched violins to build up the scene where something really creepy happens. Some scenes were so scary I had to cover an eye. It was the way the creatures looked that did most of the scares. Some of the predictable scenes scared you because you knew something was going to happen, but didn't know what it was. A movie with high pitched violins, really loud noises, and lots of screams is a descent way to define it. The movie starts off kind of slow, but progressively gets better and better as it goes on. There are a few shaky camera angles and some dark shots that tried to make it feel scary, but you can't seen anything. In the shots like this, they only last for a few seconds before changing to give you a better view of the scene.Yeah it gets kind of stupid near the end and Darth Maul was in it (why, again?), but it was rather enjoyable. However, there isn't much to go back to and I don't have any desire to see it again. But for a single viewing, Insidious was well worth the watch.Insidious gets a 7/10.",7,6,11,13 April 2011
Rio," Great Film
","There were so many things about this movie that were great. The colours, the music, the characters. There was so much it is hard to explain all of it. Usually music in movies doesn't appeal to me, but this was the opposite. The soundtrack was spectacular, it had some catchy tunes, and some songs to set the mood for the moment. The colourful nature of Rio was great, bright tropical colours that you would actually see in the jungles. 'Rio' had good characters and good decisions who to choose for the cast. The way they change was fairly well done. It also made you feel the proper emotion towards the characters, like anger or happiness. There was no scenes that weren't needed in the movie, they all seemed to be in the right spot. A short as the movie was, it still never felt as long as it was. 'Rio' was enjoyable enough that I wished it could never end. In all it was a great movie, one that you can watch over and over and not get sick of it.My rating 8/10",7,1,1,16 May 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Return of the King Review: Extended Cut
","For the first time since its theater release I have just finished 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy. Which is by far the greatest trilogy ever made. There were too many spectacular traits of this film that it was almost impossible to remember all of them. There was a terrific musical score, epic battle scenes that last for about a 1 hour span time, great characters and greatly succeeded on making you feel the worst of everything then comes back around for all hope to be regained. This is basically speaking upon the entire trilogy since it is pretty much one big film.It is completely understandable why this film won every single Oscar for which it was nominated in, but one thing that was wrong was that it wasn't nominated for enough things. This film should have been nominated and won all categories that it would be qualified for.There were amazing visual effects and spectacular set design. I was blown away by the fact that I thought such effects and designs could ever be achieved by anyone. There were no flaws in any part of the film, no revealing mistakes and it was absolutely flawless.The characters in 'The Return of the King' were the same as always, marvelous. There was a spectacular build up to feeling the proper emotions in which were meant to be shown and perfectly developed them in every way possible. There was hatred, feelings, and emotions attached to each character to feel everything that was meant to be felt. Each actor was phenomenal in every aspect and seemed to be a perfect fit for everything.The greatest thing above all though was the epic tale. There were subplots that made the movie much more epic and entertaining than anything I have ever seen before. There were suspenseful moments with a giant tarantula attacking the characters, battle scenes that last for a seemingly eternity and made you feel the very worst of everything that could happen.This truly is a masterpiece that can be seen over and over again but will keep you right where you sit and you will not leave your seat until the very end. Despite its length, it is still %100 worth the watch, even the 4 1/2 hours extended cut needs to be seen.",10,1,2,4 July 2011
Princess Mononoke," Visually Stunning
","Hayao Miyazaki is clearly one of the best directors to this day. His best movie is, in my opinion, definitely Princess Mononoke. Being a fan of Miyazaki's work like Spirited Away, The Secret World of Arietty (which he only wrote), Castle in the Sky, and Porco Rosso (I could name more but back to the review) I had no little expectations for such an amazing film, boy was I wrong. My expectations were greatly surpassed and what we receive is one of the most visually stunning films of all time.The story is about a young warrior who has a curse put upon him by a raging boar demon-god. He sets out on a journey to the western forests where he hopes to find a cure that would lift the curse from him. It's definitely like Hayao Miyazaki's style.The characters are also pretty awesome. The film's main antagonist, Lady Eboshi, develops so nicely you have this real sort of hatred towards her, one that should be present in every film. She has a reason for it though, she wants success and wants the ability to survive. The protagonist, Ashitaka, is a cool character. He sees peace on both sides between the forest gods who want the humans dead, and the humans who want the gods dead. He can't find an ally on either side directly and he constantly is in a struggle for survival. There's a good romance story between San (the human who believes she is a wolf-god) and Ashitaka and over the course of the movie their relationship develops a ton. You actually get an emotional attachment to the characters, something that's very rare. While they aren't directly involved with one-another, you can see the love between them. It's rather heart-warming considering it's a film about death and stuff.The voice acting is great, as expected. With an all-star cast that include Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, John Di Maggio, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Gillian Anderson, it's hard to believe that the voice acting wouldn't be good. It has a very good musical score that contains intense and emotional factors, never leaving the action bland or boring by complete silence.There's much to enjoy about Princess Mononoke. It's just a film in general that's great to watch. Lots of colours are featured and leaves a stunning visual impact that really catches the eye. The animators all deserve recognition, as the animation blends in with the colours and nothing is absent. It gives the film industry a perfect reason why hand-drawn films are nearly always better than computer animation.In all, Princess Mononoke is one amazing film. Definitely one of the all time best and it leaves nothing out. There were intense sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat while keeping the main attraction to the visual scenery. Everything was perfect and it's difficult to find any errors with such a masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is definitely an overlooked film. It also goes to show that special effects aren't the only thing to make a film look beautiful.",10,0,1,4 July 2012
