The Blair Witch Project," If you enjoyed 'Blair Witch' look away now!
",Blair Witch was awful!  What a waste of money.  I hate scary movies (except 'Scary Movie') but this didn't scare me at all and I am really easy to scare.  I am sure the actors in it are really good actors but it wasn't like what it was supposed to be!  My friends told me not to see it because it was bad but I wanted to see what it was like for myself.  Why o why?!,Null,0,1,17 May 2001
