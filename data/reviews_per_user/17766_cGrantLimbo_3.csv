Kill Bill: Vol. 2," In actuality, less is more
","Having seen part II of Kill Bill on opening night (just like I did with the first back in October), I couldn't help but expect the same amount of bloodshed and action that was so prominent in the first. Underneath it all though, I knew it was time for Tarantino to show us actual characters human sides, or it would just turn out to be two movies of nonstop, illiterate action that would remain derivative and not remain true to himself (Tarantino). The movie started a little slow, and you actually have to listen to the dialogue this time because it's important for things to come. Although, I liked the development and actually had only one eye open waiting in suspense in the opening scene (which is in the same setting as the part I took). I really had a sort of dislike for Tarantino before that I never told anyone, but this film (part I and II as a whole) changed my perspective (although fanboys really annoy me). My biggest surprise was that Daryll Hannah, who has been around forever, is finally showing us that she can act. Having NEVER liked her, I found her introduction in Part I to be stellar and the conclusion of her character Elle Driver even more-satisfying. Out of all of the Brides former cohorts, Elle Driver IMO was the only one that was never friends with her at any given time, as there is a perfect tension between Thurman and Hannah being displayed here. In volume one, Cottonmouth and the Bride finish each other's sentences, and after her demise, you see tears in the corner of the Brides eyes. Before Copperhead dies in the beginning of vol. 1, she asks the Bride if she still likes her coffee a certain way. You could see that at one time these characters actually cared for one another. Budd is questionable, although his feelings of slight disgust for the Bride come more from her earlier affair with Bill, his brother. Point being, Elle Driver was probably always viewed as the blacksheep of the group, with only Bill the Snake Charmer ever giving her a chance. ***SPOILER*******It's funny that the Bride spares her life, one she truly hated, and didn't to those she had once had feelings for in some way or another. Maybe this was her way of saying 'you deserve something worse than death' and then leaving her with the snake. Driver (California Mtn. Snake) was indeed specialized in the way of poisening people to end their lives, so the Bride wanted her to feel as much of a slow, painful death as Driver gave to her victims.*******end Spoiler*******. Overall, I have to say I liked this movie better, if not necessarily enjoyed it more. Volume 1 was much more of a 'enjoy it for what it is' type of movie, Volume 2 is an actual Tarantino film.In short:Volume 1: **** Volume 2: ****1/2 both: ****1/2",10,0,1,18 April 2004
Memento," Not that bad, but maybe overrated in some aspects.
","After putting it off for entirely too long, I have finally gotten the chance to see Memento. I must admit I'm not a huge fan of Guy Richie, and well.....after this didn't change my opinion much either. I did 'get it', so that was not a problem, but I believe this will test the patience of many who are not planning to sit down and pay attention (you'll also have to turn up your volume, as many parts of the film are literally quiet, sound quality not very well planned IMO, also Ritchie's character is very monotone). I found it creative with the overlapping back-tracking through time segments,as well as the side story dealing with the 'patient', but I won't get into that so to not spoil anything. What I found this film lacking despite the obvious Ritchie un-bias, is a message in this film...maybe it's a good thing? IMHO I think this film deserves more of a '7' than as high as '8.7'.",Null,1,2,18 September 2003
Mulholland Drive," Lynch at his best.
","I find it quite surprising that an actress can get more attention after first majorly starring in this film (first American film that is, that I know of). It was a very risky job for Naomi Watts to do so, but that deserves some admiration. Most actors and actresses will do a reverse, and star in the roles they really desire after 'making it big'. Oddly enough, Watts character was primarely about this concept, and what drove her over the edge. In my opinion, the people that dislike the film for these reasons: they think the acting is bad, poor dialogue, mediocre cinematography...have truly missed the point. First off, the acting is far from 'bad' b/c the persona of the main characters changes without warning, and before was their 'fake' presence, as to subtly mock Hollywood in it's superficialness. Lynch's main theme in movies is that 'things are not what they seem', as seen in Blue Velvet and this (not to mention countless others). The same can be said for the dialogue, it wasn't bad, it was just written to portray how the characters truly were (and striving for). Now, cinematography...I don't know why, as I simply loved every turn and angle and all the color combinations. The score and the cinematography are half of this film I believe, if Cameron Crow did something similar in Vanilla Sky it would've been taken more seriously, I'm not saying he should've COPIED Lynch but since Vanilla Sky was the closest mainstream version of Mulholland Dr. (despite a very different story), it may have put a spark into the mainstream audience. Although, I like the cult status of MD personally as with other films as IMO they're more treasured.",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
