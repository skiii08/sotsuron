The Blair Witch Project," Unsettling and creepy, without the use of faky special effects...
","I can't believe all the negative comments directed towards this nicely done, offbeat little fright-flick. Today's movie viewers must be getting right spoiled or something. I mean, are they expecting blood and gore to be sprayed right in their faces with a bloody fire hose or something? Come on now, whatever happened to indulging your sense of horror and fright with lots of suspense, creepy atmosphere, weird and unsettling goings on - in other words, just plain using your imagination?Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good blood-and-gore splatter-flick with the best of 'em, but I'm not one of those people who necessarily has to have his horror handed to him on a blood-spattered silver platter. Often times it's more effective to have a spooky story told to you using little more than basic story-telling techniques. And that's what I like about this film, it is virtually devoid of splashy effects - it makes you work for your dinner instead of just handing it to you for free.The one scene where they woke up to find weird rock piles neatly stacked near their tent was truly unsettling, it reminded me of a scene from the TV miniseries 'Rich Man, Poor Man' (1976) where Falconetti broke into Rudy Jordache's house and moved some of his most personal belongings Â– just enough to let him know that, yes, he had been 'visited'.... No great special effects involved, nosiree, but nonetheless very creepy.So, this movie, while maybe not truly a 'horror' movie, is still nevertheless a very unsettling picture, and if you've ever been lost in the woods, or have even the slightest trepidation about wandering too far into the deep woods, especially at night, well, then this picture is for you. Otherwise, stick with Freddy Kruger movies, as this one clearly won't be your cup of tea.",Null,0,1,8 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Barely holds my interest any more...
","I used to love this movie not too many years ago. Now it all seems so cliched and cartoonish and downright boring. What's come over me? How come I can't be like all the other happy happy people who worship this movie without fail, without question, as if this movie is the (ahem..) Holy Grail of all Adventure Movies?It probably has to do with either one of two facts: either, one, I'm just turning into a sour old fart (not entirely unthinkable); or, two, and perhaps more germane, I've simply seen way more compelling and awesome fantasy-adventure-escapist movies in my time that beat the pants off of ROTLA.As much as I know that fact number one may (sadly enough) be the truth, I'll just stick with number two. Let's face it, there are much better action-adventure movies out there. I won't bother posting a list of my favorites. Instead I would actually invite you to think about it, and look for your own favorites. Yes, they ARE out there...Well, so hate me if you must for not jumping on the band wagon and shouting the praises of this movie to the heavens. But I'm just a little sick and tired of all the hoakey Hollywoodized characters, the unbelievably impossible escapes (yeah, that submarine ride that Indy takes is a hoot!), the cliched characters (yeah, Nazis act like Nazis, and Arabs act like Arabs, etc. etc.), the stupid fight scenes, that cringeworthy drinking competition that Marion pulls off in Nepal, and on and on. Booorring!It WAS a good movie for its time though, and I will always have high praise for ROTLA for the way it added some real spice to the genre and helped launch better such movie projects in the years after it was released. But for now, I think it is best to store this relic in a long wooden box in a huge dark warehouse - right next to that box containing the Covenant of the Lost Ark.",Null,1,2,10 March 2002
American Pie," Your basic teen sexploitation flick
","I basically agree with the previous commenter Dave, in that this movie comes across as an obvious teen sexploitation flick. Yes, agreed, it's gross, lame, juvenile, sensationalistic, vulgar, vapid, and... oh, never mind, you get my drift.But I do part company with the previous commenter in one respect, and that is that I don't believe any of this silly mish-mash as being 'true', not for one minute. This movie, to my eye anyway, simply does NOT depict real true-to-life teenagers with their real problems (other than that most relevant one - getting laid before graduation) and real anxieties and insecurities. I thought most of the teens in this film seemed unrealistically sophisticated, and my 'suspension of disbelief' suffered a fatal blow right from the opening. Hey, where were the pimples? (It's also supposed to be set in Michigan, but is obviously filmed in sunny Southern California, thus adding to more of the feeling of fakiness that I got from this movie. Geez, is it really so hard to get a cast and crew up to Michigan these days??).Be that as it may, it is an okay film as a parody of teen life, and even has some poignant moments in it. Just don't take it too seriously, and be prepared to be grossed out more than a few times (and for God's sake don't let your teenage son or daughter see it!!!:)",Null,0,1,11 April 2002
Armageddon," Houston... We have a comedy...
","Giant asteroid is heading for Earth, hell bent on destroying the planet. What??! Better notify NASA. Since I guess maybe Superman, Ahnold, or the Ghostbusters weren't available, NASA has no choice but to call this motley crew of oil drilling experts (headed by Bruce Willis) and enlist them to go on the mother of all space missions: land on the asteroid, drill a deep hole, plug it with a nuke, beat it, detonate the nuke, and save Earth.You will have to put me down as one of the people who liked this film - simply because I thought it was funny as hell. I haven't laughed so hard at a sci-fi-comedy since 'Mars Attacks!'. Almost from the very start you could easily tell that the movie, though purportedly about a horrific doomsday scenario - namely, an asteroid the size of Texas careening into planet Earth (where everybody in the world lives, wouldn't ya' know it!) - never intended itself to be taken too seriously.It seems that every serious scene or sequence in the film was immediately followed by something totally comic or ludicrous. And it just got ludicrouser and ludicrouser as the film went on. By the time Steve Buscemi's character, Rockhound, got 'space mania' and had to be duct-taped to a chair, I was nearly in stitches from laughing so hard. [If the 'real' end of the world is even half as funny, well, I'm ready for it NOW.]The movie is chock full of wonderfully wacky characters and off-the-wall dialogue that (assuming you have even a smidgen of a sense of humor) should keep you at least grinning, if not guffawing, throughout. The movie is filled with rapid-fire action sequences, almost none of which is remotely believable or even scientifically possible, but hey, it looks good, and it just adds to the overall zaniness of the film.So for all of you space cadets who are out there in space looking for a great science fiction drama about the end of Earth, but instead found 'Armageddon', a truly decent space comedy, I now command you to get on the radio and call back to Earth: 'Houston... We have a comedy.'",Null,1,2,29 September 2003
Pitch Black," Stranded spaceship survivors seek shelter from swarming somnambulistic snapper-heads...
","This is one kick-ass movie that really creeped me out in a variety of ways.
I saw this on TV (thankfully in letterboxed formant), and really wish I could have seen the theatrical release. I'll bet it really rocks on the big screen.This movie is rich with atmosphere (even though that waste-land of a planet they're on isn't...). The Australian filming location is great in conveying a 'barren planet' look and feel to the story. The special effects are above average, and those flying critters ('snapper-heads', for lack of a better name) are really creepy. Vin Diesel is awesome as Riddick - a mysterious convicted felon who some time back, in prison, had his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark. You want to think of him as the 'bad' guy - but the film goes on to show that 'the Devil is not as black as he is sometimes painted'.
I like the way the film conveys the fundamental horror of being stranded on a bizarre planet with numerous menaces lurking around every corner, impeding your already slim chances at any sort of survival or rescue. This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat til the very end.Oh sure, you have to suspend your disbelief here and there. Some of the plot elements just seem a little too contrived and convenient. Nevertheless, it is still absorbing viewing, and the ending is decidedly not a real happy one (the crewmember you'd most like to see get rescued... well, I won't give it away with a spoiler here, so just go see it. Share the pain.)BTW: The plot of this movie is similar to 'Red Planet' (2000) with Val Kilmer. See them both, and compare...",Null,0,0,4 May 2003
Flashdance," Some may call it heavenly in its brilliance, others are just entertained
","Although I've long known, generally speaking, what this movie is about, I never saw it when it came out in 1983 or 1984, because I was too busy 'living' the 80's (yeah, right, whatever that means!). But I just saw it recently, in its entirety, the other night on TV.I don't know, maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film, just so I could revisit the 'happy days(?)' of the eighties, when, although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs, at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory, a pervasive (albeit childlike) adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true, miracles CAN happen, and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...This movie sucks, bigtime... but it also rocks! And that, people, is the honest to God truth. This movie is so bad it reeks of the stench of the very phoney-baloney on which it is based (and we all know how awful THAT is). BUT, it also rocks you to your very soul, and hey, how can you possibly fault a movie that dares to offer people (and not just young people, but ALL people) that little thing called HOPE??? I hope you don't take my 'critique' the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie. Strange, isn't it? If those of you reading this are parents with up-and-coming kids, make them sit through this film!! Make them watch it!! I guarantee you, at least there is not a single scene in it where some teenager just HAS to have sex with a baked pastry object!! Finally, let me comment on the fact that many in filmdom have dissed Jennifer Beals over the fact that a stand-in dancer performed various or several of her dance segments. Well let me just mention, that at the very end of the film, in the credit roll, there is a disclaimer that states: 'The people and events in this film are fictional. Any similarity to actual people or events is unintentional.' So, with this in mind a stunt double performed some of the dance steps!?? I was shocked, shocked to find that stunt doubles are used in Hollywood!!",Null,23,43,11 June 2002
Man on the Moon," Homage to a fraud
","This movie is difficult viewing. It is reasonably well-acted by Jim Carrey, at least enough so to add some three-dimensional fullness to the character of Andy Kaufman. But I never have been able to shake the conviction that Kaufman was purely a fraud who made up for lack of acting talent and comic ability with massive loads of baloney to make people THINK he was a genius. This movie only reinforced that belief.Other than the brief television career he had on 'Taxi', where he played the lovable foreign guy, Latka, who routinely butchered the English language, Kaufman was essentially a total loser who couldn't honestly act or make people laugh, so he had to resort to horrible excesses of fakery and deception and 'plants' just to make certain gags work. (Even his arch-nemesis in the ring, pro-wrestler Jerry Lawler, was a plant.)I've found that people by and large are willing to forgive bad acting, but not dishonest acting. I have always thought that Kaufman was guilty of both. Hey, it wasn't for nothing that the viewing public voted him off 'Saturday Night Live'. If you see this movie, you should, if you ever get the chance, also see the E! True Hollywood story on Kaufman for a little added balance and perspective.",Null,3,6,22 October 2002
From Hell," I say old chap, the British accent IS a bit of a sticky wicket
","I was amazed (and a bit perplexed) to hear so many of the previous commenters on IMDb  namely, those from the British Isles  make such pointed comments on the (apparently) scarcely believable accents of American actors Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. As for me, being a Yank and all, I neither noticed nor cared too much whether either Depp or Graham turned out a spotless British, Cockney, Irish or what-have-you accent because ultimately I don't know enough about those accents to be able to make an informed opinion. So in that respect I was rather neutral on the whole accent business throughout the film.Yes, I know what an authentic B-C-I accent sounds like, and I too noticed that these weren't flawless, but I never gave it much thought, as both of them seemed at least realistic and convincing enough to allow me to enjoy the overall atmospheric 'look and feel' of the movie, which was far more important.That being said, I can see where you are coming from. It would be the equivalent of watching a movie, say, featuring Medieval warriors doing battle, where everything in the battle scenes  the weapons, battle flags, helmets, spears, horses, etc.- are just spot-on accurately depicted, but (horror!) here and there you notice that a few of the foot soldiers are seen to be wearing modern-day wrist watches and sunglasses, or sporting the latest pair of Nike running shoes on their feet. Distracting, to say the least  and potentially ruinous to the whole 'magic' of the movie experience.I get the same reaction, I guess, when I see American actors who were born north of the Mason-Dixon line attempting to do a realistic- sounding Southern accent. My own mother was born and raised in the Deep South; I've personally traveled throughout much of the South, and as such I can spot a real Southern accent from a fake one from at least a mile away. (Good example of a non-Suthnah' doing an incredible Southern accent: Fred Gwynne (born/raised in NY-NY) as Judge Chamberlain Haller in 1992's 'My Cousin Vinny').But these comments about accents do raise some interesting critical questions. Namely, should Gollywood try to make more of an effort in casting the most appropriate (and realistic) actor or actress in every cast opening? Hmm, let's see, Inspector Abberline was from Dorset... perhaps the producers of this film could have or should have found an actor born and bred in Dorset to fill the role of Inspector Abberline? (Sorry, I don't right off hand know any actors originally from Dorset, so you'll have to provide me a name, if you know of one!). But on the other hand (and we all know this stubborn little fact of filmdom)... yes, that's right, they have to sell those tickets, they have to fill those seats in the theaters, folks. And Johnny Depp  say what you will about him  he *does* at least have that 'fill the seats' sort of box-office magnetism.I have always admired Johnny Depp, and I like much of his body of work. And I hurry to say that I was not disappointed with his work in this film. I regret that, for many of you, he didn't make the grade as a convincing enough Inspector Abberline, so much so that it ruined an otherwise absorbing and atmospheric film. I can only point out that, given the realities and mysteries of casting, it could have been worse. I mean, thank God it wasn't Bill Murray playing the Inspector! (Danny DeVito, anyone?)With the possible exception of calling the good folks at Central Casting, I don't know what the answer is, I don't know what we can do about it... (Sorry, I don't know their number, but I know it ISN'T '1-800-GET-REAL'.) But let me just close by saying that movies DO require a certain contribution of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. Until the folks at Central Casting can come up with perfect matches for every cast part, or until actors and actresses can effortlessly adopt themselves to the subtleties of a regional or foreign dialect, well, we will just have to deal with it, won't we?",Null,4,6,25 April 2002
From Hell," Excellent, weird, hallucinogenic... you'll love it!
","I just saw this movie today in the local theater, and *it*  *was*  *AWEsome*!!! Never mind that the whole conspiracy-theory thing was farfetched, or that it was filmed in Prague, Czech Republic (a most beautiful and delightful city, to be sure, but London it ain't). What this movie has going for it  and what really counts in a movie like this anyway  is ATMOSPHERE! The whole movie is SO eerie and atmospheric, that you almost feel like you, the viewer, have magically inhaled a few tokes from that ivory opium pipe that you see Abberline puffing on in the opening segment.As has been noted elsewhere, it is hard to pin this movie down. It's not truly a horror story  though the bloody deeds of Jack the Ripper are indeed horrifying. Nor is it truly a detective story  though Depp's Inspector Abberline and his sidekick Peter Godley (played by Robbie Coltrane) more than a little resemble the detective duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I guess what you end up with is really more of a dark, DARK hallucinogenic mystery encased in an historical slice-of-life snapshot of the dark underbelly of 19th century London.I liked virtually everything in the movie except for the scenes where Mary Kelly's friend Liz ventured into lesbianism - that to me just seemed stupidly gratuitous (somebody else commented that they felt the same way about the inclusion of the scene with The Elephant Man/John Merrick, but I didn't mind that scene, I thought it only helped contribute to the overall eerie, weird atmosphere of the movie).It's worth commenting that the background score and sound effects are employed to the utmost: if you watch this movie in a modern theater with all that high-tech surround-sound stuff, you will definitely rock, roll, and vibrate!Anyway, this movie can proudly boast of brilliantly executed visuals, set design, sound, weirdness, and just about everything else. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who wants to go on a trip... and a strange, strange trip it is.",Null,0,1,5 November 2001
The Matrix," A fun movie, Keanu is good, but Matrix should be remade as a comedy
","Yes, I thought it was a fun movie, because it just takes you on a mad roller coaster-like adventure through the real-unreal world of the Matrix. And all kinds of cool high-tech stuff happens, and lots of stuff gets blown up, and 'faster than a speeding bullet' is a relative concept in this twisted time-space-reality continuum. I personally am not a big science fiction fan, (either in books or in film) because typically I just don't 'get it' as far as what the heck they are really talking about (I guess I need more approachable subject matter). But I actually liked Matrix, it has enough high-tech action stuff happening, and enough vague, mysterious tension going on to keep me suitably riveted to the tube.That being said, I think this movie should be remade as a comedy. I recently saw 'Tank Girl' and in that movie I was amazed at how well comedy works in a futuristic, sci-fi setting. I thought many of the dialogue lines in Matrix were downright corny (sorry, I forgot to write down a sampling...), and there were times where I couldn't help but mentally rewrite certain scenes to be redone as twisted comedy. Like, when Keanu's character goes to meet the Oracle, what if the Oracle turned out to be... Larry Ellison!! (or Ross Perot, or Alice Cooper, or Madonna... heck, be creative, pick your own favorite but offbeat 'Oracle' character to appear here). And when Neo is having that gunfight showdown with the Agent, it could have been rewritten to have him crazily jumping all around and bouncing off walls to avoid the bullets, kind of like Jim Carrey's character did in The Mask.Finally, let me say that I actually admire Keanu Reeves, and his performance in this movie is quite good (IMHO). Some people think he is too wooden, whereas I liken his style more to a quiet intensity ala Clint Eastwood. I must admit, that it was years before I got around to 'liking' Clint Eastwood. In his early spaghetti western movies, in the Dirty Harry series, heck, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then, one day I watched 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' and it was truly an epiphany. Not only did that excellent movie make me a believer in Clint Eastwood, but it rekindled an interest in westerns, and actually made me want to go re-watch many of the great westerns, including some of the earlier ones with Clint Eastwood, that I had heretofore dismissed.In short, 'Matrix': not such a bad movie at all, Keanu Reeves is more intense than you may realize, and go see 'Tank Girl' and 'The Outlaw Josey Wales'.",Null,0,0,10 December 2001
