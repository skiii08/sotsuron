Howl's Moving Castle," What a great fantasy! Wonderful animation
","Wonderful animation! Great fantasy film. Espectator not only cares about the story but also by each element from that charming 'European' steampunk world under war with magicians who frighten but also are needed. Time and space are changeable, and so are appearances and things. There are great characters, metaphors, 'monsters'... it is hard to say more without spoiling. It is a film that captivates, and it does not receive a full 5-star review because I felt that the second half was less interesting and pefectly presented than the former. However, although no finishing in an upward curve, this is one of the greatest animated films ever made.",9,0,0,25 April 2020
Skyfall," The best 007 film ever
","This is by far the best 007 film I have watched, including the films since Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Skyfall showed that it would not be just one more already in the opening scene and initial credits. Afterwards, with the very best script and a competent direction it did achieve a higher level probably no James Bond movie ever reached. It is much deeper than all of them, previous or tepid Spectre. Bond and M's lives and relationship are dealt in a more mature and complex way 8n Skyfall than we are accostumed to in 007 franchise. Besides that, action scenes, original Adèle's song and locations are breathtaking. The villain portrayed by Bardem is also the best nemesis for James Bond ever. To resume, Skyfall was able to, being a much deeper and seriously developped movie, be true to the character and to the franchise, in many elements present in the story until the end.",8,1,4,31 March 2020
The Birth of a Nation," One of the most openly racist movies ever made: it also brought bad technical consequences
","It could be only an important film in the history of motion pictures that had a too large extent, but it is something much worse: it is one of the most openly racist movies ever made. The ridiculous 'black' makeup on white actors, the racist words such as 'negro' and the caricature-like way black characters talk can be viewed since the beginning. Though, the second part of the film, about reconstruction after civil war, is the direst. While black representatives are portrayed as savages with no respect, as beastly cowards, whites are shown as poor victims of the majority. D. G. Griffith was a talented director and was able to make some cute or funny short scenes and beautifully filmed footage, besides his importance in the narrative innovation. Though, his social and political views are repulsive. In a country where black people did not have even de jure the same rights as the whites until some decades later, narrating history as if the role of the two races had been the reverse is simply dishonest. The same may be told about calling equal rights as 'vicious doctrines', or calling Ku Kux Klan as 'the organization that saved the South from the anarchy of black rule', or talking about 'defence of Aryan birthright' (Nazi Germany has deserved so much concern in USA but a similar speech inside the country, although criticized, strangely does not seem to have called so much attention). The indefensible antipathy of the director for the legalization of inter-racial marriage is advocated through the confusion between marriage proposal and rape menace, racial prejudice and honor, and the ridiculous plot of a forced marriage attempt (some critics pledge not to make a confusion between politics and artistic work, but how to ignore the awful screenplay and makeup?). Don't worry, 'helpless' white 'victims' of the black 'mob' 'abuse' after the end of slavery: KKK masked vigilantes are there to save the day and 'make the negroes know their proper place' in Grifitth's epic. Disgusting and unbearable.",3,0,5,24 August 2015
Billy Elliot," Awesome! Much more than a dance movie
","What a moving, cute, funny, political, sensitive movie! Since the very first scene sequence spectators notice that this will not be an ordinary film. Cinematography is great, it is perfectly edited, actors do an amazing job (Jamie Bell is awesome in the leading role, but how not to also highlight Gary Lewis's performance as his father, or Julie Walters's as his ballet teacher, or Jean Heywood's as grandma?). It is much more than a dance film, as people usually refer themselves to it. It deals with many complex elements together, such as English working class, British politics under Thatcherism (with miners on strike and violent police repression), complicated family relations, gender conventional roles, sexuality, prejudice, cosmopolitanism vs. provincialism, and boxing as the archetypal lower class sport.",10,0,0,10 November 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," Alice in miyazakiland
","Cute movie that is kind of a Japanese version of Alice in Wonderland and NeverEnding Story (and perhaps also Jack and the Beanstalk...). Hayao Miyazaki has his name in the history of animated cinema not only for the beauty of the drawing, but also the perfection of body movements, the sensitiveness to children behaviour, the fertile fantasy imagination to overlap reality. 'Totoro' is particularly sensitive to family and childhood.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
The Hateful Eight," Not a great Western, just a sick mind
","I expected so much more. There is a beautiful cinematography, nice costumes and a good soundtrack (off course, it's Morricone; though, it is not one of his best). However, the pace is not always the best, the story is kind of meaningless in spite of its surprises and twists, and some disgusting traits as outcomes of Tarantino's sick mind annoyed me very much: lots of crap, misogyny, sadism, and perhaps racism. There is and intention of having stylish characters, but the goal is not fulfilled as in the good spaghetti or contemporary Westerns. The film is not properly bad, but is far from being good as I waited for. It is highly overestimated just because Tarantino was turned into a fashion brand. This simply does not captivate a less biased spectator, besides having the common immoral elements typical from the director's mind.",6,4,9,3 June 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The worst Spiderman movie
","Just the last two sentences of this review may be considered as spoiler. Let's begin: This is the worst official Spiderman movie ever produced. Indeed, it is much more a mix of a silly high school film and a Iron Man film. This Spiderman has very little of Spiderman. First of all, instead of having extreme reflexes, he is quite clumsy, what is nonsense and made the film a bad slapstick comedy. Besides that, what the hell is that Iron Man-like suit with many powers not traditionally related to the spider? Therefore, the fact that this is not really a Spiderman film is bad enough not to consider it a good movie. Though, there are many other problems: most of the action scenes are confusing (like the scenes Transformers franchise bad recent films use to have), there is an excess of jokes with more than 90% of them being bad and silly, acting is unconvincing for most of the main roles (Michael Keaton is clearly an exception)... The movie gets better in the final part, but it is definitely not enough to save it. SPOILER ALERT: By the way: MJ's name is Michelle? Really?!",5,2,5,9 October 2017
Underworld Awakening," A fantastic beginning; afterwards, just nice action
","In my opinion, opposite to many reviews, this is probably the best film from the franchise. The 'Purge' beginning is very nice. Indeed, if that environment had been kept until the film finished, it would be one of the best vampire movies ever. Kate Beckinsale shines (if it is possible to say that about a vampire!) once again in the charismatic leading role. I liked to see 'Tywin Lannister' Charles Dance with vampire teeth too. India Eisley, the girl, also does a good job and has some creepy quasi-'The Exorcist' moments. The first part of the movie is by far the best. Unfortunately, it looses most of its dramatic impact afterwards, becoming a conventional action thriller. Though, it is still an entertaining flick until the end. Selenes's final fight is great.",8,4,7,2 February 2016
Suicide Squad," Colorless squad in a confusing fast paced conventional adventure
","It is a confusing film, and that is not because it is complex but because it is not well developed. Characters are undeveloped. Image is too dark making harder to understand what is going on, what is worsened by the video clip pace. There are serious problems in edition - a good example is when Harley Quinn is thrown out by nothing as the blow was not against hers. After the so promising ads and trailers, I really expected much more colorful characters. The background of the characters is not carefully explored because they are numerous and the movie is in a hurry; it is only explained (at best; sometimes even this does not happen). Therefore, spectator just sees, does not feel, as there is no time for dramatic impact. Harley Quinn is by far the most interesting character; indeed, I would rather watch a Harley Quinn movie than this film. Deadshot and Rick Flag are the most consistent ones, with the best developed backgrounds, but they are far from being among the nicest characters in DC pantheon, right? Diablo is visually quite nice and becomes more interesting as the story advances, but his drama about using his power does not convince and bores. The Joker is not bad, and his visual is nice (I liked the smile on the hand) but he does not frighten and does not laugh, what is not true to the character (besides that, most of the cut scenes seem to show him and Harley, what is a waste). I saw many people praising Amanda Waller as a great villainess; OK, she does well, but she is not that special either. Killer Croc is visually excellent but is quite unimportant in the film. Enchantress and her brother are not bad and their magic has not been odd inside the story as I was afraid, but a better direction would be required to have them as the really big threats they are supposed to be. Captain Boomerang, Katana and Slipknot are the worst; uninteresting, they are there just to increase the number of members in the crew. The whole melodrama and slow motion in the final battle suck, but the very last three scenes after that are good.",6,1,2,8 October 2016
American Sniper," A propaganda movie to legitimate that USA invades other countries
","In spite of his extremely conservative political view, Clint Eastwood has already showed that he may be a quite sensible director, in movies such as 'Gran Torino', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'Invictus' and 'Unforgiven'. Though, 'American Sniper' reinforces the bad conventional wisdom about him, as a macho cowboy who loves guns and do not care about their effects. It is a militaristic and imperialist propaganda, which tries to legitimate the aggressive foreign policy developed by the United States. The film simply does not discuss why Iraqi children, women and obviously less equipped men tried to kill those servicemen from USA, who were invading their country, their homes, harming their families. Television shows the 9-11 attack, but is it that automatic to view the invasion of other countries as the way to defend the United States (Bush doctrine)? The sniper and other SEALs are shown calling Iraqi as 'savages', arguing that US is the most important country in the world and might be defended... quotes of stupid people, which would dampen any credibility in the eyes of more critical viewers, but how many spectators will not notice that and simply support that USA invades other countries? The movie shows rebels as sadistic criminals who damage the local population, what is convenient for the support of Bush doctrine, but is that fair? Why local people supported them? Are American soldiers less sadistic? Were American soldiers just defending their colleagues (who were invading Iraq!) and were the rebels assassins who wanted to murder Westerners (and not to protect their country and people)? The sniper from the other side, Mustafa, could have been much better developed, showing the feelings of the enemies, but director's blind patriotism did not allow it. In the first part, the movie reminds a lot Brazilian 'Elite Squad', which shares the main good and bad traits: very entertaining, technically well done (Eastwood made amazing war scenes), but supporting bad practices from the troops (in the Brazilian case, it supports torture and disrespect for human rights in the invasion of the homes of poor people in slums in Rio de Janeiro by the BOPE, an elite group of military police as the SEAL is for US Navy). The biggest resemblance, though, refers to the heavy 'Full Metal Jacket'-style training of servicemen. A very bizarre and disappointing thing in 'American Sniper' is that the main character is humanized after that, while we could expect that he would become even more violent and nervous than he was in the cowboy days of the beginning. His family life is by far the most interesting issue in the movie, but the bad political job in the war footage obfuscates it. There is something odd in Hollywood war movies: they are seldom critical about USA, dealing with the conflicts as good Americans against evil foreigners or, when this approach is almost impossible (like in films on Vietnam War), they focus the internal psychological problems of soldiers and veterans, not caring about the aggression per se, as there were only citizens from US suffering and no people being slaughtered by them. To resume, although 'American Sniper' is technically well done, it is the worst film directed by Clint Eastwood ever (or at least for a long time). The patriotic melodrama in the end does not help to change this opinion. Cold murderers are not heroes.",5,2,21,20 February 2015
Top Secret!," Silly... and hilarious!
","Silly... and hilarious! Campy, nonsense and dark humor comedy at once, this movie is a cold war spoof, but a very anachronistic on. It mocks all clichÃ©s and portrays a caricature of both Germany (it also merges East Germany and Nazi Germany as if they were the same, and the French resistance opposes it!) and rock n' roll movies. They never stop with the jokes and espectator laughs hysterically. Many cartoonish not realistic scenes also contribute to laughters. The film is silly, does not help in any social or political analysis (except perhaps for a few gags on US politics), but is true fun.",8,0,0,27 April 2020

Man of Steel," Not really a Superman movie
","Not really a Superman movie. That is another superhero with red cloak and black hair. I prefer, by far, 'Superman returns' and, off course, Christopher Reeve's first two films. In 'Man of Steel', the history of Krypton looks like 'Brave New World' of Aldous Huxley. Clark Kent as a child and as a teenager resembles the one from 'Smallvile'. But where is Clark Kent, the shy journalist? Where is that superhero worried about hurting human beings while fighting the enemy? The only thing I believe this film brought better than all the previous ones is not the way they showed Krypton (I didn't like it very much) or a deeper exploration of Kal-El's personality (I expected this but I didn't see it), but Faora-Ul, a nice character (better than Ursa, the female partner of Zod in Superman II).Therefore, this is not a bad film, but it isn't a movie true to the character, and that is not due to the revisionist uniform (which I also disliked). I expected much more of Zack Snyder, who brilliantly directed the fabulous 'Watchmen'.",7,0,3,21 May 2014
The Revenant," A suffocating realistic Western that follows the steps of 'Jeremiah Johnson'
","What a great production! Cinematography is amazing, showing all the beauty and the danger of nature. Camera movements and editing are also very skillful. Leonardo DiCaprio in the main role, a trekker who knows both nature and Indians deeply, and Tom Hardy as despicable Fitzgerald lead the great cast. The brutal story has the same spirit of another snowy Western that depicts the fight for surviving, Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford's 'Jeremiah Johnson', but with some very realistic scenes that probably could not be made in the 70's. The spectator feels suffocated. The only drawback of the fabulous production is that the unrealistic recovery of DiCaprio's character does not fit to the harsh and much more realistic tone of the movie.",9,2,5,4 February 2016
Spirited Away," Chihiro-Alice neets Queen of Hearts in Miyazakiland
","Spirited Away is often considered as the best of great Hayao Miyazaki's animated films. I do not agree, but off course it is also excellent. The very beginning is true horror, none of his other movies I have warched could fit this genre as this one. However, unfortunately in my point of view, the film changes the atmosphere after Chihiro meets Yubaba. The story becomes more confusing than I would appreciate too. One interesting issue I would like to highlight are Lewis Carroll's influences on Miyazaki's work. Clearly inspired in Alice, Japanese master included the Cat and the Hole in My Neighbor Totoro. Here in Spirited Away we can see the Tea, the Queen of Hearts and the White Queen.",8,0,1,26 April 2020
Underground," Unique and beautiful
","Beautiful chaos, a unique film! Theatrical acting, wonderful art direction, dark humor performances, attractive fantastic realism, crowded events, charming silent-age-style intertitles, wars seen through uncommon angles, anti-heroes' love triangle, close-ups and travelings in dionysiac moves, a charming bizarre plot... many traits make this tradicomedy an innovative worth seeing piece of art.",9,0,0,14 May 2020
Kick-Ass," Common people becoming superheroes: 'Kick-Ass' is a great lie
","This is one of the most overrated movies ever. The film pretends to show common people becoming superheroes. That is obviously a great lie: we see a hyper-violent (and criminal) child who fights better than Batman or Daredevil! She is really super powerful (what are her jumps and speed in using weapons?!).Therefore, the greatest defect of the film is not technical, but that it is a great and meaningless lie.If you want to see what would happen if common people became superheroes, forget this overrated movie and watch the superb and much less famous 'Super' or 'Defendor'.The only really nice thing in 'Kick-Ass' are the spoof scenes and songs.",6,1,4,21 May 2014
Coco," One of the best Pixar/Disney films ever
","Wow! Pixar did it again! Deep, delicate, moving. And what a wonderful animation and great songs! So charming trip through Mexican culture (they only forgot fÃºtbol-soccer and mural painting). It is a beautiful film to cry (a lot), not beacause it emphasizes the drama (it does not) but because it touches what is the most important.",10,0,0,30 March 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Hollywood, stop! It is not a good idea to make superhero or action movies with astounding visual effects but a poor screenplay
","The first part of the movie (12 minutes) is a quite good action flick. Then, the title 'Avengers' appears and the film gets worse and worse. Indeed, the visual effects throughout the movie are amazingly well done, extremely realistic and numerous (three thousand of them!), and many people, particularly youngsters, think that this is the most important thing in a superhero film (then rejecting many nice movies which lack those amazing visual effects or that fast pace or that amount of explicit violence), but I strongly disagree: the story is always the most important element... and this one is poor! In my opinion, most of the time 'Avengers 2' is a bit boring, there are many silly dialogs, lots of unfunny gags, and the black-green romance is cheesy, besides having no previous development (the chat about having or not a future together is specially pathetic). Talking about the good traits, Robert Downey Jr. was the best again. The scene in the train with Captain America and the twins was also nice, and so are some fights. Though, the film overall sucks. Is is a shame that Hollywood action movies are spending more and more in technology at expense of good screenplays. The films from the second phase of Marvel cinematic universe (this one, 'Thor: the dark world' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' are awful, and I also include here 'Avengers 1') are much worse (so poor stories! so focused only in visual effects!) than the ones made up to 'Captain America: The first Avenger' (this one and 'Iron Man' are particularly good).",5,4,11,13 October 2015
Elysium," The future of capitalism
","This is an extremely interesting sci-fi movie which discusses economics and society deeply. Basically, it simulates the future of capitalist production system. In a society so dependent on electronics, with robots, droids and cyborgs, plants full of blue collars still exist (and not an increase of financialization as we could expect), with workers working in the worst conditions possible, in a labor Darwinism. As there is a great unemployment, workers accept very bad jobs. Businessmen look for profit caring nothing about workers' rights. There is a deep split in society in two classes (well, Karl Marx could agree with much of what is shown in the film), with the richest living comfortably outside the Earth, in an artificial satellite called Elysium (full of beautiful gardens and gorgeous houses), and the others surviving in poor conditions: human rights abuse, garbage, lack of health-care (what is extremely developed for high class in the space), crime, degraded areas, pollution... Not surprisingly, Latin people are concentrated in the lowest economic strata in this futuristic Los Angeles, speaking a mix of Spanish and English. The state is focused on keeping that elite privileges in Elysium, keeping the poor outside by means which remind us a lot about the immigration control in USA/Mexico borders. Lobbyists are inside the State in order to cooperate with private interests, and private firms may cooperate with a coup d'Etat if it is economically interesting for them. Unfortunately, the film does not keep the same level throughout its length, as it gets too melodramatic and focused in chases and fights, but it is nice until its end. All the actors did a good job and it is hard to choose someone to highlight.",9,3,5,19 February 2015
Joker," The Joker is born! A masterpiece.
","The most important supervillain has a perfect dramatic biographic movie I did not imagine that DC Heroes would ever allow to be made. Deep, shocking, sometimes quite sad, very well developed, it shows a credible and socially serious backgrounded path of an outcast in an individualistic capitalist ill society towards sociopathy. It is the most realistic film ever made for a superhero universe. Not only the existence of the Joker, but also dangerous Gotham and the murder of the Waynes make much more sense now than in the usual simplistic moralist explanations. Superb movie! Amazing Joachin Phoenix!",10,2,4,12 October 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A movie of two extremes: great and awful moments
","Coppola's version of the classic novel by Bram Stocker is a good film, but quite irregular. It quickly moves from excellent moments to ridiculous ones, and then to another fantastic scene, and so forth. There is a heterodox filmmaking, which mixes many different styles alternatively. It works properly; however, the problem is that while some scenes are visually astounding (like the Brides of Dracula, the powers of the vampire, the women possessions), there are also many ridiculously kitsch ones. Why the hell Coppola decided to show hemoglobin?! Why showing those Dracula eyes in the sky? That's so cheesy that perhaps even in 'Twilight' that scene could not be included. On the other hand, off course any of the many fantastic parts of 'Dracula' is much better than the best moment of the entire 'Twilight' series. Gary Oldman plays a very frightening and bizarre quasi-androgynous master of evil. Winona Ryder is also charming in the role of Mina. Keanu Reeves is convincing as Jonathan Harker too. Perhaps the great actor who does not do a job as good as we could expect is Anthony Hopkins, whose performance as Van Helsing is tepid.",8,0,1,6 December 2015
Paths of Glory," Anti-War Masterpiece
","Early masterpiece by genius Stanley Kubrick. With extremely inteligent dialogs, it is one of his great anti-war movies, probably the best of them. Cinematography, acting, script, everything is perfect. Kubrick and Kirk Douglas's partnership gave us to of the best movies ever made, Spartacus and Paths of Glory, and both were able to discuss political issues deeply and seriously while accomplishing amazing artistic achevements with historical events as background. When France and Germany fought each other in WWI, the film is clear about who was the bad side: those who gave orders, all the others are victims. It ia not only one of the best war movies ever but also one of the best court films. The movie was already remarkable until the latest scene, which changed its status from excellent to absolutely brilliant. That perfect scene shows another important lesson: dehumanizing is necessary to make wars, otherwise nobody would do something so dire.",10,0,0,11 April 2020
The Croods," Interesting traits from stone age to be used in a great animation movie? They got them all!
","One more masterwork by DreamWorks! I don't know why, but I did not expect too much of this piece. Though, it showed itself a huge good surprise! As I told in the title above, they had many nice ideas about how to use stone age traits to make a great animation movie. The characters are very well developed and I loved their stone-age mannerisms: amazing animation job! Besides that, it has a quite smart screenplay. The general idea may be perceived as a self-help advise not to be afraid and to risk. Though, it it is more than that, or at least it shows a brilliant metaphor for that: humanity only has evolved because human beings overcame their afraid of nature and tried. Screenplay also explores the alpha male struggles, domestication of wildlife, dangers and scarcity faced by the first days of our species. Following the light is also a nice metaphor for knowledge, like the fire of Prometheus. The Noah's moment in the end was also great. The film is intelligent and touching in the right amount.",9,0,0,2 July 2015
Any Given Sunday," Not any given motivational American football movie
","This could be one more well made motivational American football film, like Jerry Maguire, Remember the Titans, Rudy or Varsity Blues, but it is even more, as it also deals with many other important issues, such as: business over all, media effects, family relations, age conflicts, vanity, health problems. The minor drawbacks are the excess of unnecessary nude butts and some scatology, but, on the other hand, the film may also be praised for its edition innovations. Al Pacino is fantastic as the coach (as everybody may expect), but Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid and Camerin Diaz also do a great job. By the end, one more sample that this is not any given conventional American football movie.",8,1,2,18 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Does changing the traits of so long established characters make sense?
","After creating a Superman who doesn't behave as Superman for disappointing 'Man of Steel', the franchise includes in its sequel a Lex Luthor who does not look like Lex Luthor (shaving his long hair is not enough as his psychological traits are also different) and an Aquaman who does not look like Aquaman (indeed, he reminds Marvel's Namor). Ben Affleck's Batman is not bad and did look like Batman... at least until putting on that horrible armor which looks like a new suit for Iron Man. Besides that, the story is tepid and nothing is remarkable (even Gal Gadot didn't really shine, not giving Wonder Woman a great debut in spite of nice fighting skills). Talking about fights, the struggle between Gotham's dark night and Smallville adopted son, expected to be a climax in the movie, is completely implausible, as there is no explanation for Wayne's extreme strength and no reason for Superman losing and recovering his superstrength under effect of krypyonite continuously, as if it blinked. To resume, DC wanted to have an innovative reboot but simply disrespected its valuable characters.",6,0,2,2 August 2016
Casino Royale," It is a Bond movie; one of the best
","I was skeptical about a 007 novie with an actor who does bot have a face of James Bond (nice actor but perhaps too bully and not ebough classy). Anyway, Casino Royale is certainly one of he best movies of the franchise ever (no masterpiece, but much above average; probably my second favorite till now, after Octopussy). The story, possibly with a record of plot twists, has all you expect from a 007 film: the Bond girls are there (Eva Green shines but Caterina Muriino is also stunning), the weird villains (Casino Royale may be the 007 movie with the best villains, and Mads Mikkelsen is by far better than tthose gold-something from XXth century), the gadgets (although less charming than in previous films), the unconventional fights. There is also beautiful footage and special effects are very well used.",8,1,3,20 March 2020
Deadpool," A Hollywood superhero movie out of the exhaustingly repeated fomula
","Funny dark humor, very sarcastic about superhero movies in a way Hollywood does not use to be. As there are jokes all the time, not all of them are nice, but many are. The first half hour is excellent. The rest of the film is nice, but does not keep the same level. There are also some too obviously predictable scenes. The main villain, Ajax, is a major drawback, as a much better actor was needed to be casted for this important role. The usage of visual effects is extreme but very well done, with interesting outcomes (as the opening credits and scene show). Violence is also extreme and not taken seriously, in a way Tarantino's films are the main examples.",8,3,9,29 December 2016
