The Avengers," Destined to become a classic
","In 2008, Marvel Studios gave us the first film adaptation of it's super hero Iron Man, with the promise of big things to come. The film was an astounding success, proving that Batman wasn't the only hero that can have a good movie. What followed was four more films, The Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America, all critical and financial successes, and all leading up to one massive blowout known as The Avengers. Culminating all five films into one massive adventure was a seemingly impossible task, however writer/director Joss Whedon somehow, against all odds, pulled it off in a big way.It's something that has never been done before in film. Taking these characters, who have proved they are strong enough to carry a film by themselves, and putting them all together in one over-arching continuity. The problems that could arise from this concept are endless, and yet this films works. Not only does it work, it's so brilliantly pieced together that it is destined to become the greatest super hero movie ever made.Joss Whedon, of Firefly and Buffy fame, is no stranger to creating stories featuring ensemble casts. The contrasting personalities of the team play a large role, and Whedon explores this with astounding fervor. This is a character study as much as an action film, and the witty dialogue Whedon brings to the table only enhances the personalities of these extraordinary individuals. The banter between the heroes during lulls in the action is just as engaging as the mind-blowing action itself.And the action will blow your mind. The main reason most people want to go see this film, is to see The Avengers kick some ass, and there is no shortage of ass-kickery happening in this film. Although The Hulk steals most of the jaw-dropping moments, even the lower tier characters of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) get just as much screen time, and each have their own 'wow' moments.One thing that is an absolute must when having such an over-powered team like this, is having a worthy adversary. Tom Hiddleston's character of Loki plays the perfect villain, and what better an adversary than a crazed God and his army? When it was first revealed that Loki was the film's antagonist, the initial fear was that we already saw Thor defeat Loki in his own movie, so why is there a need for The Avengers to be involved, when we already know Thor can beat him single handedly? Fortunately, this and all the other fanboy and critic's questions are addressed and taken into consideration.Since I was a child, I have always talked about the prospect of an Avengers movie, and it looked so unattainable that it seemed like it would forever remain just a 12 year old's dream. Having previously dreamt of a G.I. Joe movie, it comes as no surprise when The Avengers was announced, I was left with cautious optimism. Much to my delight, it seems that Joss Whedon was somehow able to look into my soul and produce the best comic book movie ever made. The Avengers is a masterpiece, and should be placed on the mantle of greatness beside Star Wars and Indiana Jones.FilmPulse.net",9,1,4,5 May 2012
Goon," Violent, Brutal, Fun
","Based on a book by real-life hockey Enforcer Doug Smith, Goon doesn't try to break any new ground, nor does it try to answer any of life's tougher questions. This film's ambitions are simply to entertain, and in that it succeedsto a point.Co-written by Superbad scribe Evan Goldberg and Jay Baruchel (who also has a supporting role in the film), Goon is the story of Doug Glatt, a well-meaning but less than bright Massachusetts bouncer who, through luck and circumstances, finds himself playing for the local hockey team as their 'go to' enforcer.From the beginning, it's clear that Doug (a well-cast Seann William Scott) simply wants to 'matter.' His father and brother are both doctors cut from the Ivy League cloth, while Doug, in his own words 'doesn't have a 'thing'' of his own.It's a classic underdog story, filled with every story beat you'd expect in a tale like this. There's almost nothing surprising about it, and yet there is a strange charm to it even when the blood starts to flow.And flow it does. Goon is a pretty gory film. It doesn't play down or glamourize the role of fighting in hockey (though whether it celebrates it or not is up for debate). When the punches fly, the camera doesn't flinch away. Director Michael Dowse is not shy about letting the shot linger on a post-punch laceration or on a stream of blood as it slowly drips to the ice. In a way, the blood is almost as much a character here as it was in Tim Burton's 2007 adaptation of Sweeney Todd.Intercut with the violence is a decent comic film with characters that are, despite being typical, somewhat easy to root for.Doug's team, The Halifax Highlanders, is full of hard-luck cases and scrubs wanting that shot at glory, and despite the impossibility of developing them all as full-fledged characters, you end up caring for their plight perhaps more than you originally expect.There's no doubt, however, that hockey fans will get much more out of Goon than the casual movie-goer. The film is very Canadian in feel, and blatant and over-the-top crassness of the sports locker room, while accurate, may turn off more conservative viewers.The supporting cast is hit-and-miss. Liev Schreiber is stellar as Ross Rhea, an aging, past his prime 'goon' who sees a lot of himself in Doug, and the best scene in the film has Doug lucking into a meeting with Ross at a late-night diner, where the veteran imparts some sobering wisdom to the young protégé.Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) is cute as Eva, a hockey-obsessed bookworm who falls for Doug despite (or perhaps because of) his simple nature, but Eugene Levy is completely wasted as Doug's father.Worse yet is Jay Baruchel, whose performance as Doug's friend Ryan is so overly grating he almost sabotages the film before it can get started. After the first ten minutes or so, the focus wisely switches to Doug and the film improves almost immediately.In the end, Goon is a decent little film and nothing more. Its part Bad News Bears and part Slap Shot, and although its story is really nothing new, it gets marks for telling it in an off-the-wall manner.Daniel FilmPulse.net",6,0,0,14 May 2012
Dark Shadows," Don't bother
","Dark Shadows, the new collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, a remake of the late 60's television show of the same name, is a disappointing train wreck of flat characters, weak storytelling, and is guilty of a mundane premise. This is just another movie (a la Alice in Wonderland) where the names Tim Burton and Johnny Depp don't go synonymous with greatness.Barnabas Collins (Depp) is a vampire, imprisoned for 200 years in a coffin by his arch nemesis and lover-to-the-end-of-time Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), and wakes up in 1972, only to find that he is in a different place, different time, and that his family fortune is all but none. He heads back to his home in Collinsport and seizes the opportunity to help his living heirs and hopefully destroy Angelique once and for all.One of the problems this movie has, albeit a lot, is that nothing ever seems too big of a deal. The 1972 Collins family is struggling to survive; yet no one works. They all blame the lack of their once successfulfishing company on Angelique's slow turning monopoly 'Angel Bay Seafood'. I know there's a point where you have to suspend disbelief but come on, battling seafood companies? The Collins' are a collection of great actors but horrible characters. Michelle Pfeiffer, the so-called matriarch, is nothing more than a brooding house mom with too much time on her hands. I personally kept getting distracted by her ridiculous eyelashes. Jonny Lee Miller, as the dim-witted selfish brother offers nothing exciting during his screen time and when he leaves us it is with relief rather than regret because it wasn't like he was doing much when he was on screen anyway. Chloe Moretz, one of the few child actors nowadays that I am actually excited to see grow up into a fine actress, is wasted as a brooding teenager, having no new insightful moments or any act relative to the story at hand. Her turn in the third act is unjustified and is over as soon as it starts. Helena Bonham Carter. Well. This movie really made me miss the Bonham Carter that was in Fight Club because since she got hitched to Burton, she seems to be playing loud obnoxious characters that aren't funny and waste time on screen (think the Red Queen and now this atrocity).The only redeeming quality Dark Shadows has is that its soundtrack is pretty awesome, giving us some 70s tunes that we haven't heard in a while and making good use of the time period with production design. It also reminds people like me that when something is being marketed as the new Tim Burton-Johnny Depp movie, I know now not to get as excited as I used to.Chad FilmPulse.net",4,4,8,13 May 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Spoiler Free Review
","Please note that this review is spoiler free. We do not discuss any plot details in this review.It's very difficult to write a review for a film like The Cabin in the Woods, when discussing the best, and most exciting aspects of the film would ruin it for those who haven't seen it. Therefore, in order to maintain the integrity of the movie, this review will not be a critique of the plot, but of the other aspects of the film. That being said, go see this movie right now, then come back and read this.The story of the production of The Cabin in the Woods is filled with almost as many twists and turns as the film itself. Filmed in 2009, the movie was originally set for a February 2010 release, however it was delayed due to the studio wanting the film to be converted to 3D, despite objections from director Drew Goddard and writer Joss Whedon. Fortunately, this idea was ultimately scrapped, but the movie was indefinitely postponed due to MGM's financial situation. Lionsgate decided to pick up the torch and announced they had purchased the film in July of 2011, and after being well received on the festival circuit, it finally got it's release April 13, 2012.Normally, when you hear about movies stuck in situations like this, it either means it isn't very good, or it will never see the light of day. Fortunately for everyone, neither of these reign true for Cabin in the Woods. It's a fantastic blend of genres, and although it would traditionally be categorized as a horror movie, there's much more to this film than your typical horror faire. Combining elements of comedy, science fiction, action, and horror, this one's going to be tough to place on a shelf at your local Blockbuster, that is if your local Blockbuster still exists.It's with this mashup of genres, the great story-line, and solid script that make this film something unique, and a much needed breath of fresh air for horror buffs like myself. Whedon and Goddard's script is clean and crisp, and provides just enough witty dialogue to give the film an almost light-heated quality, that let's us know we don't have to take everything in the film too seriously. That's not to say there aren't a few moments of cheesiness, but with a movie like this, you have to wonder if those few lines were intended to be that way.If you think you know what's going on in The Cabin in the Woods before you see it, you're wrong. It's not just a horror movie, it's every horror movie. Every great horror movie has comedy, and every great horror movie dispels the clichés of the genre. This film does that so well, that by the end, you're not even sure what you just saw could even be considered horror. Go see The Cabin in the Woods, but don't read anything about it before hand. Don't watch any trailers, or go to the IMDb page and you'll walk out of the theater surprised, shocked, and wanting more.Adam FilmPulse.net",8,1,5,8 May 2012
