Blade Runner 2049," Definitely a Sequel
","Short Strokes: 1) Loud sounds - the audio mix in the theater put far too much mid-range in what should have been very low frequency bass. The result was like the movie Dune. Fortunately, this was somewhat infrequent. 2) They make someone old look young again, and it reminds me of Carrie Fisher's character in Star Wars: Rouge. Clever, but not quite good enough and, therefore, distracting. 3) There were no small actors in original Blade Runner, even the smallest roles were great performances. Not so here, very good acting but little showmanship (Ford's and Hoek's roles were exceptional).Summary: Any time you are following a cult classic with a sequel, you expect the lights to be a little dimmer and the edges to be a little duller. True here. Expectations were set in 1982 and recently elevated with a $50 million marketing blitz, and it is hard to live up to that. There was more playing it safe in this movie: no loose ends like crane cables on 'flying' police cars or brown-eyed Rachel's green Voight Kampff eye. No daring, too little stress in Gossling's character and not enough vixen in Robin Wright's. No one tried to pull off a scene stealing performance like Rutger Hauer's or Hy Pike's.As for cinematography, the look was often muted, which made the scenes feel longer than they should. Otherwise, it was a spectacle unto itself. It might have been the theater's projector, but the dynamic range seemed too narrow.As for the story line, it seemed very much like a logical progression from the original. The dialog was engaging, and it left questions unanswered for another sequel.Bottom Line: a sure bet but not enough risk taking to be great.",6,4,8,9 October 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Blazing Borat
","While not at the side splitting-level of Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, Borat clearly delivers as the best laugh-per-production-dollar movie in the history of bathroom humor. It is a nice combination of literally in-your-face slapstick and sidebar sight gags that can send you back for a second look. Mr. Cohen is excellent as a Hebrew-speaking Jew hater, but it is really the supporting cast that turns every lesser joke into a gut-busting wedgie. While never an academy award winning performance, every supporting role begs the question 'are they real or central casting'? I still have no clue.One role, Miss Pamela Anderson's, was clearly her best movie performance. I suggest everyone go to the theaters to see this. Part of the film's experience is feeling the tension build in the audience as Borat sets up a joke that could easily start wars in thin-skin parts of the world.",10,3,15,5 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," waste of money
","'Clueless meets Barry Lyndon' with neither the wit of Alicia Silverstone nor the cinematography of Stanley Kubric.Marie Antoinette is an unsuccessful mix of contemporary music, plain language, amateurish cinematic directing, and very poor editing. While well photographed and properly acted, the combination of painfully long shots and banal dialogue made for a two hour movie that seemed to run four hours. Some scenes such as the carriage ride to France, shots of Versailles, and many of Kristin reminded me of watching paint dry. Other shots looked like home movies with pans that went nowhere and added nothing to the narrative. If this had been an Indy film, it may have been excusable as a good first effort. However, this was a major release with minor efforts in many key areas  a waste of money both in the studio and at the box office.Lastly, the movie kept all the visceral aspects of the French Revolution far from the audience just at the French government kept it from the royal couple. Unfortunately, it did not translate into viewer empathy for either Ms. Dunst, who was hardly convincing as a 14-year old, or Mr. Schwartzman, a clear candidate for the role of Nero in a G-rated remake of Caligula.Sofia needs to take some more lessons from her dad in the art of making a major release.",1,30,57,22 October 2006
Thor: Ragnarok," Comic Book on Film
","I know, both 'Comic Book' and 'Film' seem out of date, but this movie may be the index case for the 21st century version of merging both. Ragnarok seemed to capture the cocky adolescence of traditional comic books while delivering the big screen visuals one expects from a theater film. The acting was slightly better than most superhero films, too. Benedict Cumberbatch's Dr. Strange cameo was well done. Chris Hemsworth was much funnier than in Ghostbusters. Even Kate Blanchett's character showed some texture and pathos in spite of her limited appearances. Humor was well placed, and special effects were first class. The music and sound effects were both better orchestrated and less intrusive that usual.On the unseemly side, Anthony Hopkins did seem to phone in his limited role, Mark Ruffalo seemed to have been dragged into his role, and Karl Urban seemed underused. As for the plot, this is a comic book story.BTW, stay for all the credits.",8,13,23,7 November 2017
Oblivion," When the Telling is better than the Sotry
","Sometimes, it is impossible to separate the story from the storyteller. When that happens, suspension of disbelief is easy, and the art becomes a part of life. This is rare. Often the great story is told and the teller succeeds by bringing it to the fore and staying out of the way.A movie is a great story teller, but often the medium eclipses the message. This is clearly one that does. The polish of the production almost blinded me from the view of the movie. Great FX, immense star power, and an excellent score left whatever was the point of the movie on the cutting floor. An escape? Yes. However, as the plot developed, the lack of character pathos and reliance on amazing vistas let my mind wander. Any time the story gives you time to think, it is usually a bad thing.Tom Cruise was excellent, as usual. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman, complemented the star well. But the story never dared to go anywhere you might not have guessed, and the ending was predictable in a way that did not make me feel perceptive.Have you ever met a person who was so meticulous, so well groomed, proper and predictable that you wondered if he/she was real? No? Then see Oblivion.",5,4,6,20 April 2013
Baby Driver," Deja Vu
","Imagine it is 1987, and you are a budding teenage screenwriter/director. You wake up in the middle of the night with a great idea for a script about a young man with a Sony Walkman and hearing problem who can drive a car like Ryan O'Neal in The Driver. Your guy is younger and more innocent, and you picture Brad Pitt, who you have been watching on TV's Dallas, as your star.Along side Brad, you see Jennifer Jason Leigh, after seeing her in The Hitcher and Sister, Sister. She is the young heroine, a waitress. For the sinister mastermind, you envision Gene Hackman. And for the heavy, ruthless hard-ass, you picture Samuel L. Jackson, fresh from Spenser: For Hire. Throw in Mel Gibson as another heavy and a cocky ingenue Marisa Tomei (from the World Turns) as his moll. Finally, you add a soundtrack with work from Paul Simon, James Brown, Dave Brubeck, The Commodores, Isaac Hayes, Barry White, Queen, The Beach Boys, Randy Newman, Quincy Jones, Ike and Tina Turner, The Allman Brothers Band, Aretha Franklin, Phil Collins, Kiss, and a whole bunch of newbies.You call it 'Baby Driver' and hitchhike to the studios in Hollywood, who are impressed by your juvenile spunk and love the idea but cannot see the casting. 'Brad what?' 'Gene is doing another Superman.' 'Samuel L. who?' 'Marisa Tommy?!?!?' 'You will never get Mel in a supporting role.' 'What is all that music 'mixing' about?' 'Go home and grow up!' You are discouraged and set your script on your shelf. However, you never give up.Thirty years later, you dust it off and get Ansel to do Brad's role and Lily to do Jennifer's. Instead of Gene, you get Kevin Spacey. For Mr. Jackson's role, you recruit Jamie Foxx. Finally, you pull in John Hamm and Elza Gonzalez to fit Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei's roles.You keep your soundtrack intact, including the newbies who are no longer new, and add newer newbies, too.Done.",10,1,4,10 July 2017
2012," Oversold with a TV Ending
","Marketing WAY oversold this disaster flick, promising to deliver an 'end-of the world' scenario and delivering a very lame ending. The movie starts out slower than I expected, with a lot of TV-level family 'drama' and 'character development.' The action does not begin until 30 minutes into the film, after trying to explain way too much! I had entered the theater with my disbelief suspended, and they spend overtime creating doubts. Everyone knows that the more 'facts' you throw at the audience, the more thinking that goes on instead of watching. It was like sitting through an engineering report before riding the Six Flags Riddler's Revenge. This was unnecessary and made the movie too long.Once the real show started, the special effects were worthy of the best Disney rides. Things came apart nicely, and there was just enough detail to give you that 'bodies flying out the windows' realism. The airplane perspective was understandable and not implausible enough to be a distraction. However, seeing LA, Las Vegas, and Yellowstone get bashed to bits was not enough. Other venues such as Hawaii were mere glowing glimpses (though the White House wipe-out was pretty good). There are too many 'quiet moments' in-between that were like going to the bathroom between rounds of a fight. Finally, the ending started out pretty strong, if not a bit corny, then went 'happily ever after' in the most ridiculous biblical way. It was a deal killer to have the engineering 'part one' explain how the world was going to end in ways that Armageddon would envy, then get us to believe the deck-o-continents was shuffled and re-dealt in less time than it takes to get through the NBA playoffs.Good bits were (1) China saves the day (2) Woody Harrelson goes out in great style (3) there is no mention of terrorists or global warming.Acting is OK. John Cusak gives a journeyman performance that was everything you might expect for a disaster film. However, he was on screen much too long, as were many others. Amanda Peet was acceptable as the ex-wife but offered no value-add. Danny Glover looked shell shocked as the President but did not linger long enough to make it a problem. Thandie Newton was passable as the President's daughter but lacked the charm of her other works such as the Chronicles of Riddick. Oliver Platt was OK as the cold bureaucrat but nowhere up to his West Wing performances. And Chiwetel Ejiofor was passable as the 'do-gooder PhD that cannot figure out the obvious until it is too late but still gets the girl' guy.Bottom line, get into the moving 20 minutes late, plan for a popcorn break after Vegas goes, and leave just after the waters crash over Tibet. Or wait will the DVD comes and skip those parts.Oh, the sound mixing was excellent. Post production made everything seamless with the minor exception of the backdrop of Cusak and Harrelson as Yellowstone went up (those flares were a tiny bit off). No sex, little blood (a few wounds), fleeting expletives were few and hard to catch, and no political statements.",3,3,6,14 November 2009
Ex Machina," Well done, but . ..
",". . . somewhat derivative. Aside from some scenic views that might be from Montana's Glacier National Park, the entire film could have been a stage play. Caleb is a young Bill Gates type minus the bravado. Nathan could have been better played by Zach Galifianakis. And Ava is a female Sonny (I, Robot) with better make-up but less panache.The Turing Test is the tiny bit of technical grounding for this story of seduction and survival. In reality, the test is really about how easily people can be fooled rather than how clever software can be. Each time the Turing test is run in the real world, they use humans as control along with software, and many of the humans are thought to be machines, too. This movie could have used such irony to create a much greater effect.Like 'I, Robot', Ex Machina's suspension of disbelief is compromised by having Ava act and move so gracefully. If any machine could move so effortlessly, its inventor would win the Nobel Prize, even it the machine could not speak. The other compromise was the use of card keys, a technology older than every character in the film. It seemed poorly contrived.As for the drama, there is no chemistry between Caleb and Ava, and Nathan lacks a certain edginess that Zach naturally brings to his characters. It could have brought Caleb and Ava together more convincingly.I gave it a 7 for its premise, production qualities, and the ending, which was nicely done in spite of another suspension of disbelief compromise. Personally, it could have been awesome as a computer-animated fantasy film, a'la Beowulf 2007. Regardless, I would say that it is worth a Matinée for sure (pun intended for Unreal Tournament 2004 fans).",7,1,3,26 April 2015
Inception," This is not my idea
","Normally, I never review movies, as I feel most reviews are written either by shills or psychos, of which I am neither. However, this movie planted an idea in my head that it was a really great movie. It was like a dream, and since its inception I have been compelled to write something wonderful about it. I find this to be fascinating, since my memory of the movie was that of a Vanilla Sky / Dark City swirl as one might see by flushing both down a drain, which I have also been compelled to do but have thus far resisted.You ask, 'but what does this mean?' I answer, 'if you must seek out the meaning, then you have missed the point.' I feel compelled to give this answer as I feel compelled to relive memories of my dear dead wife, who is actually very much alive and sat next to me in the IMAX theater, protecting her ears from the 12,000 watts of audio this movie cranked out with impunity.That is my review, hardly one of either a shill or a psycho, as I have told you nothing about the movie, except, perhaps, how compelled I was to write about it. I gave the movie a 50, because I neither endorse or deride it. However, I do feel compelled to say it was the single greatest work of art since the Creation, but that is just my idea and, for the life of me, do not know where I got it.",5,0,5,25 July 2010
