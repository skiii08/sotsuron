Catch Me If You Can," What a funny film!
","This movie has good acting, a good story, and several good laughs.  The laughs were unexpected and quite enjoyed by the audience and me.  True stories are rarely as interesting or as funny as this one.  Leonardo di Capprio shows once again his versatility and selectivity in choosing movies for their script and for furthering his career.  Tom Hanks also plays the serious roles as well as the funny ones (e.g., Forrest Gump).  This is one of the better films to come out in December, 2002.",10,0,1,2 January 2003
Billy Elliot," Billy Elliot is great!
","Billy Elliot was even better the second time in the privacy of my home. Although the under-educated family frequently use four-letter words, Billy is able to get away from the possibility of coal mining to find 'electricity' through his hobby of dancing which is fulfilled when he is given the opportunity to study ballet at the Royal College of Ballet in London.  I was exhilarated by seeing the movie on DVD.  It is a truly grand motion picture.",10,0,0,9 May 2001
North by Northwest," North by Northwest (1959)
",One of the greatest movies ever made.  I thrill to seeing it each time. You can't fail to be impressed by the craft used in making this movie. Great acting all around.,10,0,1,9 May 2001
The Patriot," One of the best action films of 2000.
","The Patriot is well-acted, especially by Mel Gibson, who carries the movie all the way, from the beginning to the end.  The supporting roles are well-filled and well-acted.  All in all, this was one of the best films of 2000.",10,0,2,24 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor was great!
","I enjoyed Pearl Harbor and recommend it to anyone interested in what really happened December 7, 1941.  The acting was very good.  This was ensemble acting.  The photography was beautiful and horrifying at the same time.  The movie tells a story not unlike September 11, 2001.  It is difficult to understand why 'critics' failed to appreciate this movie as I loved it. Compared with other films of 2001, this was one of the more outstanding ones.",10,5,11,21 February 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan was enthralling.
",Saving Private Ryan is one of the finest movies every made.  The richly wrought characterizations were very deftly done.  These were real men who had genuine fear of being hurt or killed.  The acting was flawless on the part of the principals and the many supporting roles as well.  A friend of mine saw the film ten times in the theater.  I went out to buy the laser disc as soon as it came out.  That was when laser disc cost $40 for a new movie.  Now one can purchase a DVD movie for about half that price in the discount stores.Saving Private Ryan is THE classic war movie of all time.,10,1,2,21 February 2002
