Iron Man 3," Save your money!!! Unless you like watching dribble.
","This film takes all the bad things of the previous films and makes them even badder in this film. All the good 'adult' tension of Iron Man 1 and bins it.Throw in an annoying kid for good measure invent some ridiculous technology to base your stupidly glossy cpu effects on. Then add a unthoughtful and unimaginative script. Viola!!! you have just made Iron Man 3!!! This film is for braindead viewers or families with youngsters who have not developed their little brains yet to understand how crap this film really is.Zero for any normal teenage/adult to relate to. Nothing in this film is based on reality. The action is very minimal too its mainly just lame dialog trying to push up the tension meter, yet fails terribly. In fact the cheesy clichÃ© script destroys the tension. The director must be high or just too use to the good life of Hollywood to notice how bad their work performance is.If this film makes a profit at the box office it will be a tragedy. Downy JR should have refused it, even his acting was bland and predictable.Iron man 1 was and is the best the rest just keep getting more lame just like the Jaws series etc. If you have the time and money to waste plus loads of vallium maybe this film is for you.",1,24,50,28 April 2013
Finding Neverland," Never Find This Film!
","Never watch this dribble!If you like Peter pan, you will not like this film.If you like Johnny Depp, you will not like this film.If you like true stories, you will not like this film.This film is for dumb, inexperienced humans with only mainstream educations to endorse their mediocre existence. Everyone else will be thinking... what the..? Followed by, how to turn it off forever.Personally I would rather die than watch this again.Take care everyone, Peace out.",1,3,14,4 May 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Action Overdose
","OK this film is worth watching, however the older you are the more you will be put off by the quantity of action in it.Everyone managed to have at least one worthy performance. Although some of the better actors managed to perform well throughout the entire film.For me the disappointment was with Bruce Willis and the quiet Chinese guy. They were the most unconvincing performances.Like bad roller coaster rides, the kind that do more than just excite/thrill you, by the end of the ride you feel sick and never want to go on it again. This also describes this film's viewing experience.If only they could beef up the script, tone down the action, stop putting in, so called 'cash magnet' actors like Bruce Willis, (that really should retire.) Add some depth along with a more sophisticated soundtrack. They would have made a one-to-remember type film.I normally do not like 'the Rock' however in this film he does one of his best and believable performances! I really liked Vin Petrol too, he was awesome in this film and I wish he would act in more credible titles. The guy that plays the baddie is very good, once again proving he is around to stay.Anyway all in all a good movie, one that requires zero brain power to process, yet not quite boring enough to send you to sleep half way through.Summary A cliché feel good action flick.Questions... Is it worth cinema viewing? - No; Is it worth buying? - No! Therefore wait until it is on the TV or hire it out when there are no more 'Big Titles' left to watch. ;)",7,3,5,7 July 2013
The Purge," So close to being a good movie!
","I really liked the idea, for me I could actually imagine it being a possible reality too. This gave me even more of an interest in wanting see the movie.However now that I have seen it, I am very disappointed. Even the ending I was able to predict as soon as the cookies were given.One obvious issue was the fact that people can just go on holiday during the purge, if they do not want to be a part of it.That is just one of the many obvious problems I found in the movie.To fix the holiday issue; they could have just made the whole world ruled by one government/leader who makes the purge a global reality.The scope of my version would have been in the league of Hannible/ben-hur. However, instead of being a mega blockbuster: the real movie ends up being at a 'B' movie standard by the end.Some of the performances are worth seeing and will make the actors seem more suitable for different role types in the future.The first 20mins were really good and so thats what my '4/10' rating is for. Worth seeing a bit of it to understand the idea. Although not worth spending the entire length of the film to watch it all.",4,1,3,29 June 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," Awesome Amazing A Must See!!! :D
","This film is the text-book example for what makes great action/thriller movies.Great acting on all counts by everyone.Brilliant cinematography, convincing and perfectly executed script.Screenplay completely flowed through scene after scene.Sound/music was also perfect. The style, fashion, gadgets and tools in the movie added a certain flare to the viewers experience.Plot/story was simple and yet had incredible depth.Length was perfect too. There was not one thing that could be improved in my opinion. I just wish the movie had left a chance to provide fans with a sequel.This film is a MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE! type deal ;D",10,1,3,6 May 2013
