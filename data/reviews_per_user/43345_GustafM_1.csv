Resident Evil: Afterlife," Should have been so much more.
","With a good concept, decent actors and a strong budget, I had expected more. The action is great, even if the slow-mo is a bit excessive at times. The problem is what happens between the action, or rather, the lack of anything happening between the action.This movie is just a series of action cutscenes edited together into some sort of a movie, but there is no storytelling going on at all. It feels like the director couldn't be bothered doing anything but the action scenes. There is nothing smart, no suspense and no thrill. Just action that looks like its copied straight from 'The Matrix', but without the finesse, and that leaves you feeling indifferent and unimpressed.This movie suffers from the usual sequel virus, symptoms are less smarts, less story, less atmosphere and more CGI to compensate. It's unnecessary, lazy and insulting to the fans that the Resident Evil Franchise does not try to keep a higher level of quality, especially when they have the actors and the money to do something really good.Final verdict is that the movie is 'ok' for a Resident Evil fan, but even for a fan this is pushing the lower quality limit. Personally I hope they get another director for the next movie, like Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott, imagine that.",4,1,3,6 October 2010
