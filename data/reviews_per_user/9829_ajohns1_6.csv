Scarface," A movie that will show you what drugs can do to you.
","this movie was excellent as a matter of fact this is my all time favorite movie Al Pacino my favorite actor with a Cuban accent, doing drugs, killing people its just something I didn't imagine him doing since i had started seeing his latest movies instead of started from the beginning.",8,0,1,16 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," The two stories are very impressive
",I like this just as much as the first. This has two stories although call me crazy but I like the young Vito corleone story (De Niro) much better than Michael's story. I think I prefer because I like how he acts as Vito his academy award winning performance for best supporting actor was well deserved the way he talks to people even when their superior to him how calm he is he was perfect for the part. I also like young clamenza (Kurby) he made me laugh on how loud and obnoxious he was.,10,0,1,12 August 2002
A Clockwork Orange," A Clockwork Orange???????
",This was an excellent movie very violent and a couple of rape scenes and being betrayed by his friend's even though he deserved it and the ending was really good too. But still I dont really know why it was even named a Clockwork Orange.    10/10,9,0,0,1 June 2002
There Will Be Blood," An Outstanding Picture
",This is a crowning achievement. Some of the greatest performances you will ever see in your life. Daniel Day-Lewis is an outstanding actor who really throws himself into anything that he's a part of. He is truly 'the rug that tied the room together' in this film. The early 1900's in this film looks great thanks to some wonderful cinematography and art direction as well as original score. I'm surprised this did not win best picture or at least best director for PTA. Daniel Day-Lewis's Character shows no remorse and Paul Dano Character's will certainly hold your attention as the young priest who is quite greedy and is a constant pain in Day-Lewis's neck. I can't forget about Dillon Freasier who played Day-Lewis son HW. He certainly held his own with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. This is undoubtedly my favorite film of all time.,10,2,4,1 May 2011
Back to the Future Part II," cool hoverboard!!!!!
",This is a great follow up to the first one wich is as good as this one cause the movie has lots and lots of cool future stuff. If marty does one thing he has to do another it's really interesting and the best thing is there's allways something happening and you wont be able to lose interest the only bad thing is at the end when they give like a complete preview of the third one which I found to be the worst in the series this movie gets a 10/10 for its ability to captivate you through out the entire movie and the (cool hoverboard).,10,1,2,4 January 2003
Blow," Johnny Depp Is in top form in this excelent Movie
","This movie reminds me of Goodfellas but it's not a cheap immaitaton cause the star of Goodfellas happens to be in this movie (with A good performance I might add mister Liota) And because this movie is basicly about drugs. I like it because of Depp he is the best part about it Paul Reubens is fun to see in this movie because it makes me laugh. Pee-Wee with a big bag of grass on his lap. The worst thing about this movie is penelopy Cruz She is the most anoying caracter in the entire movie. Ethan Suplee's part is pretty good as George's friend (tuna). The story's good to watch you'll always be hopping to find out what's next I give it a 10/10 good Job by Demme, Depp and the rest of the cast ACCEPT Cruz.",8,0,1,6 February 2003
