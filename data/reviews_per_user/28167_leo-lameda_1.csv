Resident Evil: Afterlife," RE Afterlife rocks in 3D!
","I was lucky I was invited to the premiere in 3D and boy I loved it!! The whole movie is full of very fast action sequences which are largely enhanced by the 3D feature. In terms of the storyline, it keeps moving further away from the video game series but that is not a problem, both are similar stories and many people are fans of both the films and the video-games. Mila J. rocks as Alice (as usual ;) and the other characters are awesome (specially Ali Larter as Claire and the guy from Prison Break as Chris). There are way more zombies but less zombie-action but that doesn't mean the survivors weren't busy...Wesker looks and acts a lot like his video game self, so that is a plus for the gamers who go see it. Now, here is the important bit of this review: If you haven't seen the other three films, do yourself a favor and watch'em before watching this one; otherwise you'll be lost from the first action sequence up to half the movie at least... And be polite and read the credits. You'll be rewarded!!",9,13,28,12 September 2010
