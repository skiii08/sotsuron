Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I love this movie!!!
","I love this movie!!!  I watched this movie twice in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.  I didn't feel bored at all.  All fantastic technics of CG kept me attracted and impressed while I was watching the movie.  Ewan McGregor is so cool and now I really like this actor.  I was also impressed by the beautiful costumes and hair styles of actors and actresses in this movie. They reminded me of something very Asian.  I wanna watch this movie again!!!",8,0,0,30 June 1999

",I watched this movie last night and I confirmed my idea that this movie was worth watching over and over!!!  Aliens are scary enough to attract audience!  They kept me terrified until the movie finished.  I like Hicks. He's cool.,10,0,0,24 December 1999
Mission: Impossible II," This movie is amazing.
","I like this movie.  Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and he's good in it, though he looks sexier in the previous.  Anthony Hopkins is more attractive than Tom Cruise in a way.  I was impressed by the intelligence The British English he spoke.  He just sounds like such a sophiscated person.(Actually he is)  Not all British people are able of it apparently.  Are you?  Are people going to make the next one?  If they are, I'd be glad to watch it.  I can't help it.  Every major essence of this movie is so amazing.",8,1,2,8 August 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," I love this movie!!!
","This is the best movie I've ever seen.  After watching this movie, I thought a lot about life, friendship, love and compassion.  I tried to figure out what made life wonderful.  I was not so interetsed in this movie, but my favorite actor, I knew that Chris O'donnell referred to this movie as his favorite one.  Now I want to count this great movie as the favorite one, too.  Life is absolutely wonderful.",10,1,4,20 May 1999
