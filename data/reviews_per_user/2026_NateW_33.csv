Walk the Line," Excellent biopic with good music to boot
","Following a recent boom in musician inspired bio films, Walk the Line examines the early and often tumultuous years in the life of Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix is virtually guaranteed another Oscar nod for his portrayal of the Man in Black, at turns withdrawn and viciously out of control. Reese Witherspoon gives a likewise performance as the love of Cash's life, June Carter. Both stars provide the in-film vocals for their real life counterparts with remarkable results. Where Walk the Line is most successful is its accomplishment in making Cash's evolution enjoyable while not neglecting the music he made along the way. Other real life musicians of the era make 'cameos', but there's never any doubt that this is the Man in Black's film. Walk the Line is a definite Oscar worthy contender that will be hard to overlook in several categories come ballot time. If you like just one song from his legendary catalog, you'll love this film.",9,0,1,30 December 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," An action film for the ages
","Action films don't get any better than this. You have Harrison Ford as the ultimate action hero Indiana Jones in his greatest role battling the epitome of evil, the Nazis. You have the most internationally popular director of all time in rare form.  There's stunt after breathtaking stunt and each action sequence surpasses the last, not to mention the awesome opening sequence most movies would consider a climax. What more could you want? A memorable music theme? That's here too, supplied by the greatest film score composer ever, John Williams. I've seen this film no less than 30 times and it never gets old. It truly is an action film for the ages.",10,0,0,29 October 2001
Minority Report," A top notch 2002 standout
","War epics and comedy capers are nice, but this is what Mr. Spielberg does best. Minority Report is the kind of adrenaline rush non stop entertainment that recalls the days of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. It's no wonder that most critics had this on their 10 best lists last year. Tom Cruise gives his best performance since Jerry Maguire and proves he still has some action left in him. He really holds the picture together among the frantic action sequences and surprising plot twists. As for the ethical questions raised in the film, I'll leave those to self-righteous pundits to discuss. That said, Minority Report is truly one of 2002's best.",9,0,0,6 May 2003
Friday Night Lights," Captures the essence of what sports should be about
","Having played football all four years of high school, I didn't find it hard to appreciate the spirit of Friday Night Lights. Although my team never competed on the level shown in the movie, the atmosphere and emotions of playing on Friday nights is a universal feeling for all those who suit up for their alma maters. High school is the purest level of athletic competition there is in the United States. Here, the players still play because they love the sport and the thrill of victory. Friday Nigh Lights does an admirable job of projecting that raw passion and determination and making it utterly believable. Whether you were an all-state superstar or have never even watched a down of football, everyone should appreciate the aura of the big game and the impact that football has on the lives of these young men. I recommend Friday Night Lights not only as a good sports movie, but a fascinating and heartfelt look at the American dream and what it takes to be the best.",Null,0,1,20 February 2005
The Big Lebowski," Wild and crazy fun with 'The Dude'
","You've got to hand it to the Coen brothers. They certainly know how to push the right buttons at the right times when it comes to off color comedy. Following on the heals of the acclaimed hit Fargo, The Big Lebowski is cut from the same irreverent mold as its predecessor. It concerns the adventures of 'The Dude', an incredibly lazy hippie bowler with no aspirations who just can't stay out of trouble. As with all Coen films, the performances and writing are first rate, especially Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' and John Goodman as his violently unstable bowling partner. The humor is definitely not for everybody, but the people who don't like it will probably steer clear anyway. I'll just say you'll probably find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons. I think we could all learn something from 'The Dude'  I learned that I really dig this movie and now I want to check out the other works in the Coen brothers' impressive catalog. 9/10",9,1,2,31 March 2004
Fight Club," Mind blowing
","Fight Club is one of those few movies that joyously defies description. At once it is repugnantly violent and compulsively watchable. It switches from pitch black humor to stomach turning mayhem in the blink of an eye. Fight Club cannot easily be classified into one specific genre without a great amount of debate. One thing that can be agreed on is that this piece of film-making is utterly thought provoking and fascinating. The filmmakers are to be commended for taking the very complex novel by Chuck Palahniuk and transforming it into big screen material while maintaining the heart of its chaos and message. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are great together and it is evident that they embraced the spirit of their characters. Their on-screen chemistry is something to behold. When the twist of the story is revealed, don't be surprised if your jaw hits the floor. I know mine did. Rarely have I so enjoyed being totally blown away by a film's ending as I was with Fight Club. It's bold, gritty, unflinching, and unnerving if you let yourself get caught up in all the anarchy. This film is definitely not for the squeamish, but it's not hard to see why it's so well liked by those who can take it.",9,1,3,22 October 2004
Citizen Kane," An influential and important cinematic landmark
","Anyone who considers themself a film buff has undoubtedly viewed Citizen Kane at least once or certainly heard of it. It is simply one of the most lauded and recognizable films ever made in any language. It tops many alltime greatest films lists, including that by the American Film Institute. It is a required piece of viewing in any beginning film school. It's filming techniques and cinematography redefined the way films are made. It contains one of the most famous characters in cinema history, and the character isn't even human! These and many other points help to distinguish Citizen Kane as a true classic, but the real value of it comes from who made it.Orson Welles, at the age of 26, wrote, directed, and starred in this monumental film. Showing extrordinary talent in each regard, he solidifed his place in the annals of filmlore. He was a magician with a movie camera, and using it he created many images that were considered impossible to film at the time this was made. Although impressive, the camerawork never overshadows the story, which centers around the life of powerful media mogul Charles Foster Kane, a not so subtle takeoff of William Randolph Hearst. The supporting cast is great in telling the life story of Kane, but Welles and his camera are the real stars.Citizen Kane can be viewed as THE art film, but it has entertainment value as well. Each viewing presents something new and and innovative, and it is certainly watchable more than once. That is what makes Citizen Kane the great film it is.",10,1,3,8 October 2001
Dawn of the Dead," A spirited and worthwhile remake
","It may have little in common with its classic predecessor, but this new retelling of George Romero's apocalyptic horror film still has alot to offer. Fans of the genre will not be disappointed, as there is still plenty of blood and gruesome deaths to go around. There's also plenty of claustrophobic chills and suspense that might make you jump out of your seat once or twice. What I liked most about it was that it managed to maintain the humorous spirit of the first Dawn that made it such a dead-on satire of modern society. Those who put it down because it doesn't match up to the original are selling it short. I enjoyed it and it really makes me want to watch the original again to catch things I may have missed the first few times. 8/10",8,0,1,31 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Exactly what action entertainment should be
","There is a large group of candidates, but Pirates of the Caribbean gets the vote for my favorite movie of the year thus far. I love everything about it and it still entertains me after more than half a dozen viewings. There's incredible swashbuckling action, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, and delightful performances all around. The star of the show is the always reliable Johnny Depp, who turns in a career best performance as the seedy but lovable Jack Sparrow. He takes turns chewing scenery with Geoffrey Rush, who is perfectly over-the-top as Captain Barbosa. The supporting cast is great as well, but Depp and Rush leave them in the dust. If you haven't seen PotC yet, do so. It's the most fun you'll have from a single movie this year, and probably many years for that matter.",8,0,1,24 October 2003
The Godfather: Part II," My personal favorite of the trilogy
","Although I feel The Godfather is the better movie (only slightly, I might add), I actually prefer this to the original. Not only is this the greatest sequel ever, but one of the greatest movies ever. The Godfather II is more entertaining and more compelling in my opinion. What really makes this great however are the parallel story lines following Michael Corleone and a young Vito Corleone, played flawlessly by Robert DeNiro. As with the first Godfather, the ensemble acting is superb, especially from Pacino and the aforementioned DeNiro. This is simply put about as good as movie entertainment gets. 10/10",10,1,1,17 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An epic worthy of it's hype
","The long awaited live action adaption of the classic Tolkein novel Lord of the Rings more than justified the massive hype surrounding it. Simply put, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have not been so utterly blown away by a film in a long time like I was when I saw this. Every, and I mean every, aspect of this film is executed flawlessly. The ensemble performances are truly fantastic, especially by Wood and McKellan. All I can say is I can't wait for it to be released on DVD and I can't wait for The Two Towers and Return of the King to come to theatrical release. I think we have finally seen the arrival of a trilogy that matches the magnitude of the original Star Wars trilogy. 10/10",10,3,3,2 July 2002
Duck Soup," One of the greatest comedies ever
","This is as good as movies get. Definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and definitely the Marx Brothers best film. The boys are in rare form and create some of the most memorable comedy sequences ever. Never before has so much humor been crammed into such a short time frame (the movie is slightly longer than an hour). Every Marx Brother is hilarious; even Zeppo gets a few laughs. Any fan of comedies MUST see this film. 10/10",10,0,0,7 June 2001
Jarhead," Breaking the modern war movie mold
","When it was released in 1998, Saving Private Ryan immediately established a new trend for future war movies. The quick, relatively painless deaths portrayed in older, more conventional war movies were replaced by brutal, incredibly graphic ones and battle scenes were more realistically laid out on screen. Then again, most of these movies centered around the casualty-ridden battles of older wars like WWII and Vietnam. In Jarhead, we get to see another side of human conflict; the minimal combat modern-day political war. The first Persian Gulf War, the focus of Jarhead, lasted less than 100 days and produced less than 200 American casualties, many of which were caused by friendly fire. For many troops who were deployed to the sands of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, there was no war. What do you do when you're sent to war and there's no war to fight? When you're trained to be a killer, what do you do when there's no enemy to kill? Jarhead examines these questions frankly, engrossingly, and memorably. The plight of Marines struggling to contain their boredom and insanity while an international conflict is raging on their doorstep is all too evident and real. It's a startling contrast to the loud, frantic ambushes of violence of other 'modern' war movies in the mold of Saving Private Ryan. While Jarhead doesn't completely rationalize the questions posed, it's impossible to rationalize something as devastating as war. When all is said and done, it's a riveting look at another side of war that for the most part had been left unobserved. The images and words spoken by the movie's servicemen convey that sense of the unknown that only the field of battle can produce. In a small way, the audience will leave Jarhead feeling like they themselves have been to war.",9,0,1,30 December 2005
Collateral," Another first rate effort from an underrated master
","Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max. The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clichéd action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride. It's truly one of the year's best.",9,0,0,28 December 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Better than average summer action flick
","Reading some of the reviews posted on the site, it seems some people were expecting too much from this movie. I went to see this expecting good race and action scenes and not much else, and it delivered. I didn't go in expecting Academy Award material, and anyone who saw the previews should've done the same. I thought some of the acting left something to be desired, but it was adequate for the movie. The action sequences were definitely the highlight of the movie, especially the street racing scenes. I didn't mind the plot holes or the paint-by-numbers romance side plot, I wanted action and I got it. I liked it so much I saw it again a few days later. Lighten up and take this movie for what it is.",7,1,1,20 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," An amazing film experience
","This is without a doubt one of the best war films ever made, and how the hell Shakespeare in Love won Best Picture over this is beyond me.The opening scene on Normandy is definitely the most realistic battle scene ever captured on film. The gut wrenching effects and the horror in the faces of the soliders are endearing images in my mind that I'll never forget.How some people can say the performances are weak is absurd. Tom Hanks gives one of his best, as with Ed Burns. I've also heard complaints that the movie falls apart after the opening scene, with which I disagree. The plot develops nicely and it did enough to keep my attention until the the battle at the end in the abandoned city, another very realistic and well done scene.I give SPR 10/10. If you aren't affected emotionally by this film, you're probably dead.",10,0,0,7 July 1999
28 Days Later...," Excellent, intense look at zombies and human nature
","28 Days Later definitely lives up to its reputation as an effective horror film. From the start, it establishes an atmosphere of gloom and chaos that never lets up. What I found very interesting about it was its portrayal of human instincts and evils that we all can possess in our darkest hours. This was not the kind of zombie film I was expecting, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. If you can get past the look of the movie, it is one hell of a ride. Overall, this is the best horror film I've seen in years.",8,0,1,24 October 2003
Driven," Better than it's reputation
","This was panned by a lot of critics and many viewers, mostly because of the love story and the fact that Sylvester Stallone is in it. I think this movie got a bad rap. The love story is rather predictable, but there are many exciting and realistic crash scenes that make up for it. Other than the crash scenes, the overall race sequences are fun to watch. I found it a good racing movie with good performances (yes, even from Stallone). 8/10",8,0,2,20 June 2001
The Dark Knight," An unexpected masterpiece that will be remembered long after its counterparts have been forgotten
","Who knew that the best movie of the year and perhaps the biggest cinematic event in a decade could come from the same franchise that once saw George Clooney in a nipple suit? I had pretty high expectations for The Dark Knight after months of hype and anticipation, and not just because of the unfortunate and untimely death of Heath Ledger. As many of my esteemed fellow movie-goers have already stated, the end result was head and shoulders above the considerable buzz surrounding it and is on its way to setting box office records that may not be approached for a long time. Is it possible that a comic book movie can excel as film-making in such an overwhelming fashion that it is actually considered a front runner for...gasp!...Best Picture at the Oscars? I say yes, and if there is justice in this world, it will happen. Even as out-of-touch and elitist as members of the Academy usually are, even they would be hard pressed to overlook the staggering achievement that is The Dark Knight. To call it a comic book movie is an insult to everyone involved; can we really put this in the same class as Fantastic Four or Catwoman? How many other comic book movies have so perfectly mixed action and human drama? Spider-Man 2 comes close, but even it pales in the shadow of TDK. For once, the hype can be believed. If anything, it is insufficient. This could very well stand as one of the definitive films of our generation, and it doesn't take a superhero to see that.",10,4,9,29 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," A totally unique cinema experience
","Over the years 2001 has gained a lofty position as one of the best and most influential sci-fi films ever made. While it is certainly a well made and unique film, it's an acquired taste that will take multiple viewings to appreciate. Many people see it as a mind boggling one-of-a-kind movie that remains among the best American films, others see it as a boring, confusing ego trip on the part of Kubrick. Seeing as how Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors, I has grown accustomed to his directorial style. I feel that Kubrick made this film the way he did to convey the empty, vast feeling of space with long sustained periods of slow moving objects and silence. 2001 is definitely not a film for casual viewing. Although it is rather slow moving, you really need to watch every second of this film to soak in the environment and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. It is far ahead of it's time in content and effects, but the effects do not replace plot as is the case of most adventure movies churned out today at a regular pace.  He really leaves the film open to induvidual interpretation, which is something all great films should do. I gave up several times on 2001 before I finally saw it all the way through. After two viewings, I now feel that it is indeed one of the great sci-fi films and it is not for all viewers. Once you have seen it all the way through, you will probably never see sci-fi films the same way again.",10,2,5,1 July 2002
The Mummy Returns," Better than the original
","Usually I consider sequels to be inferior to their original predecessors, but I must say that I found this to be better than the first Mummy. There is a greater amount of action, romance, and all around entertainment, although it was very hokey in some spots. There is also room for humor, which the original lacked. All around the performances were good, and I can see why the Rock had only one speaking line. Fans of the first Mummy should definitely like this installment.",7,0,0,5 July 2001
Pulp Fiction," A wild ride worth taking
","After many years of putting it off, I finally rented Pulp Fiction at the recommendation of several friends and watched it. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. It is truly one of the more original films out there, not to mention possibly the most influential film of the 90's. The all star cast, Trevolta and Jackson especially, delivers memorable performances and memorable lines while crossing paths in wild fashion. Pulp Fiction established Quentin Tarentino as a major force in Hollywood, and it still stands as his best work. Pulp Fiction, for many reasons, is indeed a wild ride worth taking. 9/10",9,1,2,31 August 2002
The Departed," Far from departed for America's modern movie master
","For over two decades, Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street-wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible. With Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino, Scorsese molded ugly, violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget. After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the man most people (myseslf included) to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed. Simply put, it's the best film of 2006, if not the last several years. From the first words, there's no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can. Obscenely crackling dialogue, in-your-face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr. Scorsese. It's funny, it's startling, and it's spectacular. How good is it? This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should've gotten a few times by now. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens, but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film-making from a director who has made a living out of creating them.",9,2,4,8 February 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Pretty damn funny
","Will Farrell is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedians. As much as I liked his work on Saturday Night Live, it is on the big screen where he truly belongs. His work in Old School and Elf prove that he is very much capable of making the leap from television to motion picture projects. I can now add Anchorman to that list. Anchorman is completely stupid and rather predictable, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud several times throughout. Farrell is the man of the hour here, but he is supported by some truly inspired performances, notably Steve Carell. Add in some great celebrity cameos, and you have perhaps the year's funniest movie thus far. I didn't know quite what to expect going in, but Farrell and his news team delivered.",8,2,5,19 October 2004
The Waterboy," What did you expect from an Adam Sandler movie?
","I saw this movie in a jam packed movie theater, and I laughed until my gut was aching.There were times the theater was so loud from laughter that I missed a few of the lines. I didn't have a problem with this movie because that's the kind of humor I've come to expect from an Sandler movie. This is what he's good at.You don't(or shouldn't)go to a Sandler movie expecting Academy Award material. This one was no exception. I went for some good laughs, and that's what I got. Some people said this reminded them too much of Happy Gilmore. I on the other hand found them distanced from each other for the following reasons:-No annoying accent in Happy Gilmore -No fight scene with Bob Barker in Waterboy -No annoying rednecks in Happy Gilmore -Both movies deal with different sports -Sandler's characters in the two movies are complete oppositesThe movie was clearly aimed at the pre-teen age group with it's potty and no-brainer humor. Take it for what it is, and don't expect an Oscar nomination for Sandler anytime soon.",7,1,1,29 July 1999
Raging Bull," A flawless masterpiece
","One of my alltime favorite films, Raging Bull is a stunning examination of brutality and one man's descent into decadence and immorality. Much more than a boxing film, it's a documentation of what makes us human, and the potential of it's destruction. Simply put, Robert DeNiro gives the performance of a lifetime. He is absolutely magnificent as Jake LaMotta, a true bull of a man in and out of the ring. His sheer presence is overpowering, but he is competently underscored by an impressive supporting cast, especially Pesci as his tormented brother and Moriarty as his abused wife. The boxing sequences are as real as it gets, unflinchingly brutal and almost poignant. Behind all the ugliness of Raging Bull, though, lies beauty. The actions of LaMotta hardly evoke pity, but the film is so poetic and incredibly filmed that the movie is never so stark and perverse as to be unwatchable. Bringing it all together is the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, who is brilliant as always. I could talk forever about Raging Bull, but it has to be viewed to be fully appreciated. For that matter, see it more than once, it gets better with each viewing.",10,3,4,4 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.
","Much too often these days, superlatives are thrown around to describe the greatness of movies and music. In this case, any superlative used is an understatement. This is unlike anything that has ever been made and probably ever will be made. Few films I have seen can stir as many emotions as effectively as ROTK. After more than three hours, the film still leaves the audience wanting more. If there is any justice, ROTK would sweep every awards ceremony in existence. Combined with Fellowship and Two Towers, the unprecedented trilogy helmed by Peter Jackson towers over any achievement in the medium in scope, character, and impact. The bar has been raised and the standard has been surpassed. Motion pictures will never be the same.",10,0,0,28 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," In a class by itself
","This film is a virtual institution in my household. My parents saw each movie of the trilogy movies upon first release and needless to say this is one of the first films I ever saw. Even at a young age I was blown away. Simply put there was never anything like it before and probably never will be again. I'm glad I got to see it on the big screen when the special edition was released a few years ago. In my opinion the entire trilogy should be re-released in theaters every few years so everyone can experience it like it should be viewed. If you haven't seen it yet(all ten of you) you owe it to yourself to do so. If you have, see it again.",10,1,1,18 February 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A hilarious movie that never grows old
","After viewing hundreds of comedies throughout the years, this clearly sticks out as one of the funniest. I've seen this movie no less than 20 times and I still laugh every time. There are many classic scenes, especially the duel with the Black Knight, which always makes me chuckle with delight. The zany humor of the troupe's comedy series carries over well to their first feature film, and their best in my opinion. Once you've seen it, don't be surprised if you catch yourself quoting lines from the movie. Fans of irreverent comedy should love it, but the ending is a bit of a let down. Nontheless, it doesn't take away from the rest of the film, which should have you laughing long after it's over.",9,0,0,11 July 2001
Sin City," Hands down the biggest entertainer of the year
","Being a fan of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's previous collaborations and given the very impressive cast, I highly anticipated Sin City as a great piece of movie-making entertainment. Simply put, it exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Much was made of Sin City's striking visual style, and for good reason. While the visuals made it amusing to watch, the characters and performances made it fun to watch. Rodriguez and Frank Miller triumph in bringing the spirit of the graphic novels to life in each of the three major segments. Sin City is a rare mix of style and substance that hits all the right buttons and leaves its intended audience wanting more. Those too easily offended by the movie's over-the-top violence probably won't watch it to begin with. Sin City, for my money, is the most entertaining movie to hit the big screen in 2005. It's a one-of-a-kind extravaganza in a land full of copycats, and it's sure to spawn some cheap imitators.",9,0,1,8 December 2005
Gladiator," Great action
","I went into this movie expecting alot, and it delivered. The action sequences are spectacular and the performances are very good as well. Russell Crowe is great in the lead role and Joaquin Phoenix should receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Commodus. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a historical epic or just something to rent for the weekend. 9/10",9,0,0,15 January 2001
Goodfellas," Absolutely brilliant
","Martin Scorsese has made some of the most enduring American films of the last 30 years, and Goodfellas still stands one of his very best. Arguably the best film of the 90's,Goodfellas delivers laughs, thrills, shocks, and a great soundtrack of pop music ranging three decades. As with any Scorsese film, the acting is top-notch, especially from Liotta and Academy Award winner Pesci. And as with any Scorsese film, there's brutal violence abound. Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster films ever, and it's also a vivid look into an era that once was. On top of all that, it's my all-time favorite film. You can't ask for anything else from a movie than what Scorsese's masterpiece delivers. 10/10",10,0,0,28 November 2001
The Godfather," Timeless cinematic excellence
","As long as movies exist, The Godfather will always be relevant and stand out as one of the all time best.  When most people think of a perfect movie, this one comes to mind, and for good reason. Every single aspect of filmmaking is executed down to the finest detail with flawless results, most notably the violence, which is graphic but never gratuitous. The ensemble acting is arguably the best ever, with every performance being beliveable and memorable. The story of a mafia family trying to survive amidst a crumbling empire is very compelling, but it's much more than a mafia movie. It's a story about family and the importance of staying together.
Over the years, The Godfather has become nothing less than an American institution, inspiring several imitations as well as parodies and creating many phrases and expressions that have made their way into pop culture. There is something in The Godfather that appeals to everyone and every generation. For this, it will always find favor with the masses and truly remain a timeless classic of cinema.",10,0,2,15 October 2001
