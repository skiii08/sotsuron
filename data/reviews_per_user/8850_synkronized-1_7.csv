Marie Antoinette," total eye-candy!
","Sofia Coppola steps over the classic borders of history movies. And what she does is fabulous. She's made it new, colorful, funny, honest and rich. Coppola approaches the movie characters from their point of view. Like all her previous movies (Lick the Star, The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation) the main character(s) are in a young age. In this movie (and in history of course as well), Marie Antoinette is only 15 years old when she marries Louis XVI. And what I like that Coppola does, is that she lets her characters to do things that normal teenagers, normal 15 year old would do. They do a bit stupid things that of course would not be appropriate to royals in everyone's eyes, but Coppola makes them honest. I mean why on earth everyone thinks that real Marie Antoinette didn't do such things when she was 15 and a bit older. I like that the classic and boring way (stiff, motionless faces and ALWAYS so polite and civilized) of impersonating royals has finally broken. Coppola's movies always have really nice sceneries and sometimes camera angles as well. They are so simple, but yet so impressive. And this movie has a lot of color - beautiful costumes, colorful food, colorful people etc. Sofia Coppola's movies have excellent music choice. And so does this one. Acting is wonderful as well. Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Marie Antoinette extremely well. She's sweet, smiley and cheerful. Great actress! And Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI gives his character a mystery touch, a bit weird touch as his character suppose to be at first when we don't yet understand why his like that. Great actor as well! I can't understand why the critics slammed the movie? The only thing worth of complaining is the ending. It moves slowly, yet fast, but without any big connections between the scenes, only a blank black card. Sort of like Return of the King ending. But it's understandable as well - there were just too much material. The ending part was the part where the happy and cheerful young people's life ended, it was the part where everything went suddenly sad and they finally had to start living the life of adult royals. And after all - Sofia Coppola concentrated her movie on the young life of the royals and only gave us a sneak preview of the adults. So probably someone else some day has to make the boring and old classical story of the adulthood and ending days of Marie Antoinette! 10/10",10,1,3,2 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The bids are higher - double the action and double the jokes!
","Dead Man's Chest is as good as The Curse of The Black Pearl or at some point maybe even a little better. Definitely NOT a disappointing sequel as it sometimes might happen. It's extremely refreshing to meet the old characters again and see the new ones as well. Davy Jones & co looks really creepy and unpleasant. The filmmakers have scored right on making the bad ones really frightening. Johnny Depp gives once more an incredible performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Have you ever seen a bad movie when Johnny Depp is around? All the jokes are once more extremely funny. Keira Knightley is once and again lovely as always. And she also gets some action! What I personally really liked is that this time they gave Jack Davenport a bigger role than on the first movie. Yes, Norrington is back, but this time he's character is so much more than on the first movie. I totally loved his character now. And Orlando Bloom, who honestly isn't the best actor around, this time seems to have developed a bit. He's started to give more nuance to his performances. I already noticed it in Elizabethtown. That deserves a bit of credit also. If you loved the first movie, then you don't want to miss that one! And you might also want to see something that's after the end credits. I can't wait to see the third one, because it's going to be a great final! Excellent movie in a great visual package! 10/10",10,2,6,16 July 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," forget about fashion-TV, see how The Devil Wears Prada instead
","'The Devil Wears Prada' is probably one of the best movies in it's own genre. This is actually a movie about Andy's path of finding herself. And at this absolutely colorful fashion world, even she, who swore that she'll never change, starts to slide on her way. A simple girl starts to dress herself up, knowing more and more about fashion. This also mirrors a world of typical teenagers (although Andy is past that phase already) nowadays. At one point they are sweet and innocent, simple girls and on the next moment they are hooked on shopping, clothing and fashion. This can't harm, but if you start slipping more on your way and changing, you might not get out of there. Probably Miranda Priestly was something like that when she was younger, but she slipped. Her eyes were on the prize too much. She built a career, but she also started to wear a mask, letting go of her true self. She became 'the Devil' - always so tough on everyone, she gained herself a reputation of cold-hearted woman. But at one point she slips, she drops off her mask and let's herself go. She let's Andy to witness that moment. Let's her know that deep inside she's just like everyone else. Very wisely picked cast for the movie. You could almost call Meryl Streep as 'The Grand Old Lady', who gives a wonderful and strong performance as Miranda. And opposite her they have given a chance to Anne Hathaway, who is one of the best young actresses in Hollywood right now and who has already showed her skills that have improved more and more since 'Princess Diaries' and 'The Brokeback Mountain'. The meeting of old and new fabulous actresses. Also I was very surprised to see Simon Baker (Christian Thompson) playing on the movie. I noticed that charming Australian at the very beginning of his career on small Australian series. I knew that he had broke his way to America, but seeing him on 'The Devil Wears Prada' was very pleasant! And I can't stop without mentioning what a great chosen soundtrack for the movie. Each song just perfectly filled in the back. You could just hear those lyrics and they perfectly reflected the situations and thoughts of the characters on screen. This has happened very rarely. It just flew through me!I definitely want to get my hands on the DVD when it comes out and maybe I'll even read the book :D 9/10",9,0,0,29 October 2006
Over the Hedge," A for adorable and amusing
","'Over the Hedge' is surely a very entertaining animation for both - children and adults. I'd say that this is probably one of the best animations from big production companies alongside with Ice Age, Shrek, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. They've done a great job animating those animals. The characters are all adorable (very true to like fur and thorns + extremely big blue and emotional eyes). Movie gives a lot of true laughs. Little ones giggled over the cinema. This movie also teaches what truly matters in this life. I also noticed that children liked the musical score. Some of them started to clap their hands silently and hopped on their seats. And I truly liked the voiceovers. Very well and wisely chosen cast. Outstanding performances from Bruce Willis (RJ) and Steve Carell (Hammy). Overall rating - 9/10",9,0,0,11 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Ratner finally managed to left an impression of some kind
","At first I was a little scared of what might come out of this. Brett Ratner's work so far hadn't left me any big impression. But when I saw the movie I quite liked it. It's full of action and great visual effects. Although at some cases it's quite predictable. And a negative thing - some characters left too quickly and quietly. Would've want to see something more impressive. The skating scene was visually quite enjoyable. As well as the Golden Gate scene. Of course I'm very impressed again by the good old cast (always magnificent Ian McKellen, hot and sweaty Hugh Jackman and pretty Famke Janssen) And I was glad again to see Aaron Stanford (whom I've liked since his very first movie 'Tadpole'). And I liked seeing Ben Foster (who made truly an amazing role in 'Bang, Bang, You're Dead') as Angel. Although I really would've liked to learn much more about his character. I think that the length of the movie is probably too short :D But hopefully there will be an extended edition for the DVD. And hopefully they will really end the movie with the third part. Otherwise they will probably ruin it forever. 8/10",8,0,1,11 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," the greatest secret of our time
","The book was great. It's even one of my favourites. My hopes where quite high when I went to see it. I mean I liked the movie very much, but there was still something missing. I expected a little more of it. Ron Howard is a great director. So I knew that it can't be a total disaster movie. The movie started off really quickly and evolved pretty fast. I doubted if Tom Hanks could handle the role of Robert Langdon. I thought they were so much different, but when I saw the movie I knew I was wrong. Hanks did a great job and looked more handsome than he's ever looked. One of his best roles lies within Langdon. Audrey Tautou was brilliant. I've never seen her in a bad movie. I think that her person helped to put out the best of Sophie Neveu. And I think that Leigh Teabing's character (played by magnificent Ian McKellen) was really the first one who brought in some relaxiation. In the meaning of jokes. First the movie seemed to be a bit of tense, no real laughs, but Teabing and he's three questions seemed to be the ones that people really laughed about. Good Brithish humour never dies apparently. And I also must mention that Paul Bettany really was Silas. Although I would've made him maybe ever more pale. I don't even need to mention how good Jean Reno was. However I would've liked to see more of the Remy character. He was not given so much role here. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I started to mix the book and the movie. And things got a bit different, but I didn't let myself disturbed from it. I understand that it's a difficult job to transform such a complexed and informative book into a movie and certainly you can't put everything in it and you usually have to change something. The one thing that bothered me a bit was the ending part. If the beginning was fast, then the end was a bit too slow and it got a bit boring even. And again,everything wasn't quite like in the book. And they didn't do IT:( And what I really have to say is that they visually did a wonderful job with the secret of 'The Last Supper'. Technology is a good thing! I certainly hope that there will be more close to the book scenes in the DVD near future. It's not necessary to read a book before watching the movie, but if you have read it, the more exciting things you know. And don't let yourselves disturbed for goodness sake - it's just a fiction! A brilliant fiction!",8,0,2,19 May 2006
Amélie," I want to be Amelie!!!
","One of the main reasons I love French movies so much is that the French directors always have a good eye for visualization. It's all hidden in little details (like colours) and interesting angles of camera. And 'Amelie' I think is one of the best examples of it. Probably even THE best. And this movie also has a great and very talented story. Makes you laugh from the bottom of the heart and there's even a scene when you're ready to cry with Amelie. Every time I see it I actually think that I want to be just like Amelie. I want her determination and her joy of life. This movie shows how happiness is really on the small things. And that you have to grab chances. And that you can make life worth living! And of course I enjoyed those weird and most creative ideas (like the traveling elf, suicidal fish etc.) Cast is wisely picked. They totally complete each other. Audrey Tautou is perfect for the role of Amelie. She carries a bit of mystique touch in herself and that was necessary for the character of Amelie as well. Plus she's really sweet. And actually - how many people in this world actually care about people next to you and people you don't even know? Most people are just really egoistic, but Amelie is like this little light who suddenly cares and makes things better. Mathieu Kassovitz is a very talented actor and director as well. Perfect choice for the role of Nino. He also carries out that mysterious side. The side of little weirdness, but in a good very sense. And I also have to point out the music of this movie. Yann Tiersen has completed a fabulous score. This is something extremely romantic and totally french-like. Definitely 10 points out of 10. And believe me, I would give a lot more.",10,1,5,23 May 2006
