Source Code," this is how Hollywood should shoot sci-fi.
","In Hollywood industry, science-fiction often means E.T., robots and laser sabers.'Source Code' reaches a higher standard, and achieves to blend the paranoid matters of Philip K. Dick (altered consciousness, parallel realities) with the sensible depiction of human emotions.'Moon', Duncan Jones' previous movie was already illustrating the interest of the director for 'hard' science-fiction, as well as the reflections around self-consciousness, death, reincarnation, free will, love. In his second film, Duncan Jones gives his characters a new dimension : the characters really stands, with more profound personalities. There is a better balance between the science-fiction plot and the emotional plot. To support this idea of a 2-axis film, it is interesting to observe that 'Source Code' has two endings : the climax of the human emotions (son-father relation, and love), followed by the termination of science-fiction machine.Technically, 'Source Code' is very good. The special effects are not overly present, and are serving the film purpose well. Nevertheless, the art direction is rather impersonal and it would be difficult to identify the film by its photography only. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting well (much better than in Brokeback Montain) and the supporting actresses (Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga) are convincing.This was a very enjoyable movie, and I am looking forward for Jones' next movie. Will it be a new SF film? Will it be possible to find new dickian themes to explore? I sincerely hope so.",8,0,1,11 November 2011
Spider-Man 2," so far from common people
","'-Peter, I can't survive without you-MJ, you should not be here'The final dialog of Spiderman 2 is illustrating my feeling on the whole film. Not once, did I believe that MJ could love a character so undefined and uninteresting as Peter Parker. And yet, she is running away from her wedding to come back to Spiderman.I had the same (lack of) feeling during the entire film. I could not connect with Spiderman, and I did not feel empathy for his aunt when she is in danger, or have to leave her house. Or when Octopus is robbing the bank. Honestly, who cared?? So why is Spiderman running after him? Who cares, I'd rather have an ice-cream.Clearly, I don't think if it is a lack of focus from me. Rather, I believe this is the diagnostic on these commercial products. Hollywood movies are so artificial, so disconnected from the daily reality of real people, that I did feel its creators cared about the viewers, and in return I did not care about those characters at all.Technically, this film is still in good fit shape, despite its 10 years of age. SFX are still alright, and Sam Raimi had a good selection of camera angles, and scene rhythms.The acting is globally very bad, from Tobey Maguire (At the end of the day, not such a long filmography) to Kirsten Durst (much better interpretation under the direction of Lars von Trier in 'Melancholia'). James Franco is at is usual quality level (I have to admit I have not watch '127 hours' yet).Globally, the script and storyline are lacking. A director has yet to come, who will inject some human truth in the Spiderman brand, like Nolan did with Batman. But the even harder challenge will be to avoid copying 'The Dark Knight'.",4,1,5,27 September 2014
Silent Hill," a flat, disappointing movie.
","Christophe Gans is a known amateur of B-series movies, and his previous creations (Crying Freeman, Brotherhood of the Wolf) were very talented entertainment movies.Crying Freeman was a mix of romance and traditional yakuza story, while Brotherhood of the Wolf was a film 'de capes et d'epees'. Both movies were characterized by their suspense and the quality of the production.Silent Hill is far from that. Unfortunately, this big production is very linear and its scenario is paper-thin. Too thin, in fact, to justify the duration of this movie, and the viewer will often feel that scenes are too long or even unnecessary (especially when explicit violence is depicted -burning people, etc- ) .This film fully relies on an all-you-can-eat bulimia of special effects. Another constant is the use of deep shadows to create anxiety, as the spectator can only see monster in the light beam of the heroin. This technique was previously seen in numerous movies, Alien and Seven among many many others.I have read comments about this movie being smarter than a typical gore movie, and being more profound than a simple video-game adaptation. Unfortunately, this is simply not true.",2,0,2,29 September 2009
Taxi Driver," class conflict in the love department.
","It always seemed to me that Taxi Driver is illustrating how class struggle is not limited to the economics, but it also extends to human relations and love. The difference in education, in cultural background, makes it nearly impossible for people of different social classes to meet and have an accomplished relation.Martin Scorcese gathers Robert de Niro, Cybill Sheperd, Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster in this New Story's backstreet fable.Travis (De Niro) is a Vietnam veteran, with a very limited education who finds a job as a taxi driver with night shifts. On his nightly ride though the streets of 1970's New York, his mind continuous clashes on the crude reality of lower life. One day, Travis is ravished by the beauty of Betsy (Sheperd), who acts as a campaign agent for a senator in the presidential race. Travis will attempt to prove the sincerity of is feelings, with mixed success ...As I watch this movie again, I realize that this movie also has a political statement. The plot seems to imply that the fate of the People will not be improved by politics, that political personel is only interested in their agenda while the 'real' individuals have to deal with the difficulties of the 'real' life, which is an idea which is also conveyed by the movies of Clint Eastwood.",9,0,1,26 October 2015
Rush," Appealing story (behind the Instagram color filter)
","Howards is one of the last director which cares about story telling. His last movie 'Rush' shines the light on the competition between James Blunt and Niki Lauda, both on the F1 circuit, and off the tracks.Howards manages to draw the interest of viewers, even of those who thinks that Formula 1 is a remain of the past, like safari, fur-coats and tobacco.The main actors are really good, and never once did I question their impersonations. Niki is described as a sensible, reflexive person ; whereas James Hunt is shown as childish, self-centered and sometimes toxic for his entourage.My only dislike is related to the direction of photography. The balance of colors, the composition, the choices of focal lengths, the vibration of the image to convey emotion (trembling hands, engine vibration, etc) ... I like none of those.But the story and acting saves it all.",7,1,2,18 September 2014
Alien vs. Predator," a good action flick, far from the original Alien atmosphere
","This film from 2004 is a self-assumed action movie, and if you take it as this, you will not be disappointed. The plot is rather simple : Predator have been breeding Aliens on planet Earth, in order to have hunting targets.Based on this simple scenario, the director has been able to create a good action film, with some real suspense (how many characters will really survive? you may be surprised), and some good action and still valuable special effects.Of course, we are miles away from the frightening atmosphere of the original Alien or Predator. There is no play with lights and shades, and every details of the action is clearly visible. Yet, you will be surprised to enjoy your 2-hour show.Definitely worth more than 5.4 out of 10. ( Scream 4 is no more than 5/10! )",7,2,3,19 April 2011
Drive," kitsch kitsch kitsch
","The artistic choices of the director (a mix bag of 70's Bullit and Glam ) are yelling at the viewers' face, but it is still not enough to forget the lack of a scenario.Scena WHAT? like in real life, violence is the favorite mean of those who can not treat well with words or ideas. An hold-up going out of control, dangerous girl, impossible love. Every most basic clich√© is included.The actor Gosling (driver) is bad at playing desire, or fear, or anger. In fact, being dead, he still acts awfully bad. Mulligan is a better actress, but the ancients Brooks and Perlman are the ones saving the casting.What will remain from this movie ? that crime does not pay. Or only maybe for film producers.",6,2,5,16 January 2012
Kick-Ass," Pointless violence for sociopath teens.
","Dave Levinsky is one of those lame teenagers who spend 99% of their times jerking off, and the rest of time reading comic books. He soon starts fantasizing about becoming a superhero vigilante under the pseudonym 'Kick Ass'. Unfortunately his high expectations are not supported by superpowers or extraordinary capabilities.After an appearance on TV, David 'Kick Ass' is contacted by 2 hyper-violent vigilantes, which are of much higher level, and are doing real harm to the local drug mafia. Indeed, those 2 characters do not hesitate to use the most deadly weapons, or to even sell drugs, to fight the crime their own way...This movie is very disappointing. It is marketed as a teenage movie, with a blend of American Pie, Superbad and Spiderman. Sadly, 'Kick-Ass' ends up being not so funny, and becomes a tribute to heavy gun violence and self-justice and broken ethics. For example, the 2 superheros resell drugs to fund their armory, which is not what you would expect from 'good' guys. Did I mention, those 2 superheroes are father and daughter, the later (11-year old girl) skipping school to practice guns and kung-fu?The film production is also deeply disappointing, the screenplay is minimal, the special effects being very visible and exaggerated. The acting is very poor, you can hear laughs in the auditory when Nicolas Cage is narrating the death of his beloved pregnant wife. The 'bad' guys have absolutely no presence.Finally like many recent blockbuster movies, the director makes sure to keep one the bad guy alive, in order to leave the door opened for a very profitable sequel (Kick-Ass 2 is already scheduled for 2012).To be avoided. 3/10",3,34,69,5 May 2010
X-Men: First Class," well done, but really shows the limits of a 50 years old storyline
","This film is the fourth movie based on Marvel's comics X-Men, and it is certainly the best episode.'First Class' is a prequel to the other 3 films, and it feels like a reboot of the storyline to clear the previous shortcomings. The obvious benefit is that this is the first X-men film which is self-contained and can be evaluated like a movie rather than the live adaptation for the comics readers. Unfortunately, this film also illustrates how thin and old the plot of the X-Men is : a basic metaphor of a world divided by the cold war, obsoleted by the complexity of more recent series like the Watchmen.The cinematography of 'First Class' looks like the typical superhero movie from Hollywood's factory lines. Surprisingly, the special effects are lagging behind, they are jumping to the eyes (the castle 3d model, the missiles, the blues skin and fur effects). The split-screen scene during the X-Men training is one of the strange cinematographic choices which really fall flat, and cut the film in a patchwork of disarticulated pieces. The film introduction is astonishingly good, but the acting is then getting immediately awful, until the end credits. Except Magneto, the characters have no sign of personality, and the 'actor studio' method seems to be unknown to the whole casting.As a conclusion, this film is one of the fist fine superhero movie ever, but it will only be reminded as a film de genre.",7,0,1,26 November 2011
Pineapple Express," writers smoked too much weed
","This movie is like the brain of a weed addict, who think that is thinking soo fast, and he can understand his surroundings so sharply. Whereas in reality he is lying on a couch for endless hours, saying nonsense, and moving so slowww.54 minutes of movies. 55 still to go, and nothing much has happened. What is wrong with this movie?? It was starting surprisingly better than expected. I mean... Cinematography is OK - of course, photography is not on par with 'Lawrence of Arabia', but it still much better than 'Fast and Furious' or the kind. Acting - you feel that Seth and Franco knows how to impersonate a drug smoker, so no actor studio or improvisation class was needed.But the script is so slow and unproductive, it is amazing that it did not even try to fill the holes by mild funniness. If you want to watch a stoner comedy (before the term exists), I would suggest to go back 2000's 'Dude's where's my car?'.",4,4,7,23 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," awful!
","Mickael Bay is coming back with his new season of the 'Transformers' road show.Let me start with an anecdote : do you know how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created in the 80's ? The target audience were kids, so the marketers came with a list of what kids used to adore : comics, reptiles, kung-fu films and pizza! For the exact same reason, Mickael Bay and Paramount marketing dept are coming back with robots, race cars, heavy weaponry ... and centerfold girls! And that is why Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is an adulescent, a teenager who depends on his girlfriend and his parents for a living. Anyway...The introduction of the film (linking the Apollo program with fictional events) is appealing, but the rest of the script makes absolutely no sense. The motivations of Sentinel Prime are absurd, and nothing is really logical in this movie.The cinematography is awful. The action scenes have no rhythm, and Bay constantly relies on camera shaking and slow-motion. The SFX are awful, robot 3D models are difficult to visualize.Acting is terrible. Of course, LaBeouf does not how to play, but I would expect something better from Malkovitch and 'Torturo'! This is really a film you should avoid.",3,3,8,1 December 2011
