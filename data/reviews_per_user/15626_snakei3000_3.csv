Miracle," the best game in sports history is the best sports movie!
","man i loved it... as i wanted it..  kurt russell is so strict he was the love hate between us and russia was felt through the whole theater and the movie felt like you were watching the real game.  beacuse the photography was shot, it looked like 1980. what else the practice was good because they showed alot of what these players indured.  basicily if you loved the 1980 game watch this movie you wont be displeased...",9,0,0,7 February 2004

The Dark Knight," I saw it twice and it still is perfect
","at first i gave it a 9 but changed it to 10 a week later and saw it again the movie is perfect in every way story, plot, acting, action, and of course the batman mythology. Nolan and Goyer told an amazing story for the film and yes I'm pretty sure like many would say heath stoled the show but is he the best joker. i came to the conclusion that you cant compare jack and heath there to different without spoiling details heath is more aggressive and terrorizing, while jack is violent but yet comical in his own way I cant say who's better and people shouldn't either but all i know is i don't want to see another joker for a long time. this is the adult batman that most fans have wanted and it's true it's not for children, it has to many adult situations in it but my god it really is a theatrical experience so watch this movie because this is one of a kind.",10,6,12,28 July 2008
