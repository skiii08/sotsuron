Walk the Line," Essential to ANY aspiring musician . . .
","I definitely agree that this project maintained the perfect balance for those either familiar or not familiar with the legend, Mr Cash. I am a 'rockaholic,' for lack of a better word, and was never a big fan of classic, early country . . . ANY country really, before I saw this film. But whether you knew his music or not, this film definitely spoke many truths to any aspiring musicians out there; any who appreciate all music as a beautiful art, a love that speaks to the masses, a 'natural drug' which helps us through rough times . . . and so much more. I'm sorry. I just worship music. It is an amazing thing. Anyway, I hope others who attempt any bio-musician-pictures in the future will model theirs appropriately (in reminder of maintaining their OWN creativity of course) after this well delivered piece. I cannot wait to see a piece which carries similar aesthetics and original portrayal about one of the most legendary musicians, dreamers of humanity ever . . . Mr John Lennon. After twenty-five years on December 8th, I wish someday such a movie will be recognized not because it topped the charts in profit, but raised the awareness and changed the hearts John tried so hard to do.",10,1,2,21 December 2005
