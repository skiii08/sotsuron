Blade Runner 2049," A Breath of Fresh Air in a time of Comic Book Movies
","Words are going to fall short to describe this movie.I went into the cinemas expecting a regular blockbuster.This movie surprised me. It is a CLASSIC. The pace of this movie is EPIC. You become a part of it immediately when you see it.The cast is impeccable. Cinematography, out of this world. Visually Spectacular. Audibly mesmerizing. Ryan Gosling pull of 'K' effortlessly. Ana de Armas as 'Joi' is beautiful. Robin Wright is fantastic. Harrison Ford is the Best as usual.I will say no more. Just go and enjoy the movie.",10,8,19,7 October 2017
Hereditary," Critics are a bunch of grredy Suckers writing only for money. I think I have much more respect for W*****
","I saw this because it was proclaimed by critics (probably the same who overhype the marvel movies) that this movie was the best a horror movie can offer. they said that it was so disturbing that some of them had a hard time forgetting the movie after it had ended. All a bunch of non sense.
This movie has a great atmosphere and splendid cast, but the script and moreover the narration lets it down. I seriously waited for one truly scary terrifying moment (there are actually some of these, but not many) that would maybe make it different from the norm (Conjuring) these days but was disappointed. It builds up slowly into something that appears to be great but ends up being not even mediocre. The sequence of event that happen in the movie make no sense and are not explained to complete satisfaction. that is the main flaw of the movie. The end not only disappoints but makes u cringe abt why did u even bother.I re-iterate",6,1,2,26 August 2018
Zootopia," This is what Animated Movies Should Be
","Absolute Fun, Right from beginning to End.I think animated movies now a days have begun to be more the moral, emotional or very intelligent affair, so the fun part usually takes a back seat.Zootopia is not like those movies at all. It is what more animated movies should aspire to be. It is a movie where i can take a 8-10 yr old and still both of us would end up having fun (Pixar does not make such movies anymore). The characters of Zootopia were awesome. The 3D was spectacular. The story pace beautiful. So kudos to Disney. A job well Done.",10,3,13,5 March 2016
Point Break," Must see 3D movie
","I write this review only because I saw a whole bunch of negative reviews about POINT BREAK (2015).First of all, it was a visual delight, Edge of the seat, Adventure movie.Yes, the plot isn't very logical, but to me the cinematography coupled with the breath taking adventure sports/stunts made up for the lack of decent plot.I spent a no holds barred, very entertaining 114 mins in Theatre and that's tat.MUST See, especially in 3D for a marvelous experience",8,13,30,2 January 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Of all the Marvel Movies I hate......I think I like this one the most
","This movie is the best in 3d with spectacular special effects and a decent story line. The Jokes are awesome. Probably the funniest of all Marvel movies.But It doesn't have that feel good effect in the end. I did not walk out of the theater feeling gr8. I was entertained lot though. The major problem is that I think the movie tries to be too funny at times. It does not need to be that. Too many parts of the movie were inspired(copied) from other movies e.g Satuur is the Cave Monster from LOTR1, and such. Characters, I did not like one single character, including THOR, who is just kicked around a lot(for a superhero). Even Hulk is not very likable. The Junk trash ridden planet that they have created is what puts you off.Having said that, overall it is a very enjoyable movie.",7,1,4,5 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player One (RPO) Best Movie This Year....Seriously... Avengers 4 won't even get close to this
","I have read the book. I have seen the movie and I have been thinking abt it for the past 24 hrs. So Here Goes.....The first 15 minutes of the movie are pure adrenalin and fun. The cost of your ticket is, whatever that may be, is recuperated in those15-20 minutes itself. No other movie in the last 5 years has come that can claim to have the impact like those of RPO's first 15-20 mins. Rest of the movie is enjoyed free of cost. And literally enjoyed. I maybe wet myself once during it (although I can't say for sure) I know ppl are gonna say, its way different from the book, but hey, Ernest Cline himself is involved in the screen play and has put in enough easter eggs and references from the book. I won't go into a detailed analysis because this movie is to be watched, not just discussed.To sum it all this movie is the best time I have had in the cinema for a long long time. Go ahead and enjoy it.",9,0,1,9 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," I liked some parts...Hated the whole
",this is just another Marvel movie high on charisma low on substance and they have ruined Spider-Man. The individuality of Spider-Man was not there in the movie. His genius is never shown. Tom Holland is a good actor but definitely not Spider-Man. He is somewhere between Tobey Maguire(OK) and AndrewGarfield(Perfect). The story is a huge Cliché. The characters are a huge Cliché. The action pieces are good but not great. The Villain in typical Marvel style is weak.* Another classic example of a Marvel movie on IMDb with paid reviews,3,17,27,1 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," What Pourpose Did the Billboards Serve?
","I wanted to Like this movie. I like Frances McDormand and the different roles the plays. I had also heard about the potential Oscar vibes the movie had. So I tuned into it expecting a lot. And I was disappointed.My disappointment is nothing to do with the actors, all have given marvelous performances. But, the story is deeply faulty. There are so many potholes in the script that it just begs the question what were the writers thinking?Secondly, the character of Mildred(McDormand) is deeply flawed and deeply angry throughout the movie. So much so that I began to hate her. Willoughby(Harrelson) is wasted and Dixon(Rockwell) is confusing. Now take it that this is not the actors fault, they have played their parts perfectly. The story doesn't do justice to any of the characters. The Billboards (that make the title of the movie) do not themselves inspire or lead to anything in the movie. That is the biggest flaw of the story and the biggest disappointment.One of the reviewers here(on IMDB) has written out the exact flaws of the movie pointwise in his review, so I am not going to list them here again. Check them out.I am just gonna say this movie is a terrible disappointment",6,1,4,27 January 2018
Justice League," It is Fantastic...But too Short..It should have been longer
","First things First. This is better than The AVENGERS, Age Of Ulrtron and Civil War put together. And I know that many people won't agree with this. The Persona of every character is unique and well portrayed. The fights are great e.g the scene when Steppenwolf enters was absolutely Brilliant. The story is good. The setup really has a feel of new group forming and the perks that come with it, the differences of opinion that come with it, the clashes that happen and then comes the team spirit.I thought that Superman was a little less portrayed, but still every scene that he is in is fantastic. Which is why I think the film should have been longer. I think the original film was actually longer but for some reason the studios cut it down. I am certainly hoping for an extended cut of the film when it comes in Blu-ray.It is a fantastic film and I think a must watch in the IMAX format.",9,3,7,18 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," It is a really bad movie
","All through this movie it just feels like they are setting up an homage to the past marvel movies and characters, this in itself is not a bad ploy but the way it is executed is lame. They do not even try to make it interesting. And the whole movies drags along this way like it is entering some kind of depression. The Quantum time travel idea is extremely badly executed. it seems the idea was just an excuse to visit past movies and characters. In addition the characters are lame, they just don't have any mojo about themselves. It just feels like they knew it was the end and everybody appears bored or not interested. The last fight is pathetic. Again no excitement at all. And the heroes that died felt like they had to die just for the sake of it. Pathetic movie, even by Marvel standards.",5,6,12,5 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Hell of a way to rob money out of yur pockets
","First things First. This is a good movie. Enjoyable and sort of entertaining to a point.
They really marketed it well with the secret leaks to the ending, killing off many characters etc. etc. They surely had me fooled and apparently almost 90% of the world's population(Who have not even realized it yet). 
The first 20 mins of this movie are seriously good and they build up nicely to an middle and an end that falls flatly on the ground. Thanos is the most important character in the movie(as the trailers and the marketing team has made apparent). He alternates between being strong and being weak, being a badass and then a softie entirely for the convenience of the plot. There are no other characters that are given that much importance, seriously. Everyone makes an appearance though, and have their comic one liners but all for nothing.Captain America is virtually absent from the movie (except during his entrance scene). Black Panther is also an observer, so is Winter Soldier and Hulk, Yes u heard it right, Hulk is not there in the movie. Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man , Thor and Guardians have a better amount of screen time. Then comes the ending, which I am confident was a late patch up thing and not well thought of.In the end you are left wondering weather you have liked this movie or not? I have liked it but only Just.",7,0,5,6 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Most Boring Movie I have Ever seen
","And that is saying a lot. Because even Blade Runner 2049 was a long movie but it did not feel boring. The movie has feel of being boring from the very beginning. They have also gone with sort of Gender equality (Many women in top decision making and executing function of the rebellion) but I think that degrades the movie even more because of the lack of action associated with it. The characters are heartless and soulless. You don't care about any single one of them (Not even Luke Skywalker) which is surprising because these are good actors. The most disappointing part of the movie was the action involved which is truly little to speak of despite it being a Star Wars film. I did not like The Force Awakens that much. But compared to the Last Jedi, Force Awakens is Cherry Pie.It all boils does to the Story and the execution. It looks like a decent attempt tell something new but falls drastically short of good execution.Totally disappointing (I liked the little Luke Skywalker twist towards the end though, and probably the best 10-15 mins of the movie). But overall you can give it a skip.",4,3,5,24 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," How can anyone like this movie
","I give it a three but its more like 2.5ish, and I am being very generous. Its only because of the quality of special effects and baby Groot. That said, there is nothing in this movie to be excited about. Bad dialogues, bad dialogue delivery. Weird sense of timing on bad jokes. No Script whatsoever. I could stand the movie for abt 5 mins tops. Then I got bored. so I had to watch it in 5-10 mins intervals hoping it would get better but it didn't. The whole premise in the movie is a direct take over(COPY in lay Mans terms) from every space movie Hollywood has made. The scene where Kurt Russel explains his origins to StarLord seems directly taken from the MAN Of Steel, but seems very stupid. The Space creatures are Gross. The only feeling I had at times while watching it is a feeling of PUKE(As opposed to some users here who felt Joyous). Sly Stallone is wasted, Kurt Russell is stupidly wasted and I can go on and on.Marvel must really be paying a bomb to all those critics, Marvel Fans and IMDb credit dispatchers(One who give the stars) to give it such a good rating.All I see in this movie is a bunch of C***. Glad I did not waste my money to see it in the theater.",3,19,35,11 August 2017
The Shape of Water," This movie has a Heart, and its beautiful
","I think the title of the review is enough to tell you that do not miss it. There was nothing like this movie at all last year(except for Blade Runner). The characters. story, direction, visuals, music score everything works for the movie. The love story between a Monster and a Human is presented in a mesmerizing way. The fact that the two of them are similar in some respects (Both communicate to others through sign language) and tats why they understand and fall for each other is strikingly , beautifully portrayed. Don't Miss the movie.",9,40,74,27 January 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Awesome is an Understatement
","The Atmosphere that they create from the start of the movie, till it ends....Marvelous. The sound, the effects are breathtaking. it is just what a Superhero movie should be like. It makes it AVENGERS look like a bunch of School Kids.More Importantly, this movie has a HEART, Unlike the AVENGERS, this has a feel that u are IMMERSED(HANS ZImMMER helps a lot) in the movie and it holds on to u back right till the end. I went in the theatre with modest expectations from the movie. I knew it was going to be good. But what I saw just Blew my mind. It is much more than AWESOME and it will stay with you forever.I know the star ratings on IMDb does not reflect it(AS OF YET). But this is definite a watch twice even thrice, pure entertainment.",10,5,10,25 March 2016
