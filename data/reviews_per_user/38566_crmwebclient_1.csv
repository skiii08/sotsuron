The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," totally disappointed and frustrated
","There is nothing to tell about this move. it is a test to your patience. I did watch hunger games films. This was a worst movie i saw recently. it is just 2 hour narration of same piece of information again and again, again and again. movie won't go further and do not except a single action sequence even though in the movie, there is war going on as part of story. from begin to end, all they did is just talking in different places ( a bunker or ruined building or near a lake). only scenes I liked were fights carried by rebels against capital.if you are going to this film do't dare to have any expectation. i hope that they will make part 2 in much better way.",2,27,40,24 November 2014
