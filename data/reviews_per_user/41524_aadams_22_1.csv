Miracle," Excellent Movie
",This is by far the best sports movie that I have ever seen. It chronicles the true story of Herb Brooks and the 1980 US Hockey team and how the entire country was captivated by it. The USA was in shambles in the late 70s early 80's and this hockey team gave the whole country something to cheer about. It is truly sad that Herb Brooks was killed in a car crash just a few weeks before the theatrical release of this film. The world is just not the same without him around. He will be sorely missed. Even if you are not a hockey fan this film is a must see. I highly recommend this film to EVERYONE. I am certain that even the most fair weather hockey fan or even the largest hockey basher will enjoy this movie.,10,1,1,10 March 2005
