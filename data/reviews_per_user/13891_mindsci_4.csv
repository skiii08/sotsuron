Sucker Punch," Watch the 'R' Rated Version! (review of R rated version).
","I know there are/were a lot of people that didn't like or get this movie. I bought the Blu-Ray set when it first came out and watched the 'R' rated version first- I'm glad I did! I subsequently watched the Theatrical Release, and WOW, the film was butchered for that studio coveted 'PG-13'! This is no kids movie!(R version). It is and can be quite dark, disturbing, and tragic, but if you watch this version you will most definitely get the 'ending'. Babydoll is plunged into a dreamy and nightmarish world of (akin to) a psychotic break, and real horrors, by her evil stepfather. This is the world we are privy to. She is forced into an existence of 'lucid dreaming'... Where would you go if you were stripped of all control, all that you loved, and any hope for the future? The 'break' or 'dream' is a world of fantastical sensory overload. As such, it is a joy to behold as it unfolds choppily and meanders through the dreamscape. But, second and subsequent film viewings will be extremely flat as all has become predictable. So be sure to pay attention the first time you watch Sucker Punch- all the more reason to forgo the Theatrical Release if you haven't seen it yet.Emily Browning definitely exudes a lot of sexual tension. She was equally erotic in 'The Uninvited' when she was 21. There is something about those plump pouting lips! All the more for the dreamscape effect in Sucker Punch!Zack Snyder films are most definitely 'Sensory Feasts' when seen in the theater. I would have loved to see the real ('R' rated) version of this in 3D on the big screen. However, I still found that the Blue-Ray 'R' version delivered nicely on a substantial home theater system- Damn those 'coveted PG-13's!",9,2,3,26 February 2012
Cloverfield," An Aggravating Mix of: 'Blair Witch', 'The View', & 'kraken'
","This ?Film? was annoying from the start...I guess the yuppies couldn't afford a camcorder with Image Stabilization. The entire movie is so shaky it's like 'Blair Witch' on METH or in DT's! Meanwhile, I felt as if I was listening to a really bad episode of 'The View' with everyone bickering, venting, and- of course- all talking at once! Yikes! The movie is so bad from the beginning that within 15 minutes I was praying that they would at least throw in a storyline about/developing the 'Creature'- no such luck.The movie 'idea' had/has rather good potential; unfortunately all is squandered here. It is as if the film makers set out with the idea of 'How can we make this film so as to sabotage any chance of it living up to it's real potential'!",1,5,6,19 October 2010
Event Horizon," Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Breakout' Masterpiece
","This review is not a summary of the plot, or a critique of the Filmography, cast, acting, etc. This review points to the merits, uniqueness of the film, interesting background info, and my impressions. Paul W. S. Anderson was offered to direct X-MEN, but he declined that offer in order to do 'Event Horizon'- lucky for us! For me,the film was a groundbreaking confluence of space science, physics, science fiction, horror, and spirituality/religion- 'good versus evil'.The film was originally 130 minutes in length, but the studio forced Anderson to cut it down to 96 minutes- something Anderson regrets to this day. The studio and Test audience runs of the 130 minute version proved too unnerving and disturbing as this version was much more graphic than the released version.The film has developed somewhat of a cult status amongst its fans. Meanwhile, Anderson had promised to release a 'Director's Cut' to include the 34 minutes worth of footage the studios forced him to cut; however, that footage was lost and only remains in lower quality video tape. Hence, no Director's Cut will ever be likely.Despite the lost footage and Anderson having his Post-Production time cut from 6 to 4 weeks, the released version is very, very good. The movie is TRULY CREEPY; especially because of the story: It is seemingly quite plausible and,thus all the more frightening. I first experienced this film on DVD up-scaled at 1080i at home on my 46' home theater system, alone, in the dark, and very late at night. This movie continuously and reliably sent chills up and down my spine- thanks Anderson! If a Director's Cut had ever been released I can only imagine how delightfully unnerving and disturbing it would have been!Just watched it on Blu-Ray...Awesome... Despite its 1997 release, on Blu-Ray the improved detail, color, and sound improvements make it look so good that it seems it could have been made recently! I had watched it last 2 years ago, yet watching it again still left me creeped out & disturbed for a good while! Event Horizon remains an excruciatingly unnerving, despairing, and frightening Masterpiece- LOVE IT!",10,3,7,15 August 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," I wish Clyde Had Brought The Whole Thing Down!
","Just like 'Heat' this is a film that would have been monumental if the 'anti-Hero' had won out! Guess Hollywood and Film Studios still hold the erroneous assumption that 'Politically Correct' is the only way to get a film into circulation. They are so Freaking wrong! For instance, David Fincher and his film SE7EN broke all these rules and remains a masterpiece of film to this day! Go Clyde- Go! I wish the spineless studios had let GERARD BUTLER TAKE HIS MASTERPIECE REVENGE PLOT TO A JOYOUS DESTRUCTIVE END!!! GERARD BUTLER WAS MAGNIFICENT! FOXX WAS HIS USUAL DISSATISFYING 'PSEUDO HERO' WIMP! FOXX CONTINUES HIS REIGN AS AN ACTION-'NOT GONNA BE'- ACTOR! He would do better to stick with other roles which he definitely excels at. Unfortunately, the way Foxx portrays Nick makes it impossible to feel anything good about him... Perhaps that's what the director intended, and that director had a much darker finale for the film, only to be forced to be PC by the studios. The ending scenes of the cello recital seems to be such a pathetic patch on the end.",9,1,1,16 September 2010
