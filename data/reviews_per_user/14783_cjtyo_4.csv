The Ring," It's an insult to compare this to The Sixth Sense!
","I only gave this a 3, instead of a 1, because there was some fantastic imagery. Otherwise, this really was one of the bigger waste of time movies I've ever seen.This was NOT a truly scary movie. It was creepy. Absolutely creepy. But, the expectation that I would suspend my disbelief was SO high I simply couldn't do it.Many people have said there were too many questions left unanswered - that is totally true. I was more frustrated after the movie ended simply because there wasn't enough information provided about the WHY of the premise.Unfortunately truly bad acting by the two main adult characters did not contribute positively to my viewing experience. I had a hard time caring about anyone in the film. And the main woman did the most amazingly stupid things over and over and over - starting with watching the video to begin with!I don't recommend this movie at all, and am horrified that anyone would think to compare it to anything as excellent as The Sixth Sense!",3,1,2,22 March 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Extremely disappointing
","They should have left well enough alone. The only thing that saved this movie was the ending, otherwise it is a complete waste of time. Even the two or three humorous lines by Arnie can't make up for the poor plot, poor writing, and excessive special effects.This was definitely made for young men, the T-X sucked, she wasn't menacing, interesting, or threatening, unlike the T-1000 in T2. But she had big boobs. Whoopie.The acting of the two main human characters was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the writers and director were thinking making John so slow witted and insipid, it did nothing but irritate and annoy.I bought this sight-unseen to have the complete series, and I'm sorry I wasted my money. Like the Highlander and Alien movies, it's a shame when Hollywood doesn't recognize it's time to STOP MAKING SEQUELS!",5,25,52,23 November 2003
The Usual Suspects," Total surprise ending
",I'm really good at 'figuring' out how movies will flow and end. This one caught me completely by surprise. It is absolutely a fantastic film with terrific acting. Kevin Spacey is phenomenal. I highly recommend this movie.,10,0,1,22 May 2001
The Producers," The funniest movie I've ever seen!
","There's nothing else to say really. 'Springtime for Hitler' will stick in your mind forEVER, and rightly so. It's pure Brooks and purely hysterical. There is no better chemistry than zero and Gene, a perfect match casted brilliantly by Brooks. Brooks has made some of my favorite comedies, and this tops the list hands down!",10,0,1,18 April 2001
