Ali," Great. Inevitable. Unnecessary(?)
","There is no doubt that Michael Mann is one of the foremost directors working today. His task here, though, is impossible. How can anyone, even the best of narrative filmmakers, really capture the life of such a familiar and beloved living legend? The Ali story being translated to film was unavoidable. It's an honorable effort in the hands of Mann and his performers.   Mann succeeds at wrapping the Ali story into a film that's meaningful in itself, rather than simply documenting a life. In the decade spanning 1964 to 1974, we see how Ali's life was such a paradox. With the blessing of Ali and his family, Mann breaks down the legend and studies the man. It shows a person who had too many allegiances, resulting in a lot of pain for many who knew and loved him. The most profound moment is Ali standing before the drawings of him children have made on the walls in Kinshasa. As if he never realized how far reaching his impact has been, the picture depicts him using his boxing gloves to fight off jet fighters and tanks. Under this, the locals' chosen slogan, 'Ali Bumbaya,' which means, 'Ali kill him.' In that moment, all the sacrifices he'd made, standing up to the draft board, speaking out against the Vietnam War, sticking to his religious beliefs, seems to culminate in something. He can actually see the evidence of it through the eyes of children. This scene does contain a few anachronisms, such as showing a kid on a razor scooter--in 1974, and some of the clothing they wear.The six fights (Liston, Liston, Quarry, Terrell, the first Frazier, and finally Foreman) are recreated with stunning accuracy. The voice-overs of what Ali was thinking I could have done without.  It's in these scenes that Smith is able to inhabit the Ali character the most. These are the scenes you're really able to forget an actor is playing Ali and believe for a moment that you're really watching him fight. The film skips over Ali/Frazier II, barely mentioning it in fact, and goes straight to the 'Rumble in the Jungle' with Foreman. This move sucks some of the drama away from how Ali wins back his title. It's also not made clear enough that Foreman was the champion at the time of the Zaire fight, having beaten Frazier, who'd beat Ali. Ali then beat Frazier in January of Â‘74 to earn the right to reclaim his belt. That second Frazier bout was critical and shouldn't have been swept aside.    Despite having to condense so many events into a short time, the film is cohesive, a major triumph for Mann. But too much of his life had been lived in public. There was so much TV coverage of him, of his fights, of his press conferences. He was, and still is, a very public person. That leaves a real life of imagery that's almost too powerful to try to tell better in a narrative film.  The Academy undoubtedly won't feel the need to nominate the film or its director for this reason.  The film really doesn't have much that's new to say about the life of Muhammad Ali. To honor the film would do no more than honor the man. This is a position voters won't be comfortable with. They'll be content to leave the job of honoring Ali to the body who's already doing a fine job of it--sports writers, documentary filmmakers, and historians. I do believe that Columbia will promote Smith's performance enough to get him a much-deserved nomination. Some technical awards are possible as well, such as editing, cinematography, and original score.Grade: B",8,0,0,2 January 2002
Iron Man 3," Why Not Just Call it Tony Stark: The Motion Picture?
","Given the intense run-up to this film, I was far too aware of studio machinations behind it. I could almost smell the ink on the contract Downey Jr. signed to the franchise that certainly guaranteed him a minimum amount of face time. It's ludicrous how much time he spends as just plain old Tony Stark, running around with a gun or with self-made gadgets or wearing only part of the Iron Man armor (careful to keep his face exposed). The character seems to have gone far beyond anything the comic envisioned. The movie version of Stark is more complex and that's great. Except, the armor has become no more than a metaphor for the theoretical armor Stark hides behind. They come up with many imaginative ways 42 suits of armor (all built by Stark alone because he can't help it), but in the end they just seem like more excuses to get Downey Jr's face in front of the camera and STILL have scenes with armor so it can be an Iron Man movie. I would reckon that the armor spends very little time on screen, if anyone were to sit down and calculate it. One other issue I noticed: Disney bought Marvel. Disney's animated movies move along at a bullet pace. They seem to be pushing for that same style with these comic book movies now. The way IM3 is cut, there's no time to even consider what you just saw, no time for emotion whatsoever. I wanted to raise my hand and shout, 'whoa just take it easy! Slow down!' For instance, the movie's best action sequence, where Iron Man rescues the passengers of Air Force One, starts and ends before you can even soakin what just happened. Oh and I didn't see it in 3D or IMAX but I can't imagine why anyone would want to.",6,0,1,24 May 2013
Training Day," Big cop out
","SPOILERS'Training Day' opens strong. Here you had Jake, a guy who finds himself in this terrible situation. He wants to make detective and work narcotics, so he must spend a day in the field getting some real world' training with a hardened LAPD legend. You see this big brother/little brother dynamic develop between the two. Jake wants to impress this guy more than anything, but soon realizes he's in for more than he ever imagined.Who was it that said, the audience doesn't want to see the second worst day of a guy's life? Well, what a day this ends up being for Jake Hoyt. Ethan Hawke gives this great multi-leveled performance. There's two main things he needs to accomplish: be scared of Alonzo and hide that fear from Alonzo. It's just one day,' he must be thinking to himself, I can get through this.'The film does not build on this promise, but ends up being an unintentional sermon. I never like to feel like I'm being preached to while watching a film. 'Training Day' claims to know the answers to the questions it poses. Films shouldn't do that. Make the audience think but let them make up their own minds.The cause of this problem is the character of Alonzo Harris. I was disappointed that this guy ended up really being bad. This is a case of a plot twist gone wrong.  While it's admirable that Denzel didn't demand that the writers change the story so his character seems more heroic, the way many stars have, I almost wished they'd gone that route, if only just a little.We're never given a reason to feel sympathetic toward Alonzo. First we think he's a jerk. Then we find out he's really an evil person. The plot features this double fake-out that starts with him going psycho on a couple of would-be rapists. At this point you're thinking, they're messing with our heads. Soon we're going to see that Alonzo isn't such a bad guy. But the story just keeps pouring it on: Evil, evil, evil. This translated into boring, boring, boring.By the time the film got to the business with the three wise men and Alonzo's 'posse,' followed by the revelation that Jake's been set up the entire time, I was no longer involved. I was no longer relating to Jake's character but was just along for the ride, merely curious about what happened next.The card game scene is great and could have saved this film's behind. It's ruined by a coincidence that asks more from the audience's suspension of disbelief than it should. I mean, his cousin? Out of how many millions of people in Los Angeles? Is that supposed to be ironic? It's not even the coincidence that bugs me the most; it's that the scene it's meant to be the payoff of, the scene that had been the most interesting and intense in the film, ends with a big thud.'Training Day' is another one of those films I wish had taken a different course. At the beginning you're thinking it's going to be about this wide-eyed rookie learning the hard lessons of the 'real' world. But not long into the story it becomes apparent that the film isn't based on any reality at all. It becomes this typical cop thriller with corrupt cops and evil Russian mafia guys. Isn't there enough moral tests in the real struggles of an undercover narcotics officer that they could have built a story around? It's as if no one involved in the film knew anything about narcotics investigation, so they had to resort to this theoretical crap that's straight out of 'Tango and Cash.'Grade: C",5,0,12,20 October 2001
A Star Is Born," Really wanted to like this film
","When this first came out in theaters, people were losing their minds over it. I finally was able to watch it, albeit at home on blu ray, this past week. I had never seen any of the other versions of this story that have come out over the years.It takes place in a world where extremely mediocre music is hugely successful. Oh wait, that's our world, the one we live in now. So this film gets points for that. Except it thinks much of its music is really good. There are 2 pretty good songs in it, one being 'Shallow.' It has some good lyrics. I was never sure though, if we were supposed to enjoy Maine's songs he didn't sing with Ally. Or if they were just there because he was a rock singer and needed to sing songs. Someone with songs of that quality would have difficulty filling bars, let alone a stadium full of music fans. Same goes for Ally's 'pop' songs, which are worse. Complete garbage in fact.But enough complaining about the music. Let's talk about the performances by the lead actors. Lady Gaga is a really talented actress and musician. She manages to shrink her own persona just enough for this, and I think that's why she received so much praise for this performance. Wow, we all say, see how she can transform herself into just a regular gal with dreams to chase? What a trooper. But I guess that's what most of the acting corps in Hollywood must do, right? Becoming the everywoman or everyman becomes that much more difficult as the cash starts piling up. Cynicism anyone?Then there's Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine. It's a fine performance, which he mumbles his way through. I couldn't help but recall Jeff Bridge's performance in True Grit, and suspect he drew inspiration from it.My favorite work here is that of Sam Elliott. He does his best work here.Oh and by the way the entire film is about alcoholism and is pretty much the story of a rock singer's nosedive into deeper alcohol and drug addiction, to the point where he hangs himself in his garage. As I said, I had not seen any other version of A Star Is Born, so maybe I should have known it was coming. But the film does not seem to be setting this up, for most of it anyway. It went hard after the tears and certainly got it from most audience members.Instead of making the film a tragedy of a life wasted and Jack's death, The tragedy should have been that Ally's dreams of being an artist were crushed by her ascent into superstardom. If she was really being true to herself, with the dancing and stupid lyrics, wasting the talent within her, then why should I care what befalls her? What makes her stand apart from any other sellout in showbiz? We are left to wonder, would Jack have been better off without her coming into his life? Addiction is a disease, so probably not. Right? The film should offer a crystal clear answer to this. It thinks it does, but really does not.",5,3,5,1 October 2019
Memento," Write yourself a note: 'See Memento'
","`Memento' is the first film of 2001 that matters. Hopefully it won't be the last. It's about a guy who loses his short-term memory after sustaining a head injury trying to prevent his wife's murder. He remembers who he is, his entire life before it happened. His lone objective is to find the man responsible for the last new memory he ever made: the death of his wife. He believes he can do this because memory is unreliable anyway. The facts are not. In order to continue knowing the facts, he writes himself notes. He writes notes on Polaroid photos. He has some of these notes made into tatoos (and you thought your mom was bad for leaving those annoying reminder notes all over the house).The film's subject is memory, but it also proves to be a monumental test of the audience's memory. Mr. Nolan takes conventional film storytelling apart in a way no one has ever seen. In doing so he breathes new life into the entire film medium. `Memento' is any dedicated film-goer's Ultimate Challenge. Anyone who fully grasps everything that goes on in this thing on first viewing deserves the Handsome Reward. Don't plan on propping up your feet and relaxing if you go see this. Prepare to actually use your noggin or come away lost.Beginning a film at the end is a convention that's almost over-used by directors these days, but never has a film begun at the last scene, then the next to the last scene, and on and on. The final scene is the very beginning of the story. You ask, well where's the suspense then? Just see it. Nolan isn't just trying to be clever either (but ends up being very VERY clever anyway). Telling it backwards is his way of putting us in Leonard's head. Any time a scene begins, we have no idea what's going on (again, not new to the film medium). We have to figure it out as it goes, the same way Leonard Shelby (`L.A. Confidential's Guy Pearce) has to.For two hours the film gets more and more captivating, but also more and more mentally taxing. It's a real test of a person's capacity to pay attention to details and, well, to remember things. Not everyone is going to be looking for this kind of experience in the movie they bought a ticket for, which is fine. But I think anyone (except children of course) can get something out of it.The story Nolan just happens to tell backwards isn't any more complex than a good thriller should be, that is, after your mind takes it apart and reconstructs it. This will be a must-own DVD when it comes out. At least then I'll have the option, just once, of starting at the end and watching it in chronological order by the miracle of the back' and next' buttons. By then I'm sure I'll have seen it a few more times. Grade: A",10,0,1,25 April 2001
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek ripping its own self off
","Knowing I was going to be seeing this in the near future I (re)watched Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. Aside from the superior special effects, I can't say that Into Darkness is better.Weirdly, it's like someone took this pre-production script for Wrath of Khan, pulled out its best concepts, and cobbled it together into a different film, using some of its identical scenes, sometimes giving its same lines to different actors.What makes it weirder is that there are indications in Into Darkness that this is set in the same universe as the 6 original Star Trek films (of the 80s and 90s). If that's so, then how is the same stuff happening before it happens again? The crew of the Enterprise is doomed to repeat its own history, I guess.What Into Darkness felt like to me was a big, loud, Star Trek knock off that was kind of okay. It hits the same beats that Wrath of Khan managed to pull off so much better, somehow, in the early 80s. I guess I wanted to see a totally original Star Trek tale, not one that borrows so heavily from a previous one. J.J. Abrams leans too heavily on fan love for Wrath of Khan.Hate to say it, but thinking about it makes me want to re-watch the Star Trek tribute/parody Galaxy Quest. Not sure why.",6,2,5,30 May 2013
The Others," so they do make 'em like they used to
","Using absolutely no CG imagery, nor even blood or gory make-up effects, director Alejandro Amenábar goes old school here, crafting something that is truly special in a year like 2001, filled with meaningless, thoughtless work from directors who have proved they know better. 'The Others' is the kind of picture (what they used to call this form of entertainment) that won't really course through your veins until after the end credits roll. Along the way it provides such great imagery, the kind you only see if you're really paying attention. For instance, when Grace is going through the box full of old photo albums, there is briefly revealed a ghostly face in one of them, as if it's watching her. Likewise the opening shot of one scene showing another ghostly face lit in candlelight (you remember the shot), that at first cannot be distinguished as real or a painting. All of it contributes to a singular purpose: not a shot wasted, no line of dialogue that isn't giving you something meaningful.'The Others' is beautiful, not just in the way it looks, but thematically as well. Like any ghost story, it explores the spiritual. It doesn't tell you what to believe, but forces you to question the nature of death and hell. I predict that this will be the most underrated film of the year. Audiences have been programmed for too long to expect certain things. Too many films don't trust the audience enough to let them collect information and draw conclusions themselves. Too many films have spoon-fed us. Many will get to the end of 'The Others' and say, 'what, that's it?' It's such a subtle work, it'll leave many feeling like there should have been more. For these reasons, this film will probably be forgotten before too long. And yet, it's the kind of film that should be studied for years to come, particular for its writing, direction, and cinematography. 'The Others' looks like it could have come from almost any decade. The 'aughts' should be proud to have this film as part of its cinema history.Grade: A",9,1,1,22 August 2001
Insomnia," the anti-summer movie
","'Insomnia' is not the kind of movie you expect to see this time of year. It's the kind of dark film studios usually save for fall release. The logic is that a) audiences are expecting more serious, dark material that time of year and b) it's positioned better for Oscar attention. Something has happened this summer, though. We seem to be getting back to the idea that summer is not just the time for dumbed-down action. It's the height of the movie box office season, period. If a movie is good, it has the best chance of being seen during this season. That has not been the way things have gone in recent years. The high-profile release of 'Insomnia' release may be a sign that major movie studios have finally wised up.This summer, if schedules hold, we'll get Cold War thrillers 'Sum of All Fears' and 'K-19: The Widowmaker.' We'll get the first major studio, serious crime film in a while, 'Road to Perdition.'  Are the days finally gone that true movie fans must spend spring and summer waiting for anything good to watch, settling for what amounts to garbage? I'm hopeful.By the way, I loved 'Insomnia.' It's the best film of the year so far. The film is a rare instance of a project living up to and far exceeding its potential. Sometimes the collaboration of great talent actually creates something great.Director Christopher Nolan, who only four years ago released his first film, 'Following' on a shoestring budget shot with friends over a year of weekends. Only one print was made of the film at the time. Not knowing this, I was lucky enough to see it screened back in 1998 at a theater in Santa Monica. Only two other people were in the theater. The night before I saw it, Nolan held a Q & A session after the screening. I'm kicking myself now for not attending that. If only I'd had any idea what would happen next. In 2000, at the Toronto Film Festival, came 'Memento,' and everything changed. A couple of struggling producers named Clooney and Soderbergh immediately recognized Nolan as having big-time potential and tapped him to direct 'Insomnia,' their remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name.I saw 'Insomnia' on Memorial Day Sunday. The theater was packed.So now here is Nolan, having directed three Academy Award winners in a thriller that found itself taking advantage of a Memorial Day weekend left wide open by schedule shifts. The choice to release it at such a time would not have been made had this film not been so good. I believe that the studio took a look at it and said, 'this is great, people are going to love this. Now, when can we open?'Despite its big stars and probably big budget, 'Insomnia' is remarkably tight. There's a subdued, perfectly channelled intensity throughout. Stylistically it's only a few clicks removed from `Memento.'  The two films look a lot alike.Each of the great actors, Pacino, Williams, and Swank accept themselves as pieces of Nolan's puzzle, snapping themselves in perfectly. They're the kinds of roles actors live for.Grade: A",10,0,0,31 May 2002
We Were Soldiers," Finally, the beginning
","'We Were Soldiers' offers little new insight on war, but does offer a new perspective on the U.S. in Vietnam. Based one of the first battles of what would become the Vietnam War, the film gives a rare perspective for those who are too young to remember. We had always been told the story from the middle, from 'Platoon' to 'Forrest Gump.' We'd always seen Vietnam used to illustrate the horror and uselessness of war, often the psychological side. We'd also seen it from the end, where the real struggle for many veterans was only beginning. 'Soldiers' tells the beginning of the story, before the Â‘Second Indochina War' became for Americans merely 'Vietnam.' The Nov. 14-16 Battle of Ia Drang Valley was the first major battle between American soldiers and North Vietnamese Army regulars (as opposed to the guerrilla Viet Cong). At this time there was still hope for some U.S. success, at least militarily (25,000 anti-war protesters would march on Washington mere weeks later). The film contains little talk about Communism, nor the American government's anti-Communist 'policy of containment' in southeast Asia that got us into this war, but concentrates on the human side: you're called, you go, out of duty. While this is the first worthwhile film of 2002, to say that this is 'the best war film ever' (as one user put it) is a huge overstatement. I question a lot of Wallace's directing choices here, like the overuse of slow motion. It really got tiresome after a while. The narrative itself could have packed a bigger emotional punch had they cut it differently. This may have had a lot to do with Wallace's script and his apparent attachment to it. Upon seeing the footage, it would have been evident to me that he really had something with the home front scenes, the wives and widows, with Madeleine Stowe's (as Gen. Moore's wife) and Keri Russell's characters. I saw opportunities to weave those stories more with the battle scenes but Wallace--or someone else who pulls the strings--did not see it that way. Someone may have felt that audiences were looking for intense, sustained, bloody battle sequences, given the success of the standard-setting 'Saving Private Ryan' and with the intense 'Black Hawk Down' still in many theaters.
It's still solid, though. Definitely worth seeing. Mel Gibson's work as Airmobile Division commander Lt. Colonel Hal Moore is solid, but the best reason to watch this is Sam Elliott's performance as Moore's second-in-command, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley. Grade: B-",8,0,1,9 March 2002
Snatch," Resist the temptation to stop watching it
","'Snatch' spent only a brief time in the theater for those committed to actually sitting and watching films. I did see this during its short US theatrical release, having been fortunate enough to be in a larger market city on business at the time. Back then I never found time to post a review, though. Now it's on DVD and I took another look. Same movie, smaller screen, just as good. I predict 'Snatch' will be one of the most rented but least watched' home videos of the year because its plot is so incomprehensible (though not near as much as Guy Ritchie's previous, 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels'). People will give up on it after a time and go get a sandwich, iron clothes, play cards, etcetera. But it's fun enough to keep on as background static just for say, the bits with the dog who eats the squeaky toy and Brad Pitt's hilarious, unintelligible Irish(?) accent.
Just a few words about Brad Pitt: he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, mostly because of how he completely commits to every role he's in. He has a healthy, George Clooney-like mentality toward his choice of projects (like George, he's chosen a Coen brothers production, 'To The White Sea' for his next), saying pooey! to the Hollywood hit machine and choosing roles that are actually interesting. Occasionally he'll earn a paycheck with dreck such as 'Meet Joe Black.' In this film he plays Mickey, a gypsy (or to your average Welshman, 'piker') with an iron jaw and a monster right hook.
Pitt plays Mickey with such genius. See, when you need to understand him, you can. When it's just for laughs, well, you'd need subtitles. The accent (I could be wrong on this), like the lazy eye in `Twelve Monkeys,' was his idea and is intended to poke fun at the way American audiences couldn't understand a word anyone was saying in 'Smoking Barrels.' Pitt's every move is calculated, but he does it with such abandon you have to give him credit.Grade for `Snatch': A-",9,1,1,11 August 2001
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Holland is the best Spider Man. This version HAD to be different
","I've read other reviewers take issue with Tony Stark inventing a suit for Parker to use. This is a version of the Iron Spider armor Stark created for him in the Earth 616 universe. Ironically, it's when Spider Man and Iron Man end up on different sides during the comic Civil War, that he ditches the armor. I've read other reviewers take issue with the supporting characters in Peter's world and school. They turned Flash into a nerd. They turned Aunt May into a younger woman. They left out the origin story (but we know that it's still a spider bit that gave him his powers. There are slightly racist reviews that take issue with the 'diversity.' Well first, the high school is in New York City, a very racially diverse city as everyone knows. We've already had 2 cracks at a Spider Man franchise, in very recent history, so the makers of Homecoming had a challenge on their hands: How to make this one feel very different. They succeed and do it in such a way that Spider Man could now be re-launched for a generation. Holland could play him for decades. It is set up so that the Spider Man franchise can slowly distance itself from the larger Marvel CU but still dip its toe in once in a while. Now that the Iron Man and Captain America story arcs seem to be coming to an end, Marvel needs Spider Man, its signature character, to be able to live on for a long time--longer than any other character it's translated to film. Spider Man: Homecoming is good. One reviewer pointed out, as an insult, that it was trying to be a John Hughes film. I thought that was an interesting point. I mean, it is a film about high school kids so why not? It pays a nice homage to (Hughes') Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the kids are foul mouthed and a little bit too 'real' at times. Many parents will not be comfortable with some of this content (myself included). There is a great action scene in the 2nd act where Spider Man finds himself having to rescue his classmates from a failing, disabled elevator at the top of the Washington Monument. His only way in is one of the small windows near the base of the monument's peak. He is freaking out because he's never been up this high before. He has to overcome that fear and use the police helicopter that's hunting him to give him the thrust he needs to bust through. This is one example of why Peter Parker is an interesting character. He is, at this point in his story, still just trying to figure out his own life, and figure out his limitations. Spider Man: Homecoming will be the beginning of a long series of films for Marvel, surely. Hopefully they keep Tom Holland in the role. He really gets it right. He can 'grow up' into the role as the character advances in experience. But please no more reboots.",8,3,4,10 October 2017
Fast & Furious 6," This series and I--we go way back. Sort of.
","This franchise has been providing big dumb entertainment for 12 years now. And I've been there nearly every step of the way. It all started summer of 2001, when the original came out. I was never one for a car chase or caper film, but something caught my eye about it from the trailer. So I bought my ticket. Sat there, thinking often man this is really dumb. But the action sequences (then directed by Rob Cohen) really gave it muscle. It had this infectious energy that I enjoyed. By the time the end scene (the train scene) came around, I was kind of hooked. I knew they'd make more of these. Unable to wait till the inevitable sequel came out, I ran out and saw 2Fast 2Furious.Well no. No I didn't. It's the only one of these I haven't seen in fact.Later they broke off with this sort of spin-off with 'Tokyo Drift' stuck to the end. Good for it, thought I. Its theater run came and went, too, without me. This despite the fact that I saw nearly every movie that came out at that time. My time then was more...spacious back then than it is now. Later it would be shown on cable and I caught it then. The reappearance of Dom at the end intrigued me. I thought, you see what they did there? They tossed out some bait to see what they'd catch. And you know what? What they did there may have been the most important moment in the franchise's unlikely history. They enclosed the franchise back into its star. The animal was at that moment named. Now we have something..When it came to Fast & Furious I actually rented the video as a new release. I was that eager to see it. I enjoyed it even though it was seen on my miserable 32' non-HD television. I remember a fuel truck rolling over in the Dominican Republic and an epic car chase through a drug running tunnel on the US.-Mexico border. And Letty being a double agent in a drug cartel. I must have enjoyed it enough to go out and...ACTUALLY SEE FAST FIVE IN THE THEATER. For the first time since the first F&F film, I was sitting in a theater watching one! They won me back! (applause) It only took ten years but they did it.While Fast Five's success paved the way for Furious 6 (and 7 and probably 8, 9...), Furious 6 is not the film that 5 is. What made Fast 5 so great was that it is a caper film. It also seemed to send the franchise in a slightly more serious direction by raising the stakes in the form of Hobbs (And what other franchise could ever see adding Dwayne Johnson as a path to seriousness?) But even though Fast Five marks the franchise's serious turn, it's also funny, which legitimized its utter ridiculousness. Furious 6 really wants to be funny, too. It's kind of like Fast 5's wannabe jealous unfunny brother. Same writers, same director, most of the same cast. And somehow, very different films. It's as if the writers have become boxed in by their own formula. And the script has its issues, for instance:Why does Riley, if she's actually with Shaw, chase after Letty in the notoriously brutal girl fight? Did they only decide during the later stages of writing that Riley was a mole and just didn't want to ditch the first Riley/Letty fight? It didn't make sense.In the tank scene, on the Spanish highway, they kill the tank by attaching a cable to Roman's mangled car. But wouldn't the ultra-strong cable just rip through the car? Let alone turn the tank upside down? Just how long are NATO runways? The climactic scene in the cargo plane must have been set on one that was 200 miles long. I still like this franchise and will be interested to see more. Jason Statham should be able to infuse it yet again with new energy. They could even get rid of Hobbs (killed in a blaze of glory? Yeah that'd be a good story point). One spot on the crew vacated by Han and Gisele with Sean Boswell (which many of the F&F forums already seem to be discussing).",3,0,1,30 May 2013
Pacific Rim," No matter how many times you remake Independence Day...
","...it doesn't get better. I do like 'ID4' but sci-fi writers looking for a plot keep stealing from it. They may not even realize they're doing it on a conscious level. I recently reviewed 'Oblivion' which also borrows from 'ID4.' What I'm complaining about is this nuclear endgame that always pops up. It's become this deux ex machina that solves everything (and no, a nuclear reactor that melts down does not result in a nuclear explosion, as this film's homepage points out). Also, PR rips off the 'hive mind' idea (and even calls it the same thing) from ID4. Remember the scene in ID4 where the president's mind is linked with the alien pilot's and he discovers their secret plan? Again, directly ripped off by Pacific Rim.But really, all this thievery's not a big deal as long as the story that surrounds it is sound. But PR is a mess. It never makes up its mind how seriously it wants to be taken. No character is interesting, or even very likable. At least ID4 had Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum odd couple to inject comedy into the proceedings, especially the ending. What's so unique (still) about ID4 is how the world comes together with existing technology (and old school strategies like morse code) to scrap with and beat the technologically advanced aliens. PR wants you to believe that in a few years we would have the technology to build these giant man-controlled robots operated through a mind-meld. What a mess.I will say that the fight scenes and CGI of Pacific Rim are commendable. That said, though, it's not enough. Filmmakers aren't even making films any more. they're making cartoons. This is a whole other subject but--there is a reason that these horror movies are coming along and burying the big-budget 'tentpole' films studios parade out during the summer. The horror genre is still rooted in the basic elements of filmmaking: shot selection and editing. An audience wants to get emotionally involved. They're not impressed by computer-generated monsters any more. A film is story, camera angles, revelation, lighting, music, character, editing. Nothing's ever going to change that.",4,4,8,27 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," NOW 'Phantom Menace' makes sense!
","If George Lucas knew the whole story for 9 movies back before the original 1977 Star Wars was made, why did he choose to make Episode IV first? Who knows? All I know is that if he'd decided to begin with Episode I, the series may have stayed at one film. You don't know the exact reasoning for the choice, but you can't argue with it. 'Phantom Menace,' which once seemed like a tragic mistake, an epic misguidance, now seems tolerable after seeing Episode II: 'Attack of the Clones.' Events of 'Clones' give weight to what happens in 'Menace.' Pieces of the puzzle are fit together, making sense of both films, and lifting the weaker Episode I to 'acceptable' status. A film should still stand on its own, however. Episodes IV through VI were all good movies, but were even better if you'd seen all of them. Unlike 'Menace,' 'Clones' stands on its own without the benefit of the other films. To be exact, it's an absolute riot, a hoot, great fun at the movies! For Star Wars fans it must be paradise. Everyone gets in on the action this time. R2-D2 flies to the rescue! C-3PO carries a rifle (and gets his head knocked off yet again)!  The most fulfilling moment of course, belongs to Yoda. By now everyone has heard about Yoda. He fights! He commands an army! (Many have wondered how the little guy goes from hobbling along with a cane to bouncing and flipping around like an acrobat. My guess is he moves his own small body around as he would other objects, while still managing a light-saber. It's not his feet and hands that are moving, but his entire body). I'm told that Lucas was not intentionally Â‘making up for' the disappointment of 'Menace,' but given how amped up this film in the series is, it sure feels like it. Lucas really pours it on, but it doesn't feel overloaded. He follows more closely to the structure of 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi,' with space battles and lots of traveling from planet to planet. Many early reviews of 'Clones' claimed that Lucas saved the really good stuff for the film's final act. I found that there was a good balance of action throughout, that you never wait too long for some action to happen (this IS an action movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else). It does reach a fever pitch near the end, as any in the series do, but there is good stuff all the way through.Grade: B",8,0,0,20 May 2002
Captain America: The First Avenger," It's OK but still, this is the best Captain America film we're ever going to get
","I was an avid reader of the Captain America comic up until the mid-nineties, about the time it seemed to be coming off the rails (about the time he got caught in the meth lab explosion). I think it was revitalized later and gained popularity as a result (he was saved by a Red Skull blood transfusion? Bucky Barnes resurfaces as a villain, the Winter Soldier! The discovery of a black Captain America from WWII! a Super Hero civil war--culminating in Cap beating up Iron Man(!?) Wow! I dropped off at THE wrong time, apparently). Still, I was delighted that they were making a gigantic summer movie out of it and getting fully behind it. Top-notch talent was being put together for the project with the SFX to go with. The result is what I expected: A huge, action-packed (though it does drag a bit at times) movie that's immensely entertaining. They really get the character right, as best as a condensed movie version could be expected to. It's amazing how the writers and director deal with how he becomes Captain America, how he gets his abilities, how he gets his name (he's a propaganda piece, selling war bonds). The costume he uses on his U.S. bond tour is just about exactly the one from the comic (sans chain mail). Then, when Rogers chances upon real action, his costume is modified for real combat. There are some bad one-liners in it, which shows that the production may have been more rushed than, say, Thor or Iron Man, which where more polished. But overall I found that Joe Johnston (highly underrated as a director) finds just the right combination of heart, fantasy, and action here. Time should be good to Captain America: the First Avenger.",7,0,4,5 August 2011
Oblivion," Been there seen that
","IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REASONS NOT TO SEE OBLIVION, THIS IS ONE REVIEW FOR YOU TO READ. IF NOT, SKIP IT. 64 years in the future, Earth is a wasteland after the moon is destroyed by an invading alien army and the war that follows. We won the war but the planet 'was ruined.' A few humans have stayed behind to maintain the water that is left, which is being used for the rest of the human race that relocated to a space station (called Tet) orbiting Earth, or to Titan, a moon of Saturn. Now, depending on your movie taste, that synopsis either makes you roll your eyes and groan or makes you want to hear more. Somebody thought it was a good idea and it became Oblivion. But sometimes a good idea doesn't realize its potential. Such is the case here. It does well through the first half or so. Tom Cruise is Jack (of course) Harper who is a 'drone maintenance tech (so far as he knows)' left on Earth. Drones fly around protecting, or so Jack is told, these giant water-collecting machines that are sucking all of the planet's seawater and converting it into fusion energy (although it is not made clear how this energy is transferred to Tet)I was never sure. From Tet, a NASA operative named Sally runs the pod show. Jack even has a lovely redheaded British live-in assistant Vicka who's a sort of dispatcher/eye-in-the-sky. Of course, they also provide each other with companionship. So when a transport pod full of sleeping NASA people (just happens to) fall from the sky within sight of where Jack has a secret cabin by a lake, leaving one survivor (the rest are killed by a drone—more on that later), his WIFE, things get complicated. The movie also starts coming apart at its weak seams.Many conventions of sci-fi are present here: The future. Aliens. Apocalypse. Space travel. Delta-sleep. Machines that seem to have their own vengeful personalities. A rag-tag band of survivors who've begun an insurgency against the oppressive aliens (and have a nuke dammit, and are ready to use it). Memory wiped. Clones. The moon destroyed. I'm sure there's more. Which is all fine, as long as it's crafted into a good movie. Not long after we meet Julia, we meet the aforementioned insurgents, led by Beech (Morgan Freeman, who is in every other movie made). Explosions and drone chases through the post-war landscape ensue. It all culminates in a secret plot to sneak a nuclear bomb inside the alien mothership (which turns out to BE the giant triangle above Earth that was supposed to be Mission Control) using one of its drones, reprogrammed. As I said, there are MANY oft-used elements of sci-fi here. Some are PLOT elements seemingly lifted from other sci-fi movies like, say, the (gulp) superior Independence Day. That brings me to my main question about the movie's climax: How is it that these aliens who have radically advanced technology and can detect who a person is just by their DNA and detect their emotions from the inside of a spacecraft—can't detect the 10 nuclear fuel cells it knew were missing on board the ship as well? Just wondering. ID4's nuclear endgame has similar issues but at least it has a sense of cigar-smoking humor about it. And as far as Oblivion goes, 'F—k you, Sally.' That's the best line you could come up with? Really? Bottom line here is that I was disappointed with Oblivion. It's based on a graphic novel and offers striking visuals (SFX and sound design really are great here, the only thing earning it a 5-star rating from me). Its footage makes for a good trailer. Futuristic action and explosions always do. And movie staples like Cruise and Freeman (too bad they needed to ruin the mystery of the Scavs by showing Freeman in the trailers).One thought occurred to me watching Vicka interact with Sally. The story could be an metaphor for how lower-level employees in large companies feel about their bosses. These mysterious, distant, unfeeling pencil and numbers pushers who care nothing for the real work going on in the trenches. They see everyone as the same people (in Oblivion's case, literally) and easily replaceable with the next sucker who comes along.",6,6,11,10 May 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Greatest Show on Earth
","What I appreciate most about 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is how, from the very beginning, it sits you down and just starts shamelessly pummeling you with the story of the rings and Middle Earth. There's this cool confidence evident in all of it, like the film is alive and believes in itself. The opening montage, the prologue that explains the history of the ring, is as good an excuse to not walk into a movie late as there has ever been. What follows is, in terms of modern filmmaking, a revolution. Peter Jackson leaves nothing to chance. He doesn't believe in the saying, 'you can't please everyone.' His first installment of the trilogy makes sure a good time is had by all. It's the ultimate in film entertainment.
'Ring' has the inside track to not only get nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but to win. Like 'Gladiator' last year, 'Ring' is the greatest overall achievement in filmmaking of the year. Its only legitimate acting nominee would be Ian McKellen, who deserves a Supporting Role nomination. If not, there is a precedent for films winning BP without any acting nominations. 'The Last Emperor' did it in '87. Before that you have to go waaay back to the 50s for 'Greatest Show on Earth,' 'Around the World in 80 Days,' and 'Gigi' to find others who accomplished this feat. It hasn't happened much, but it could happen again this year.Grade for 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring': A",10,0,0,4 January 2002
Man of Steel," Should successfully restart the franchise BUT...
","Most Superman or Batman movie fans would name 'it's dark' as Christopher NOlan's main signature on Man of Steel. But I say the man Christopher Nolan signature here is the non-linear storytelling style. It worked for Batman Begins and it works here. The way story information is disseminated is impressive. This is carried out through a combination of the writing, directing and editing. It all works together well, culminating in a really new kind of movie experience. This retelling of the Superman story highlights the sci-fi aspect of Superman's origin. It features huge fights between super-beings, more destruction seemingly on NYC than we've ever seen (oh sorry Metropolis), but it's all wrapped into a coherent story that should satisfy any movie fan, and targets both super hero fans and sci-fi fans. That's why the re-introduction of the Superman brand to the marketplace was inevitable. Sci fi and super hero movies are the two top-grossing genres there are.I have a couple of nitpicky questions, however, that go toward the Superman story in general. The first will become more of an issue as the years go by and it is: Why do the people of Krypton look exactly like humans? Humans who all look like they're from Kansas? And here is the biggest issue with the people of Krypton all looking like they're from Kansas: The coincidence of the spaceship containing Krypton's last son LANDING IN KANSAS. This issue will never be resolved because the Superman story is too old and too beloved to be altered.Next question: Why does Superman have muscles? Simple answer is that he's strong, right? How can he be strong without muscles? Well in both Superman 2 (the half-Richard Donner one) and in Man of Steel, we have super villains with less muscle than Superman who seem to be faster and stronger than our hero. The explanation has to do with Earth being closer to its sun than Krypton was and having a different gravitational force as well (which really actually answers little). So then, back to the original question: Why would Clark Kent/Superman have muscles? How would he have even developed muscles? It would be like Neal Armstrong living on the moon and lifting weights there and expecting to develop muscles. He'd have to lift cars instead of dumbbells. So I just don't get it.Still, all that aside, I was entertained.",7,1,3,24 June 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Mark your calendars: Coming May 2014 Kung Fu Panda 3
","I went in knowing that the first KFP could not be topped. The newness of the concept, the opening fantasy sequence, the Tai Lung escape scene, the clumsy humor of Po, I could go on...no beating it or duplicating it. The sequel doesn't beat it. But it's still very good. And for very different reasons from those that made the original was so awesome. In KFP2 the Furious Five have grown, moved on. They've improved their kung fu. They work as a unit, with a new leader, Po the Dragon Warrior, whom they've fully accepted. The banter between the team is raised to a new level. The rocky relationship between Tigress and Po is replaced by friendship. The action scenes where they're all fighting together are...something not seen in the first movie, actually. The story is excellent, centering on Po's search for his real parents. It's a little bit more intense than the first, with a lot more weapons used than last time. It's just more of an action movie. There were a lot of kids there when I saw it(ages 6-12 I'd guess) and I heard a lot of comments during and after the movie. Universal approval. There will be another in this series. Hopefully we'll see more of Shifu, who only shows up at the beginning and end of '2.'",Null,0,1,21 July 2011
Spider-Man," Green Goblin: 'What's my motivation?'
","The first half of 'Spider-Man' really is perfect. It's everything you could hope for in a comic book movie. It's lighthearted, yet dramatic, as well as exciting. It is the reason to go see it. The film also has problems that any this huge, with this much at stake, is likely to have. Some are merely inconsistencies with the comic, which I can't argue with. For one, Peter fires the webbing out of his wrists, which he never did in the comic. In the comic, he fits his costume with web-shooters that fire super strong webbing. But having the webs fire from his own wrists in the film creates some nice comic moments and is more economical, story-wise, than having manufactured web shooters. So this is easily excused.In true comic-book fashion, the hero and the villain are created nearly simultaneously, in completely unrelated events. I was able to shun this aside as well. That's just a Hollywood coincidence and is consistent with comic storytelling.Another aspect of the comic that the film misses is Spider-Man's sarcastic sense of humor. In the comic, in even the most dire situations, Spider-Man always found some wise-crack, which was sometimes just to hide his own fear. It's like trash talk, of the NBA variety. This is one of the most appealing and unique aspects about the Spider-Man character and the film barely touches on it.  The film runs into real problems, though, with the Green Goblin (and I don't mean the problems he causes Spider-Man). Norman Osborn's mental breakdown, triggered by his business failings, is well represented by Willem Dafoe. The performance is great, but it doesn't look like he was allowed to have any fun, the way Jack Nicholson was as the Joker, Michelle Pfiefer as Cat Woman, and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Even Ian McKellen as Magneto (in 'X-Men') looked like he savored every moment of that role. But the Goblin of 'Spider-Man' is just an extreme version of every character Dafoe's ever played (I had this flashback of 'Shadow of the Vampire' when Osborn gasps upon seeing the blood on Peter's arm in the Thanksgiving scene). There's nothing surprising about the character, nor any moments that let you know the film isn't taking itself too seriously. A film like this needs to show that it is aware of its own triviality, something usually done through the villain. Sam Raimi doesn't get this. That isn't even the film's biggest flaw. This flaw could have been fixed with one or two small changes and would have made a huge difference. The Goblin's motivation for wanting to kill Spider Man-what is it? The film never gives a convincing one. Even a comic book movie needs this. For some reason, writer David Koepp has the Goblin decide that Spider-Man can't be beat (he's 'virtually invincible'), so he asks the hero to join him to do what, exactly? When Spider-Man refuses, the Goblin gets angry and tries to kill him. He goes after his family and friends just to bait him. This concept is just, well, dumb. For one thing, the whole appeal of the Spider-Man character as a superhero is that he IS vulnerable. He does have superhuman strength, but bullets can hurt him. He can be killed by things that would kill normal people, like bullets and fire. All he has going for him is his spider-sense, his strength, his agility. Another point: this vendetta of the Goblin's isn't even consistent with the Norman Osborn character Koepp had built up to that point. Osborn is a guy who blames other people, homicidally, for his own failings. He doesn't get the DOD contract and kills the men who said no to him. Spider-Man saying no didn't make any difference one way or the other. It didn't cause any failing on Osborn's part. Now, if Spider-Man had caused the Goblin to fail in some way, or stood in his way and created the perception that it was Spider-Man's fault, well, that would have been a different story. As it is, though, this lack of motivation leaves a huge hole through the middle of the movie. At least for me.Grade: B-",7,0,0,9 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Just rent 'Point Break' instead
","'Fast and the Furious' is largely a re-hash of 'Point Break.' The idea behind both films is similar: undercover cop infiltrates youth subculture to bust a faction of it that's committing real crimes. In 'PB' the guy blending into the scenery is Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who you'd easily mistake for a surfer. Johnny U. is actually interesting, actually seems to have a past, a life, a personality. But while 'Fast' protagonist Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is heroic and likeable, we're never told anything about the guy. He wants to make detective, and so is doing his undercover tour of duty busting some auto mechanics turned bad. That's about all we're told, though. His character is defined by the circumstances he's in, not by the person he actually is.  Character and plot isn't exactly director Rob Cohen's number one priority here of course. For sheer high-speed thrills, 'Fast' delivers the goods. Cohen saves the best for last. Three big high-speed chase scenes close it out. The finest of them, also the best action scene I've seen this year, is another hijacking involving a tractor/trailer. This time the trucker is ready for them, though. An exhilarating mixture of cross-cutting, directing and stunts, this was expert filmmaking. Then the film's creators find a way to keep it going, plotting a race car versus motorbike sequence, followed by a good old-fashioned old-versus-new drag race with railroad tracks serving as the finish line. Of course, there's a train coming at high speed. That's good stuff. By the time it's all over, you really feel like you got your money's worth. For me though, without a strong plot to push it along, it's all a waste.  Women in the audience might be disappointed that only one girl (Michelle Rodriguez of 'Girlfight') gets to race (well, she wins anyway). The primary use this film has for women is showing them scantily-clad, putting themselves up as trophies for the winners of these races. Using women as props is nothing new to the action genre. Still, going into 'Fast' I had hoped for better. Haven't we come to a point in movie history where it's safe to expect something for everyone? Whether you're a chick or a dude, you're unlikely to identify with any character in this.
Even a movie as dumbed-down as this tries to grow a brain now and again. One such moment in `Fast' involves Chad Lindbergh's character, Jesse. He's a genius about anything automotive. He builds the engines legendary street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's real name would've worked better) puts in his cars. He says the only reason he didn't go to, say, MIT, is that he suffers from A.D.D. With Jesse, the film raises the question of how a great mind may or may not be going to waste simply because he couldn't pay attention in class. He represents an entire demographic of kids with great potential on  the fast-track to nowhere. Who to blame? A society too dependent on social classes, diplomas and college degrees? Does a lack of direction justify choosing the criminal path? The film opens the issue, but has little to actually say about it.  'The Fast and the Furious' commits one too many transgressions against my sensibilities to recommend it, even on the strength of the action sequences. But do see 'Point Break': more action, more style, much more of a plot, and better characters. It really is the whole package and besides, surfing is still cooler than street racing.

Ocean's Eleven," Easy money
","Danny Ocean and his co-conspirators are looking to do the impossible. They're not even as careful as they should be about it. They want to see just how far they can push their luck. So it's appropriate that the establishment they are knocking over is a casino (actually, three casinos that share one ridiculously secure vault). Steven Soderbergh is trying to continue a streak of great directorial efforts, to give us an encore after winning an Academy Award. To do it, he's assembled a cast that reads more like a producer's wish list. Soderbergh got all of 'em. Knocking over three casinos in one night? Impossible. The guy responsible for two out of five Best Picture nominees last year making a movie that people will want to watch starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Matt Damon? Well heck, that's just easy. Whether it's good or not is a different proposition and, perhaps, a moot one.     
The film takes no time to explore what's at stake for any of the eleven, except Ocean himself. Each man's take is not that much in movie terms, roughly $13.6 million. So why risk it? Even exploring the lives of three of four characters would have sufficed. So I guess they just want money. For what? Well, because--the house always wins. Elliott Gould's character, when the idea is proposed to him, tells Ocean he'll need a crew just as crazy as he is. So assemble he does, many crazy fellows. But what exactly makes them so crazy? Why are they selected? Soderbergh didn't want to spend too much time on assembling the group, so he had to leave much crucial information out. And it hurts. Not that Soderbergh and HIS crew don't put on a good show anyway. He's brought several actors together who are used to carrying films by themselves and asked them to play minor character roles. Budget plummets, net profits soar. This move should represent something very positive in the filmmaking community--the idea that acting is fun and work is work (though even the reduced rate each A-lister here was paid is more than the average American makes in ten lifetimes). The problem is they risked nothing. This film could not miss. Everyone involved is obviously having a blast, but the film never finds a soul. It's too busy being cool and clever.   So cool is 'Ocean's Eleven' in fact, that I missed that there's barely a curse word, no sex, no violence. Nil. A caper movie like this typically has plenty of each, but not this. Not that  Soderbergh seems to be necessarily avoiding them. These things that are meant to add something to films--sex, violence, profanity--are like a subject in a conversation that just never comes up. Soderbergh shoots this one himself, as he did with 'Traffic.' I wonder how much the guy actually directed on this one. With this kind of acting talent, who tries to direct? Even before he won his Best Director Oscar, he was probably thinking about a project in which he could be mostly a cameraman. That's why 'Eleven' falls far short of 'Traffic,' 'The Limey,' and 'Out of Sight.' But then, you can't hit one out of the park every time you step up to the plate.Grade: B-",7,0,1,13 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," War 'Light'
","Some pre-opening weekend hype-mongers dubbed 'Pearl Harbor' 'Titanic'-meets-'Saving Private Ryan.' I'd be lying if I said it wasn't entertaining. But the action sequences aren't anything close to the complex, calculated sinking luxury liner in Cameron's film or the beginning and ending battle sequences of Spielberg's.  Director Michael Bay does nothing groundbreaking here. He shows a lot of improvement since the sloppy 'Armageddon,' but he still depends too much on special effects and not enough on editing. An example is what could have been the film's money shot--that bomb's-eye-view shot everyone saw in the trailer, resulting in the Arizona being destroyed. The armor-piercing shell drops all the way down into the lower deck, coming to a rest on a million pounds of gunpowder (it's true). According to eyewitnesses, the explosion all but ripped the ship in two pieces, shooting it straight up in the air about twenty feet. Bay does the explosion in one brief, wide shot that doesn't even look real.Bay tries to one-up Cameron by hiring an Oscar winner, Randall Wallace(`Braveheart') to write his script. But 'Pearl Harbor' still feels like it was written by committee, in some Santa Monica Boulevard board room. This is due no doubt to the project not originating with Wallace. He was hired to give a story to Bay's vision. I can imagine the shopping list Bay handed to Wallace: `Write whatever you want, but it has to have these scenes, these shots, in it. And another thing, make it PG-13! Oh and remember, it has to appeal to women AND 14-year-old boys' and so on and so forth. So I don't hold Wallace responsible for the just-average film that ended up on movie screens. A man's got to work, after all. One thing Bay didn't ask, apparently, was to keep it a reasonable length. I could excuse the over three-hour length if the story had moved along a little better.Bay did get his PG-13 so you're never afraid you're going to see something gruesome. No pun intended, but this factor seriously cripples the movie. Sure there's blood, but the hospital scenes never get more intense than a given episode of 'ER.' The scene in which Evelyn has to go outside and mark the status of the wounded in lipstick is another missed opportunity. Looking at the dirtied, limping crowd I couldn't see how any one of them was more critically wounded than the other. All I saw was a bunch of men covered with oil, in which case they don't need a nurse, they need a fire hose. There were more disturbing images in Bay's 'The Rock,' and that movie is practically a comedy! By the time a truly disturbing image comes along, of a net being hoisted out of the water filled with bloody corpses, it seems out of place and overly grisly. I truly wish this project had been entrusted to someone like John McTiernan, Roger Donaldson, Wolfgang Petersen, Ed Zwick, Joe Johnston, Oliver Stone (well maybe not), Philip Kaufman--anyone who's willing to do something meaningful with this material and not just have Summer blockbuster tunnel vision. Unfortunately, hiring Bay was the only way to justify what staging the two-hour attack would surely cost. Say what you will about the man as a director, but he hasn't had a dud yet. A short career of nothing but box office hits.I would have much rather seen a complex story that dealt more with the attack itself and who knew what, the inside story, something like Donaldson's 'Thirteen Days.' I don't need that many special effects. Really, I don't. Save your money. Just give me an engaging, interesting story (think 'Hunt for Red October'). With 'Pearl Harbor' you get this cumbersome back and forth thing: love story, Japanese planning attack, love story, Naval Intelligence meeting about possibility of an attack, love story, etcetera, etcetera. None of it crosses paths until, and not even then really, the attack itself. After seeing this, I now want to read up more on the actual events. The film makes no serious attempt to explain who knew what and when. All you really come away with, if the film represents the extent of your knowledge of the attack, is that Naval intelligence saw all the signs that an attack was possible, but basically ignored them.I wouldn't be surprised to see this get nominated for an Academy Award or two. It's just good enough to leave it open for some technical awards like visual effects, sound, editing, things of that nature. But they couldn't possibly nominate this for Best Picture. Could they? Well, consider this. By this time last year two BP nominees, including 'Gladiator,' the eventual winner, had already been released. And what has there been this year? Exactly. Here's hoping 2001 is a late bloomer.Grade: C-",4,0,0,5 June 2001
No Man's Land," a microcosm of the Balkan Conflict
","'No Man's Land' appears to be a microcosm of the 1992-1995 Balkan conflict. There are many interesting, subtle hints at this--Cera lying on top of the live mine for instance seems to represent the Yugoslavia as it was after the fall of Communism, a bomb that will go off at the slightest disturbance.
There's a prevailing trueness to the whole film. Ciki (the Bosnian Croat) and Nino (the Bosnian Serb) don't become best buds. There's no attempt to erase centuries of animosity between two cultures in one day. They do lower their guard enough to find the solution that gets both out alive (both have their opportunities to kill each other, but do not). This is another part of the microcosm the film represents. No one expects the Croats, Muslims, and Serbs to all get along instantly--they just want the killing to stop. Each man blames the other for 'starting the war.' The Muslim and Croat majority voted independence for Bosnia, leading most Bosnian Serbs, wishing to remain united with Serbia as Yugoslavia, to rebel against the new government. Each man believes he has a legitimate claim against the other.
The UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) soldiers represent, well, the U.N.  The events that unfold once the French and British UN troops get involved in the trench between Serb and Croat/Muslim lines demonstrate what happens when a third party gets involved in someone else's battle. We see the futility of a 'protective force' trying to stay out of the conflict. 'There can be no neutrality in the face of murder,' says the French UN captain, who can never properly define his role. Maybe the best thing 'No Man's Land' has to offer is the way it puts you right there in the middle of the conflict. You get a real sense of the sociological texture of that time and place, and how out of place the horror of war is among these seemingly civilized, modern people. You wonder if the same people living together in a different place wouldn't be fighting at all. You get a sense that all that stands in the way of peace is history-or the unwillingness to let go of it.",9,0,1,20 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Ladies and gentlemen: the future
","In the category of how about that' : the most technically advanced film in some time is set in 1899. Baz Luhrmann's purpose is to capture the energy and spirit of that time period, portraying the Moulin Rouge as the Ultimate Party of that or any day. The belief is that back then people were less inhibited, less guarded than now. A slight disappointment is that there is only one scene showing the club in all its wanton glory. Shortly after, it's converted into a theater for the 'Spectacular Spectacular.' The first club scene is milked for all it's worth, though. This is electric, eye-popping cinema that really pulls you into the story. It would have been tough to top.The story isn't the most imaginative ever, but sticks to the format of the musical romance out of necessity. The film works so well because the story is so simple. Anything more complex would be lost in the kinetic pace of the visuals. 'Moulin Rouge' is really like a roller coaster: one second you're moving slow and easy, the next you're blasted forward a hundred miles an hour. Even if another director could have thought up some of the visual ideas Luhrmann comes up with, they'd likely dismiss them as impossible to pull off. The film is like nothing you've ever seen before and yet, oddly familiar at the same time.  Luhrmann seems determined to give you something cool to look at every second. You're literally afraid to blink for fear of missing the slightest thing. The super zoom' is a marvel to watch, the shot that starts miles away from its target, then pulls you forward at light speed until you're right on top of it. But this isn't all just computer wizardry. It's how the director, for instance, will use two different color filters in one shot, or adds energy to a scene by editing together shots filmed at different speeds. Astonishing. I'm an Oscar junkie so I'm always looking out for films that will tempt the almighty Academy. Certainly the best film of the year so far, I could see 'Moulin Rouge' nearly running the table: Sound, visual effects, cinematography, editing, directing, original song for 'Come What May,' acting for Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo (who somehow plays a dwarf). An original score nomination would be a toughie, as Luhrmann pieces this one together from thirty or so classic songs from several genres, re-imagining them in the context of this story. I'll probably be proven wrong as the inevitable crop of quality movies enter the fold beginning in August. One thing is sure, though: 'Moulin Rouge' will not be forgotten.Grade: A",10,0,1,27 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," Welcome to the mind of David Lynch
","Many words could describe 'Mulholland Drive': interesting, unnerving, strange. I'll avoid throwing around terms like 'mind-bending' or 'original.' I can't tell if something is original if I don't completely understand it. It may be exactly like something else for all I know, were I to piece this all together. Something tells me I should be glad I don't understand the way David Lynch's mind works.My suspicion is that Lynch neither wants, nor cares if the audience understands this. This is his vision. He had complete control over this project so what you see is exactly what he wants you to see. Audiences haven't seemed put off by the incomprehensible plot, if it can even be called a plot. I do know that there is sense to be made of this. Out there. Somewhere.When we're first introduced to Naomi Watts' character, Betty, she's an aspiring actress just arriving in Hollywood, ready to go out on auditions. She describes to 'Coco' her landlady how she'd never even been out of Ontario before and now she's in this 'dream place.' That line floats over our heads with little consequence but it's the key to this whole thing. Los Angeles is a dream. It's realities are stranger than any fiction a lunatic could make up. The entire film is this character imagining the way things might have been, and remembering things that happened. This is all intermingled with real events she did not witness. At the end, you'll find yourself guessing what was real and what was imagined. And who people really are.This project represents another personal triumph for this respected film artist. His best work is of the experimental kind, which 'Mulholland' is. 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks' also come to mind. Lynch is pleased because he didn't have to compromise anything. He did not re-edit 'Mulholland' to 'dumb it down' to a level that could be more easily understood by a larger portion of the audience. His last film was totally linear, simple, followed the rules, and was rated G. On his latest, Lynch more than makes up for these departures.    Somehow, and I believe this effect to be intentional, I didn't want it to end. The images and music, lighting, photography, performances, for some reason leave you wanting more. You're not anticipating where the story will go next but rather, what you'll see next, where you'll be taken next.Lynch isn't trying to be weird. He just sees the world that much differently and happens to know how to translate that vision to film. I don't see a Best Picture nomination for this, but a Best Director Oscar nomination is likely, given Lynch's obvious control over this material and execution of his vision.   Though the story of 'Mulholland Falls' is still lost to me, I have managed to figure out what it's about. If anyone else who reads this wants to contradict me, feel free--I have only begun my study of this film. Film history may show that this film is a manifestation of the way David Lynch sees the town in which he works. It's not a protest, but simply, one perspective. There have been many films about the clash between dreams and reality in Tinseltown. This is the Lynch version. There's nothing political or high-minded this, it's just pure unadulterated filmmaking. Lynch has outsmarted everyone except himself and that is what matters most.Grade: A-",9,1,2,1 November 2001
Black Hawk Down," So ugly, you can't possibly look away
","The presence of U.S. forces in Somalia was right and just. It's just that this particular operation was vastly flawed. Precautions that should have been taken were not, for the simple reason that is alluded to in the film: American arrogance. This mission was supposed to be easy. On paper, it all worked out. In and out in half an hour--wishful thinking, I'd say. Hindsight, though, is always 20/20 isn't it? Even as General Garrison (Sam Shephard) is telling his squad leaders not to underestimate this enemy, the sin has already been committed. By going in with no air cover, they've already got one hand tied behind their backs. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) tells his men, this is what we do, we're elite, remember that' to build confidence, but with no basis on which to make the statement.  The man had never seen combat before. Many of the hundred or so soldiers who drop into the middle of one of the most hostile, armed, dangerous spots on the planet at that time, Mogadishu, had likewise never seen combat. But this is what they are trained for. This kind of operation is what the elite armed forces live for. Ridley Scott's direction is what makes 'Black Hawk' work as well as it does. The script, more often than not, gets in the way, making what could really have been a masterpiece, just a great film. The sometimes ridiculous dialogue you know no one would ever say, is the only evidence that they were in any hurry to finish. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, how in the world did he get THAT shot?' One of my favorites was what appeared to be done with a camera mounted on the front of one of the Black Hawks, pointed toward the back, filming as the copter flew through a dense cloud of smoke from tire fires in the streets below. Awesome.I submit that Scott can't NOT make an intense film. Ask him for a women's film and he gives you 'Thelma and Louise' or 'GI Jane.' Ask the man for an action movie and he gives you 'Gladiator.' I'm surprised it's taken him this long to make his first war film (GI Jane is a military movie, but by no means a war movie), but it's the kind of film we always knew he'd excel at once he finally got around to it.I enjoyed this mostly because it's a well-executed film in most every respect. If the Mogadishu operation hadn't been flubbed so badly, such a well-executed film wouldn't have been made about it. It's a war film the likes of which we've never seen. It's so well made that you never fear that the director is going to slip up. You're not just interested in what's going on--you're riveted.The actual events are more horrifying than any script writer could come up with, or would even dare to write. In this case, though, something rare: you don't feel like you're being lied to here. You don't feel like anything is being glamorized. Scott presses on, compromising nothing. This is not an interpretation of what happened, but a dramatization. This happened too recently to do otherwise, keeping in mind the families of the dead. I will say, though, that much seems to be left up in the air at the end. Despite Garrison's revised initiative, the rangers killed in the second helicopter crash were left behind. We're left wondering exactly how those bodies are eventually recovered. Maybe this is the film's way of saying this is as much as I'm going to tell you. If you want to know more, look for yourself.' The details of the operation are well documented by news organizations and in Mark Bowden's book. Grade:A-",9,0,0,16 February 2002
Avatar," Dances With Wolves...In Space!
","Was that how the pitch meeting for Avatar started? You have to admit, there are parallels, in story and in theme, with the 1990 successful-in-every-possible-way Kevin Costner film. A soldier joins the ranks of an oppressed culture and becomes one of them. Eventually he is fighting against the society he swore to protect. Seems to me that in the look, the culture, even language he gives to the Na'vi, James Cameron wants them remind you of native Americans. I thought as I watched it, how could the American military be so cold as to force people off of their land out of greed? Ah but we did do it. Avatar is meant to symbolize what happened to America's aboriginal people.",10,2,4,10 March 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Run away
","I am usually not one to hate on movies too much. I have seen the other 4 of the films in this series. I did not read any of the books. The other films were intriguing. They were entertaining enough. Not that I care all that much, but this finale was not the ending even the most passive of Twilight followers (me) could hope for. For four films, the story just hinted, just toed the line of complete ridiculous stupidity. The wolves that first appeared in New Moon. That was tough. I laughed inside. But I got over it and enjoyed the rest of the films. The wolves arguing with each other though mindspeak in B.D. Part One--again, tough. Again, Twilight almost lost me, but I hung on. Then, as has been the tradition with all of the others in this series, I'm out of town, in a small town, a (way) secondary movie market and it's one of 3 films showing and there's nothing else to do. Bond, Legend of the Guardians, and Twilight. Already saw Bond. No brainer, right? Anyone see Legend of the Guardians? Do I wish we'd gone to that one instead. But we didn't. So anyway there we were. Part Dos. Nice opening credits sequence (seriously. it was good work). Bella Swan (seriously, going way back to the first Twilight, that's her name. Bella Swan) is now a vampire. She's a 'newborn' though, which we learned in Eclipse meant that she would have difficulty controlling her thirst for mortal blood. Being a newborn means was also stronger than mature vampires. She and Edward, a weaker, mature vampire, have a daughter. A half human daughter named, eh, Renesmee (another shaky moment from B.D. Uno). She's half mortal. Oh God Bella might eat her! Seriously! The movie spends time on this issue for all of two minutes. the whole newborn storyline comes and goes in 3 minutes. I don't know how much of this territory Stephanie Meyer covered in the book but--this is rich ground to mine. Spend some time there! Spend a whole movie there! Instead we move on to the 'evil' vampires, the Vulturi, and their mistaken impression that Renesmee is a baby vampire (even worse than a newborn), an immortal, which breaks all existing vampire codes on the books. She must be destroyed immediately. The Cullen family must gather together an international coalition of vampires, summoned from the ends of the earth, to attest to Renesmee's mortality, and therefore, innocence. Many vampires from different cultures come to town--France, an unnamed middle eastern nation, U.K. Oh and the Amazons. Tall women dressed in tribal attire who understand English. You know, Amazons. You mean there really are tall warrior women living deep in the jungles of South America? Oh yes and they even wear face paint. And know English. (crickets chirping) And we're done. I did sit through the rest of the movie and found out that another missing link was found--again deep in the Amazon rain forest, again, perfect English, who was half mortal, half immortal. Before we got to that though, there was this protracted sequence of completely bloodless fighting, mauling, beheading, and severed head burning. A squandered opportunity to redeem the movie slightly and actually kill off a main character or two, seeing as the entire thing ends up just being a vision anyway. Oh and Bella's father--STILL doesn't know she's a vampire. I'd ask for another film for all this stuff to be worked out but I'd be afraid of what we'd get.",2,11,27,25 November 2012
From Hell," Conspiracy Theory
","The Hughes brothers have again infused social commentary into their innovative filmmaking. The theme is familiar: The affluent turning a blind eye to the impoverished of 19th century British society echoes much about today's world. Like virtually any period film, 'From Hell' is intended to reflect something about the present times, demonstrating that no matter how much things change, history repeats itself in different forms.'From Hell' deals with social issues in its own way. Normally I'd say that art peddled as entertainment should stay off the soapbox unless it's prepared to be serious. 'From Hell' tries to do both and misses most of the time. Still, it's a decent thriller/murder mystery with a definite horror film structure, but still passes as a historical piece.
The script is where the film runs into its biggest problems.  Foremost of them is that it may take itself too seriously. The slayings are certainly nothing to chuckle about, but some humor would have provided some much-needed balance. They could easily have sacrificed the love story between Abberline (Johnny Depp) and Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), which never finds its feet.Even in the late 19th century, these ritual killings seemed ancient; they were hideous and barbaric, like something out of some long forgotten age, committed by someone whose state of mind should not still exist in a modern society. The killer's savagery woke people up to the enduring possibility of such acts, just when civilization really started to seem civil.'From Hell' takes liberties with the truth, following closely to the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. It stays faithful to the details of the murders, based on the actual police and coroner's reports. Mary Kelly's post-mortem for instance, is re-enacted verbatim by the examiner. Kelly's murder was the last and by far the most gruesome. Little is actually shown but it's true that your imagination can come up with far worse images than a make-up effects person can.No one ever figured out for certain who the Ripper was, which affords comic book artists and filmmakers the opportunity to romanticize the character for profit--here done at the expense of the royal family (always an easy target) and the freemasons. But at least these artists offer a reasonable, original revelation of the Ripper's identity that just happens to make good cinema.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," please don't feed the cash cow
","There is a classic early 90's 'Far Side' cartoon of 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS,' which stands for 'Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society.' Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon of what I'd call the 'societal embrace.' People look for things to identify with to make them feel like they're a part of mass culture. Enough people give this product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. People are more likely to decide something's good if someone else tells them it's good, even though they would have felt indifferent otherwise. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter. (pronounced 'Paw-TUH' because I've rarely heard it said otherwise. Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Ridley Scott, James Bond, Austin Powers, Shrek-talking like a stuffy brit is definitely cool again.)
With that, I hereby begin DLHPSSS (Didn't Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Society). The first half hour or so I found interesting. Then I noticed that the film continued to roll, but there was still no sign of an actual story. Poor cute little Harry had no objective. There was no jeopardy. Two hours in, finally, something. There's this magic stone created by the world's most powerful wizard (probably all that's preventing him from mass ridicule over being named Dumbledore), see and-oh never mind. By that time I had ceased to care. I can't remember ever caring less how a film was going to end (or wishing more that one simply would). The ending that did eventually come, frankly, sucked. Then they add to the agony by reminding us that there was the points contest between the houses. I was actually happy when the Slitherin house won. They even ruined that moment for me.
On the way out, my brother, whom I saw this with, made a good analogy. He said the film was like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or some other Disneyland ride where you just travel through and watch various animatronic things jump out at you. There's no real story, it's just a bunch of neat things to look at. Same thing with 'Harry Potter.' This is the most offensive kind of film to me, one that passes itself off as cinema, but is really just assorted eye candy. The effects and sets and cute kid actors are designed to make you feel like you've been entertained when you've really just been gypped.
It's been a long time since 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' has been released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place. I sensed, knowing that director Chris Columbus had stayed nearly verbatim faithful to the book, that this was a cash cow just waiting to be fed. There was no risk involved for the film's creators, who knew its audience came built in. Now it's up for a Golden Laurel award, which is the Producer's Guild of America's year-end pat on the back for 'excellence in producing a motion picture,' which translates as 'best job of making lots of money on a motion picture.' (Why do movie producers need a guild? No one knows. No one wants to ask. But that's for another time.) The award should be replaced by something that looks more like the one they give the winners of the MTV Movie Awards: a gold-encrusted bucket of popcorn. 'Harry Potter' producer David Heyman should certainly win for creating the 'movie project that moved the most popcorn at cineplexes worldwide.'I never believed in the 'Harry Potter' propaganda and I was right. But there I was, buying a ticket anyway. I sensed a hesitation from the vendor, actually, when I heard 'Harry Paw-TUH' come out of my mouth, like he was giving me one last chance to change my mind. ('Dude, are you sure you want to see THAT movie?') Curiosity got the best of me. My solace is that there are still a couple of people out there who haven't seen it who can still be saved. Maybe I should have seen it sooner.Grade: D",2,2,4,27 January 2002

I'm sure she's written a fine book (yes, I'm the one who hasn't read it yet.) There's a big difference between cinematic storytelling and the dramatic arc of a novel. A novel can survive on details and character alone for a long time. 'Harry Potter' tries to survive for too much of its ungodly 2.5-hour length on just following Harry around before finally doing something with him. It's a shame because the character is actually intriguing.  I never bought into the 'Harry Potter' propaganda, but there I was, buying a ticket anyway.

Enemy at the Gates," Not as good as it could have been
","Director Jean-Jacques Annaud and DP Robert Fraisse come up with a visual style I'm not sure I like, but know I haven't seen before. They've figured out a way to make big effects shots (Stalingrad being bombed by German planes) look cool without looking like they used a lot of CG. For all I know, they did use a lot. I'm just saying. They definitely succeed in giving `Enemy' a murky, dirty, even smelly look.It's a really good war film too. Not that it's the best one ever, but it has all the necessary elements of a great war film:  Intricate, well-staged battle scenes; human drama; showing mankind both at its lowest and at its most noble.  The war movie brings together the elements of many genres to create a genre of its own.Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) enforced Stalin's policy of killing on sight any soldier retreating out of fear. Annaud's telling of this tale creates a fascinating paradox. Where does the courage to resist the Germans come from if the alternative is going on living in Stalin's society? Talk about choosing the lesser of two evils.The backbone of the story is how Hope alone may have stopped the advance of Nazi forces in Stalingrad at the end of 1943. A political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) believes the city will fall unless its soldiers are given some sign of hope. He decides they need a hero and finds one in Vassili Zaitsev, a sharp-shooter who may be the finest in all of Russia. No German high-ranking officer is safe with Zaitsev within range of him. Within days, he's a national hero (a true story) and is Germany's number one enemy. They send (or does he come of his own accord?) Major Koenig (Ed Harris), their own champion sniper, to find Zaitsev and kill him.Each man is aware of the other and try and guess the others' next move. Each side uses its champion to inspire its soldiers. The news of either man's death, especially by the other's bullet, could turn the tide of the battle unlike any other event. What a great idea for a film--and executed to near perfection to boot. The love story and other subplots that accompany the two champions' struggle serve their purpose--they give the characters their souls.In a perfect world, this film would have been made with Russian and German-speaking actors with subtitles for the benefit of us Westerners. I know I would have enjoyed it more and taken it much, much more seriously if they'd gone the other way with it. Annaud wasn't of like thinking with Ang Lee, who could easily have made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in english.Then again why wasn't, say, `Schindler's List' told in its characters' native tongues? The reasons for both films being in english are identical and, valid. In a film in which many language are spoken, sometimes it helps to unify the communication by having everyone speak one language.  It's also a matter of knowing who your audience is going to be. Annaud knew he wanted this film to target a Western audience. As long as Russians aren't offended by it being in english, I have no problem with it. But like I said, I'd rather it were in Russian and German.`Enemy at the Gates' is a fascinating, exciting film. It's got everything you could want in a war film, but also goes a step beyond. The Battle of Stalingrad is a key moment not only in the history of Russia, but in the history of the world. Unfortunately, this may be the only education some people receive on the subject. So be it. It's certainly better than nothing.Grade: B",8,0,1,2 April 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Genius
","'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those projects that would look like a hard sell to a producer upon close examination. Think about its premise: the story of the co-recipient of the Nobel prize for economics in 1994, a mathematical genius who was nearly overlooked because he was a paranoid schizophrenic. There is no doubt that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe's involvement was crucial to the film's coming to pass, but before one frame was shot, someone had to say 'yes.' Sylvia Nasar, upon whose novel the screenplay is based, must have been as surprised as anyone when producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard came calling. This is the kind of story that wouldn't seem to lend itself to film narrative-it may not have had it not been for Akiva Goldsman and Howard's approach to the material. They leave out details of John Nash's life, glamorize people and events, all in the name of creating the best film possible. The difficulty in adapting Nasar's novel was that so much of the story goes on in Nash's head. Goldsman's script is one of the best I've ever seen put to film. It's part human drama, part perception-tampering psychological thriller. Another challenge is Nash himself. By now it's well known that the man had an awful personality. Goldsman doesn't shy away from this, but turns it to the movie's advantage. Crowe's remarkable performance as Nash is heartbreaking. The man is obviously a very dedicated mathematician, with all these ideas, but doesn't have the disposition to get them across. He's his own worst enemy. The actual love story between Nash and his wife is altered, again, for the purposes of making the Nash character at all likeable. Nash had a son with Eleanor Stier before he ever met Alicia Larde. He never married Eleanor, who reportedly wished he would, but married Alicia. She divorced him in 1963 but did keep him from returning to a mental institution and stood by him while he fought his mental illness. The two were re-married recently.Any inaccuracies or liberties taken have been excused by phrases attached to 'Beautiful Mind' such as inspired by' or based on.' This film has critics scoffing over the way it oversimplifies Nash's ordeal, and yet those same critics turn around and unanimously bestow it with Best Picture nominations and awards, Top Ten list entries, praise for Goldsman, Howard, Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly. They need to remember that if Howard and company were for some reason forced to depict the events of Nash's life more truthfully, 'Mind' never would have been made or worse, it would have been an inferior film. The industry needs more pictures like this one. Not that anyone in Hollywood cares what critics think anyhow.Look for 'A Beautiful Mind' to earn Crowe his second straight Oscar. Wins for Connelly and Goldsman are also likely. A shame, though, that Roger Deakins has been getting such well-deserved attention for his cinematography on 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' his work on this film may be overlooked.Grade: A",10,0,1,20 January 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," My favorite film of 2005 (the first half, anyway)
","Doug Liman's short directing career is remarkable. Look at his track record. An instant classic in 'Swingers,' then two movies later an unexpected blockbuster 'Bourne Identity' due in no small part to his guidance, and now another overachiever, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith.' I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the trailers i had seen for this. But with Liman's name on it and an interesting premise, and because my girlfriend and I missed 'Cinderella Man' by five minutes, there we were watching it.From the beginning I had a feeling I was going to like it. Its humor seemed to hit the mark and it had just the right tone. It starts out appropriately enough with the couple (who unfortunately we know from the trailers are both assassins) in marriage counseling. Both actors seem fully invested in their characters. A strong start.Sure there's a lot of killing and the film seems to sort of make light of it. But this is just a big fantasy, a huge stretch of reality as any good action/adventure film should be. It's a study in the marriage relationship and reminds those so wed of how they just want to wring each other's necks sometimes, even thought they love each other deeply. Why? Communication. Turns out real problem with the Smith marriage is that they're hiding the biggest side of their lives from each other. They're the only ones each other has to talk to about assassination-related issues buy they can't (how frustrating is that?) Then once their occupations are discovered and their pitted against each other, the film slides toward the couple's reconciliation--or rather, will they or won't they? If they do, will it stick? Will one kill the other before they give it a fair shot? There's a lot of possibilities during this section of the film, a great luxury for a film to have.This achieves for 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' one of the most important elements of a good film story most these films days are lacking: a true sense of jeopardy for any main character. At any point during this film I thought it was possible for either of these characters to get bumped off. Somehow, it would've made thematic sense for it to happen to either of them. What's more, you give a damn! This suspense lasts to nearly the end of the film until the satisfying conclusion is reached. 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is my favorite film of the year so far and one of only a few I actually want to see again (a definite DVD purchase).",9,2,5,8 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's war protest film(?)
","Don't be fooled by my seemingly high rating for this film. This one was a big disappointment for me. It's just one of those films that, after having seen it, I found...unnecessary. Even from the first time I saw the teaser trailers I thought, how is this in any way different from 'Independence Day?' Then the Super Bowl ads piqued my interest and my anticipation grew. It looked like it would be what Independence Day wasn't--a grim tail of invasion that pulled no punches. This one might actually be scary. but then, I thought, we got scary aliens (or creepy at the very least) in Shyamalan's 'Signs' 3 years ago. How then can Spielberg's HG Wells update stand apart? Well, it does begin with a lot of intensity. Aliens start vaporizing people within the first 20 minutes, right after some character introductions. I found it interesting that the aliens' Beams of Fury (my name) were very similar to the 'spray of sparks' from the 1953 original--which at the time must have been terrifying in themselves. 'War' circa 2005 shares many common traits with the original film but probably only because both are adapted from the same book. After the invasion from below begins, Spielberg maintains the level of intensity throughout...which becomes a problem. The intensity never lets up enough to create genuine fright. You need to let people breathe easy for a while, then let them have it, then repeat. 'War of the Worlds' is all peaks, no valleys. Other than never letting up, it never lightens up either. There is little humor to be found in this, making it not much fun. That's trouble, during the summer season especially.Spielberg seems intent on giving audiences a study of fear in an age of terrorism. For a time, this works. But the suspension of disbelief, at least for me, expired early on this one. Few of us are genuinely afraid of an alien invasion. But most people these days are afraid of terrorism. The invasion analogy worked well in 1953 but doesn't work now...or does it? Perhaps the invaders in the analogy aren't terrorists at all but American planes and bombs. Let's do a little calendar pointing. A year ago Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg had openings in their schedules at the same time. The Iraq occupation had by that time become a hellish nightmare. So this project that had been a blip on both men's radars now was possible. And what's better, it had a context. But perhaps the assumed terrorists = aliens analogy was too simple. In 2003 we had a massive invasion, followed by uncertainty and destabilization, followed by hell (which Iraq still is anywhere outside the Green Zone). So 'War' may not be a protest film, but may well symbolize the violence and chaos that we have been seeing for over two years now in Iraq. We witnessed a normal society in which people felt relatively safe walking around on the streets, thrown into chaos by an invasion that few there understood. All they want is for life to go back to normal again. Sounds like a movie I just saw. For what it's worth, I'd rank the big alien invasion films of the last decade as follows: 1. 'Signs' 2. 'Independence Day' 3. 'War of the Worlds'",7,1,3,7 July 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'What do you think you are, crazy? Well, you're not!'
","Whether intentional or not, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' was a sign ofthe times when it came out in 1975. It reflected the anti-authoritarian sensibility of Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Director Milos Forman'staste for subversion is said to come from his war-torn childhood, his parentless upbringing, and finally, the rise of Communism in his native Czechoslovakia.
The film's imitators, many and poor, have tried to duplicate its formula,practically inventing a new genre--the mental hospital drama--probably because of the opportunities for over-acting. An actor's favorite role to play is a mentally disadvantaged person. But Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, everyoneagrees, is not sick at all. Some of 'Cuckoo''s imitators didn't understand that the film isn't about crazy people, but about rules, suppression of the soul, and the desire for power. As McMurphy emerges as a leader among the patients, a battle of wills formsbetween he and Nurse Ratched. At first McMurphy is just having fun. Heoperates on the belief that few of these men are actually crazy. Of course, it works for a time. Eventually it has tragic consequences.
Forman would re-visit the anti-authoritarian themes of 'Cuckoo's Nest' in'People vs. Larry Flynt' and 'Ragtime.'  His apparent identification with mad geniuses was carried on with 'Amadeus' and 'Man on the Moon.'",9,1,2,6 January 2003
Blow," The Grand Illusion
","CONTAINS SPOILERSIn an early scene, a young George Jung is at the unemployment office with his father who's just lost his job. Mr. Jung all but promises his son that they'll never be poor. This is a nice thing for a dad to say. The problem is that George feared poverty more than Mr. Jung ever could have imagined. With this scene, writer David McKenna (American History X) introduces his theme and the ride begins. This telling of George Jung's life is exhilarating, entertaining, fascinating. Yet underneath each scene is the shallow cry of sadness. Imagine yourself in a seat next to Jung himself, or even imagine yourself as Jung watching this film. I suspect that if Jung is given the opportunity to watch the finished film (he got to see a rough cut before its release), he'll be grateful for its existence. If there is any possible good that could come from this man's life, it is the film that is based on it (I can't speak for Bruce Porter's novel but I hear it pushes him as more of a heroic, legendary figure).`Blow: How a Smalltown Boy Made a Million Dollars with the Medellin Cocaine Cartel and Lost it All' is not an autobiography. `Blow' the motion picture is told from Jung's point of view, though. We see everything, condensed into two hours as movies have to do, as Jung sees it. Demme tells the story like he's Jung telling a classroom full of teenagers why no one should want to live the kind of life he lived. He's saying, Â‘Do not get to the end of your life and wish you'd done things differently'. In `Blow' I saw a man who fulfilled all of his childhood ambition thousandfold only to discover it wasn't what he wanted at all. His cellmate in Danbury tells him `you didn't fail to achieve your dream, you just had the wrong dream'. He was speaking of switching from marijuana to cocaine, of course, but the statement is true on a much larger scale (SPOILER INCOMING!!!) Near the end, Jung is released from prison and achieves great personal triumph by re-establishing a relationship with his daughter. He wants to clean himself up and take her with him to California. And she wants to go! But all he has ever known is drugs. All he needs is one last big score. The deal is done and he believes he's on his way. But it's a set-up, a DEA sting. He fails his daughter worse than he ever did before. He finally knew exactly what he wanted, but was incapable of getting it.
 `Blow' is a carefully crafted film that isn't always perfect, but achieves its objectives. I've heard people complain about the ending of this movie (how is this possible? It's a true story!)  I hear things like it's too slow, it's too melodramatic, yada yada. Me, I wasn't completely sold on the film until that last scene. It's nicely caps the sad tale of a man who discovers that his life, just as his daughter is in this scene, was all just an illusion.Grade: A-",9,0,0,11 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," A twist without a plot
","'Vanilla Sky' is not an easy film to like, an art film disguised as an event film. I'd argue that a project like this is the sort of thing that SHOULD be what we consider an 'event,' because it's actually interesting. Whatever your opinion of this film is, it's worth a discussion.
Being a star is about many things--recognizability, mystery, attraction, but probably most of all, trust.  That is, audiences feel 'safe' going to a Tom Cruise film--any Tom Cruise film. When will people ever learn? Consider three of Cruise's last four films, 'Magnolia,' 'Eyes Wide Shut,' and now 'Vanilla Sky.' None of the trio are exactly audience pleasers (personally, I hated 'Mission: Impossible 2'). They're odd, intricate pieces featuring odd, intricate characters. Like 'Eyes Wide Shut,' 'Sky' comes wrapped in a nice package. The former: Stanley Kubrick's last film and another pairing of wife Nicole Kidman; the latter: Camerons Crowe and Diaz, plus the (arguably) rising Penelope Cruz. With this kind of star power, many filmgoers willingly enter 'Sky' knowing next to nothing about what they're in for. They're usually the first ones to hurl their super-size buckets of popcorn at the screen in anguish halfway through.No popcorn became airborne at the screening I attended. There was, however, a couple near me who insisted on talking to each other through the entire second half of the movie. Normally this would annoy me a great deal. 'This better start making sense real fast,' the girl would say to her companion. He would try to explain what was going on perhaps not realizing we could hear every word of it. In this particular instance, I can't say I blame this girl, whoever she was. Personally, I've never asked myself 'what the heck is going on?' more in a film than I did during 'Vanilla Sky.' The only incentive to keep watching was Cruise, who gives one of his best performances. As for the story, all is revealed eventually, but it takes a major test of patience to get there. This is the point for me where having seen Alejandro Amenabar's 'Open Your Eyes' would have been helpful, but I'll do my best. Having seen his really, really great film 'The Others,' however, will do for now. It provides the example I need to illustrate my point. 'Others' is recognizable as a ghost story and makes sense, whether you know what's REALLY going on or not. You understand the themes that are being presented. Depending on how observant you are, you may even be able to predict the ending before Amenabar pulls the rug out from under you.  Based on Amanabar's own criteria, 'Vanilla Sky' stinks. People watch movies to be entertained, to see a story, for two hours give or take. They don't go to have nonsense hurled at them for two hours and then have that nonsense explained to them for the last fifteen minutes in a bunch of exposition by talking heads. There's no rug to pull out because Crowe forgets to even put one under you. The only possibility of enjoying this would be on a second viewing. That should never be the case. Of course, next I'll actually see the film 'Sky' is based on, which supposedly is all but a carbon copy of it, and I like it. No matter how similar the two films are, they are still two different films, made in different countries by different directors, with different actors (except Cruz). Wanting to make an avant-garde, thinking piece is noble, but Crowe, who had always been reliable, bricks this one.  File 'Vanilla Sky' under interesting,' fascinating,' ambitious,' but not good.'

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not the definitive version of either character
","Recently I went back and re-watched Man of Steel and enjoyed it a little bit more than I did the first time, viewing in the theater. It's a visual feast, and gave me hope that its sequel could offer something beyond. Sometimes ingesting visual ideas wrapped in even an OK story is enough. I would go so far as to say I even (gulp) liked Man Of Steel. The fight scenes especially, between the Kryptonians and Superman, are innovative and like nothing anyone had done before.Now we finally have unwrapped Batman V. Superman and it's hugely disappointing. It's dark and laced with a feeling of despondence and hopelessness.The story feels forced. Seems to be the result of some executive forcing the Batman and Superman stories and worlds (as they are in comics) into one movie. They took elements of both the 'Dark Knight' graphic novel and 'Death of Superman' comic series. This mashup does provide thought provocation but does not congeal into a cohesive whole. Again, it's all enjoyable to look at but that is not enough.the Dark Knight series is the definitive Batman series and always will be. Particularly the first two in the series. Even the Tim Burton Batman films are a better vision of the character (and world) than this is. Watched the 1989 entry recently too.SPOILER ALERT: The trailer for this movie is selling you snake oil as far as the fight between the two characters goes. It makes the viewer curious about how Batman could stand against someone as powerful as Superman. I was worried though that there was some trick involved to how Batman is able to gain an upper hand on Superman. the entire second act is devoted to Batman's quest for the kryptonite rock found in the Indian Ocean. I was praying he would not get it, that it would not be the answer to how Batman beats Superman (he does). But it is. Kryptonite dust, kryptonite spear, Superman vulnerable. That's the ugly part about this. Superman never has it coming. Batman is wrong the entire time, and we're never convinced that he should even have the thought. The cunning with which Batman wins is true to the character, but it's false advertising. Every shot the trailer shows of Batman punching Superman is a moment Superman is weakened by the Kryptonite dust, even the infamous 'blocked punch' shot. I was worried that this was the case, and it turned out to be true.Christopher Reeve is the definitive Superman. Richard Donner got it really right. It makes you wonder what Donner would have done with the technology available today, if there weren't the constraints of 70's visual effects.",5,2,9,6 April 2016
Signs," Indie-pendence Day
","M. Night Shyamalan has made 3 films in 4 years that are all very different and yet, a lot alike. They're all somber, frightening, and heartwarming. They're each what used to be called 'slow.' But because of Shyamalan, audience expectations are changing. They're rediscovering what makes films appealing in the first place. They're being engaged, challenged. These 3 films (I don't even have to name them) have stayed within familiar film subjects, but turned those genres on their ears. Ghosts, superheroes, and now, aliens. He's taken all of these subjects and crafted supernatural thrillers around them. What he's done is not necessarily changed the story, but rather, changed the point of view. In 'Sixth Sense' he finds the point of view from which ghosts are the most frightening, a child's. 'Unbreakable' does a similar thing. What would REALLY happen if a kid found out his dad is a super hero? What if you were faced with the prospect that you couldn't be hurt? Shyamalan doesn't need to change reality in order for a super hero to exist. It's still fantasy but then, it's real. He makes it personal. Shyamalan achieves this by using a smaller stage. We need only see the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) dealing with this curse and turning it into a blessing (see also Cole in 'Sense').  Compared to the larger story 'Signs' is a cross-section of, the film's stage is even smaller. The world is about to be attacked by aliens, house by house. Where else to put the camera then, asks Shyamalan, than in one of those houses? For the most part, this is where he keeps it. One major reason 'Signs' works so well is that audiences have already seen the larger story in countless other special effects-driven alien invasion films for decades. Shyamalan says, hey that's great but, how would we REALLY react to an alien invasion? What's scarier, a city-sized spaceship over downtown or the frozen graphic on your television set that says Â‘stay tuned?' Leave it to Shyamalan to think of it first, to encapsulate what makes an event really huge, when the fate of the world really hangs in the balance: CNN goes off the air. All he had to do was show Mel Gibson looking ominously at a television screen.
Shyamalan is a director who understands how to use the craft. He's been compared to Spielberg, not for his penchant for making blockbusters, but because he seems to understand better than most current auteurs how to really make an audience respond. Like Spielberg's older work, M. Night's films have changed the way audiences see movies. It's the element of surprise, stupid. It's where you move the camera and what that camera finds. It's not always what's in the frame but what is just outside of it. Sometimes just holding the camera stationary on, say, the top of a staircase is scarier than anything else you could put in front of it. Shyamalan limits his story to a small cast of characters, a short period of time, in a small town. He keeps it simple. As always he rewards the audience by trusting it. This director's effectiveness lies in his ability to reach an audience that's seen it all. Well, not if M. Night has anything to say about it.Grade: A-",9,0,1,5 August 2002
Amélie," Don't miss it
","We're introduced to Amelie Poulain at a very early stage in her life (as sperm), which made me nervous that I was going to sit through this person's ENTIRE life in two hours. Not so. The opening sequence simply lays out the groundwork for the rest of the story, thematically and visually.
For the rest of the film, we follow Amelie as a 28-year-old woman who, after her love life doesn't make her happy, devotes her life to performing secret, inventive acts of kindness toward others. The deeds she does are so imaginative and funny, the audience can't help but fall for her. The way they are presented is equally imaginative. We soon realize that the acts are a sort of defense mechanism, a wall she's thrown up between her and personal relationships. She longs for contact but is almost afraid of it, something attributed to her parents, like the way her father never touched her except once a year when he'd give her a medical exam. Her neighbor, Mr. Dufayel, the 'man of glass,' helps her to realize it's time to be as kind to herself as she is to others. As the story moves on, Amelie comes out of her shell more and more, finding the courage to speak up, to 'get the last word in.'The same theme is strung through the film, that beauty unseen is tragic, but is still beauty. Amelie's selflessness is her beauty, but after a while she realizes it's not making her completely happy. She finds herself using her craftiness to trap the man of her dreams, but has trouble actually facing him. 'Alien: Resurrection' aside, this film should lift Jean-Pierre Jeunet out of his cult' filmmaker status. His films have been famous only in film people' circles, at least here in the States. But hopefully 'Amelie' will change that. It's no less inventive and visually captivating than the rest of his work, but targets a wider audience demographic.
It's French, so expect crude humor than U.S. audiences will find out of place. Still, 'Amelie' is the kind of foreign-language film that could break away in America like 'La Vita e Bella (Life Is Beautiful)' or 'All About My Mother.' It will likely be that foreign film that leaves all others behind in the Oscar race.Grade: A",10,1,3,9 December 2001
Flight," Wish I'd known nothing about this going in...
","I understand the need for TV spots and theatrical trailers to promote films. They need to show something to get people to the movie and get a return on the investment. But the trailers for Flight are typical in the way they reveal far too much about the movie. Reviews reveal too much. Interviews with crew and actors reveal too much. All of this lessens the impact of the story's narrative. most movies are like this and Flight is no exception. The medium of film relies on images that refute each other and stand in contrast to each other, which creates tension, shock, drama. For instance, having seen the trailers and read up on the movie, it came as no surprise that seconds after Whip snorts lines of coke he's exiting his hotel room dressed in his pilot uniform. That is a great cut! Ruined! What's more: the Academy Awards (sorry, 'Oscars') chose to use the film's climactic scene, the NTSP hearing, to showcase Denzel Washington's performance. The brief clip they used GAVE AWAY THE ENDING OF THE FILM. Prior to this scene, you have this rather shocking scene in which Whip's union rep, his lawyer, and his coke dealer get him 'ready' for the hearing after a night of binge drinking by paying for the dealer's drugs and services. The only reason this scene exists is to cast doubt on Whip's testimony. Will he do the right thing? Well if you watched the Oscars, you already know. It's criminal. And frustrating. Another note on the best actor race, which Denzel lost to Daniel Day-Lewis. I think Denzel's performance here is so much more powerful in how he shrinks himself and takes risks and sheds all of his Denzel-ness. It's hard to measure a performance to say who should 'win.' But I don't believe Day-Lewis' performance carries Lincoln. It's a combination of elements: the history, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field. But with Flight, Denzel carries it. His role and performance carries it.",9,0,4,26 February 2013
Donnie Darko," Jason, Freddie, Mike Myers, Chuckie,...Frank the bunny?
","'Donnie Darko' is one of the best-written, original, interesting films to come along in a while.  Not to take anything away from it but it reminds me of a really, really great, long episode of 'X-Files.' I kept waiting for Mulder and Scully to show up after the jet engine crashes down from the sky. Thankfully, Chris Carter's brain didn't dream up this idea. Writer/director Richard Kelly dreams it up first. Donnie Darko is the real name Jake Gyllenhaal's character. In a great exchange between he and his girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone), she says 'What kind of a name is that? It sounds like a super hero or something.' Donnie's reply: 'How do you know I'm not?' The irony, for what it's worth, is that 'Gretchen Ross' is not her real name. This film is filled with great exchanges, great scenes, great ideas. Example (for those who've seen it): Ms. Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) making a girl move so Gretchen can find a seat 'next to the guy she thinks is cutest,' who is of course, Donnie. It's just one moment in which the world of the film feels like it's just someone's fantasy and not really happening. The film's marketers (Newmarket?) wisely use Frank the giant bunny rabbit prominently in the 'Donnie Darko' campaign. A giant, scary-looking bunny rabbit is as good a reason to check out a film as any, I suppose.",9,0,1,31 March 2002
