Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Can't believe this is in top 250
","OK first of all let it be known that i loved Kill Bill 1 because it didn't have any pretensions about what it was, a cool, witty samurai movie which draws upon the best of genre films only does better which leaves the viewers with a feast of gore and chick fights which stand up against 'crouching tiger'. Unfortunately the 2nd volume does not rely on action and cool laconic Dialogue which is OK i grant you. Clearly Tarantino wanted to spend the entire film with characters exchanging pointless below average lines (not Tarantino quality of 'Resevoir dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction) because he had faith in the cinematic appeal of Bill which im sorry wasn't there. Their is one semi decent action scene in the entire film between daryhl Hannah and Uma Thurman's the bride and the rest is dependent on the on character relationships which are .. well ..LAME! I don't mind a slow paced film but if it lacks the dialogue and emotion that makes them enjoyable they are the worst type of film to have to sit through. Sorry to disappoint my friends - Kill Bill 1's an 8/10 possible DVD purchase, Kill Bill 2's a 5/10 at the most and i suggest you suppress your curiosity until it comes out on TV or something.",Null,0,1,13 May 2004
Aliens," Complete change in genre ensures the originality of this sequel
","Why Alien is always revered to such an extent i find hard to comprehend when Aliens is clearly a more enjoyable film. James Cameron's conceptualisation of the alien creatures is far more interesting for the screen. All the creeping about and setting of the scene in the first installment leaves a viewer quite simply bored. Aliens completely switches genre from sci-fi thriller to sci-fi action movie. Riply (Sigourney Weaver) is given new strength and is perhaps the strongest heroine to hit the screens if not Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 (another of Camerons creations). The effects in this film are still enjoyable to watch today and the aliens themselves are a much bigger feature in this film, hence the name Aliens! Bill Paxton Provides the comical element in the film representing the average person put in a situation as psychologically crippling as one could imagine being trapped on a planet crawling with homocidal aliens might be. This film delivers great actions scenes with plenty of human and alien carnage to satisfy an audiences blood lust, while the balanced structure of the film does not neglect the characters giving more than Ripley an interesting arc. A failure in many action films is when a character is of such little interest to the viewer that you do not care what happens to them (see 'Black Hawk Dawn'). Aliens avoids this trap and is definitely a film that can be enjoyed more than once. 9/10.",Null,0,0,8 May 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Highly overated
","Ok i admit i'm not the most objective in that i think a superfluous amount of gangster/crime movies have been made. However i can recognise the inherent qualities of godfather 1+2, scarface and goodfellers, qualities that are in no way present in this film. The biggest problem is the lack of a coherent plot and as far as i can tell the ending is pretty meaningless. The time jump toward the end (Where James Woods and Deniro's characters are old with the worst make up ever to illustrate this fact)led me to a conclusion that is out of touch with the direction the movie was originally going. A twist in a movie is fine but it must make some semblance of sense within the parameters set my the intro and middle of a movie.I was not drawn in by the characters or the plot which inevitably leaves a viewer bored. AVOID THIS FILM AND SPEND THREE HOURS TRAINSPOTTING OR SOMETHING! - 3/10",Null,2,6,17 May 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Id love to speak like Macdowell does in this!
","The neo shakespearean language created in this film provides a continium of comedy for the protagonist Malcolm Macdowell. It also prevents the language from becoming dated as the dialogue is not synonymous with any modern subcultures exchange in discourse. The element of comedy comes from the juxtaposition of the language with the 'ultra violence' performed by Alex De Large (Macdowell) and his gang. Soft words and poetic deliveries soften the displays of violence in the film (but perhaps make them darker) and also allow the audience to understand the pleasure in which the Alex takes in the violence as his antics go hand in hand with songs, laughing and poetry. (Possible Spoiler) The film is dark throughout as Alex's character has no arc, suggesting that all change in men is socially conditioned rather than a product of moral awakening. This is classic with Kubrick who changes the ending of the book to deliver a darker conclusion to that of the book much as he did with Stephan Kings 'The Shining'. If you like this film i suggest watching 'American Psycho' which also provides a satirical character who equals Macdowells nihilism and entertains in a similar way.",Null,0,0,8 May 2003
