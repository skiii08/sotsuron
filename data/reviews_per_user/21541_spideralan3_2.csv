The Avengers," Guess What, it's Awesome!!!!
","I can describe the film as EPIC.This is by far the best movie from Marvel studios, Whedon made an impeccable job while working on this, it's not very often to see the heroes you've seen before individually join together in a single film and that's what make The Avengers unique; Whedon made a perfect assemble with an interesting plot full of action making it one of the best superhero movies ever made.The plot is really original, mixing the comic book stories with reality and make it clever and fresh with a well chosen strong cast that make you feel as they were real superheroes; and i would like to congratulate Mark Ruffalo that makes an excellent job as Bruce Banner , it really fits for the role, in my opinion the best hulk ever.Visually the film is a feast the eyes with high tech. special effects and a well done CGI work, as for the score it works and make the action scenes very epic. Again i would like to congratulate the special effects crew for the iron man suit an specially for making the most realistic hulk to date. (3D isn't the best but works well) Finally The Avengers is an epic, superhero sack of fun that will entertain everyone in the family, I can't wait wait to buy it on Blu-Ray!!!",10,19,37,1 July 2012
Prometheus," Impressive
","I will be honest, when i went to see the movie the only thing i knew is that it was going to be about aliens.Since the start of the film, you'll be impressed but as the movie unfolds you will find an interesting science fiction plot.The cast isn't the best, but it works perfectly for each situation that comes next.Technically is visually stunning and the soundtrack is powerful making it one of the best looking movies of all time.The only thing that fails from the movie is the the end, it feels kinda short and cliffhanger but accomplishes it's purpose for being an indirect prequel to the alien series, aside from that Scott made a great job making a fun and entertaining summer movie.",9,3,17,1 July 2012
