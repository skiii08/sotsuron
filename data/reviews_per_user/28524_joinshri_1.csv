Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock HOlmes - A game of shadows - The end?
","My review -First things first..... I loved the movie.For all the fans of the detective from Arthur Canon Doyle's book, this version of Holmes is blasphemous. For all those who got the first taste of the great detective after watching the first installment, this movie is one hell of a joyride... Take your pick.For the original Sherlock Holmes fans.... Sherlock Holmes, the great detective, does not deduce anything in the movie. There is no mystery to solve here,no clues, no surprise elements.While the first part had not one but many puzzles to solve, this time around, the story is plain vanilla. Here, Holmes is on a mission to stop Prof. James Moriarty from committing a dastardly act (no spoilers this time).For read further, pls click on - http://filtercoffeechronicles.blogspot.com/2012/01/sherlock-holmes- end.html",7,0,0,1 January 2012
