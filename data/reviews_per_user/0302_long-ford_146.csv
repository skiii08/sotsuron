The Devil's Advocate," Hammy but enjoyable Pacino in camp thriller
",'The Devil's Advocate' is a camp thriller that entertains despite going way over the top. Al Pacino plays the devil and gives a hammy scenery-chewing performance that will leave you in splits. He isn't the least bit scary as Satan but is very watchable. Keanu Reeves is alright. Charlize Theron impresses in a brief role as the tormented wife. The film has a moral to deliver about pride and does so in style. The camera work is sometimes annoying and the ending makes little sense. Still the whole thing is perfectly watchable. Note - there is a lot of profanity.Overall 7/10,Null,1,2,24 February 2009
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," As mediocre as the first film
","If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this sequel. Cage and his friends race across the world solving difficult clues in a matter of seconds while fending off the bad guys, a bunch of Southern Confederates! I found the film preposterous though watchable. The villains are incompetent, the action sequences belabored, and the plot holes simply too big to ignore. Cage looks weird with his toupee. A pleasant addition to the cast is Helen Mirren who adds a touch of class to the proceedings. Otherwise, everyone seems to be there mainly for the pay check. Thoroughly mediocre.Overall 4/10",Null,0,0,31 January 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than Vol.1, fine David Carradine
","Vol.2 of Kill Bill feels like a complete film and is easily superior to Vol.1. In fact, by adding a brief prologue to Vol.2, Vol.1 could have been dispensed with entirely. It is more interesting and provides us back story on the bride and her relationship with Bill. David Carradine is excellent as Bill and capably holds the film together. His monologue on Superman is inspired. Uma has a terrific fight scene with Daryl Hannah. The fight sequences in Vol.2 are brief however, when compared to Vol.1. The film moves slowly and could have been better edited. Still watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,27 February 2009
Changeling," Good film, well acted but suffers from weak script and uneven tone
","'Changeling' is a good film, certainly a well-intentioned one, but it suffers from a very uneven script. Directed sedately by Clint Eastwood, the film feels disjointed as it repeatedly loses focus. The period detail is impeccable as we see working single mother Angelina Jolie living with her son in 1920s Los Angeles. A mid-section reminded me of 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. The acting is good and the film is liable to fill you with outrage against the LA Police Department. The film is definitely worth watching at least once at home, but is certainly no classic.Overall 6/10",Null,1,6,19 February 2009
Walk the Line," Fine performances in solidly entertaining Johnny Cash biopic
","This is a solidly entertaining biopic of country singer Johnny Cash. The story is slightly predictable but both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are good and even sing their own songs. The film effectively charts Cash's entire career from his (MINOR SPOILERS) youth on a farm, his years in the Air Force, his rise, addiction to prescription medication, and eventual redemption.My favorite segment was Cash's relationship with his father. This could have been expanded. While fans of Cash's music will love this film, even non-fans will enjoy the film.Overall 7/10",Null,1,1,27 February 2009
Alien 3," Disappointing sequel, watchable but a complete mess
",This film is a complete mess. It's watchable but is a huge letdown after the first two films. It casually dispense with the previous storyline as it places Sigourney Weaver on a prison planet with an alien loose. There is little action and the film isn't particularly tense or scary. Sigourney Weaver is good though and elevates the material. Characters appear from out of nowhere and it seems that a lot of tinkering was done with the final product. The directer David Fincher has admitted studio interference and other factors were responsible for the film's problems. Disappointing.Overall 4/10,Null,144,152,19 February 2009
Antz," Fine Woody Allen in entertaining animation, more for adults
","Woody Allen is perfect as neurotic ant Z in this entertaining CGI animated feature. I prefer 'Antz' to Pixar's 'A Bug's life' mainly because it caters to a slightly older audience. The film lacks the bright colors of 'A Bug's Life' but has it's own earthy charm. There are several hilarious asides, mostly dealing with adult relationships and politics. There is an all star cast with Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Sylvester Stallone and they all do a good job. The story is surprisingly intense at times with some specially bloody battle scenes. Recommended.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,18 February 2009
Mission: Impossible III," Adequate entertainer but runs out of steam towards the end
","This film works well for over two-thirds of its running time. It's sleekly directed and even though the events seem fairly unbelievable, they remain entertaining. Sadly it loses its sense of focus towards the end and the climax is rather disappointing. Tom Cruise is adequate as Ethan Hawke and his stunt work remains impressive. However he fails to convince during the tender moments. Lawrence Fishburn has a brief but interesting role. Hoffman is good as usual. The action sequences are watchable but lack that extra something that makes these summer blockbusters memorable.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,14 February 2009
Lucky Number Slevin," Interesting thriller, but not as smart as it thinks it is
",This is a wannabe Hitchcockian thriller which mostly works. The setup is intriguing with the hapless Josh Hartnett apparently being set up to commit a murder. The film is rather violent and some of the gory scenes feel unnecessary. Bruce Willis has a brief role and is alright. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are decent but both feel a trifle wasted. The plot twists occasionally feel too clever by half. However Lucy Liu is excellent in a brief role and has great chemistry with Hartnett. We can sense how the story is going to end halfway through the film. It's still watchable but should have been better.Overall 6/10,Null,1,2,22 February 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Good acting in competent Western despite contrived climax
","This is a well acted entertaining western despite some plot contrivances. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale both work very well with each other. Bale, in particular, brings out the inner torment that his character faces. Though the film is dialog heavy, there's quite a lot of action. In fact, the climactic action scene goes on a bit too long and is frankly more than a touch unbelievable. Also, (MINOR SPOILERS) Russell Crowe's actions after he gets on the train seem to negate all the previous character development. Still, it's competently made and quite watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,4 February 2009
The Sound of Music," Overlong family musical, wholesome Julie Andrews and charming songs
","This famous movie may be very long but the songs still work their charm on you. There is a bit too much sweetness on display though, and cynics would be well advised to avoid the film for fear of 'sugar shock'. Christopher Plummer is good as Captain Von Trapp while Julie Andrews is irrepressibly wholesome as the singing governess. The kids may be overbearingly cute but remain endearing. The opening scene is great and draws you into the film immediately. The songs remain ever popular, my favorite ones include 'Edelweiss' and 'My Favorite Things'. While the film could have been shorter, its still enjoyable.Overall 7/10",Null,1,7,23 February 2009
The Longest Yard," Clichéd and predictable
","This is a clichéd and completely predictable sports drama with Adam Sandler in the lead. The plot somehow conspires to send him to prison where he takes part in a football game against the prison guards. Every single sports movie cliché is present, the music is loud and manipulative, and the film is littered with juvenile humor and crass jokes. Burt Reynolds, the star of the original 'The Longest Yard' has a brief role. Sandler is alright though no one is really stretched in the film. James Cromwell sneers and gnashes his teeth in a bid to act menacing. Very mediocre film. Watch only if completely bored.Overall 4/10",Null,2,4,27 February 2009
Marie Antoinette," Endless series of parties invites tedium after a good start
","This film begins well and the opening twenty minutes are interesting as we watch the young Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) entering France and coping with royal protocol and an indifferent husband (Jason Schwartzman). Unfortunately, the film then goes on to show endless party scenes punctuated with modern music. Young Marie clearly enjoyed her parties! But why did this need to be repeated over and over again. Audience tedium ensues. Rip Torn seems to be enjoying himself as the lecherous Louis XV. There's practically no politics in the film and nothing is shown of the revolting classes until it's too late.Overall 5/10",Null,5,8,11 February 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," fun popcorn adventure, but overrated
","Why is this film so highly rated? I enjoyed it as a pop-corn adventure, but its IMDb ranking still seems too high. There's lots of action, most of it unbelievable, what with Nazis as the bad guys, but it's all good fun specially for kids. Harrison Ford is solid without being spectacular. His charisma helps a great deal. The music is annoying, constantly giving the viewers cues on when to laugh, cry, etc. Spielberg should have a little faith in his audience. Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best in the Indiana Jones series and is far superior to the recently released Indy adventure.Overall 7/10",Null,1,2,20 January 2009
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Uneven tone but remains technologically dazzling
","I can see why some love this film. It remains technologically dazzling and the story will appeal to adults having been copied from Chinatown(!). Still, I found the manic character of Roger Rabbit almost too much to bear. Also, the combination of adult themes including some heavy-handed references to black civil rights didn't sit well with the cartoonish tone of the film. There are plenty of pratfalls and gags and Bob Hoskins does a commendable job under the circumstances. Christopher Lloyd is well cast as Judge Doom. I enjoyed the numerous cartoon cameos, in particular Betty Boop. Watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,1,1,18 February 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Dreamwork's best film, superbly choreographed action set-pieces
","'Kung Fu Panda' is an entertaining Kung Fu animation and possibly Dreamwork's best animated movie yet. The story is simple but the animation quality is superb and rivals Pixar. The Kung Fu fighting is excellent with some stunning action set-pieces. Dustin Hoffman is the pick of the cast as Kung Fu master Shifu. Jack Black plays a lazy yet lovable fat panda. Despite his overly cuddly appearance, you come to care for him. Ian McShane voices the menacing villain Tai Lung. There are bit parts for Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie. Terrific family entertainment.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,21 February 2009
Unbreakable," slow paced but effective thriller despite misguided final twist
","'Unbreakable' is a slow, reasonably effective film which suffers only from a misguided final twist. The bulk of the film works well as a spooky supernatural thriller with comic book undertones. Indeed, (MINOR SPOILERS), M Night Shyamalan's film works as a highly unusual superhero origin tale. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson do a good job and play well off each other. The film does have occasional lapses into pretentiousness and the scenes with Willis's family are a bit tedious. The unnecessary ending twist was probably added after the success of The Sixth Sense's final twist. Still quite watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,12 February 2009
As Good as It Gets," Good performances in variation on 'A Christmas Carol'
","This is an interesting variation on Dicken's 'A Christmas Carol'. Nicholson, although playing an abrasive obsessive-compulsive is clearly channeling Scrooge, who ultimately has his world view changed for the better. Helen Hunt is good as the waitress who regularly serves him, while Greg Kinear plays a sympathetic gay neighbor. The film starts off with Nicholson mouthing obscenities at everyone. There's plenty of (somewhat nasty) humor as we watch Jack playing a grumpier version of himself. Gradually however, the film mellows into a gentle romance. Both Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars for their performances, which while good, certainly aren't award caliber.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,21 January 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Well acted film, good Fiennes, intricate script
",This was a film I initially disliked but came around after my second viewing. It still has some problems but I can see why some love it so much. The script is intricate and packed with visual and verbal clues on Elizabethan England. The actors all seem to be enjoying themselves. Joseph Fiennes is a well-cast Shakespeare. Gwyneth Paltrow looks beautiful but I'm not convinced she deserved her Oscar. Geoffery Rush and Tom Wilkinson are old pros who slip into their comic roles comfortably. Judi Dench is solid as always. No one does a bad job. The last one third is devoted to a stage recreation of Romeo and Juliet and drags a bit.Overall 7/10,Null,0,0,5 February 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Watchable action-horror but no match for the first two films
","This film is definitely better than Fincher's disappointing 'Alien3' but doesn't come close to the first two films. It's pretty much a straight action-horror combining elements of both Alien and Aliens. The production design is creepy and effective, although some images are simply repulsive. Sigourney Weaver, this time (MINOR SPOILERS) playing a curious human-alien hybrid, is impressive. She has great screen presence and her intensity lifts the film. Ron Perlman is alright though Winona Ryder seems completely out of place. Watchable action-horror film.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,19 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The best of the trilogy
","This second film in the Pirates trilogy is my personal favorite. Depp is at his looniest, and there's plenty of humor. The film is also very long as many more characters are introduced. The best is Bill Nighy, playing a menacing but jokey Davy Jones. His appearance has to be seen to be believed. Indeed, the Special Effects in this film are a significant improvement over the first film. There's also some crackling chemistry between Keira Knightley and Depp. The film takes its time setting everything up for the superb final hour which includes a sword fight on top of a ferris wheel and humor reminiscent of the three stooges. To top it all, there's also a giant Kraken, though the kraken's attacks carry on too long.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,18 January 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Disney's greatest feature-length animation
","This is Disney's greatest feature-length animation in my humble opinion. Everything works form the first scene to the last. The film contains memorable images, outstanding comedy and a romance for the ages. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson impressively voice Beauty and the Beast respectively. Richard White voices the odious Gaston. The songs are memorable, with Angela Lansbury winning a much deserved Oscar for the title track. I was in tears the first time I saw the film. Despite multiple viewings, it still leaves an impact on me. Highly recommended as one of the all time great movies.Overall 10/10",Null,1,2,27 January 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," excellent filmization of CS Lewis's novel
","The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable filmization of CS Lewis's magical childhood epic. The story expertly weaves in childhood themes with a modern day Christian plot line (including a slightly grisly 'crucifiction' scene) to create an enchanting motion picture. Tilda Swinton is superb as the sinister White Witch. The children are average though young Georgie Henly stands out. The Special effects are more than adequate, with a specially impressive rendering of Aslan. The film moves slowly initially and its epic nature become apparent only towards the end with a vicious (but bloodless) final battle. All told, a pleasant surprise indeed! Overall 8/10",Null,7,10,9 January 2009
Madagascar," Uninspired animated film, kids will probably enjoy it
","This is a mediocre Animation feature. It begins well and there are some genuinely amusing scenes in New York, showing the blasé attitude of New Yorkers to the escaped animals. The crazy penguins are worth some laughs as well. Unfortunately, the script stalls once we reach the titular island. The voice work is undistinguished, and I quickly grew tired of the antics of the four central characters. Kids will probably enjoy the film, specially Sacha Baron Cohen who gets some amusing lines. This is a watchable but uninspired film, probably more suited for children than adults.Overall 5/10",Null,0,0,4 February 2009
Elizabeth," Impressive performances in gritty political thriller
","'Elizabeth' features some impressive performances all round, including a star-making turn by Cate Blanchett in the lead. Her performance alone makes the film well worth watching. The film is essentially a political thriller and there's lots of intrigue and double-crosses. The tone of the film is rather gritty and it is consistently absorbing, even if events seem a bit murky at times. Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston both excel. Joseph Fiennes is effective as Robert Dudley and his romance with Elizabeth is touching. The film is violent, and the conclusion feels a little rushed. Recommended.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,1 March 2009
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Alternately very enjoyable and tiresome
","This cartoon is very much a mixed bag. The sequences with the squirrel Scrat and his epic struggle to eat his acorn are pure comedy gold. But, the bulk of the film is a mediocre trek through the melting snow by our animated colleagues from the first Ice Age movie. Diego the saber-tooth takes a back seat as Ray Romano and an annoying Queen Latifah hog the storyline. John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth bravely tries to up the comedy tempo but is only occasionally successful. The story line is just too weak to fully work. As a plus, the animation quality is a huge improvement over its predecessor.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,7 January 2009
Spider-Man 2," Watchable sequel with better Special Effects, but weaker then the first film
","I am one of those in the minority who liked Spiderman (2002) better than its sequel. The Special Effects have indeed improved with Dr Octavious (a good but sadly underutilized Alfred Molina) being a worthy match for Spiderman. However, the pacing is weak and the mid-section gets bogged down as it rehashes Peter and MJ's romance from the first film. Also, too many bad things happen to poor Peter, so much so that suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. On the plus side, JK Simmons is as hilarious as ever as Peter's boss J Jonah Jameson. There's also an exciting train rescue. Definitely still worth a watch.Overall 6/10",Null,1,2,3 February 2009
Batman Returns," interesting follow up by Burton with a sizzling Michelle Pfeiffer
","Batman Returns is better than Burton's own Batman (1989) with a possible career best sizzling performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. The story is much better and the whole thing has a smooth, more polished feel to it. Michael Keaton is fine as always, but Danny deVito is simply tiresome as the 'foaming at the mouth' Penguin. Minus Pfeiffer's Catwoman, the film would have been a tedious bore to sit through. Also, some scenes are simply unsuitable for children. The film sags towards the end but is entertaining for most of it's running length.Overall 7/10",Null,0,2,7 January 2009
Finding Nemo," Charming film with outstanding animation quality
","Finding Nemo is a thoroughly charming animated feature and continues Pixar's dream run. Telling the story of how a clown fish struggles to reunite with his son, the film has a slightly scary beginning and invokes memories of Bambi's mother! The animation quality is stellar. Special mention for the dream-like jellyfish scene with its hidden menace. Ellen Degeneres steals the show with her wisecracks. Albert Brooks is occasionally annoying as the over-protective dad. The film is just a bit too long and could have been trimmed. It has a 'three hanky' emotional ending and you will probably leave the film with a smile on your face.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,9 January 2009
Superbad," You probably have to be of a certain age to get this
","This was always going to be a very polarizing film and I'm afraid I didn't really get much out of it. Perhaps you have to be of a certain age to get this. It's competently put together and there are some funny one-liners. The best part of the film is probably the whole 'Mclovin' subplot. Still, the whole thing was just too juvenile for me. I also found the never ending barrage of swearing tiresome. Yes, we know that horny teens talk like that, but that does't make it particularly interesting. Some will love this film for its foul language and bold humor. Others will be bored/offended. It's still worth a watch, however, specially on DVD/Television.Overall 6/10",Null,1,2,19 January 2009
Troy," works better on a second viewing but still poorly paced and overlong
","Troy is a LONG three hours of uneven spectacle. Alas, with better editing and pacing, this would have been a good movie. Even so, its definitely worth a watch, at least on DVD/television. While I initially hated Brad Pitt's Achilles, a second viewing has convinced me he played his role deliberately in such a 'non-heroic' manner, in order to add to the anti-war sentiment of the film. Peter O'Toole is magnificent, and deserved more screen time. Eric Bana is the most sympathetic character in the film, which suffers as a result of his departure. Sean Bean is also decent. The fight scenes are a major disappointment, specially in the wake of the popular 'Lord Of the Rings'. Only Hector and Achilless' one on one fight leaves an impact.Overall 6/10",Null,1,3,15 January 2009
Home Alone," Moderately enjoyable with cute Culkin but too much cartoon violence
","'Home Alone' is a moderately enjoyable film. Kids will love it. Adults won't be bored but they may be turned off by the cartoon violence which is sometimes excessive. Macaulay Culkin is cute as the young kid Kevin who gets left behind at home, and battles with some burglars. I thought Macaulay was way too smart and the adults all shown as shallow and dumb. Still, its a family movie and in that respect it works. Joe Pesci is an inspired choice and lifts the film with his energy. Most of the film's humor comes from him. The film is better than its sequels and best seen during the Christmas holidays.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,28 February 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Weak plot but excellent Special Effects
","This film was just an excuse to combine scenes from virtually every disaster movie ever made using state-of-the-art Special Effects. In that respect it succeeds as the Special Effects are frequently awe-inspiring. However, the film is also saddled with a brainless plot filled with illogical events and coincidences. The best way to enjoy this film is to put your brain on hold in the theater. My favorite scenes include the triple tornadoes in Los Angeles and the massive floods in New York. The opening scene showing cracks in the Antarctic ice-shelf was also very cool. Overlong but watchable.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,4 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," weaker than the first two but still worth watching
","This sequel is much weaker than the earlier two films in the Pirates trilogy. Still its reasonably entertaining. Johnny Depp is absent in the first hour as the film focuses on Geoffery Rush, Knightley and Bloom. Rush is excellent as usual but the young leads are average. The opening fight sequence in the far east is disappointing. WIth Depp's entry however, the film regains its sense of fun. There's some demented humor and some striking photography as Depp is shown all alone 'at World's End'. There are double crosses galore, and things get confusing in the mid-section. Thank heavens for a rousing sea battle which occupies much of the final hour, as Sparrow and Davy Jones (a fine Bill Nighy) go head to head. The Special Effects are excellent as usual.Overall 7/10",Null,0,2,18 January 2009
Spider-Man 3," A satisfying watch despite its flaws
","I surprisingly enjoyed this sequel despite its many flaws. The plot negates the first film by contriving a new killer for Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, and there's an inexplicable lapse in logic late in the film. Still the opening action scene is exciting and the birth of Sandman is memorable. The CGI is generally impressive. Only the climactic fight scenes feel incomplete, almost straight out of a video game. The acting is uniformly good. People have panned Tobey Maguire but I found his 'bad Parker' scenes quite funny. Topher Grace is good but Venom isn't given enough screen time. A satisfying watch despite its flaws.Overall 7/10",Null,1,2,25 February 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Easily the best in the Resident Evil series
","This film was surprisingly watchable and I rate it the best in the Resident Evil series. The film carries on from where 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' stopped. The action is better staged and the VFX much better than the previous two films. There are some genuine scares and there's a chilling scene that works well as a homage to Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Milla Jovovich has very few lines as always, but carries the film with her presence. The story is needlessly complicated and the climactic action sequences a letdown. Still watchable at least on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,1,2,18 February 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Sumptiously mounted and stylish, but with a weak plot
","This film has outstanding production design but a weak plot. It begins well and Johnny Depp is quite amusing as the naive but enthusiastic investigator Ichabod Crane. After about fifty minutes, the plot stalls and we see beautiful image after beautiful image with little connection to the storyline. It seems obvious that Burton got so enraptured with the look of the film (admittedly great) that there was no time for other details. Also, Depp share little chemistry with co-star Ricci. Christopher Walken is terrifying but has little to do. Still worth a watch for it's sheer style.Overall 5/10",Null,0,1,4 February 2009
The Beach," A complete mess. Probably Danny Boyle's worst film
","Danny Boyle is a very good directer but something went very wrong with 'The Beach'. The film is a complete mess. The story which is basically an updating of Lord of the Flies feels rather shallow. I never believed Leo's character and found (MINOR SPOILERS) his descent into madness ludicrous. The fault lies mainly with the script which is incoherent and ill-focused. There is some forced symbolism throughout the film. While Tilda Swinton does a good job, the other performances are mediocre. This was quite a disappointing watch and is probably Boyle's worst film.Overall 4/10",Null,2,3,24 February 2009
Knocked Up," Overlong but watchable, good jokes and two surprisingly likable characters
","After watching 'Superbad', which I found packed with more swear words and juvenile humor than I could handle, I was dubious about yet another Judd Aptow film. Luckily, 'Knocked Up' isn't half bad. Admittedly, there's very little chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogan, and the film contains it's fair share of profanity. Still, both the leads are likable and I wanted to see them together. The humor is sharp and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. the film is overlong though and should probably have been at least half an hour shorter. Still watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,2,6 February 2009
Alien," Groundbreaking Sci-fi Horror, Amazing VFX
","'Alien' is a groundbreaking Sci-fi horror film expertly directed by Ridley Scott. I prefer it slightly to it's sequel, the action packed 'Aliens'. The film is slow to start as it depicts the vastness of space. The creature design is amazing and the Special Effects remain terrifyingly effective. Sigourney Weaver plays the reluctant heroine although everyone does a good job. The last forty five minutes are pure horror and genuinely scary. Tension is expertly ratcheted up as (MINOR SPOILERS) the crew starts getting killed one by one. Highly recommended and hugely influential.Overall 9/10",Null,0,1,19 February 2009
Corpse Bride," Somewhat padded plot line but unique look and dazzling stop-motion animation
","The plot is average but the look of 'Corpse Bride' is absolutely unique. It's pure Tim Burton! Dark and ghoulish scenes make this inappropriate for young children. The film utilizes stop-motion animation, making it very different from the usual animated fare. The voice work is uniformly good. I specially loved the Peter Lorre imitating maggot and thought Christopher Lee was memorable in a brief appearance. The songs are all right. I specially liked 'According to Plan'. The plot line feels slightly padded. This would have been brilliant as a short. However, it's still worth watching.OVERALL 7/10",Null,0,0,24 February 2009
Forrest Gump," Intriguing Social Satire with good production values
","This is an intriguing social satire in the guise of a quirky comedy-drama. Tom Hanks is good but his performance wasn't award worthy. The film takes a (MINOR SPOILERS) conservative view of American politics but it is deeper than its critics suggest. In fact, the film pokes fun at the average person who goes through life blissfully unaware of the importance of events happening around him/her. The Special Effects are effective and the period detail impeccable. There is an affecting moment earlier in the picture which brought tears to my eyes. Despite its over length and dull mid-section, its worth watching.Overall 7/10",Null,1,2,12 February 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Tremendous follow up to 'The godfather' though Brando is missed
","Part II in 'The Godfather' saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10",Null,3,4,27 February 2009
Predator," Taut sci-fi action thriller with Arnold battling a vicious predator
","This is a fast-paced sci-fi action thriller with soldier Arnold battling an invisible predator who's killing everyone one by one. The predator who is apparently from outer space is a hunter, and enjoys killing his prey and collecting body parts as trophies. The film is tense and exciting, and the Special Effects still hold up well. The predator itself has a menacing appearance and proves a worthy foe for Arnold. Only the climax feels a touch preposterous but the whole thing works well overall. A solid recommendation for Arnold fans and for fans of violent action thrillers.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,31 January 2009
Notting Hill," Good Hugh Grant, Beautiful Julia Roberts in pleasant date movie
","This was a film I wasn't particularly keen on, but it managed to work its charm on me. The story is predictable but the two stars do very well. Julia Roberts is luminescent and slips comfortably into a role tailer-made for her. Hugh Grant plays the bumbling Englishman yet again and somehow manages to make his performance feel fresh. He gets the best lines. Rhys Ifans is very good. Almost every Brit in the film plays a lovable eccentric and this seems like overkill. The ending is pure corn and die-hard romantics will probably love it. This is a watchable date movie.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,25 February 2009
The Aviator," Long biopic, good Leo but great Cate
","This is a long but fascinating take on the early life of the billionaire aviator, oil man and TWA owner Howard Hughes. Leo is fine in the lead although he looks too young, but its Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn who steals the show. She owns the screen whenever she makes an appearance and won a richly deserved Oscar. Kate Beckinsale is miscast as Ava Gardner. The rest of the cast are fine. The film takes a sympathetic view of Hughes as it depicts him fighting to control his sanity, even as he is being questioned by the Govt. for alleged improprieties. Some of the scenes detailing Hughes' Obsesive Compulsive condition go on too long and serve little purpose in the script.Overall 7/10",Null,2,3,29 January 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very Impressive Fantasy adventure
","This is very impressive indeed. A fantasy adventure that's treated with respect, but also very well directed and with imaginative Special Effects. Some of the Effects already look a bit dated (MINOR SPOILER: specially the opening battle when the ring is lost), but the rest are stylish and reveal Jackson's strengths as a filmmaker. The acting is competent with Ian McCellan faring well as Gandalf. The sets are grand and add greatly to the film's charm.

The Matrix Revolutions," Watchable but flawed conclusion to trilogy
","'The Matrix Revolutions' is a watchable conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. It's about par with the second film and never reaches the heights of the original. The dialog remains solemn verging on the ridiculous. The film simply takes itself too seriously. Stripped of the pointless dialog, this could have been good fun. Of course there's a big battle that's rather exciting and the Special Effects are quite good. Hugo Weaving remains a menacing adversary. Lawrence Fishburne is good while Keanu Reeves is effective. The film is watchable on television or DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,26 February 2009
Cast Away," Uneven film, good Hanks, generally engrossing
","'Castaway' has a slow start and the film initially tends to drag until a terrifying plane crash which is very well depicted. The long mid-section with (MINOR SPOILERS) Tom Hanks all alone on a deserted island is well worth watching. Hanks is a good actor and watching him trying to survive is an engrossing experience. Unfortunately, there are some mawkish scenes involving a basketball named Wilson, which should have been more subtle. There is some annoying product placement as well. The last act is interesting to watch. Helen Hunt has a supporting role and is alright.Overall 7/10",Null,0,3,18 February 2009
Armageddon," Lots of action but overlong and over-melodramatic
","Armageddon begins well with LOTS of ACTION! There's a ton of Special Effects as scenes of death and destruction shock/excite the viewer. Alas, the plot leaves a lot to be desired as a bunch of no-hopers led by Bruce WIllis try to save the earth from a colliding asteroid. At two and a half hours, the film is just too long. Viewer fatigue sets in with nearly an hour left to go. There are some unconvincing scenes of melodrama towards the end which are unlikely to make any adult cry. Still, its watchable as yet another brainless Michael Bay disaster (movie)! Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,21 January 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Well acted comedy drama
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a well acted comedy drama. The script may be contrived but the fine cast makes it feel fresh. Alan Arkin is a memorable foul-mouthed grandpa. Greg Kinnear plays an unsuccessful motivational speaker(!) Paul Dano is effective despite being silent for most of the film and Steve Carell is good in an understated dramatic role. While the usual life lessons are learned by everyone, there are also some hilarious pot-shots aimed at junior beauty pageants where kids as young as eight or ten take part. While hardly worthy of it's Best Picture nomination, the film is worth watching.Overall 7/10",Null,2,5,23 February 2009
"I, Robot"," Decent sci-fi entertainer with fine VFX, good Will Smith
","Lovers of Isaac Asimov's science fiction may not like it but 'I, Robot' is good fun. It's reasonably intelligent although it borrows little from Asimov's writings apart from his famous Three Laws of Robotics. Will Smith's charisma keeps the film afloat and I quite enjoyed his one-liners. The VFX is impressive and there's a thrilling chase sequence in the film that's worthy of praise. James Cromwell has a small but significant role. Bridget Moynahan is alright while Alan Tudyk voices the innocent looking robot Sonny. The climax is a bit of a letdown but the film remains a watchable entertainer.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,14 February 2009
Over the Hedge," Watchable animation, good for kids
","The plot line for 'Over the Hedge' is simple: Animals fight humans to get food. Perhaps if this film had come out a few years ago, I might have had high praise for it. The animation quality is good, there's plenty of light banter and some genuinely funny jokes. Yet the film has that 'been there seen that' look about it that seems to plague most talking animal cartoons. Nick Nolte's voice work is the most distinguished, everyone else feels average by comparison. There is nothing particularly memorable about this film, though kids will undoubtedly love it.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,4 February 2009
Wanted," Overlong but a wild adrenaline ride!
","This is a lot of fun. The film's plot is wildly implausible and it's action explosive, like something out of a comic book. James McAvoy plays a likable guy trapped in a mundane office job, with a cheating girl friend, a boss from a hell and a smarmy best friend. Enter Angelina Jolie and McAvoy's life is changed for ever! There's a clever plot twist towards the end which I didn't guess. It makes McAvoy reassess everything that's been happening to him. Morgan Freeman is solidly dependable while Jolie is enigmatic and deadly. There is too much violence and the film is overlong. Still very much watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,3,6,12 February 2009
The Patriot," Flaws in dialog and pacing, but good action in stridently patriotic period film
",This is a patriotic period film with Mel Gibson playing a farmer during the American Revolution who's reluctant to fight the British. Everything changes thanks to the actions of a sadistic English officer. Jason Isaacs plays the villain with great relish. He is as black as they come and the film sometimes goes overboard in its depiction of the British. The action is good and Gibson is solid as usual. Heath Ledger has a brief appearance as Gibson's son. The film is weakly paced and the dialog occasionally anachronistic. Still watchable on television/DVD.Overall 6/10,Null,0,4,21 February 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," overlong but generally funny adult romcom
","Steve Carell is a funny guy. In this film he plays an appealing geeky character who is still a virgin at the ripe old age of forty. The situation is naturally ripe for comedy and the film generally doesn't disappoint, although it isn't a 'classic' or 'the funniest film ever made', as some have suggested. Some of the adult humor comes of as lame and childish. Catherine Keener is a decent romantic foil and she and Carell share a warm rapport (but few genuine sparks). Paul Rudd is quite good as the friend although everybody chips in well. Note: the extended version is a bit of a bore, so stick to the shorter and better-edited theatrical cut.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,8 January 2009
Spider-Man," Watchable and fun Superhero film marred slightly by sub-par Special Effects
","This was a blockbuster superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. In many ways, the first hour is the best as we get to know more about Peter Parker, and how exactly he becomes Spiderman. Tobey Maguire gives a pitch perfect performance as the awkward and geeky Parker. Kirsten Dunst is alright as Peter's love Mary Jane Watson. William Dafoe hams it up as the Green Goblin despite being hamstrung by a bad suit. James Franco is stiff as Harry, Peter's best friend. The Special Effects are not very convincing. There's a corny patriotic scene towards the end that pulls you out of the film. Otherwise very much watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,3 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," dark and stylish Potter with a Mexican sensibility!
","The Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty impressive for a Harry Potter film. With Alfonso Cuaron at the helm, the film is much more adult and darker in tone. Breathtakingly shot and superbly visualized, there is genuine emotion in the story, unlike the 'americanized' tone of the first two films. Harry is older this time and ready to get angry. Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson provide stand out performances (though only supporting in nature). The young actors are generally competent though Radcliffe struggles a bit compared to Watson and Grint. The special effects are truly magical, specially some scary 'dementors' and an amazing 'hippogriff'. The film is still a bit too long and some parts of the plot aren't fully explained.Overall 8/10",Null,0,2,9 January 2009
Ratatouille," very entertaining and thought-provoking Pixar effort
","Ratatouille is a thought-provokingly superb Pixar effort, effortlessly besting its nearest rivals in the Animated Category. Brad Bird's animated tale of a rat (Remy) who pursues his dreams of becoming a world class chef in Paris is very entertaining, although more geared towards adults. The story will be of lesser interest to kids (apart from the excellent physical comedy routines). The story doesn't take the easy way out, but instead takes it time setting up the characters. The animation is brilliant. Peter O'Toole is perfect as a cynical critic, and the scene where he first tastes Remy's cuisine has to be seen to be believed. His climactic speech where he bemoans the cynicism and futility of critics is quite deep for a cartoon! Truly one of the finest Pixar films yet, only slightly below Wall.E and The Incredibles. Overall 9/10",Null,1,3,7 January 2009
Aliens," Impressive sequel to Alien, Last hour is unbearably intense
","James Cameron goes in an entirely new direction with this sequel . Rather than make a horror movie, 'Aliens' is an all out action movie. The film starts slowly and takes it's time to set things up. However, once the action begins there is no let up, with the final hour almost unbearably intense. Sigourney Weaver makes a great female action hero. The film lacks the slow horror of the first film and the characterizations aren't as well depicted. The Special Effects are very impressive and the production design and look of the aliens is worthy of praise. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10",Null,1,4,19 February 2009
Gandhi," Very long epic biopic with impressive Ben Kingsley
","Richard Attenborough's mammoth epic is worth seeing for Ben Kingsley's impressive lead performance. Kingsley IS Gandhi and dominates the film from start to end. The film copies the time line followed by 'Lawrence of Arabia' by choosing to begin with Gandhi's assassination and funeral. It glosses over Gandhi's lesser known but bizarre personality quirks, but that's a minor nitpick. However, it is overly reverent at times. Still, it is very engrossing. 'Gandhi' is very long and secondary characters are mostly short-changed as the film ambitiously shows India's partition and it's bloody aftermath. Recommended.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,16 February 2009
Pearl Harbor," Plodding film with impressive Pearl Harbor destruction segment
","This film is worth seeing only for the forty minutes when Pearl Harbor is being bombed. It would have been a disaster without those impressive CGI-enhanced scenes of destruction. The rest of the film is a plodding love triangle with mediocre actors and a script that's packed with clichés. Jon Voight plays a scarcely believable President Roosevelt. The film is useless as a history lesson beyond the most rudimentary details. For a reasonably accurate and engrossing look at Pearl Harbor, 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is your best bet. Otherwise, this is just a typical Michael Bay film with very few signs of intelligence.Overall 5/10",Null,2,3,26 January 2009
Enchanted," Leaves you feeling giddily romantic
","What fabulous fun 'Enchanted' is! A welcome return to form for Disney. Amy Adams is blissfully sweet, yet slyly self-aware as the cartoon character caught in the real world. She and Patrick Dempsey make a sweet couple. The comedy routines and songs are the stuff of legend, specially a great Broadway musical in a park. A CGI chipmunk steals the show. Susan Sarandon is a trifle miscast as the evil queen and seems slightly out of place. The climax is a partial letdown. The first ten minutes comprise a clever Disney self-parody as they poke fun at their older romantic cartoons. A charming surprise indeed.Overall 8/10",Null,1,1,18 January 2009
Resident Evil," Sluggish start, weak VFX. An average watch
","For a film based on a video game, Resident Evil has a very sluggish start. It takes well over an hour for the plot to gather steam. This hurts it a lot. The production design at least initially is good though the Special Effects have already dated and look tacky. The performances are generally decent and Milla Jovovich has good screen presence. There is plenty of blood and gore and the film is definitely not for the squeamish. There are a lot of plot-holes and the action is not very thrilling. This is an average flick that still remains better than it's sequel 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'.Overall 4/10",Null,0,1,18 February 2009
Quantum of Solace," Watchable Bond film, but with major flaws
","This film is quite a letdown after the stunning 'Casino Royale'. The plot is nonsensical (Bond trying to protect Bolivia's water supply!), humor is in very short supply, and the action scenes are hurt by an 'arty' approach whereby meaningless secondary scenes are juxtaposed between high-octane action sequences. Maybe this is what comes from an art-house directer making a Bond adventure. Daniel Craig tries his best but is badly hamstrung by a role that gives him virtually nothing to do. The climax (MINOR SPOILERS) is unsatisfying, specially the fate of the villain. Watchable on DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,5,9,31 January 2009
Gone with the Wind," Production values still hold up in massive epic, fine Vivien Leigh and Rhett Butler
","'Gone With the Wind' is a much beloved epic that still impresses. It's only drawback is over length and a tendency towards excessive melodrama, specially in the last hour. Otherwise, the performances are generally very good with Vivien Leigh and Rhett Butler having great chemistry together. Leigh's character is selfish but she captures our attention from start to end. The film's views on racial harmony are obviously dated. Yet it has an amazing scale and the production values are very good. The sacking of Atlanta is specially well depicted. Definitely well worth watching.Overall 8/10",Null,3,5,18 February 2009

All we do is watch a bunch of B-movie thespians wander aimlessly around for what seems like an eternity inside a pyramid in the antarctic (!) waiting for the titular villains to finally show up. The horror is limited by the PG-13 content of the film. (MINOR SPOILERS) The film treats the predators as the good guys. There's some peculiar human-predator bonding towards the end.

No Country for Old Men," memorable Javier Bardem in intriguing film, masterfully directed
","This is an intriguing film with cracking dialog directed masterfully by the Coen Brothers. The plot line is ambiguous and the ending very anticlimactic, but all that is expected from the Coens. Javier Bardem is memorable as a menacing killer Anton Chigurh who's after Josh Brolin (also great). The third main character is sheriff Tommy Lee Jones, who can't understand the brutality of an ever-changing world. The film is at times dense, with many issues subtly raised. There's an impressive cat and mouse sequence in the mid-section that's thrilling to watch. Highly recommended and deserves multiple viewings.Overall 9/10",Null,1,1,1 March 2009
Batman Begins," Very impressive beginning of Batman
","'Batman Begins' is a terrific reboot of the Batman franchise. After the disappointing 'Batman and Robin', this is a welcome turn towards gritty reality. The film takes its time explaining to us how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. Special Effects are judiciously used and never overwhelm the story. Bale is good both as Bruce Wayne and as Batman. The supporting cast all shine with only Katie Holmes feeling a trifle miscast. However, the fight scenes are somewhat chaotic and there's a minor lapse into pretentiousness late in the film. Still, very impressive considering this is a superhero movie we are talking about.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,7 January 2009

",This is a mediocre follow up to 'Meet The Parents'. The jokes appear in fits and starts despite the presence of an all star cast. The script is weak. It feels like a retread of the first film. Several incidents are repeated and the energy level sags at times. It is fun though to see Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman playing a married couple. They clearly improvised many of their lines.The film milks some laughs from the liberal-conservative divide between the Focker and the Byrnes families. Robert De Niro isn't as funny this time round.

Saving Private Ryan," Visceral opening, but then loses its intensity and lapses occasionally into over-sentimentality
","This film is very well researched and the opening thirty minutes are intensely visceral as we experience the D-Day landings in Normandy, France. After such a stunning start, the film suffers because it never again captures that intensity. The story is simple and shows the American soldiers as good honest men who fight because it's their duty. Hanks is fine in an understated role. Matt Damon is slightly bland. No one else leaves much of an impression. The film descends into sentimentality frequently, and this does occasionally fell like overkill. Still, it's well worth watching.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,6 February 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Better Special Effects but easily the weakest in the Jurassic franchise
","The Special Effects have improved in this sequel to 'Jurassic Park'. However, its overlong, packed with implausible events and is easily the weakest in the franchise. Julianne Moore's character, for one, appears far too casual as she (MINOR SPOILERS) merrily goes about saving a baby T.Rex without realizing the consequences. The film is also more violent and unsuitable for young children. There is a long subplot towards the end which exists mainly to create a kind of 'King Kong' homage. It works but it's not really needed in the film. Still watchable as a serviceable Effects driven popcorn movie.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,3 February 2009
Cars," Good not Great Pixar
","Cars is a perfectly watchable Pixar Animation. There's nothing wrong with that, but after the high standards set by 'Nemo' and 'Incredibles', its natural to feel a bit letdown. The script never really explains this world populated entirely by cars, and these cars exhibit ALL the features of human beings, its strange really. Still, the animation quality is amazing, specially the scenic views of the South West United States. The plot is old-fashioned and reassuring, with the moral of enjoying life, rather than simply racing by. A pleasant watch but nothing great.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,21 January 2009
JFK," Very well acted conspiracy theory by Stone
","There is a star-studded lineup in this Oliver Stone conspiracy thriller. Despite its slightly dubious premise and desire to consider every possible wacky theory in the JFK assassination, the film is superbly acted and very engrossing. Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon are the pick of the lot. Everyone does well with the exception of a slightly wooden Kevin Costner. Stone employs his usual array of cinematic tricks but does so in a compelling manner. It's best not to take everything in this film seriously, but rather to watch the fascinating drama and splendid acting.Overall 8/10",Null,2,12,27 January 2009
Ghost Rider," Good production design but terrible script leaves the whole thing a mess
","This film was quite a letdown. Despite the fine production design and decent Special Effects you still leave the theater disappointed. The flaws are mainly in the script which simply doesn't work. There are some laughable line spoken by the actors with a straight face. Ghost Rider's various powers are never adequately explained, which means the fight scenes make little sense. These flaws could have easily been fixed. Nicolas Cage tries hard to make the material better than it deserves. Peter Fonda is alright but hamstrung by the script. Wes Bentley is wholly inadequate as the villain. Disappointing.Overall 3/10",Null,1,2,21 February 2009
Hellboy," Dark and stylish Superhero movie, good Ron Perlman
","'Hellboy' is an entertaining superhero movie directed with style by Guillermo del Toro. Unlike Superman and Spiderman, Hellboy is a dark superhero with a surprisingly demonic origin. The film is slick and well-paced and there are plenty of VFX. The production design is imaginative and the Special Effects achieve a lot on a limited budget. Ron Perlman has some terrific one-liners as our sarcastic superhero. Everyone else is adequate. However, I was disappointed in Rasputin (Karel Roden). He should have been a more menacing character. A solidly entertaining watch.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,19 February 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," tremendous battle at Helm's Deep, amazing CGI Gollum
","The Two Towers is my favorite film in the Rings trilogy. It is darker than 'Fellowship' and contains more character development than 'Return of the King'. The film has a slow start which can lead to some impatience but it builds to a visceral battle at Helm's Deep which is filmed using a combination of CGI and regular stunt work. Viggo Mortenson gets a larger share of the action this time as the heroic Aragorn. Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis is a remarkable Special Effects creation and singlehandedly lifts this film to another level. His pitiable yet frightening conversations with himself are mesmerizing.

Schindler's List," A notable achievement despite some unnecessary melodrama towards the end
","Schindler's List is a notable achievement for Spielberg. Here he presents a harrowing account of the horrors suffered by the Jews in World War II, along with a generally uplifting story of hope. All three major performances (Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes) are solid, specially Fiennes, who is impressive as an evil Nazi. The film is careful to present him as a fully formed character rather than a caricature. The clearance of the Jews from the Warsaw ghetto is shown in unsparing detail and without a trace of sentiment. Alas, Spielberg slips up in the end with a fake-sounding speech from Oskar Schindler melodramatically lamenting his inability to do more. Still strongly recommended.Overall 9/10",Null,1,3,22 January 2009

But, it is still very very impressive and deserves a place on anybody's top ten animated movies list. A subversive superhero movie and spoof all rolled into one, with jaw dropping action scenes and tender family drama, Brad Bird's animated masterpiece thoroughly deserved its Best Animation Film Oscar. Kids may be a bit bored but adults will be thoroughly entranced.

Some scenes work and some don't. The ratio of hits to misses falls well short of Shrek and Shrek2. The entire Artie storyline is middling at best and drags the film down. Also, Donkey and Puss have precious little to do. Plenty of jokes are recycled from the previous films. While kids will probably enjoy it, adults should skip the theatrical version and wait for DVD or the Television premiere.Overall 6/10",Null,3,3,7 January 2009
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Very mixed feelings on this film
","I have to admit I am unsure about this film. After a sweet opening thirty minutes with the geeky and shy Suri (SRK), the film suffers after Suri dresses and acts outrageously as the irritating Raj simply so that he can catch a glimpse of his wife dancing at the local dance competition. Raj is very annoying, and Shahrukh is plainly to old to pull off this role. Much of the mid-section invites audience boredom, as they wonder why the husband would do something so bizarre. Some critics have claimed that the Raj character is an open attack on Bollywood romantic heroes. Indeed, this may be true, but it still isn't very interesting to watch as the balance of the film is ruined.Thank heavens, the film sets itself right in the end with a sweet climax and ends with a charming voice-over by King Khan over the credits.Overall 5/10",Null,2,7,11 January 2009
Transformers," Eye-popping Special Effects in overlong but entertaining film
","I enjoyed this film a great deal despite the plot loopholes and over length. Michael Bay has delivered his most popcorn-friendly movie to date! There's a lot of action and the Special Effects, specially in the last thirty minutes, have to be seen to be believed. There are some comic moments, notably when the Autobots are hiding from Shia's family. The acting is alright though Jon Voight appears slightly embarrassed as the Defence Secretary. Megan Fox looks too old to still be in school but provides the requisite amount of glamor. A tighter plot would have made this more impressive but the film remains a lot of fun.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,5 February 2009

The plot is contrived: two tennis players meet during Wimbledon and fall in love. It's that simple. Bettany has some nice one-liners early on and his voice-overs are thoughtful. There's a (MINOR SPOILERS) climactic tennis final and there are no prizes for guessing the result. Sam Neill is wasted while Jon Favreau has a nice cameo.

In an effort to mimic a video game, the action scenes are blurred and incoherent with split second edits rendering everything incomprehensible. In fact, I ended up with a headache. The Special Effects remain decent however, and (MINOR SPOILERS) a secret weapon called Nemesis is an impressive creation.

Indeed, after watching Vol II, I felt that Vol I was overlong and superfluous, and could have been dispensed with entirely. However, the film is VERY stylish. The fight scenes are impressive and Uma Thurman looks cool as she dispatches hundreds of men to their deaths with a samurai sword. David Carradine's role is severely limited which is a pity. There is a long anime sequence which is hyper-violent but works. Watchable.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,26 February 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Excellent production design, good Freddie Highmore but creepy Depp
",This film is yet another triumph of production design for Tim Burton. His chocolate factory is a place of wonder. Clearly a lot of money was spent on the film. The story is adapted from Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory' and is a reasonable watch. Johnny Depp plays Willie Wonka and the otherwise gifted actor appears a bit too quirky to pull off the role. He gives a creepy vibe of Michael Jackson! Freddie Highmore is very good as Charlie and his Dickensian lifestyle is interesting to watch. All the other kids are spoiled brats and are taught some choice lessons. The sly lyrics and catchy tunes are yet another highlight. Recommended.Overall 7/10,Null,2,3,5 February 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Good entertainer. The best in the M:I series
","This John Woo directed sequel to Mission Impossible has plenty of high-octane action stunts, specially in the second half. The story which involves a deadly virus is implausible, and the first half rather low key with a greater focus on old-fashioned spying and gadgetry. However, the last hour is nearly non-stop action. The stylish stunts are expertly choreographed and Tom Cruise looks cool with his sunglasses! Thandie Newton is refreshingly different as the love interest. This is an enjoyable popcorn blockbuster, easily the best in the M:I series and certainly worth watching on the big screen.Overall 6/10",Null,2,4,16 February 2009
A Bug's Life," Watchable children's animation, weak story but colorful visuals
","I disliked this film on first viewing but repeat viewings have made me change my mind. It's not without it's share of flaws but is still quite watchable. The film caters to a younger audience than 'Antz'. There are bright colors and the animation is spectacular at times. The story is lifted from 'Seven Samurai', something which was a turn-off for me on first viewing. However, it does have some subtle humor and the closing credits alone are almost worth the price of admission. The film is slow to start and the pace slightly uneven. The last hour is a lot of fun as the pace picks up. Watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,18 February 2009
The Insider," Overlong but remarkable acting by Crowe

He is flawless in depicting Jeffrey Wigand, a former research scientist for Big Tobacco who is hounded for revealing some nasty truths in front of a CBS '60 minutes' program. He has a remarkable ability to project tension without really appearing to try!. Al Pacino is alright though he suffers in comparison.

John Turturro is magnificent as Herbie Stempel, a Jew who claims that the aristocratic Charles Van Doren (excellent Ralph Fiennes) has been fed the right answers during the show. Robert Redford's motive is to suggest the loss of innocence in America with the end of the fifties and the impending arrival of the culture wars and civil strife. Whether an American audience in the fifties was that gullible is open to question however. The film is a trifle overlong but never boring. Recommended.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,3 February 2009

The storyline builds up on elements introduced in the excellent 'Batman Begins'. The film gains immeasurably from a creepy performance by Heath Ledger as the freaky Joker, The Dark Knight is slightly overlong but never boring. The confrontation scenes between Batman and the Joker (most specifically a high speed chase) leave you gasping for breath. The climactic action scenes seem a bit rushed but that's a minor niggle.

Blood Diamond," Very well acted film, struggles to overcome it's 'message'
","The message movie tag sits heavily on Blood Diamond and ultimately prevents it from being truly great. Leonardo and Djimon are both very good as they form a team to track down a diamond, their ticket out of civil war torn Africa. Jennifer Connely is stuck with the 'anguished liberal' journalist role, but does her best. There some powerful moments in the film like the recruitment of child soldiers, their brutal training and brainwashing.

The film tries its best to be cinematic (always difficult with Austen), and on the whole does well. The camera constantly moves and architecture is very skilfully filmed, conveying a wealth of information on what the characters are feeling. Keira is annoying initially, but her character slowly grows on you. Macfadyen is a bit bland. The rest of the cast is competent.

Still, its strangely watchable as it concentrates on three major episodes in Prague, Langely (Virgina) and the Channel Tunnel. The acting is adequate though Jon Voight is strangely muted. Tom Cruise has a long but spectacular stunt (MINOR SPOILERS) inside CIA headquarters that's gripping to watch. The climax feels perfunctory and the addition of loud explosions seems a bit forced. In general, it's worth seeing at least once on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,1,1,14 February 2009
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Pleasant sequel, almost an exact copy of the first
","If you liked the first film you will like this sequel. It's as simple as that. Thereis nothing particularly unique about the Home Alone series where a precocious kid (Macaulay Culkin) outsmarts some crooks and subjects them to rather painful cartoon-like violence. If anything, the violence is worse this time round. However, the setting is Christmas which gives the perfect excuse for a family-friendly soundtrack. Culkin is decent though a bit too smart while Joe Pesci brings a lot of energy to his role. This is a pleasant watch specially at home on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,23 February 2009
Groundhog Day," Superb Bill Murray in ingeniously conceived comedy
","This is an ingenious comedy that turns out to have a heart. Bill Murray is simply superb as the narcissistic weather man who finds himself trapped in a bizarre twilight zone episode. Reliving each day over and over again leads to some brilliant comic set-pieces. However, its the gradual change in Murray's character and his cheerful acceptance of things which makes this film a perennial favorite of mine. There are plenty of laughs but mostly in the first hour, after which the tone changes slightly. The supporting cast are all fine and Andie Macdowell is good as the leading lady. An excellent comedy that makes you think.Overall 9/10",Null,3,6,31 January 2009
Hoosiers," Clichéd but very heartwarming, Excellent Hackman
","This film does an excellent job in painting the picture of a sport-obsessed Mid-West small town. The story is the classic come-back-from-behind, a staple of sports movies, but the authenticity of the backdrop helps a great deal. Gene Hackman is excellent in an understated performance as the new coach of the basketball team. He has a few skeletons in his closet and the film handles this cliché well. Dennis Hopper plays a redeemed alcoholic and convinces. The energy in the high school games is effortlessly captured. I found 'Hoosiers' clichéd but heartwarming and its one of my all time favorite sports movies.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,28 January 2009
Pulp Fiction," Razor-sharp dialog in violent and profane gangster parody. Highly recommended
","Pulp Fiction is without a doubt Quentin Tarantino's best work. The film is a long, violent parody of the gangster genre with some excellent performances. The dialog is very profane with countless F- words. It also sounds very geeky at times. However, its razor-sharp, slyly self-aware and frequently very funny. There are multiple story lines which intersect, and the screenplay won a richly deserved Oscar. Samuel L. Jackson is in tremendous form and has a memorable speech. Travolta, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all good. The film remains engrossing throughout and is highly recommended.Overall 10/10",Null,1,2,26 February 2009
Titanic," Awesome spectacle with magical chemistry between Kate and Leo
","On a recent viewing of Titanic, I realized that some of the Special Effects now look slightly dodgy. Still, the bulk of the film holds up very well. The beginning is a bit slow as the older Rose narrates her story. Bill Paxton is wasted in a thankless part. Leo and Kate's tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though. They absolutely convinced me they were in love. Once the ship strikes the iceberg, the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch. Titanic remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heart-breaking romance.Overall 9/10",Null,1,3,26 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Solid, by-the-numbers film, decent entertainer but not as good as the book
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is adequate as a film but falls well short of the book. The cast is good though Daniel Radcliffe is rather green. The film however feels surprisingly by-the-numbers. A little more imagination and perhaps some risks could well have made it memorable, but it sticks to the printed text almost to the letter. While young fans will love it, adults may bemoan a missed opportunity. Still, its not all bad. Robbie Coltrane is endearing as gentle giant Hagrid, and the climax works very well. This film is a solid entertainer without ever reaching for anything higher.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,19 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good action set-pieces but otherwise a step down from Cuaron's 'Azkaban'
","This fourth installment of the Harry Potter series is an entertaining watch even if it never reaches the level of Alfonso Cuaron's magical 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. The plot revolves around a wizarding tournament and there are some good action set-pieces, most notably involving a deadly fire-breathing dragon. The script is hugely simplified to maintain the film's length. However, scenes dealing with Harry's first date and his inability to ask a girl out are retained, adding a touch of humor to the story. The acting is average though Ralph Fiennes leaves an impact in the creepy climax.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,5 February 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Watchable but a letdown after the first film
",The Special Effects are even better in this sequel to The Matrix. However the film is a relative letdown. There is a lot of pseudo-scientific babble. Unlike the first film it sounds somewhat pretentious. The religious metaphors are rather unsubtle and there's a solemnity hanging around the whole film. Lawrence Fishburne reprises his role and impresses. Keanu Reeves is alright. There are two major fight sequences which remain exciting to watch. The film ends without a definite conclusion which may annoy some. It is a decent watch specially at home on television or DVD.Overall 6/10,Null,0,0,26 February 2009
A Beautiful Mind," Worth watching for fine acting despite being somewhat misleading and overtly sentimental
","This was a very well acted drama but it is very misleading in it's portrayal (MINOR SPOILERS) of schizophrenia. The direction by Ron Howard is conventional but what makes this film worth watching is the chemistry between Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe. Their relationship seems genuine and I loved the tender moments between them. The film becomes overtly sentimental towards the end but never crosses over completely into full flown melodrama. Some of the attempts at explaining mathematics seem too clever by half. Still recommended, though scarcely deserving of its Best Film Oscar.Overall 7/10",Null,1,3,4 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Good sequel, overlong but entertaining
","This film picks up from where the first one ended and remains generally entertaining. Directed again by Chris Columbus, this time, a few more risks are taken, and Hogwarts appears more magical and menacing this time round. The VFX are good as (MINOR SPOILERS) Harry escapes from terrifying spiders, and battles a ferocious Basilisk. Still, the film is way too long and the mid-section sags. Some scenes could have been cut. The acting is decent with the adult cast doing much better than the kids. Alan Rickman remains the pick of the lot while Kenneth Branagh looks like he's having a lot of fun. Watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,19 February 2009
The Departed," Long and hard-hitting thriller-drama
","Long and hard-hitting police thriller-drama by Scorsese is not without its share of flaws, but remains an immensely enjoyable film. The acting is generally very good, though Nicholson occasionally lapses into caricature. Leo is surely the pick of the cast with his growing sense of desperation very well depicted. Damon is good but a bit flat in a couple of scenes. Baldwin and Wahlberg are both great. The film is long but gripping. One major nitpick with the film: the fate of Leo and some other characters is so suddenly decided, its almost farcical! Still, a good watch.Overall 8/10",Null,0,3,13 January 2009
The Holiday," Watchable but overtly manipulative, overlong and meandering
","This film is way too long to be a pleasant romantic comedy. There are two intertwined couples here, and while Cameron and Jude have some chemistry, the same can't be said for Kate and Jack. In fact, Winslet probably has more screen time with veteran Eli Wallach. The plot is meandering and insubstantial, the characters superficial and unbelievable. The England part of the storyline is almost sickeningly sweet with Jude Law's two adorable girls. Clearly the film's creators want to tug at our heart strings. Unfortunately, the whole thing's too overtly manipulative to be enjoyable. Still watchable though.Overall 5/10",Null,0,1,2 February 2009
War of the Worlds," Memorable scenes of terror and destruction, loses its way towards the end
","Spielberg shows some terrifying scenes of panic and destruction in this Sci-fi remake of 'War of the Worlds'. Unfortunately, the film loses its way in the last half hour and ends with a fizz not a bang. The stunning opening scenes where the alien tripod first appears is memorable, and the resulting chaos very well depicted. Cruise has little to do in the first hour besides stare at the destruction and run! Dakota fanning is a good actress but was somewhat annoying. Spielberg gives into his sentimental side with a happy ending that feels contrived. Stil worth watching for its first ninety minutes.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,25 February 2009
Love Actually," Not for cynics but sweetly romantic and watchable
","This is a decent watch for Christmas Eve or whenever you are in a decidedly romantic mood. It is not for everyone and may cause sugar shock amongst cynics. Numerous couples and multiple story lines are intertwined together and it is to the directer's credit that the film remains coherent. Hugh Grant has fun as the Prime Minister who ticks off Billy Bob Thornton, playing the horny US president! Also in fine touch are Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman Some segment are a little too cute, including the fatherly chat Liam Neeson has with his son. Watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,1,2,13 February 2009
Wedding Crashers," Begins well but loses steam towards the end with a bland romance
",This film begins well with some rapid fire banter from Vince Vaugn. He and Owen Wilson play a pair of lovable wedding crashers who get more than they bargained for after gatecrashing a politician's (Christopher Walken) wedding. The jokes and witticisms soon end as the film turns into a rather dull romance between a visibly disinterested Wilson and Rachel McAdam (who is stunningly beautiful). There are some cheap gay jokes and the whole thing feels like a wasted opportunity to go all out. There is a key cameo towards the end that turns out to be disappointing. Watchable on television/DVD.Overall 6/10,Null,1,2,13 February 2009
To Kill a Mockingbird," Excellent child acting in slightly overrated film
","This is a good film but it's hard to justify its claims to greatness. It deals with racism in simple terms, most of the whites are bigots and all the blacks are simple, honest and virtuous types. There are very few lines for the black actors (which is probably a symptom of when the film was made). What is commendable is the acting of the children. Their antics are all naturally believable and they run rings around Gregory Peck, the actual Oscar winner! The courtroom drama is effective but feels incomplete. It doesn't even bother to present the arguments of the prosecution. Watchable but slightly overrated.Overall 7/10",Null,2,5,28 January 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Quirky Woody Allen type comedy drama, pleasing performances
",The story is slight but the acting is impressive in this genuinely quirky Woody Allen type comedy-drama. Will Farrell eases off his manic persona to give a pleasing performance as a straitlaced and methodical IRS auditor who suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear. Maggie Gyllenhaal breathes life into a simple role and is a delight to watch. She shares genuine chemistry with Farrell. Emma Thompson has some wonderful lines as a weary author. Dustin Hoffman is solid. The plot promises more than it can deliver but the acting carries the film. An enjoyable watch.Overall 7/10,Null,0,0,25 February 2009
Hancock," Rushed conclusion but an intriguing departure from most superhero films
","This is an intriguing departure from most superhero movies. Will Smith plays Hancock like a jerk. Smith's likability greatly helps as Hancock's rough edges aren't very appealing. Charlize Theron has a significant role in the film as (MINOR SPOILERS) Hancock's back story is gradually revealed. It is surprisingly intense and deserved more screen time. The film's conclusion is rushed which may account for most of the critical reactions against it. Also the villains seem to appear out of nowhere and are broad caricatures. Still, the acting is good and the film is a decent watch, at least on home viewing.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,12 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Geat VFX but weak dialog. The best of the prequels
","This is the best of the prequels by far but doesn't come close to the strongest entry in the series - The Empire Strikes Back. The film is better focused, the VFX are impressive as usual, and there is a lot of action. In fact, some of the fighting could have been toned down. Yoda remains the most expressive of all the performers(!) Hayden Christensen is stiff as usual while Natalie Portman gets some awful dialog. Ewan McGregor tries his hand at an Alec Guinness accent. The (MINOR SPOILERS) battle between Yoda and the emperor is a treat to watch. The film is a solidly entertaining watch.Overall 7/10",Null,1,3,19 February 2009
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Impressive film, slightly hurt by unnecessary padding
","This is a well known classic and often praised as the greatest Animated Feature film of all time. In my humble opinion, that honor belongs to Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991). 'Snow White' begins very well and the title character's flight into the forest is very imaginatively depicted. Alas, there's a lot of padding as time is spent on some cute forest creatures. The film picks up again with the entry of the seven dwarfs. The evil Queen is frightening and probably deserved more scenes. Considering it's age, the film is impressive and definitely worth watching.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,27 January 2009
The Lion King," Excellent animation quality but average storyline with dull mid-section
","'The Lion King' is a watchable cartoon feature with a serviceable plot line but excellent animation. The opening sequence is breath-taking. There's also an amazing stampede later in the film that feels stunningly real. There are some fine songs by Elton John. Alas, the story isn't as great. The plot is loosely inspired from Hamlet but feels rather feudal. The mid-section tends to sag. The film goes overboard in its depiction of the villain Scar (a fine Jeremy Irons) by giving him pronounced 'asiatic' features as opposed to the good lions. Despite these misgivings, the film remains entertaining.Overall 7/10",Null,1,1,23 February 2009
The Good Shepherd," Engrossing spy saga despite some flaws
","The good Shepherd is a solidly directed and engrossing spy saga. It recounts the early years of the CIA through the eyes of one man Edward Wilson, played well by Matt Damon. Damon is a bit muted though, and for some odd reason he doesn't age even though the film follows his life for more than twenty years. Angelina Jolie is decent but somewhat miscast. Several incidents in the film appear based on real events and the period recreation is impeccable. Michael Gambon is good in a somewhat poorly explained role. John Turturro is underused. Despite some flaws, the film is well worth watching.Overall 7/10",Null,1,3,27 February 2009
The Terminal," Watchable fantasy, good Hanks but flawed script
","Spielberg directs this gentle fantasy of an immigrant stuck at a New York airport. The script doesn't fully work but Tom Hanks is very effective. He brings a vulnerability to the role as he gradually befriends everyone with his positive attitude. Catherine Zeta Jones is wasted in a brief role. Stanley Tucci is alright but his character doesn't entirely suit the whimsical nature of this film. Kumar Pallana is endearing as the gruff yet soft-hearted Gupta. The film's climax feels contrived, specially Hanks's reasons for visiting the US. Still its definitely worth a watch.Overall 6/10",Null,0,1,23 February 2009
The Iron Giant," Solid animated feature with devastating conclusion
","This film took me completely by surprise. For most of its running time, its a decent if unspectacular animated feature showing the relationship between a giant robot and a young boy. The era is the 1950s and cold war paranoia is at an all time high. The film is highly critical of the various investigative agencies. However, what really works is the ending. It is very emotional and makes you re-evaluate the entire film. The voice work is unremarkable and there are no cute talking animals or light-hearted pop culture references that currently plague most animated feature films. Worth watching.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,12 February 2009
Iron Man," Fun, unpretentious entertainer, second half weaker than first
","This is a fast-paced comic book movie and a lot of fun. Robert Downey Jr is excellent as the maverick billionaire Tony Stark, who develops a robotic suit in response to current events in Afghanistan. The first hour moves really fast as Downey develops his Iron Man suit. The second hour is not as good with some tedious sermonizing about the suffering caused by American war weaponry. The climax is bit of a letdown (MINOR SPOILERS) with two CGI robots trying to smash each other to bits. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but interesting role as Tony Stark's warm and caring secretary. Recommended as a fun entertainer with no pretensions to greatness.Overall 7/10",Null,1,2,25 January 2009
Casino Royale," Hard hitting Bond film, Craig is fantastic!
","This is an impressive Bond film, with a star-making turn by the superb Daniel Craig. Craig brings an impressive dynamism and menace to the role and eclipses almost all previous Bonds (except perhaps Connery). The film's structure is a bit uneven with three different acts. The first part is more of a traditional Bond film, with some explosive action set pieces. Specially noteworthy is the stupendous stunt work in a long, meticulously choreographed chase. Then there is a long and surprisingly involving love story with 007 falling head over heels in love. The last act is the finest with betrayal and a heartbreaking death scene. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and has some fiery exchanges with Daniel Craig. Highly recommended, although, be warned, its surprisingly violent.Overall 9/10",Null,2,4,19 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Watchable sequel but weaker than the first film
","This sequel to 'Elizabeth' is really two movies in one. The first focuses on court intrigue and assassination plots against Queen Elizabeth. The second is the Spanish Armada and how England faces up to the challenge.While the first segment is reasonably engrossing despite being convoluted, the second feels rushed. The Spanish invasion probably deserved a movie of its own. Cate Blanchett is decent in the lead but doesn't come close to her nuanced performance in 'Elizabeth'. Her emotional entanglements occasionally annoy. Samantha Morton is excellent in a brief appearance. Geoffrey Rush and Clive Owen are adequate. Watchable but weaker than the first film.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,1 March 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," excellent action thriller, worthy entry in Die Hard series
","Live Free or Die Hard is an excellent action thriller and a worthy entry in the Die Hard series. The plot has Bruce Willis as John Mclane bringing down a terrorist who is trying to destroy the nation's infrastructure in a 'fire-sale'. There are very few lulls and the action goes on virtually nonstop. The stunts and CGI work is very good and the film is strongly recommended as a thrill ride. The only weak points are a couple of lame one-liners by Bruce Willis and a somewhat weak villain played by Timothy Olyphant. Maggie Q, his hench woman is much better and should have had a bigger role. Profanity is however less than usual for a Die Hard film and that might be an issue for some(!).Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,8 January 2009
The Sixth Sense," Good thriller, fine Haley Joel Osment. Script feels slightly contrived
",Time has robbed this film of it's sheen. It's still very watchable but the script feels a trifle contrived. Those who guess the final twist beforehand won't like the film. Others will probably be thrilled and see it again. Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who tries to help a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with a terrifying problem. Both give fine performances. Willis is however a bit too muted. Osment is very effective and won an Oscar nomination. Toni Collete is excellent in a brief role. The film is creepy but not very scary. The ending doesn't fully explain everything but is emotionally satisfying.Overall 7/10,Null,0,0,23 February 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Impressive end to trilogy, though the weakest of the three
","This was the weakest of the trilogy for me but still a very impressive film. There are glorious battles and excellent action set-pieces. In fact, most of the film is one long series of battles. The CGI here is better than in the previous two films (apart from some slightly dubious scenes of Legolas bringing down an Olyphant). The acting as usual is assured with Ian McCellan doing the honours. Minor problems with the film include over length (Jackson could have trimmed the running time by half an hour at least) and the multiple false endings. They work better in the context of the entire trilogy but still go on too long. Highly recommended all the same.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,24 January 2009
Munich," Powerful film by Spielberg depicting Israeli response to terror
","I consider 'Munich', along with Schindler's List, to be among Spielberg's best films and worthy of high praise. The film is long but never boring as it details attempts by an Israeli team led by Eric Bana (excellent) to avenge the terror attacks at the Munich Olympics. It masterfully shows their confidence gradually dissolving as they come face to face with nagging doubt, and the growing realization that violence only engenders violence. Note that the film doesn't do this in a heavy-handed manner. While some have criticized him for being naive, I believe Spielberg's only motive is to step back and look at the entire conflict from a distance. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10",Null,1,1,2 February 2009
The Truman Show," Impressive Carrey in uplifting cautionary fable
","This is a deceptively simple film. The central plot twist is what keeps the film fresh along with impressive acting by Jim Carrey (who plays Truman). Unfortunately, I was aware of the plot line before watching the film. Still, Carrey is hugely likable here and his (MINOR SPOILERS) climactic 'sea struggle' is riveting to watch. The film takes amusing potshots at everyone: people who are utterly absorbed by television shows, the producers as well as the actors. I however wanted more background information on Truman as well as more details on his relationship with his wife. Still recommended as an uplifting cautionary fable.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,4 February 2009
The Matrix," Influential Sci-fi, impressive VFX
","This was hugely popular when it came out and remains an influential film. The subsequent sequels may have been a letdown but 'The Matrix' still remains enjoyable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly effective. Lawrence Fishburne has a great role and makes the best of it. The USP of this film remains the Special Effects. They still impress. The story is classic Sci-fi and is a fairly straightforward dystopia despite a convoluted beginning. There's some pseudo scientific dialog but it is interesting, unlike the sequels where it bores. Hugo Weaving makes a memorable villain. Recommended.Overall 8/10",Null,0,0,26 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," fun but vastly overrated
","The original Star Wars remains a fun film, and its easy to understand the sense of nostalgia many viewers get when they re watch the film. Still its vastly overrated in my humble opinion. The story is simplicity itself, and is a bit slow to start. Gradually the plot develops finally ending in a rousing final battle. Harrison Ford remains the star of the show, and without his magnetic presence, the film would lose a lot of its appeal. There's also Darth Vader who remains an iconic villain to this day. George Lucas updated the Special Effects in the re-issue of Star Wars. This helps a lot as the original Effects have dated considerably. Overall 7/10",Null,1,3,19 January 2009
300," Visceral comic book action fantasy with nothing substantial inside
","This film was based on a comic book and it clearly shows. The heroes are powerful men (and women) with impressive bodies while the villains are dark-skinned(!) Persians and sneaky deformed slaves. It's all black and white here. But, the film's action scenes are simply explosive and well worth watching on the big screen. While there's plenty of blood, it's artistically rendered. The story is clearly fantastical and not worth serious analysis. The acting is alright but some of the dialog is clunky, occasionally bordering on hilarious. Despite the above-mentioned misgivings, I quite liked the film.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,2 February 2009
The Thin Red Line," Overlong but astonishingly well directed with almost hypnotic imagery
","I was bored out of my mind on first viewing this. However, a second viewing completely changed my opinion. While it is indeed overlong and parts towards the end bored me, the bulk of the film is hypnotically engrossing. The directer has an uncanny ability to film nature and takes a dispassionate nonjudgmental view of war and human suffering. The pace is deliberately unhurried and allows you to experience what's happening on the big screen. There are simply too many recognizable faces, some of whom should have been edited out of the film. Still, Sean Penn, James Caviezel and Nick Nolte leave an impression.Overall 8/10",Null,0,1,6 February 2009
Fantastic Four," Boring and badly acted, more suitable for kids than adults
","This was a crashing bore the first time I saw it. Repeat viewings have made it slightly more palatable, but it's still not very good. There'a a corny beginning with the four getting their powers. Jessica Alba looks beautiful but simply can't act. Ioan Gruffudd is too stiff as the leader Reed Richards while Julian Macmohan is laughably over-the-top as the teeth gnashing villain Dr Doom. Only Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis leave any sort of impression. The dialog is very corny and seems tailored for young kids. One saving grace: the Special Effects. Kids may like it but adults beware.Overall 4/10",Null,0,2,3 February 2009
Click," surprisingly effective Adam Sandler film
","I agree with a number of other comments that this is one of Adam Sandler's best films. Since he has appeared in numerous mediocre films, that's not necessarily much of an achievement. Still, 'Click' works remarkably well as a modern day cautionary fable, reminding its viewers of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Things get almost unbearably painful until the final happy ending (surely that's no spoiler in an Adam Sandler picture!). Alas, the film partially ruins this by running a series of annoying juvenile jokes of the sort favored by young teenagers. Worth watching nonetheless.Overall 7/10",Null,0,1,30 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Easily the high point of the original trilogy
","'The Empire Strikes Back' easily bests the original Star Wars. The film moves fast, has very few lulls, the Special Effects are more impressive, and the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader remains a dramatic high point. The wise Yoda is introduced and his scenes with Luke are still worth watching. As always, Harrison Ford dominates the film. This was truly a star-making trilogy for him. Hamill is average as an actor. The droids R2D2 and C3PO are fun and their antics remain watchable specially for kids. This film is easily the high point of the original trilogy.Overall 8/10",Null,1,3,19 January 2009
Aladdin," Inspired Robin Williams in Disney classic
","Disney's Aladdin is a charming animated classic with an inspired manic performance by Robin Williams. This is probably Williams's best voice-work after 'Good Morning Vietnam'. Here he is matched by the remarkably fluid animation. The film is compact and there are no dull segments though Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin are a bit bland as Aladdin and Jasmine. Jonathan Freeman is suitably menacing as the scheming Jafar while Gilbert Gottfried makes a memorable sidekick. There are two great musical numbers, 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali', both with some dizzying animation. Worth watching.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,23 February 2009
Sin City," Ultra-stylish, and very violent comic book noir, but filled with unlikable characters
","This film is clearly either loved or hated. I for one appreciated it's sheer style, resembling a pumped up comic book noir and the performances are generally quite good. However, almost all the characters are nasty and the film does get exhausting after a while. Benicio Del Toro and Mickey Rourke are the pick of the lot. The film is ultra-violent and definitely not appropriate for children. Its depiction of women is quite frankly old-fashioned, and leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Still, its a compelling watch thanks to the visual style. Recommended.Overall 7/10",Null,0,3,19 February 2009
Gangs of New York," Unevenly directed, but excellent Daniel Day-Lewis
","This is a film that I initially disliked, but came around to liking on my second viewing. It still has some problems including overlength, an uneven tone and some middling acting by Leo and Cameron, but there is a brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. He is awe-inspiring as 'Bill the Butcher', a satanic villain who dominates the entire film. Leo fares badly specially when compared to DDL and this hurts the film. The film is almost vaudeville-like in its depiction of New York, and suggests the city is a veritable cesspool of crime and corruption. Its VERY violent (something which turned me off on the first viewing), and there are some shocking scenes, so viewers beware! Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,19 January 2009
Braveheart," Simplistic storyline but rousing battles and good Gibson
","This film is extremely one-sided in its depiction of history but it remains watchable. The story is simplistic showing the simple-minded, oppressed Scots rising up against the blood-thirsty English. Patrick McGoohan is virtually a caricature of pure evil as Edward I. However, the film has rousing and extremely bloody battle scenes. The action is visceral and very effective. Mel Gibson is good in the lead. His charisma makes (MINOR SPOILERS) his final death scene very difficult to watch. The film is well photographed and Scotland has never looked better. Watchable epic.Overall 7/10",Null,1,6,1 March 2009
Happy Feet," Excellent film marred by strident and preachy final segment
","This is a stunning CGI animation which sadly loses its way in the final one third. After some gorgeous images of Antarctica and an enjoyable storyline of a penguin who's 'different' because he can't sing, but enjoys tap-dancing, the last half hour turns stridently preachy and dampens the fun. There are some excellent musical set-pieces as the penguins sing and dance. Robin Williams is alright in two different roles (apart from narrating). While the ecological theme is relevant, the way it's presented is what's slightly annoying. Enjoyable nonetheless.Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,2 February 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Vibrant and energetic film, well directed by Danny Boyle
",This is a vibrant and energetic film directed with great passion by Danny Boyle. It's the proverbial tale of rise from rags to riches of a slum kid (Jamal) in Mumbai. The film moves at a breakneck pace initially with some stylish camera-work and rapid-fire editing. Our three young protagonists quickly win us over as they go through some harrowing times. The film slows down later as the pace becomes less frenetic and (MINOR SPOILERS) a touching love story emerges. The older Jamal (Dev Patel) has a Brit accent which occasionally draws the viewers out of the picture. Anil Kapoor is the pick of the adult actors. Recommended.Overall 8/10,Null,1,4,25 January 2009
Gladiator," Intense Russell Crowe and visceral action scenes in period epic
","'Gladiator' is a period epic with an amazingly intense performance by Russell Crowe. He almost singlehandedly raises the movie and makes it a must watch film. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film's pacing is slow and the story is essentially a revenge drama. Joaquin Phoenix is very effective playing the malevolent but tortured Commodus. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Derek Jacobi is good in a brief role. The opening battle scene is brilliant. The rest of the action is visceral and bloody. Some of the CGI-aided Special Effects look a bit dated but the film remains impressive.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,1 March 2009

While the film isn't as good as the novel by Carl Sagan, it is solid entertainment. The Special Effects are impressive and always in service of the story. The argument between religion and science is rather brief and doesn't do either side justice. Also, the solemn tone of the film isn't quite matched by the quality of the screenplay. Still James Woods is impressive in a brief appearance. Matthew McConaughey is alright but could have done more with his role. Watchable.Overall 7/10",Null,0,2,28 February 2009
Shark Tale," Annoying Will Smith and weak script in otherwise amusing animation
","Will Smith is a good actor but here he always remains Will Smith even when he becomes famous as Oscar, the 'shark-slayer'. His non-stop talking also got on my nerves. De Niro and Scorsese have some amusing lines together and there are plenty of pop culture references throughout the film. Sadly, the plot is weak and Jack Black's character Lenny is given short thrift even though the film should really have been about him. The animation quality is decent though hardly ground-breaking. Still watchable and fun at least for kids, though adults may be exhausted long before the end credits.Overall 6/10",Null,1,1,5 February 2009
Cinderella Man," Good Russell Crowe in conventional risk-averse film
","This was one of those films that began really well but ultimately felt rather conventional. It's basically a depression-era 'Rocky' directed with little risk by Ron Howard. Russell Crowe is competent as usual, but is never allowed to fully break loose. He does have one scene, (MINOR SPOILERS) where he is is left literally begging for money that had me in tears. If only the rest of the film matched the intensity of that scene. Renee Zellwege is bland in a straightforward role as the loving wife. The fight scenes are good though uninspired. Still watchable as long as you keep reasonable expectations.Overall 6/10",Null,1,3,4 February 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Good jokes in Simpsons movie but can't match up to the earlier episodes
","This film version of the long running TV series 'The Simpsons' can't match up to the earlier classic episodes, but is funnier than anything in the last five years or so. The focus is on slapstick humor and gags. Satire generally takes a back seat. The voice work is good as usual. Sadly, many of the supporting characters like Apu and Monty Burns have very few lines. The plot manages to sustain itself over nearly ninety minutes and there are no dull patches. The film takes potshots at the government as well as environment activists. My favorite bit- Ahnold as the President!Overall 7/10",Null,0,0,28 February 2009
The Island," Begins well, decent McGregor & Johansson, but runs out of ideas in the second half
","This is a passable entertainer by Michael Bay. It initially attempts to be intelligent and the Sci-fi world presented is certainly interesting. Howver, Bay runs out of ideas in the second half and substitutes them with action scenes that aren't particularly thrilling. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson both make a game effort with Ewan having fun with a second role that's a rather broad caricature. Sean Bean is menacing but has relatively little to do. Djimon Hounsou is wasted. The film (MINOR SPOILERS) takes a strong anti-cloning line. Watchable on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",Null,0,0,14 February 2009
The Godfather," Superby acted and directed film. One of the all time greats.
","'The Godfather' remains compelling viewing after all these years. Directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, the film shows the control of a mafia family passing from Marlon Brando to his reluctant son Al Pacino. The opening segment is brilliant as it introduces all the main characters. The acting is superb across the board with Brando winning a richly deserved Best Actor Oscar for his highly nuanced portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. Pacino gives an understated performance with sudden intense outbursts. The film is very violent but remains hugely influential. One of the all time greats.Overall 10/10",Null,1,2,27 February 2009
