Marie Antoinette," Off with her head!
","What was on my mind was finally getting to see 'Marie Antoinette', before it disappeared all together! Now I'm usually a real sucker for costume epics, especially with some good historical background. This film directed by Sophie Coppolla, couldn't choose a more colorful subject matter than the ill-fated queen of the feckless Louis XVI! My cat could have made a better movie. Half the film establishes Marie as a party girl, overwhelmed yet fascinated with her exalted and obscenely wealthy station. The second half reinforces the first. Nothing happens.Vacuous dialog, with action focused around overdressed fops scurrying along palace halls, rolling in elysian fields, flirting at a masked ball, or trotting along in huge pumpkin like carriages. With none but the briefest mention of some apparently disgruntled peasants, the palace is suddenly seized by the unwashed rabble, the king and queen are quickly thrown into yet another galloping carriage, and............ roll credits. By now you're quite ready for a smashing guillotine scene, but you're denied even this satisfaction! I want 2 hours of my life back!",2,5,8,15 January 2007
Ghost Rider," 'Easy Mummy'
","As I laughed my way out of the theatre, I couldn't help but thinking the movie wasn't as dumb as it sounded! It was funny! It was a good cowboy movie, bad guys, badder guys, but more than that, it had this great f/x chopper doing stupid cycle tricks not even a GS BMW would be capable of. Then again, it's all f/x, isn't it? In this case, good enough to please a jaded gamer But why even bother with actors anymore? Oh, right, a good vehicle for Mr. Cage, Mr Fonda, and Mr. Elliot, who looked like they were having a ball filming this 'cowboy/biker' camp film.Towards the inevitable ending: hero swears vengeance on evil, but loses girl to fulfill his vowsI'm seeing other pop movies themes here! But that's o.k.You might think this was Mummy meets Easy Rider, meets Zorro Perhaps 'Mummy Rider'? Or, 'Easy Mummy'? Either way, it was entertainingly forgetful! The world has another superheroand it's got motorcycles in it!",7,0,2,16 February 2007
