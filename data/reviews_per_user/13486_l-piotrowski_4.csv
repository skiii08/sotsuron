The Expendables 2," Great Summer Action Movie
","I liked Expendables 2 even more than the previous movie. Expendables 2 has just about all the great action stars of the past with lots of fighting, cheesy dialogue sprinkled with some humor, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. A deep philosophical flick this is not, but anyone considering see it should already be aware of this. I'm sure there will be the bad reviews decrying the end of civilization that people will actually see and enjoy this type of movie with all the real problems out in the world, but who cares, this is a nice couple of hours of escapism fun. Stallone, Statham, Van Damme, Wills, Arnold, Chuck Norris and others manage to pull off an exciting thrill ride that anyone who was a fan of their past movies should appreciate.This movie definitely warrants the R rating. No sex or swearing, but lots of death, destruction, mayhem (but not too gory thankfully).",8,2,13,17 August 2012
Drive," Decent action scenes but overall disappointing
","I had looked forward to seeing this movie after the good trailers and positive reviews. Unfortunately, I don't understand the very high scores on IMDb and by the critics.I did like Ryan Gosling's performance,and appreciated the realistic driving scenes (very little CGI; I wish there were a lot more of them)but that's about it.The story had too many tangents to stay coherent and there were too many plot holes. The first half of the movie has some really slow scenes that kept me wondering when the movie was going to pick up steam. I thought some of the violence was needlessly graphic.The R rating is quite appropriate to due very graphic violence, some coarse language and some nudity, though very little sexual content.Overall, it was an OK movie for a $4 matinée on a cold cloudy Friday afternoon, but I would not recommend spending nighttime movie prices for this show.",6,6,22,16 September 2011
Unknown," Good start and middle, disappointing ending
","Unknown is an OK movie that could have been a lot better. The movie has lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing about what is going on. Unforuntately, the last part of the movie is not very good. It almost seems like the writers of this script spent so much time and effort building up the movie that they either ran out of ideas for the end or there was pressure just to finish the movie and get it released.There is much to like. Liam Neesen is excellent as usual. He does a great job portraying a man who no one seems to recognize. Diane Kruger also gives a strong performance. The action scenes are very good.The last part of the movie just does not match up to the thrilling first parts. I thought the final revelations of why Neesen's character went through what he did this were very weak.The PG 13 rating is appropriate. Lots of violence, not a lot of swearing, no explicit nudity but some scenes of a man and woman taking a shower together.In summary, Unknown is worth seeing as a matinée or as a movie rental, but not at nighttime movie prices.",6,1,5,19 February 2011
RED," Fun movie to see. I liked it very much.
","Red is an enjoyable, fun movie. It has some good action scenes, nice humor and good interaction between characters. The story is kind of absurd, but that doesn't get in the way. Bruce Willis is really good, but my favorite character was the one played by John Malkovich. The Morgan Freeman character was just so-so. The PG-13 rating is accurate. I would not recommend anyone under 13 seeing this. No sex, a few swears, lots of shooting and explosions.Overall, if you are looking for a fun movie with a few twists, good action and nice wordplay between the characters, this is for you. I recommend this movie.",8,0,1,31 October 2010
