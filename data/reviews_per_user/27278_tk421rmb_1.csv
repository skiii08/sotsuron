Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A solid Star Wars movie
","Phantom Menace is a great movie and I encourage any one to see it. This movie, like the original 3 Star Wars movies, is a fantasy tale with the same light-hearted spirit we all loved as children. It is a shame that many Star Wars fans have grown-up and forgotten what is was that made Star Wars fantastic. Phantom Menace follows the traditional Star Wars formula and is not an adult- action movie. It is a movie made for the child-at-heart and the wildest of our imagination. Phantom Menace is just as strong a movie as is any of the originals...Do I prefer the Episodes 4-6? ...yes, of course but I am not at all disappointed at Episode 1.",10,0,1,7 June 2005
