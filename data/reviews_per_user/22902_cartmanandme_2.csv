Captain Phillips," Thriller, Adventure, and Action all into one
","Great movie based off of a true event. Yes, the real captain was not as heroic as the movie, but Tom Hanks does a terrific portrayal possibly (Oscar nominated). Everyone knows the ending of this event, but the movie is a huge suspense nonetheless. The authenticity with the Somolian pirates and their language makes everything believable. I highly encourage people to see this movie. Tom Hanks never disappoints and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie was nominated for other Oscars like best sound and cinematography. Regardless of awards the movie has a lot of ups and downs and accurately portrays the feelings of fear and even courage among this attack. The time might seem like a factor, but it goes by quickly.",10,1,8,12 October 2013
Atonement," One of the best titles
","I barely review a film, but this is the exception. This film is riveting and has a fantastic premise. McCoy gives the best performance of his career in this stunning movie. The film starts out strong then dips a bit in the middle and then ends so majestically that I was left in tears. Without a doubt this movie deserves its nominations and even more than what it got. I have not seen a movie that knows how to channel the viewers emotions so well. I was happy, sad, hateful, and burdened. This was a thrilled and everyone should see this film. From the cinematography to the acting it was new, refreshing, and most of all a real masterpieces. I will definitely buy this movie when I next see it.The only thing that I have a tiny problem with is the fact that they do not illustrate very well what time period the movie takes place in. As in what year or month we are in after the beginning. If that were a bit more clear it would be perfect.",10,0,0,21 August 2016
