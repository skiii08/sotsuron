Skyfall," Not the witty charming James Bond but an old depressing secret agent....
","Where is the witty charming James Bond? Instead, we got a depressed, grumpy old man, tired 40-year-old agent. (He looks late 40's anyway.) It would have been a good something-else secret agent movie, but not a James Bond movie. A big dude sitting next to me was with his girlfriend, (he was so excited before the movie started,) slept after about 30 minutes all the way through the end of this movie. People leaving this packed theater seemed depressed after the movie was over. Some understandably left the movie early. It would have been good if it named something else; otherwise, people are misled thinking and waiting for the charming, witty, smart, fast-pace, mysterious, sweet-talk British agent guy with unimaginably surprised gadget to show up.",2,11,23,14 November 2012
