Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Two is better than one....
","First of all, let me just say, it's pointless to argue about which 'volume' of Kill Bill is better, as it is intended to be seen as one movie anyway However, that said, Volume two is the superior of the two films. To put it in grading terms, volume one is an A+ and volume two is an A++.The dialog is awesome, the characters,especially Pei Mei and Bill, are awesome. Every line of this movie is brilliant and every actor is brilliant, right down to Larry and Rocket in the strip club.And The Superman Speech is the greatest moment in cinema EVER. EVER. No question.",10,2,4,27 August 2006
