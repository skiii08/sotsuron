The Ring," sound effects is the base of its success
",that kind of movie proves that ... the sound effect in a horror movie is the key Stone of a successful horror movie .... i always admire the sound effects here .. and may be the visual one .... the kid in that movie wasn't so good .. he tried and may be the director tried but both failed ... i think he is the worst thing in that movie ...beside the sound effects .. i think also the video tap is so gorgeous.. it was so scary ... and strange ..the short cuts of the face of hero when he dies .. also the rapid shots without focusing in the pictures ...was so good and helping the overall aim of movie ...i enjoyed with that movie so much,8,3,5,28 March 2008
Capote," is it good ??? really .... infamous is much much much better
",if you want to compare infamous with Capote ... infamous is much stronger .. dramatically deeper ... the only thing in Capote which exceed infamous is the superb performance of Hoffman ... if Hoffman is acting in infamous replacing tubby ... infamous will be a masterpiece what makes Capote is more famous is the outstanding performance of Hoffman ... even if tubby Jones do a good work in infamous .. but he cannot exceed that astonishing performance of Seymour .... if we skip that point .. every single thing and item in infamous is better than Capote ... the drama line is strong and deep ... you can feel and even sympathize with the brutal murderer ... and understand why Capote sympathize with them in reality ... watch infamous .. and you will find Capote is ordinary movie ... and you will forget everything in that movie and will be covered by stronger and deeper movie ( infamous)... except Hoffman .. he is the good positive point and the strong point in Capote,4,0,2,29 August 2015
American Sniper," piece of *****
",to flip the facts ...killing children and women who try to defend their land from American invasion ... try to justify the war crimes committed by American soldiers in base of protecting American soldiers ... what force the American soldier to invade Iraq in first place ... oil .. oil and oil and what is that all the F words ? you cannot hear 10 words without hearing one or two F words ... is that the American soldiers .. cannot live or speak like normal persons without saying F words every ten seconds...the actors were acting i mean not feeling the character but acting the charactersawful,1,7,22,23 August 2015
3 Idiots," over ... over .. over ..
",good movie but it is full of the usual over dramatic story ... with the unbelievable incident and unbelievable action ( like the one of the child birth) yes ... it has some smart moments .. and funny moments .. but the shadow of weak story and weak handling of the situations make the whole idea of the movie obscured ... nonsense and absurd action of the heroes of the movie with some superficial character with no depth at all ... acting staff is so well but kareena kapoor was not that good and she is the least in the acting staff ... but i wonder why this movie in the top list .. frankly doesn't deserve .. may be someone has another opinion .. but i think that time tho=is movie doesn't deserve all that high ranking and hardly get 5 of ten .. yes you can watch it enjoy it ... but you cannot memorize it or even bear to watch it again,5,2,7,3 August 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," where's albert finney ?
","They tried too much ... they tried to make the audience impressed .... the recent technology and the amazing details of the train .... and even with some action and chasing which is by the way against the charterer which was drawn carefully over years by Agatha Christie ... the story of course supreme .. and this credit goes to Agatha Christie not to the movie makers ... they did a very good effort indeed .. the actors also tried too much .. but their glamour was shadowed by the good story and by the ghost of the old movie with the same title ...
the only problem in that movie .. that you are keep asking yourself .. where is Albert finney ... he was brilliant in the old version .. he touched the charterer deeply .. even Agatha Christie admitted that .. he was Hercule Poirot as she imagined and as she drew him ..
so in this movie they tried hardly to beat the old version .. but they missed the most important item .... Albert finney",6,0,0,29 April 2018
Munich," what a joke !!!
","of course a joke .. when you present one sided view and close your eyes away from all the other points of view .. the work turned into a joke ... the movie cry about the violence and the assassination of athletes .. and close eyes away from all the massacre which done by Israel towards Arabs and Palestine ... what about sabra , shatila , kana . ghaza , kana again and areha all this mass murdering directed towards women . children and innocent and the number of victims exceed 12000 , but any of you or film makers know about it ... any of you or film makers has a gut to produce a movie present that massacre .. no of course .. as the money in USA is all jewes money and they control behind the curtains all politics and media .. abolishing the minds of Americans .. that awful assassination which is refused by me and by Islam ... is reaction to what Israel do in Arab not an action and also the dialogue has many mistakes like Arab hates Palestinian .. Palestinian are not Arab .. from what dirt you get that information ..i am rating four .. for the spots of direction and the acting and some smart words about the truth of the conflict between Arabs and Israel ...also the end in which the hero refuse what the Israeli intelligence do and even refuse to come back to Israel",4,1,5,10 May 2013
Donnie Darko," the idea is lost here
","this movie may be one of the most attractive one u see in your life ... the schizophrenic guy and how he feels , how he thinks , how he lives was so brilliant in that movie .... we live with him and with all his delusions and the nonsense of time traveling and so on ... even with that bizarre accident in the first 5 minutes of the movie ... we didn't stop there to much ... we didn't ask ourselves is that truly happened .. or that another dilution of Donnie we live in ....the movie go on in one stream ... with that odd ideas of Donnie .. we all swallow all that ideas at the basis that he is schizophrenic ..till we reached to the last scene of the movie ... his girl friend died .. he killed frank .. the big bunny .. by a shot in his eye ..then he tried to go back in time to save his girl friend ..and by exotic scene we find a vantage hole in the sky .. with a plane (his mother and sister was on it )>> and the plan losing its engine ... and suddenly we find Donnie in his room laughing a very strange laugh and the time is back ... what hell is that ?? how he succeeded in jumping into that vantage hole ... and that means all nonsense about time traveling was true .. and all that dilutions may be true ... to discover he isn't schizoid ... and so the idea which has been built allover that movie is lost ..another strange scenes is the scenes of the song ( mad world)... frank is touching his eye ..and crying ... the deceitful psychiatrist is crying ... why ??another strange scene ... frank lost his eye in cinema ... before he got the shot ..all that bizarre scene was explained by the base that he is schizophrenic ... but the end put a termination to that .. and that great idea is lost ..any body can explain ??",7,1,3,16 June 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," disappointed
",frankly i was disappointed at the end of that interesting movie happyniss by its wrong spelling has a role in that movie ... he thinks that the pursuit of happiness is in that road he was walking to .. that strange career with loss of his dignity bit by bit . and for what .. for a hope he didnot know he will achieve or not .. difficult route seems like a mirage .the end .. or i could say the logic end of that movie is failure of chris .. and to prepare to us that the route of chris which he was walking in is route of happiness .. it is a fake route ..wrong route like the word.. while the route of happiness is to anther way .. another parallel not crossing route.but the end ..was so disappointing to me ...the movie i think deserve another good fin...will smith was genius here .. i donot know why he didnot win Oscar .. for god sake he deserves it,5,0,2,19 July 2009
