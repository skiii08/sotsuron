Skyfall," Generic Action Guy
","James Bond's thinly veiled cover had been either that of an aristocratic playboy or business man. Using this cover he was able to interact with wealthy jet-setters as one of their own. Woman and Men alike are attracted to his charm, wit and boundless knowledge of fine living. In retrospect, many of the early films seemed more like travelogues for tourist and less like action films. This pretense accomplished a couple of objectives; it allowed blue collar types like me to see behind the veil of wealth power and privilege. And moreover, OUR AGENT, James Bond will ultimately show these aristocrats up, giving them their well-deserved comeuppance. The world has change and become more corporatized and generic. However, human nature being what it is, we know there are still restaurants, casinos and other venues where most of us would be spotted as interlopers and summarily ejected. We still need James Bond. I think Daniel Craig capable of pulling off that sort of nuanced performance. He just hasn't been provided that sort of script. What did they get right: Daniel can wear a tailored suit well. And, Javier Bardem's mad man was appropriately distant and sinister.This film is a disservice to Ian Fleming, who's stories expanded on F. Scott Fitzgerald's words: 'Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different.'007 is a blue collar wolf disquised as a blue blood, not a Scottish prince.",5,10,22,11 November 2012
The Hateful Eight," Mad and Happy Too!
","Quentin T. you cheating lying piece of offal. I was promised a brand new Ennio Morricone original soundtrack and didn't get it (although the man has written so many movie scores I doubt anyone beside Quentin has heard them all). I am sorry, I overstate my disappointment. The movie was good and so was the re-purposed music. I think Maestro Morricone wrote one maybe two original themes for the film, I have to watch it again, (I know that man is 87 years old!!! But his genius MAKES MOVIES). Spoilers When I saw 'Django,' I expected the film 'The Great Silence' to be referenced but it wasn't much. When I saw 'The Hateful Eight' coming I was happy because I figured it would. Instead to my surprise, musically and thematically we saw homage to John Carpenter's 'The Thing.' But as he does, Mr. Q puts a unique touch on his films that make them his own and this message was one of my favorites. I don't want to spell it all out, but let me say, the ending is a message for our times. Bravo Mr. Tarantino, Bravo.",9,5,29,21 December 2015
Ex Machina," Indulgent
","I love movies and books about AI, because I think we may be nearly there. This movie however, does not get into what is important about the genre. We already know geek guys have sex fantasies about anime and robots. So therefore this movie should have been about the AI and how it developed and what sort of mirror it held up to humanity. Not about how hot the computer guys imagined the entity is. The film suggested that the entity became what it was because it was programmed to survive. What does that mean? Potentially based upon the ending the life form could have shut down, having fulfilled its program. Way to shallow for the subject matter.",5,1,5,22 May 2015
Once Upon a Time in America," contains spoilers
","Once Upon a Time in America was never a favorite, due to pacing primarily and the ending, in particular. I liked Henry Fonda's character better as a villain in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, I have to say, James Wood's Max character was better written, on review. This guy killed his buddies, stole their money and faked his own death. Now on seeing it again, I realize what the ending was showing. Max intended to betray Noodles (De Niro) one more time. He set Noodles up with a slow reveal, showing him the truth bit by bit, so that Noodles would be murderous and kill him before the feds locked him up or his cronies killed him. That seemed like justice and I used to think the film should have ended there. However, the scene with the garbage truck at the end shows that Max was going to 'whack' Noodles posthumously. So even in death, that creep wanted to betray him again. What a hateful person. Didn't get that on previous viewings. The rape scene was also telling. Noodles never loved Deborah, he loved the idea of her. She had feelings for him and enjoyed playing hard to get with him. Instead of respecting her and attempting to connect, he tried to use brute force, first with money (at the fancy dinner) and then literally. Being in love with your idea of someone isn't the same as being in love. This was three movies in one.",10,1,6,26 July 2015
Flight," heroic drunk
","I wasn't going to write anything about this film, until I saw a blog entry linked to Roger Ebert's Sun Times site. That reviewer posited that Whip, wouldn't have done what he did to save the passengers unless he was uninhibited â€“ i.e. â€“ drunk. I think that was accurate and felt so viscerally when I watched the film. This was a film about the relativity of morality. Whip saved those people and Whip is a drunk. What do YOU make of that. In real life ALL of us would rather have an effective drunk at our side, rather than a failed angel. Whip's transformation at the end was about his personal survival going forward, not about the rightness or wrongness of his past behavior. That drunk was a hero.",Null,2,3,11 November 2012
