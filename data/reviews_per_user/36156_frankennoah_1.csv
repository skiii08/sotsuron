The Blair Witch Project," Simply a MASTERPIECE
","It makes me sad to see all these negative reviews by people who have been brought up on cheap horror flicks with no real scare value. I have watched MANY horror movies, and none of them have stuck with me like this one. It's easy to make the audience jump, but it's another thing entirely to make them lay in their beds at night and be TERRIFIED. I've seen many people say that this movie looks like it was made by amateurs, and to them I say: That's the point!! It is not supposed to be a movie about people making a documentary, it's supposed to be the documentary they made! If you were lost in the woods with something chasing you, how good would your filming be? The actors are also fantastic, because they are so realistic. They act like normal human beings, mostly because the script was largely improvised. You feel their terror and confusion, and you want them to get out alive. The thing about this movie that scared me the most was the fact that everything is left to your imagination. Nothing explicit is seen, there is no gore, just some incredibly eerie sounds coming from the woods. And that is what sticks with you after the movie is over more than any killer popping out of a closet could.",10,2,5,24 August 2012
