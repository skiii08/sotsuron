Despicable Me 2," Still got the charm.
","The original was adorable and very funny, and even though its sequel lives on that it's still well done and captures what made the original so loveable.Gru is now looking out for the three girls, Agnes, Edith and Margo while being recruited by the Anti Villain League to capture the mastermind behind a mysterious abduction of an entire laboratory from the arctic circle.He ends up working with the enthusiastic Lucy Wilde and then the fun begins. They go through so many hilarious scenes together, and give the minions a run for their money.Saying much more would be spoiling the movie's central plot points, but let's put it this way: Despicable Me 2 delivers what is expected but does not feel like a rehash at all with the heart and the humour still being top-notch.",9,0,1,12 February 2019
Antz," For a starter, it is actually pretty good.
","We all know the drill about DreamWorks' Antz being compared to Pixars A Bug's Life. I think they both succeeded in their own ways. While A Bug's Life was more kid oriented, Antz offered much more adult material and cleverness. Due to their similarities, I won't say that much about it, but briefly highlight what I think is good about Antz. Antz has a voice cast of great actors, who add so much to the characters. Adults who have seen Woody Allen, Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken will recognize the immediately. It can be distracting at times, but it is admirable that Dreamworks' first feature managed such a great cast. The different insects depicted in Antz are much more realistically rendered, given the fact that insects are different sizes. It has a battle scene which is memorable and dark. Maybe scary to the youngest kids, but great. The conflict of our main character Z is superior to the conflict in A Bug's Life. Z is a neurotic ant who doesn't feel special given the fact that every ant in the colony from birth is placed either as a soldier or a worker. Z wants something different, but the general ant is against all sorts of 'weakness' and plots a cleansing of the weak ants and take over the colony. While it is good, the villainous general could have been more threatening and memorable, but it is a minor thing. Antz may lack the brightness and colours of A Bug's Life and could perhaps use a little more laughs, but it surely is worth watching.",7,1,2,24 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One dragged out and dull attempt at a prequel.
","I'm a newcomer into the Star Wars universe, and after finally having seen the original trilogy I decided to give this one a chance just like the other prequels, because I remember watching them many years ago. And man, what a dull expirience I submitted myself to! The acting is my biggest problem, because almost every one of the actors are so monotonous I swear I cringed so much. In the middle of an attack they just kept on with the same monotone. And since CGI was used here instead of the animatronics and other real life puppets and such in the original, it just felt fake and sometimes you could easily see that it wasn't there. Like Jar Jar Binks, Boss Nass, Watto and so on. They just stuck out, and I knew they weren't there.Speaking of Jar Jar Binks, what the hell??? What is his purpose??? He was so damn annoying I could punch him! The only things I would say was decent is the makeup, that's a thing they did well, like the outfits of Queen Amidala and the design of Darth Maul. 
And when there were lightsaber fights they were made more intense, because back in the day it looked like they only tapped at each other's glowing sticks ;)The fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jin and and Obi-Wan Kenobi was my favourite scene, but what a shame I had to go through almost to hours of dull dialogue and filler scenes to get to it. Okay, to be fair, many of the landscapes were beatiful to look at. A dull movie overall, so I don't think I'll recommend this if you know the original trilogy.",3,1,6,25 August 2018
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A revolutionary achievement.
","This is not just a movie, it's a miracle!How these cartoon characters interact with living human actors is just mind-blowing in how seamless they go together. And the plot about this cartoon world being a part of the real world just makes the cartoon characters become even more alive.The plot is solid and keeps you on your toes, the voice acting is brilliant and the actors do good jobs in their respective roles. And the entertainment value is high and can satisfy both fans of detective/murder mystery movies and cartoon enthusiasts like myself.And this may be the only time we see the big names in animation putting their rivalry aside to make one hell of a ride with all their well known and beloved characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the list goes on. It is a marvelous achievement.",9,3,3,25 July 2019
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," One of my favorite dog movies!
","I really like this movie. Among my favorite from outside the Disney renaissance. Very memorable characters and a pretty solid story. And last, but absolutely not least, one of the greatest Disney villains! Cruella De Vil is both stylish, menacing and versatile in her performance, both exposing her psychotic driving and sugar sweet and slimy voice and her yelling at her goons. You know she is up to no good right from the start. The slow pacing gives time for some good suspense when our main dogs try to escape Cruella and her goons' clutches. That also leads up to great chase scenes. Watch it. It is funny, cute, full of suspense and great characters.",10,4,4,26 August 2017
Mulan," At points underrated.
","When I still watch Disney animated movies, it is because I think there is more to them than just great animation and family entertainment. Mulan has shown me that real life issues can be handled in a way so we can translate those problems into a visual delivery. Therefore I will highlight some points for which Mulan should get more recognition.Mulan shows us the generally male dominated culture we live in (the Chinese setting is secondary). Mulan is a good role model for young girls, because she acts instead of just being pretty and waiting for her prince to save her (Snow White and Sleeping Beauty for example). The horrors of war is also visually shown when Li Shang and his army finds the dead bodies of his father and the other soldiers. It is a brilliant scene which seldom is mentioned in various 'scariest Disney moments'-countdowns. Those are the messages I feel are underrated. Now for some quick technical aspects I see as great. The Hun army's run down the mountain side is incredible, when the crowd in front of the emperor's palace bows is also great and the scene in which the Chinese army finishes the song 'A Girl Worth Fighting for' and discovers the burned down village. However, I would have liked to see more of the terror of the Huns. Shan Yu was not that memorable (I still find him scary, though).",9,1,1,6 August 2017
Coraline," Up there with 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'!
","Coraline is one of those movies you just can't deny has something great to it. After a slow start presenting the 11-year old Coraline's family and their relationship to us, the movie takes us all the way to another world in which her family is everything she ever wanted them to be. But something is wrong and she soon finds out. When Coraline enters the other world you'll see the immense amount of artistry that's put into the design of the movie with lots of great designs of both landscapes and character design. A great debut for Laika Entertainment which puts them as a competent player in the stopmotion industry. Worth watching at least once.",10,0,1,5 July 2018
Zootopia," This is ranking among Disney's finest!
","Zootopia flew right into my top 5 of the Disney animated movies. And if nostalgia had nothing to say on that list, it would be on top!This is one of the few Disney movies which manages to master the fine balance between the most hilarious comedy and the darkest issues of reality. Nothing is thrown in just because it had to. It's a tale of a countryside bonnie who wants more out of life, she wants to persue that by going to the big city of Zootopia! She wants to be a cop, but everyone tells her that she hasn't got what's needed to become one simply because she is a rabbit. Beside that personal issue which has been seen a lot in recent Disney movies, there is a refreshing social comment on how society is full of prejudice, here exemplified by predator and prey. That is a brilliant metaphore! And there is no stone left unturned in the world of Zootopia! So much attention has been payed to details in every part of the city! Go watch it for yourself, otherwise I would spoil it! But such small things as how Judy Hopps shows her emotional state by how her ears are is one of the great details of the animation. She's a rabbit, get it?It will keep you at the edge of your seat, it will make laugh a lot, it will make you think about your own prejudice especially if you pay attention to our present times. Go watch it, you won't regret it!",10,1,1,3 May 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Uneven and too long, but still has strong spots.
","Some say that the first Pirates of the Carribean movie was too long and I didn't share that opinion back then, but with this first sequel I join in on that. Some parts around the beginning just felt unnecessary.But when Jack and co. are finished with fooling around and the plot of finding the chest to get rid of the infamous Davy Jones gets going, then the good stuff begins. And the Flying Dutchman and its crew are highlights in here, because never have I seen CGI that made me feel like it was real.Davy Jones is voiced brilliantly by Bill Nighy who makes his mark as a dispicable and merciless captain of the ship that's doomed to sail the seas forever.The visuals are the biggest highlight of Dead Man's Chest, because even though I enjoy the presence of Captain Jack Sparrow, the movie falls victim to a common fault in sequels of repeating much of the same seen in the previous movie. In this case it's only in the rather weak beginning until the main plot gets going.",8,0,0,25 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A modern classic.
","What can I say about this wonderful film that hasn't already been said?Johnny Depp shines as the eccentric captain Jack Sparrow, whose sassy and unpredictable nature is a scene stealer. He is the highlight of this movie.I think the special effects for the pirates is really good. When such effects were good back in that day they really were amazing. Some say that CGI today is getting worse because it's overused which underlines my point.But yes, this was the first time we encountered captain Jack Sparrow and company, so it all goes down from here. Too many sequels were made, but the first two worked out fine.",10,3,4,23 July 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Walt would have been proud.
","This is in short the most magical movie, Disney has ever put out. I have watched it so many times and every time it just feels equally or more magical. The songs are perfect, the animation is perfect, the villain is not the 'evil-just-for-being-evil', but realistically motivated to do bad things which fits the movie perfectly. And finally, the romance between Belle and beast are among the most real and beautiful ever done by Disney if not the best.The story is definitely a tale as old as time.",10,5,6,4 August 2017
Madagascar," Not as bad as I remember, but not the best either.
","I remember back in the day when DreamWorks mad traditionally animated movie of which many of them are among my favorites of all time. Their computer animated ones can be hit and miss, whereas Madagascar wasn't a big hit with critics but a maasive success in theaters. I may be with the critics on this one.Not that it doesn't have its good parts, because I definitely enjoyed the penguins who had all the funniest lines. Aside from them, the humour is rather juvenile and goes all nuts too many times for my taste.So, the humour is scatter-shot, but what about the story? Well, it's not very original, but the execution is well done. Marty the zebra wants to go away from the New York Zoo, because he dreams of the wild while his friends think he's crazy. He goes out and the others go after him and they end up getting to Madagascar where they don't fit in and must try to get home while trying to adapt. A mix of a fish-out-of-water story and getting-back-home story.They meet a colourful cast of characters who make them their gods or something while still having doubts about their intentions, but that's here where the best parts concerning the main characters happen, because of how the wild brings out something in Alex the lion.Whether you like Madagascar or not depends on your age or sense of humour, because while it has well executed parts like its colourful animation it lacks in others.",6,0,1,23 September 2019
Finding Nemo," Oh Pixar, you keep on doing it!
","Finding Nemo is yet another creative idea filled with memorable characters in a touching story about trust, family, teamwork and all the good stuff. No character without memorability or a reason for doing what they do. Nwemo's father, Marlin, is overprotective, but since Nemo is his only son after a tragic loss at the time of his infancy you can't blame him for it. It is much more a story aimed towards parents, and that's great, because that is a strong argument against the misconception that animation is just for children. And Ellen DeGeneres makes us all crack open in laughter and still maintains a sense of importance to Marlin learning a lesson. All characters are memorable, the story is beautiful, the animation was groundbreaking for its time and still looks great. What more could you want from an animated feature?",10,0,0,30 July 2018
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Fine as an action flick, not as much as an origin story.
","Since I loved the first two X-Men movies, I was rather disappointed with the third one. My expectations weren't that high after hearing the harsh reception X-Men: Wolverine had got, so maybe that's why I haven't been so hard on it.I actually enjoyed it a little more than The Last Stand which is kind of odd, because Wolverine is my favorite X-Man and he has an awesome origin story which sadly isn't really that well handled in here.There are some crucial things wrong which makes this less of an origin story and more like a handful of ideas never really fleshed out to its full potential. The opening scene establishes the brotherhood of Logan and Victor, but that is abandoned and only visited in the way we already know Logan. What origin story?Logan gets into some relationships which are important to his persona, but that aspect isn't used the way it should in AN ORIGIN STORY! You don't see him developing his well known self after being affected by episodes in his life, the writers just set up a lot of things and later paying them off in not very effective ways.I didn't find X-Men Origins: Wolverine insufferable as a movie, even though I know how many reviewers with more expieriance than me have stated the opposite, but I was sufficiently entertained by some of the performances like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston and that was a better waste of time than the mostly hollow performances from The Last Stand.All in all, as an origin story it falls flat, but as an action flick it's okay.",6,0,1,18 June 2019
Chicken Run," Why so restrained in the user ratings of old DreamWorks? This movie rocks!
","Chicken Run is great movie, but I won't count it as much of a DreamWorks movie than an Aardman animation one. The British humour is just too much to call it DreamWorks. Not necessarily Wallace & Gromit style, but its own style of dialougue and physical comedy. The atmosphere we are presented to in the beginning is just unnerving, and with a solid performance by Miranda Richardson as the devilish Mrs. Tweedy topped with an almost constant feeling of peril a PG-rating might have fitted better. Even though the movie has some intense action scenes, which are truly spectacular, and some dark atmospheric passages it also features some hilarious British humour and well acted charaters. Fowler and the two business rats were my favourites, they made me laugh several times. Mel Gibson as Rocky was not necessarily insufferable, but was too much of a generic douche who learns his lesson which you have seen many times before. Everything else is great, so that's just nitpicking.Chicken Run is a thoroughly enjoyable and underrated flick which will keep you on the edge of your seat with great animation, great characters, fantastic action scenes and a reminder that stop-motion still has a place among top quality entertainment.",10,0,0,26 April 2018
My Neighbor Totoro," Such an endlessly charming slice-of-life story seen from a child's perspective.
","There is just something about the simplicity of the premise of My Neighbour Totoro which makes it such an engaging watch.You see the reality depicted of a couple of sister playing around their house while they are told that they have to move to another place soon. They act just like regular children would when such a message is delivered. That's not the only encounter with reality in the movie, but let me tell you, it's not just material changes, but some serious events handled in such a respectful way without being as heavy handed as the tear-jerkingly sad Grave of the Fireflies released that same year.And as always the animation is just gorgeous with beautiful design of iconic characters, immersive landscapes and grabbing elements of imaginative beings which can be in every child's mind at that young age.A nice feel-good movie with a surprisingly real setting. Not just a mindless kids film, but an animated classic.",9,0,0,13 August 2019
X-Men," A lot better than expected.
","After watching a lot of animated X-Men stuff, I thought that it was time to watch some live-action movies. I'd heard rumours that the X-Men franchise was rather hit and miss. Well, this was a very solid start.Not everyone delivers a top performance, but I was so happy that my favorite characters delivered. Hugh Jackman does a relly good and charismatic job as the tough Wolverine coming from a place he doesn't even know himself. He ends up meeting Marie aka Rogue who brings him to Xavier's School for the Gifted. Their relationship is a highlight here.Magneto gets a lot of star power from the magnificent Ian McKellen and a well done take on his harsh past which leads him onto his dark path in life conflicting with his old friend Xavier who are also given a nice portrayal by Patrick Stuart.The otherwise talented Halle Berry wasn't as convincing as Storm, I must admit. The booming persona I knew was shifted to a quite monotonous one, and her powers weren't to show before nearing the climax. James Marsden was a good choice as Cyclops, but was kind of the same case as Storm without real punch to the performance.But despite a few small bumps on the road, I enjoyed X-Men more than I had expected, because the story was actually really engaging when the focus was on the right elements like Wolverine and Rogue and how Magneto fulfills his plan. It's not the usual superhero movie where action and special effects are the main focus, but more like a psychological drama with some hero elements. That makes it stand out among the crowd.But even though the special effects weren't the main focus they were awesome, hands down! It may be a movie from the year 2000, but back then the effects weren't used as much as they are today, so when they were good they really rocked the screen.I would recommend X-Men to people who like a well balanced movie with a well told story spiced up with the right amount of action and special effects.",8,4,4,11 June 2019
Spider-Man 3," Too many villains and a questionable take on the symbiote, but not terrible.
","Spider-Man 3 carries a reputation for being the worst movie in the Sam Raimi trilogy, and while that's true, the movie itself isn't all terrible.The movie has a strong message of putting the needs of others before your own which is most prominent in the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane who were about to get serious, but clashed with Peter being Spider-Man.And that theme could have fitted into the story with the symbiote. But with both the symbiote, Harry Osborn and Sandman, the movie seemed rather contrived and could easily have been split up into two movies. But even if it all seemed contrived and underdeveloped, the ending still made me feel something.But how the writers handled the symbiote was pretty stupid. It's feeding on its host's negative emotions like anger, desperation and sadness and doesn't make people act like hotshots and do lame dance moves in doorways. That was the biggest let-down and wasn't really saved by Eddie Brock's bonding, because of some out-of-character lines that took the menace away from him.But at least it's better than the train-wreck of a movie which shed disgrace on the character of Venom in 2018.",6,0,0,7 April 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," Tintin delivers an exciting action/mystery flick.
","I enjoyed watching this recreation of Tintin's The Secret of the Unicorn. The voice performances made me care for their trouble and made the mystery engaging to be part of. It also changed my opinion about the motion capture animation style. To begin with, you must know that it doesn't deliver a movie completely true to the comic book, because some characters have been given pretty big roles despite minor roles in the source material. Fans will perhaps feel offended by these changes, but I am forgiving, because what we got was an exciting take on the characters we love. I am still impressed by how Red Rackham's involvement with Captain Haddock is portrayed. It really kept my eyes glued to the screen just like many of the other action scenes. They can be pretty intense. It makes for an action-packed mystery with great voice performances to keep you engaged and entertained.",9,0,0,4 May 2018
Moana," Disney really masters computeranimation with this one, but that's about it.
","To start off with my highest praise for Moana: The visuals are spectacular. The water effects are masterfully crafted and the moving tattoos on the body of Maui are entertaining in their liveliness. The climax is also something I hadn't seen coming, and I say that, because out of everything in the movie THAT was the one thing I really didn't predict. Seriously, if you know the Disney movies you'll be able to predict almost every turn.The sidekick of Maui is pretty entertaining, but that blasted Hei-Hei is pretty much pointless and annoying through out the movie. How Far I'll Go was beautiful and You're Welcome was also memorable. The whole soundtrack captured the culture of the Polynesian people very well, but the overall film was kind of a disappointment and to be honest I fell asleep during the first watch.",7,0,1,22 August 2018
Megamind," Interesting take on some sort of Superman story.
","While not my favorite DreamWorks movie I can say with certainty it is a refreshing take on the superhero formula. Not being just a comedy that makes a parody out of the well known trope of such movies, Megamind actually takes its time to be a little thoughtful about the hero/villain duality.Because what would it be like if the villain actually won and took over the world? Empty and meaningless, if you ask the man himself, but he tries to make it meaningful again by means that go in all different direction and can make the movie seem a little crammed at times and a little unbalanced in how it wants to present itself.But overall it turns out an enjoyable result with the usual DreamWorks splendor in animation, casting and a killer soundtrack.",7,0,0,27 September 2019
Tangled," Beautifully animated and a whole lot of fun.
","While this is yet another Disney princess movie, it does present both the familiar elements and add in new ones to make seem fresh and new. First of all, I'd like to state that it looks amazing from the gorgeous colours to the well textured hair. The hair was one of the animaters' finest achievements in this movie, because that's one of the hard things to do in animation.The songs were okay, I See The Light was the stand-out while the others were well performed and served their purpose even if they weren't among my picks for the best songs by Alan Menken.The comedy was actually my favorite part, because there are so many hilarious passages in here, and they weren't mostly the spoken jokes, because hands down Maximus is the funniest character from Disney in a long time, maybe since the 90's!So to sum it up, a fresh take on the well known fairy-tale princess formula with stunning animation and lots of fun for the whole family are guaranteed.",9,3,3,2 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Filled with cheesy dialogue, but still better than 'Phantom'.
","Since I watched the original trilogy which is still awesome in every way I get why the fans mostly hate the prequels. But I am not a Star Wars fanatic, so therefore I do not get as angry about it.I was thoroughly bored with The Phantom Menace and the introduction of Jar Jar Binks, and thank god he has much less screen time in this, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker is mediocre at best, partly because of the bad writing which George Lucas at least is aware of. The scenes of romance are so laughably bad, but at least much of it is taking place in pretty landscapes.While the acting is mediocre, the action scenes are more frequent in Attack of the Clones, and they work very well if you ask me. An enjoyable addition seeing Yoda battling the menacing Count Dooku who was brought well to life by the magnificent Christopher Lee.The final battle and the addition of Dooku are the most applaudable parts of an otherwise mediocre addition to the Star Wars universe.",5,2,3,21 October 2018
Corpse Bride," Another Tim Burton hit.
","The best thing about Tim Burton is his knack for writing stories so macabre but still filled with likability and creativity. Corpse Bride is witty, beautifully crafted and at times it makes you think a little more about honoring the dead instead of just letting them go as if nothing mattered.It starts off as Victor van Dort is about to get married but is not very fond of the idea. When he later by mistake practices his vows on a dead woman he is dragged into the land of the dead and his life is turned upside down.It seemed at first like a basic fish-out-of-water story, but as it progresses it evolves into both a cautionary tale of the consequences of letting loved ones down and a portrayal of forced marriages vs marrying for love.It has all the Burton ingredients like Danny Elfman's talented music scoring, even though the songs weren't that memorable, and Johnny Depp as the lead role. And the crown on top is the recognicable design of the characters and the gothic setting. A fine addition to the Burton legacy.",8,0,0,6 October 2019
Forrest Gump," This is pure gold.
","Forrest Gump has been one of those movies that stuck with me even though many years have passed since I watched it the first time. The journey through the life of the dim-witted but ever lovable Forrest Gump is just so touching, funny, sad everything you know from life is represented here in some way.To be honest, there are times when the characterization of Gump as a person with less the average IQ points can be a little too much, but if you look at it through the interplay with the characters he meets, then it becomes an eye-opener.Especially when he is sharing the screen with either his love interest Jenny, the war time comrade Bubba or his stern but loyal lieutenant Dan Taylor. Those characters stay with you in some way, because they are som well written in the context of Forrest's story. The fact that you don't always get on well just because you're smart. Life is harsh, but when it is, look out for your loved ones.And how the technicians managed to mix Tom Hank's person into that footage of historical events is still baffling. I had a blast watching it every time it appeared.Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. An undoubted masterpiece.",10,1,1,4 August 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," Creative and engaging.
","Monsters Inc. is in my top 5 of Pixar films, because the creativity behind it is truly great. The story created around this power station creating energy from child screams is unique and engaging. The characters is relatable due to the similarity between this work place and those from the real world. Humans are dangerous according to the monsters, but the child Boo accidentally enters their world and is discovered by one of the main characters, Sully, who tries to hide her whilst finding a way to return her to the human world. This makes way for really fun moments in the development of the main conflict in the movie and eventually an emotional core which is both sweet, engaging and real. The movie is great and a must to watch along with the other Pixar greats.",10,0,0,19 August 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Malek is the king of Queen!
","Yeah, as a Queen fan I loved this movie. Rami Malek's performance sounded great in the trailer and took everyone by storm in the final product. I loved how well he and the other band members turned out, because more than once I stared at Gwilum Lee and thought 'isn't that Bryan May' to myself.It was kind of weird witnessing Malek sing the chosen songs from Queen, because he delivered them with the same power and presence as Freddie Mercury did back in the day. Man, he did an amazing job!I agree it's a rough take on a legendary band's and singer's career, so hopefully it lights a spark in a new generation of Queen fans to go pick up their music and their fascinating story. But I am so glad the writers took the hard life of Freddie Mercury with them into the movie, because otherwise it would be disgraceful.Maybe not the one I'll be rooting for the most in the race for the Academy Award for Best Picture, but I really hope Malek gets the award for his performance!",9,3,4,22 January 2019
Lilo & Stitch," The 'Dumbo' of the 00's.
","I mean think about it: it has a similar style of animation, had a remarkably lower budget than the movies which preceeded it, it actually made a fair amount of money after a string of disappointing outcomes. Even though I think that either critics or audiences or both were a little too harsh on certain Disney movies of the 00's, I can certainly see why Lilo & Stitch reigns supreme as the best of the second dark age of Disney. It all comes down to one simple thing: the story. Lilo & Stitch takes up great themes of family and responsibility. The relationship between Nani and Lilo is so real and touching. Spicing it up with an alien coming to Earth was an odd choice, but Stitch is both cute, entertaining and serves a purpose. A big one actually. I'd say that that is both a blessing and a curse, because it gives the movie a feel of wanting to be two movies at the same time. It is not as distracting as, let's say, Meeko and Percy in Pocahontas or the gargoyls in Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Stitch steals the show and I first discovered the real heart of the movie when I watched it again as an adult. No hate, just a note. But it makes the movie unique in its own way and therfor it does not affect my rating.I love the characters! No one is dragging the movie down. They're all likable and entertaining, but Nani and Lilo are the emotional center of the movie. David Ogden Stiers' performance as Jumba is my favorite along with Chris Sanders as Stitch and Daveigh Chase as Lilo. They have the funniest lines and bounce off of their surroundings perfectly. If you haven't watched Lilo & Stitch since your child I highly recommend that you do it, because a beautiful story like this is perhaps even better for adults .",10,0,0,9 August 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," This was a wonderful surprise!
","I admit it, I was a little sceptical about this movie knowing the history and reputation of Sony Animation and after I watched their live-action departent butcher the character of Venom in theaters earlier this year.But this was a stunning expirience! The company that gave us garbage like The Emoji Movie actually cared this time and stepped up their game.First of all, the animation was fantastic with lots of vibrant colours and an overall comic book feel to it unfolding when Miles Morales is discovering his new identity as his dimension's Spider-Man. Your eyes will be glued to the screen when this riot of animation gets going.We also get a well paced coming-of-age story of Miles Morales which is filled with lots of real-life struggles which makes him so relatable just like Spider-Man is supposed to be. I was so happy seeing a portrayal of him which understood his comic book character. The writers definitely knew about certain misinterpretations in the past.Even though not every character has a ton of development put into them, they still manage to make them work to serve the story. They get to tell a brief origin story just to make clear to non-Spider-Man viewers who we're dealing with. And the Spider-Man team is just so loveable and make great dynamics off of each other while they still keep both feet on the ground knowing how serious the situation is.And wait for the climax which is super intense and showcases animation's full potential in creating art and entertainment.A good coming-of-age story with amazing animation and intense action scenes that will blow your mind!",9,5,11,19 December 2018
Over the Hedge," Okay, I guess.
","I remember watching Over The Hedge when it cames out. I also remember not enjoying very much, so therefore I checked it out once again these many years later to find out if my opinion had changed.Well, something I enjoyed and something I didn't. Firstly, I enjoyed the animation done on the backgrounds and the animal characters where the fur looked nicely textured and the movements were a good mix of slapstick wildness and realism. The choice to make the everyday objects and the humans look bigger as seen from the animals' point of view was nice. But the humans themselves didn't look very appealing and seemed too unlikable in their over-the-top hatred hatred towards the animals.And that's one of my main gripes with this movie, because at first it looks like a satire on humans moving away from nature, but it gets overly preachy when the main human antagonists are so darn cruel without any hesitation.The story is pretty predictable and doesn't do much to make it seem fresh. RJ is a raccoon in trouble with a bear he has stolen food from and he promises to get it back in a week. He meets a bunch of folks he uses to get it from, he feels guilty, he makes it good again, you know the drill.While I don't think it's bad, I'd say that Over The Hedge has enough meat on it to be passable as innocent entertainment without any objectionable elements in it. On par with the first Madagascar movie.",6,0,0,7 October 2019
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Better story, better characters, better jokes equals a better movie.
","It's a rare thing to see a sequel to an animated comedy that is way better than its predecessor, but that is the case with Madagascar.It starts off where the first movie ended and let's us see these characters end up in Africa where they discover things about themselves that changes their lives in different ways either by learning about their past, the present or where the future will bring them. That added some welcomed depth to them which was scarce in the first movie.But it's not just our main characters who get turned into something interesting in this swequel, because even minor characters from the first movie get their own sub-plot which is mostly meant to be entertainment, but it actually works and does not feel shoe-horned in or takes focus away from the main plot.And I laughed so much more and way harder to the humour in this than in its predecessor, so I dare say that Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is better than it's predecessor in every way",8,0,0,24 September 2019
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton takes a simple premise and makes it perfectly perfect.
","The premise of an outsider coming to a new environment has been done to death, but this take on it is both entertaining, dark, bright, funny, scary everything!Johnny Depp is brilliant as Edward, the romance is strangely touching, the music by Danny Elfman is beautiful. I could go on, but I think everything has already been said. But the character of Edward and what he goes through may be the strongest part of the movie, because of how the odd one out ends up becoming the town star but isn't immune to trouble. All of that must be seen in how the townsfolk react to him and his doing.Go watch it, it's an entertaining movie with a lot of heart and a strong message ranking among Burton's best works.",9,0,1,10 January 2020
Monsters vs. Aliens," Generic stupid fun.
","Not that stupid fun is a bad thing, it can actually be quite hiliarious when it is done right. Well, Monsters vs Aliens wasn't. Not a terrible expirience for me, but it wasn't anything new or had anything really exciting to it.It's your basic story about one person being transformed into something different and learning things about being diiferent and ending up liking it . It was predictable and the humour could be funny at times but was rather hit or miss.The villain of the movie, Gallaxar, was the part that truely took it away from being all bland or stupid comedic characters. His self-important take-over-the-world attitude was what made me giggle most times. B.O.B. was also kind of innocently stupid granted he had no brain.It still looked good like most DreamWorks movies and it's a passable distraction for the kiddies, but lacks in many places.",6,1,1,14 October 2019
Spider-Man," Good start if not entirely perfect.
","Sam Raimi did give me a good time with my favorite web-slinger, so pointing out flaws in this first Spider-Man movie are mostly cosmetic or nit-picky.The set-up for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was more or less a by-the-book of his iconic comicbook origin by being bitten by a genetically altered spider and after that taking it to the wrestling ring to earn cash and facing the tragedy losing a loved one.That was well done and showcased how Peter Parker becomes a somebody instead of a nobody even if the romance with Mary Jane never really felt genuine to me. And that's probably my biggest gripe with the movie, because outside the standout performances from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Willem Defoe's dual role as Norman Osborn and Green Goblin, the acting was only servicable.James Franco seemed bored most of the time as Harry Osborn and Tobey Maguire was pretty bland as Peter Parker, but actually convincing as Spider-Man.And that Goblin costume! Oh boy, how not scary can you be! It would have been so much better if Defoe had some make-up or effects turning his face green, because when you see him switch between Norman and the goblin in the mirror, you see some facial expressions to make your skin crawl. With all the brilliant special effects used in the movie, don't tell me they couldn't have done that.So yes, I have some problems with Spider-Man, but overall I had a good time with great action scenes and a couple of standout performances.",7,1,1,3 April 2020
Ratatouille," Another great one from Brad Bird.
","Ratatouille proves yet again how Brad Bird manages to breathe fresh air into something we have seen many times before while he at the same time offers a realistic look into a new corner of the world which in this case is the cooking business. You can tell his distinctive style by the look of the characters in the movie. Their sometimes exaggerated features make them all unique to look at. Most impressive is the giant colony of rats. As I said the story is something we have seen many times before with a nobody becoming a somebody while still struggling with his heritage which is the case for Rémy who is a rat who likes to cook. Linguini is a clumsy young man with no talent for cooking at all, but he grows with the help of Rémy. The execution breathes fresh air into it by how they work together which is not just hilariously entertaing, but also very creative. Every voice actor is doing a phenomenal job, the animation is lush and the message the movie conveys is inspiring. It is another incredible achievement for Brad Bird and Pixar.",10,0,0,24 July 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Pretty darn good.
","I grew up with Tobey Maguire playing the masked web-slinger, but re-watching it made me reconsider its greatness, because the acting was only sercivable and the romance lacking. But still Spider-Man 2 is a winner!But that brings me to The Amazing Spider-Man in which I actually was way more into Andrew Garfield's acting as Peter Parker, even if his take on the web-slinger was a tad overacted.And the romance with Gwen Stacey was actually really cute. So, the problems are minimal and I enjoyed the movie with the Lizard being an awesome villain and the action scenes with their intensity.",8,1,1,3 April 2020
The Lego Movie," I misjudged this movie. It has everything to be awesome!
","I never expected a movie about living blocks of plastic to be this good. It has lots of comedic splendour pouring out at a fast pace, a solid plot with many unpredictable twists and turns and last but not least a really heart-warming message for everyone watching. An all out enjoyable flick for anyone who needs cheering up.",10,0,0,12 October 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One must understand that when X-Men was good, it was spectacular.
","The X-Men franchise has had its ups and downs over the years, but if we just look at the ups, it helped show that superhero movies can be more than flashy special effects and break-neck action. Days of Future Past is not just the best X-Men movie overall, but one of the best superhero movies of all time.Phenominally acted by everyone with sepcial praise to James McAvoy as the you Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as the young Magneto whose rivalry brings the psychological tension up in their different view on the human threat to their survival. Add in Jennifer Lawrence as the key person Mystique and you have excitement through the entire run time.The special effects are splendid, the story of time travel is engaging and well portioned in each settings to keep us updated on the effects of Wolverine's actions in the past.A must watch for X-Men fans.",10,0,0,30 September 2019
Spirited Away," No words describe this masterpiece.
","I am speechless... nothing more to say. The animation is startling, the emotions are piercing and the characters are perfectly developed. It is just another masterpiece in the long line of Miazaki works. It will please every part of the family, kids as well as adults, despite its length.Watch it! You won't regret it.",10,2,3,26 August 2017
Enchanted," So much to like!
","I had a blast watching Enchanted!Not only is it a hilarious parody of the Disney fairytale formula, it also brought back well known names from Disney's heyday in the 90's. Yes, I'm talking about the masterful duo of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz who created the music and wrote the songs, so no wonder the film was nominated for three academy awards for best original song.The animated parts of the movie were also a welcomed return to the traditional animation with colourful backgrounds and great character design. But the strongest aspects of the movie were in the sharp and witty dialogue and the wonderful performances by the hilariously over-the-top but still controlled James Marsden as prince Edward and the main character, princess Giselle, played by Amy Adams. The fish-out-of-water story about Giselle and Edward coming to the real world and still acting like fairytale characters was hilarious. Timothy Spall and Susan Sarandon also made a great villainous duo as the classic evil sorceress and bumbling sidekick.If you know your Disney, you'll also spot many references to classic animated movies from the company, some more obvious than others. Several watches recommended just to focus on that alone. I spotted references to Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Lady & the Tramp, The Lion King and Snow White during my watch for this review.The only thing to put a finger on is that by today's standards the computer generated animal character at times look obviously fake, but not to a distracting degree. The CGI used in the big climax is still rather impressive.I hope other people will find Enchanted as entertaining and wonderful as I did, because it holds high entertainment value and stands well on its own as a Disney parody and a Disney movie at once.",9,3,3,24 May 2019
Inside Out," Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.
","I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point. Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one. Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them. The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection. I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments. You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch.",10,50,85,23 November 2017
Toy Story 4," Not needed but still a great movie.
","I am among the people who were very skeptical about Pixar making a fourth Toy Story movie after the powerful ending of the third movie, but I went to the theater to see it for myself.And may I say, for a sequel we may not have needed, I still enjoyed it to the fullest because of how they made another aspect of toys come to life. I'm talking about the emotionally and physically damaged doll, Gabby Gabby whose wants and needs are fully understandable.Her story is the most touching here and even though her sidekicks can be scary as hell it's worth paying attention every time she is on screen. But not her alone, because we get closure with Bo Peep very early on who wasn't in the third movie at all. She is awesome and entertaining and tough and all that stuff. In my opinion, ther is still room for more in this franchise, not a movie, but a TV-series about Bo Peep could be awesome.So many memorable characters and yet another emotionally charged story only Toy Story is capable of making. TS4 may seem like an odd choice after the seemingly definite ending from the third movie, but this ending is another one of that kind.",7,1,5,31 August 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Should have won the academy award!
","I think Wreck-It-Ralph is my second favorite animated feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios from the 2010's second only to Zootopia, because of the imaginative world build off of these games I honestly know very litle about. I guess it's a good sign that even non-gamers can enjoy this movie for what it did.The animation was fantastic with all its vibrant colours and the way the different tones of the different games blended with each other when interacting.Ralph and Venelopy are so good together and King Candy is among the best Disney Villains in recent years. His manipulative personality is so despicable and yet he manages to hide it from the games with his genius plan. No wonder it received a sequel which I haven't seen yet, but will do in time to come.And it is out of this world how Pixar's mediocre Brave won the Academy Award this year, not just over this movie, but in general. In my opinion, this movie deserved the award.",10,1,1,3 November 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A sequel done right!
","How to Train Your Dragon 2 has everything that makes for a great cinematic expirience and a adds enough new stuff to make it one of those sequels which surpasses its predecessor.I had minor issues with the original HTTYD regarding its story which was this underdog story where the main focus was one the main character Hiccup's journey from being an outcast to becoming the one to save the day, which was a little predictable, but the animation was stil spectacular.In HTTYD2 the focus is more on the dragons and the world they live in and less on Hiccup. But we also get a new insight into his people and his family, and I'll admit that was engaging to watch. Throw in the amazing animation and an intimidating villain and you'll get an immersive fantasy world with a mature tone.If you get the opportunity to watch it on the big screen, do it! I did and it was amazing! HTTYD2 is a definite recommendation from me if you want to see more from this world of dragons.",9,0,0,24 December 2018
Cars," A step back for Pixar.
","Pixar had been riding on a wave of highly acclaimed animated feature films almost non-stop since its beginning with the mega hit of Toy Story, and sure a couple of movies shared a similar story structure like 2006's Cars, but they had something thoughtprovoking about them, but while I watched cars I had so many questions.First of all, why did it have to be a world of cars? With this unoriginal story you could put anything in the car's place and you would still get the same outcome, so why cars out of all possible things. We at least got a glimpse of a plausible miniature world in A Bug's Life, but this world makes no sense. How do they mate? How do they use the rear-view mirrors when their eyes are the wind shield? And why are even the flies a car?But it all comes back to the story, because how many times have you heard this: a self-absorbed city boy lives his life in the fast lane without thinking about other, some day he gets out of his comfort zone and must learn about appreciating the small things in life and care about others, then he gets his chance to be the greatest person in the world but has learned his lesson.Yeah, it was predictable from start to finish, but I wouldn't say it's all bad, because even though he meets some colourful characters whereas most of them are one-note I did like McQueen's romance with Sally and how he played out with the race car veteran Doc Hudson which leads to a foreseen but heart-warming ending.It may be Pixar's weakest original movie, but it's not all bad, we'll leave that to its sequel.",6,0,1,21 September 2019
The Little Mermaid," The colours, the music, the animation, the villain! Everything is great.
","As a whole The Little Mermaid is fantastic. It is not my favorite from the Disney renaisance, but it definitely is a fantastic underwater adventure. Comparing it to the later Disney greats I came to a conclusion on why I liked it: it made me happy. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite, because it was thought-provoking and made me think about life, but when in need of cheering up this Mermaid is what I turn to. 
The climax is one of the best in the Disney catalog with the great Ursula being defeated in a pretty awesome way actually! Under The Sea is only one of all the ridiculously catchy songs in the movie and it really deserved those Oscars. While Ursula's song maybe is my least favorite of the villain songs from the great 90's Disney movies it surely is entertaining just like the other songs. But the time Ariel spends on land really shows how passionately the animators worked on the movie. If you haven't, watch it! It is great.",9,0,0,13 December 2017
Bolt," Good, not great, but an immense improvement since Disney's CG debut.
","Hats off to Disney for improving their CG that much in just three years. If you try looking at Chicken liitle which established Disney as capable of making CG-animated movies, you will know. Bolt is also waaay more likable than Chicken Little. Now for the actual movie. Bolt (John Travolta) is a dog whose life is a reality show in which he is a super powered dog who goes on dangerous missions with a girl named Penny (Miley Cyrus). But it turns out that he really believes this and when he escapes from the studio he must deal with not having super powers and come to terms with reality. The plot is pretty similar to The Truman Show, and since I know that movie, Bolt became rather predictable to me. It is cute seeing him interact with humans and hanging out with a feline he meets along the way home to the studio, but that was just not enough to make it a classic. The voice actors did good jobs, that's for sure, and some action scenes are well made, but aside from that it's pretty average. One year later Disney returned with a bang in their last traditionally animated musical which to be honest is a lot stronger than bolt despite not being the mega hit they anticipated.",6,0,1,26 April 2018
Frozen," Over-hyped for sure, but not bad. Worth a watch or two.
","I'd say Frozen is worth your time. There are a lot of clever ideas to be seen in this spectacular effort which threw Disney back on top of the animation hierarchy after a slowly coming back with the previously released 'Wreck-it Ralph', 'Tangled' and 'The Princess and the Frog'. I at first fell into the 'hate it'-camp, but decided to watch it anyway to form my own opinion. I was positively surprised. I think the musical score has a the most memorable numbers to come out of the Disney company since 'Tarzan'. 'Let It Go' is a catchy tune and even though it has been played to death it certainly deserves credit. The scene in which it is played is simply astounding. 'For the First Time In Forever' serves the movie well, because it moves the story forward just like 'Do You Wanna Build a Snow Man'. That is the purpose of songs in musicals. I wasn't very keen on Olaf's and the Tolls' songs to be honest. The Trolls' song felt out of place and Olaf's did not add very much to the story.It was pleasant to have Olaf as a more quiet comic relief instead of loudly yelling ones from movies like 'Treasure Planet' and 'Bolt'. Olaf's relationship obsession with summer was funny and had a good and heartfelt pay-off in the end. The animation is along with the music the highlight of the movie. It was beautiful, nothing more to say. The movie also makes fun of earlier Disney clichés like falling in love with one you just met. That is clever, and I enjoyed it all the way through. Sounds like a flawless movie? Think again! The villain is not good. Even though he explained his motivations which were decently clever, it felt forced. It was one of those last-minute villains. I think overall the hype has killed a generally well done movie. I think Frozen is good, but not among the greatest Disney animated movies.",8,3,5,16 October 2017
X-Men: The Last Stand," Rushed and over crowded story.
","As a stand-alone movie, X-Men: The Last Stand is about average superhero stuff with decent action scenes and a couple of eye-popping sceneries here and there, but it sadly pales as a follow-up to X2, which had so many deep character moments.X-Men: The Last Stand is filled with awesome characters, but almost non of them have any moments which makes you care for them. And those who did were either tossed away or had rushed arcs. The two opening scenes including Jean Grey and Angel were promising and made me think that this movie could be powerful, but then the feeling of two plots being strung together ensued.I think if the writers had decided to focus solely on the Pheonix Saga it could have worked, because a good portion of it actually worked out pretty well, but with the overall plot being the development of a cure for mutation, it felt like two different plotlines not being well connected.Yeah, I didn't find it insufferable, but it was a disappointment after watching the two predecessors both of which I still value as comicbook masterpieces.",5,0,0,17 June 2019
The Incredibles," Disney tried a mediocre action/adventure with 'Atlantis', but Pixar did a perfect job with 'The Incredibles'!
","The Incredibles truly is an amazing superhero action flick with the heart only Pixar manages to do. Another great effort by Brad Bird! The characters are so lovely. The mid-life crisis stricken Bob Parr and his family who try to blend into regular suburban lives after some unfortunate events get forced into action after Bob is offered an opportunity to be super again. Craig T. Nelson nails the sound of a tired middelaged father who lives through that midlife crisis while also showcasing intense emotions when someone crosses his limits. Holly Hunter makes Helen Parr/Elastigirl a perfect example of a stern mom trying to keep everything under control. Sarah Vowell does make Violet a nervous teenage girl which fits perfectly and when she bounces off the youthful Dash they become really entertaining. But my favorites were Edna Mode and Buddy Pine/Syndrome. Did you honestly know as a kid that Brad Bird himself did the voice of Edna? I didn't, but now I know and it is so cool! Edna is so funny in her Cruella De Vil-ish attitude and her exaggerated outburst of excitement and other emotions! I was laughing so hard so many times! Syndrome must without a doubt be one of the animated villains with the highest deathcount. Oh god, I just realised how many superheroes he took down to achieve his gold. Such a tragic story of a neglected boy. Jason Lee really nailed his geeky personality, but also made him incredibly manacing when he was doing terrible things. The family aspect of the movie was also handled in a mature way by having both conflicts shown and resolved through the movie's running time. More than once the writers also managed to poke some great fun at existing family tropes which I first noticed when watching the movie recently. Overall, a great superhero action flick, but made incredible with great themes of family.",10,0,0,19 June 2018
Cars 2," Well, this was unnecessary.
","When I said that Cars was a step back for Pixar back in 2006, this one was a giant leap in what could go wrong.The original had a generic predictable story, but at least it was easy to follow. This is first of all not really a sequel and was a mess of different plot lines like this out of nowhere spy story which Mater of all is dragged into, McQueen racing against this Italian formula car and an underlying environmental theme which doesn't really add much else than a forced pay off.Aside from the weird spy story I think it was wrong to make Mater the overall star of the movie, because while we get a few glimpses into how he feels being seen as an idiot most of the time which can add a little to the story, he just can't run (or drive) from the fact that he acts like one. If you're a big fan of Mater, this sequel to the weakest Pixar outing may be for you.",4,0,0,9 October 2019
Back to the Future Part III," A satisfying end to a beloved trilogy.
","While not as good as the first sequel it manages to be entertaining on its own.I appreciate that the writers gave a little more to Doc Brown's character by putting him in a dilemma of choosing his new found love or going back instead of just repeating his one-note presence as Marty's helper in the first sequel.But even if the setting seems a little odd at first, it still raises some fairly high stakes for Marty to cope with while still facing the same obstacles like in the earlier movies. And since all three movies are tied very closely together, Back to the Future pt. 3 is so worth watching just to get to that strong ending.",8,2,2,24 March 2020
Coco," A really strong movie that made me appreciate my family.
","I had been a little embarrased by saying that the only Pixar movie I had seen in theaters was Cars, so I went to see Coco. And may I say that I was overwhelmed with emotion, because this was the most relatable movie expirience I have ever been through.Miguel is a boy who loves playing music and looks up to a famous musician Ernesto De La Cruz who is kind of the Elvis Presley of Mexico, but Miguel's family hates music because of their reasons. Since I do play music as well he caught my interest, but I must admit, though, that this initial set-up seemed kind of clichÃ©d, but the execution of it is expertly done, because there is so much more put into it than just making a run-of-the-mill story of making the ones who don't like a certain thing care.Because Miguel's initial frustration about his family takes him on a wonderful journey into a beautiful world of dead people which is much more pleasant than it sounds and discovers much about his family and what family at its core means to us all. All this is made with the inspiration of the Mexican holiday Dios de los muertos (the day of the dead) which is used to honour family.There are some really strong scenes in Pixar's Coco which deal with heavy topics like death and abandonment, but it surely is handled with respect and delicacy without being dumbed down.And if you do not cry at least once during Coco, I suggest an appointment with your doctor.",10,1,2,28 February 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," An enduring classic.
","The one movie that kicked Tim Burton into the hearts and minds of millions with his unique art style of grotesque exaggerated body parts and eerie atmosphere provided by an unforgettable music score and infectious songs by Danny Elfman.It's a movie that holds up to this day, because Burton has made a name for himself by not only achieving the first nomination by an animated feature for an academy award for best visual effects, but also with time getting his character designs dubbed 'burtonesque'. That's some achievement!The characters here are iconic, too. So likable, creepy, funny and everything in between. This is a must watch for any fan of great movie magic.",10,0,1,13 October 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Everything but your average cartoon!
","It is not called the saddest animated movie for nothing. That's because it deals with themes we normally stay away from in our daily lives, the cost of war and the destruction of our lives together. I bet war veterans would cry their eyes out if one of them was even able to sit through it. The relationship between our two main characters is so real and so strong it just makes you care about them and feel their pain when they go through their suffering in WW2 Japan, because even if Japan were allies of Nazi Germany, the population never asked for it and certainly never deserved the nuclear bombs dropped on them (no spoiler, just historical retrospect). I think Grave of the Fireflies deserve all the recognition it can get, because it proves that animation is not just for kids. It is definitely too real and depressing for younger viewers, but should be viewed by everyone capable of understanding the horrors of war.",10,1,1,7 May 2018
Brave," Not the usual Pixar quality.
","When I first saw Brave, I wasn't impressed like I usually am by Pixar.The premise is pretty generic and the mother/daughter relationship isn't very interesting, because of the clichéd story of rebelling against the old traditions of royalty. And to be honest, I didn't find Merida that likable when she more or less constantly bickered and argued with her mother. Not much new done with this material in an already lackluster story.The other members of the clan can be entertaining and the animation is beautiful as always with Pixar, but visual brilliance is only surface level quality, because a well crafted story can save mediocre animation, but not the other way around in my book.And out of all animals you can think of why should the mother be turned into a bear? Disney already given us Brother Bear, but at the very least Pixar didn't make it talk and instead added a little fun mannerisms.Mediocre by Pixar standards, but harmless as a movie in general. Brave can bare the Pixar logo, but in my book not the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature of 2012.",5,0,0,9 May 2019
A Bug's Life," One of the weaker Pixar movies, but still enjoyable.
","Pixar really started at the top with the spectacular mega hit Toy Story which still holds up as a great story with great characters. That isn't exactly the same with their second feature A Bug's Life. The story is not that unique to begin with. Heck, Pixar had a ton to live up to after the surprise of Toy Story, so it is forgivable. Flik is our neurotic main character who longs after being special, but is rejected by his colony which must provide food to feed the tyrannical grasshoppers, lead by Hopper, to avoid them attacking the colony. Given the fact that Dreamworks' Antz came out shortly before A Bug's Life they are quite similar. I guess you know the controversy surrounding those two movies. I think they both a good in their own ways, and what makes A Bug's Life good is the colours and the circus bugs as the comedic addition to the plot. They are the highlight of the entire movie and can make both kids and adults laugh. In my opinion Hopper as a villain is also doing a great job. When his colony of grasshoppers arrived at the ants' near the climax used to scare me as a kid. Their tall and menacing figures slowly emerging from the fog is bone-chilling. All in all, A Bug's Life is a good children's movie and adults may also find one or two things enjoyable, too. Mainly the circus bugs, though.",7,3,5,24 November 2017
Logan," A hard-hitting wonder from Logan the Wolverine.
","Logan is the best movie in the X-Men franchise, but is solely about Logan wanting to live without being confronted with the mutant agenda and works a steady job while he is hiding with Charles Xavier and Caliban both of whom in a sad condition. Not that it is bad, not at all, but I will stress that I mostly consider it a spin-off, and therefore my favorite 'X-Men' movie is still Day of Future Past.But in this movie Logan is approached by a nurse who recognices him as the Wolverine and wants his help, but he doesn't want to. But that woman ends up turning his life upside-down because she knows something unsettling involving an 11-year-old girl and a gang of other mutant kids.This story adaption is just all out violent, sad, gory and packs up all the heartbreaking events we got in the comic, so if you don't mind all the severed limbs and children being harmed, then you're in for a hellride of emotions. It does give itself room for some quiter moments to let us get into the wants and hardships of the characters, so it works as a satisfying journey with enough growth and bonding to make you care for them.",10,1,1,2 October 2019
The Dark Knight," What can I say? A thoughtprovoking and dark effort!
","Count me in as a fan of The Dark Knight right away!I loved every minute of it, because everything was just perfect from the performances to the pacing, the cinematography and the music score. It was just beautiful!Normally I am a little cautious about movies surpassing the two hour running time, but as I said with the pacing, it didn't feel like it dragged at any time.And let us all give all praise possible to the late Heath Ledger for bringing the most real portrayal of the Joker to life and earning him the well deserved Academy Award. R.I.P., dear Ledger. You died way too early!The performances done by Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face and Christian Bale as the titular role were also top-notch. And the makeup artists who were hired for this surely worked their butts off, because Two-Face was masterfully made and didn't seem fake to me.This is a must watch for any Batman fan and for those who want to see one of the few superhero movies that manage to be more than just that!",10,0,0,22 January 2019
Toy Story," The Snow White of CGI and better!
","Firstly, Toy Stoy is just a great and heartfelt movie with great and relatable characters and story. When I say it is the Snow White of CGI, it is because what Snow White did for traditional animation, Toy Story did for CGI. If you look closer at it, you can see the faults in the graphics, but to h*** with that! It was the first of its kind! I cannot add much more to this. Toy Story is a fantastic movie and a milestone in the world of animation. And in comparison to Walt Disney Pictures' classics, the sequels are great too.",10,0,0,6 August 2017
Toy Story 2," The best sequel ever made.
","My headline sum up the most admirable thing about Toy Story. Pixar had enough respect towards their 1995 mega hit to put effort into making a spectacular sequel. Woody is faced with hard choices here about himself being a collector's item and therefore immediately desired by the toy enthusiast Al who brings him to his own place with lots of merchandise. One of them is a TV-show with co-puppets a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bull's Eye and a prospector named Stinky Pete.Jessie is a really well made character with an emotional back-story which always makes me cry a little. The song 'When She Loved Me' is a perfect song illustrating her emotional scars. That song easily ranks among Randy Newman's best. Every conflict faced in this movie is perfect. When you find yourself torn between both choices, you know it is great. Woody wants to stay with his newly acquired fame and free his new friends from being left as an incomplete collection, but also to go back to Andy. There are also a lot of great laughs. Lots of jokes about other toys and the situations they find themselves in. I could go on for ever about how much I like Toy Story 2. Go see it if you haven't and do your kids a favor and show all Toy Story movies to them.",10,0,1,14 November 2017
Up," A surreal one with its own magically moving story.
","Up is best known for its famous heart-wrenching ten minutes in the beginning of the movie, but the rest is filled with so much gold: a surreal setting and weird memorable characters, but made believable in Up's own universe. Just like the one Pinocchio made back in the day. Pixar has always bin a master of storytelling, and Up is no exeption. Carl Fredericksen is a grumpy old man who learns valuable lessons of friendship and trust, but discovers some unpleasant realities along the way. He meets some colourful characters on his journey, which may seem weird at first, but strangely enough fit into the universe the film creates. Up also features some comedic gold which surely will entertain audiences of all ages and does not stick awkwardly out. It fits in with the overall tone of the movie. I highly recommend Up to everyone out there.",10,0,1,3 April 2018
How to Train Your Dragon," A fairly good movie.
","How to Train Your Dragon is a breathtakingly animated movie which deserves high praise for that, but even though it has a couple of really good elements it also has noticable drawbacks. I'll explainOne of the best aspects of HTTYD is the animation. The flight scenes and the discovery of the dragons are highlights of the movie, because the creativity put into making every dragon unique is wonderful, and when you see those landscapes from above your jaw will drop. Just amazing work of animation. Another great thing is this very real and organic build-up of the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, because it's not an easy task, and that leads to the later conflict which is clichéd but is well excecutedNo wonder Chris Sanders had a directoral role in this moving story, after all he was the writer of Disney's Lilo & Stitch which also had touchingly dramatic scenes. Toothless reminded me of Stitch, and it isn't hard to guess why the writer of that that movie could make a character with similar mannerisms.But many of these characters are pretty weak in their characterizations, because they either come off as one-note, mean-spirited or both. Hiccup's co-students in his training to become a viking warrior are easily described with simple tropes with almost no depth to them. Well, Astrid has some dimensions to her, because she discovers Hiccup's secret as the story progresses, but the others are kind of annoying one-trope characters. And Hiccup's father kept on being so mean to him that I found him pretty hateable, because even when his son has proven his worth he still makes less blatant mean comments. That aspect of the movie just got on my nerves.The sequel is better in my opinion, because its focus is more on the world around them rather than on the characters and bigger consequences happened and added a less predictable feel to its story, but HTTYD started it all so therefore I can't deny it's worth.So all in all: Breathtaking animation and a well excecuted start of a beautiful friendship between two characters are highlights in an otherwise predictable story with many weak characters.",7,0,0,28 February 2018
Rocky," A charming uplifting story.
","Even people who are not into sports can be won over by this offering by Sylvester Stallone. Well, maybe because most of the movie isn't about sport but rather a slice of life drama about the titular character Rocky Balboa who earns his spare change by fighting here and there while working for a crime boss.He gets this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and gives it his all while the big-shot Creed is overly sure of himself to win. Yes, it is predictable, but it is the build-up of the titular character that makes this so enjoyable, because Rocky may not be very smart, but he has determination and is an honest man.Rocky's relationships with the local pet store girl Adrian and her brother Paulie and his his manager Mickey is also handled with expertise. A highly enjoyable movie despite its predicatbility.",8,0,0,20 October 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Overall a fine expirience.
","I decided to do a check-up on Harry Potter's famous adventure made for the big screen, so I started reading the books yet again, because I know that changes have been made to make it fit for a visual medium. I knew I would prefer the book, because I'll admit that some scenes that were cut didn't make sense to me.But I could go on talking only about that, so therefore I'll bring up the good stuff.The music was beautiful and really captured the sense of wonder when all the magical elements were presented. And the Hogwarts castle was stunning in its grandiosity and still struck me with awe and amazement. The broomstick flying hasn't aged too well as you can tell that they're not really flying when they come in for close-ups, but you can't really blame a movie for being made when it is and the Quidditch game still looked good and felt exciting.Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Severus Snape and Hagrid respectively were well chosen for the roles and as far as I know, J.K. Rowling had a personal say in their assignments to the roles and it payed off in my opinion. Rickman's soft voice was just what I heard in my head when reading his lines in the books and Coltrane puts just as much likability into Hagrid as I remembered.Richard Harris and Maggie Smith as Dumbledore and Mcgonagall respectively also did well adding personality and face to those characters. And Rupert Grint stood out as a funny Ron Weasley among our main charcaters. As it is their first meeting with each other, they have to warm up to each other's company, so I Harry is mostly going around being all 'wow, it's amazing, I didn't know that' but comes around and discovers thing he is not supposed to and getting into trouble as the movie goes on. Hermione is a know-it-all and Malfoy is an arrogant dick. It's a first movie in a coming-of-age story, so that is to be expected.But I was disappointed with one thing especially, just to round off the faithfulness to the book, because Hermione's character was surprisingly down-played in a couple of crucial areas making up her character growth in the book some of them also could have made a couple of exciting scenes. That made her a little more one-dimensional here, I'll admit.While some crucial scenes didn't make it, the movie is still good-looking and with some really good choises made for other characters. Add in some fantastic music and you have a fantasy film for the whole family.",7,0,0,22 November 2019
Hercules," Unique visuals and a great villain steal the show.
","I must say that after watching this childhood time-stealer, I found it a little underdeveloped. Hades and his sidekicks pain and panic have become more entertaining over the years while Hercules, Zeus and Megara have worn out a little. Mostly Herc whose conflict is as generic as can be. The visual style is unique to put it neutrally. I personally think it is the ugliest of the Disney renaissance era, but that's not the main problem with this movie. Its uninteresting characters are the problem as I stated in the beginning. Hades makes this movie worth watching and he gets a laugh out of me every time he is on screen and that is great.Despite its problems it has spawned one of my favorite Disney songs, though. 'I Won't Say I'm In Love' is a really catchy tune and along with 'Go The Distance' the most memorable songs in the movie. Maybe Hercules' unique visual style and the standout performance of James Woods as Hades serves in its favor to make it memorable. Just the weirdness of it in general.One of my least favorite movies from the Disney renaissance, but I can appreciate its existence.",6,0,1,14 October 2017
Sausage Party," This is Foodfight as it should have been.
","Does that mean that it was an intolerable piece of unfinished rawness? 
Not really, it's definitely not for everyone, and I at times struggled to get through the raunchy, juvenile and terrifying scenes more than once filled with as much gore that can be made by food. But I had a few laughs and I liked how it spoofed both Disney and Pixar and a lot of other films and such. It had enough far-fetched scenes without the loudness and inuendos to be pretty funny at times. I may not be seeing it again soon, but it had enough meat to make up for the abundance of food puns and juvenile nature.Shout-out to Alan Menken for composing the catchy music for Sausage Party!",5,1,2,17 July 2018
Ice Age," Worth watching.
","Ice Age is an enjoyable family film with something for everybody. I don't think it's something spectacular, but what we get is enjoyable. This is a buddy comedy story we've seen before, but it is executed well with each character providing their own sense of humour ranging from the mostly goofball slapstick of Sid to the deadpan from Manfred and the similar style from Diego. But it's not only fun and gags, because these characters are actually pretty well made. Even though Sid primarilly plays the role of the socially inept one whom nobody wants he is both kind and brave when he needs to. Manfred may seem grumpy and stern, but their is a sad reason to that (no spoilers). Diego gets into their trip with a completely different agenda than when he pretends to have and that makes some good tension between the three of them. My only little issue with Ice Age is that the animation hasn't aged very well. Even compared to other animated features of its time it is not that great which is shown best in the human characters' unnatural look. You can't blame it for that, because it's a first from Blue Sky Studios and they did a great job. Even though it's been milked with pointless sequels which went in a completely different way than I had hoped, people seem to like it, because the box office performances sure don't lie. It all started with this enjoyable feature with good humour, good characters and some powerfull moments.",8,1,1,9 August 2018
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The one that started it all
","Let me start off with this: the visuals are amazing, the characters are likable and the emotional scenes really work. I have asked myself the question 'is this movie really 80 years old by now'? and the fact that it actually is still astounds me. In my lifetime the company has made movies which looked less than half as good as Snow White despite the available technology, therefore it has a special place in my heart. But that said, I honestly think that Snow White as a character is quite a bore. She surely has the beautiful singing voice of Adriana Caselotti, but she is too cute and innocent to be interesting. In addition to that, the scenes involving her and the prince are just awkward, both of the times they meet. The dwarfs and the evil queen are by far the greatest characters in this movie.'Snow White and the Seven Dwafs' is highly recommendable if you like animation as a craft.",9,1,1,6 August 2017
The Lion King," Not a personal favorite, but no one can deny its brilliance.
","For a long time I have been deeply thinking about what I really think of The Lion King. After watching all the animated Disney movies I can see its brilliance, even though it isn't a personal favorite of mine and there are other animated Disney movies I think deserve more attention.Let me make it clear. TLK is among the most beautifully animated Disney movies. The stampede scene is just huge and intimidating, the intro scene is by far the most iconic scene from any Disney movie along with one of the most iconic and grandest songs ever to be in a movie. The backgrounds are amazing, the whole animation aspect of it is amazing. On that spot it is an undoubted masterpiece.And I must admit that the culmination of the stampede scene with Simba, Mufasa and Scar will for ever be the most emotionally charged scene in a Disney movie if not in a movie in general.The voice acting is good. James Earl Jones is never a disappointment with his booming voice. Jeremy Irons does make a great, slimy, backstabbing, power hungry villain, but falls a little flat when he comes to power compared to both earlier power hungry villains like Maleficent and Jafar and my personal favorite Frollo. But that's a nit-pick, because story-wise it's essential, because we see how young Simba dreams of being a king who can do whatever he wants and that is what Scar turns into when he comes to power.'The Circle of Life' which as mentioned before is perhaps the grandest Disney song ever and one of the most iconic openings of any movie. Not just in Disney, but in general. The rest of the music is catchy and memorable and serves the story well. I am not as fond of 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' as I am of earlier love songs like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'A Whole New World' simply because the love aspect is kind of disturbing since lions live in prides which consist of family, so therefore making Simba and Nala relatives. 'Be Prepared' has a great visual appeal and serves the scene well, but when I listen to it on its own it comes off as just another 'I-want-power-because-I'm-evil' song. The african inspiration in the music is amazing, nothing more to say.I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I don't hate them, not at all. They raised Simba, but the fact that they had a tv-show and a direct-to-video film, the latter which I think is garbage, just made me think badly of them.It is my personal opinion. I feel at times TLK is a little overrated, but it is undoubtedly a great movie.",10,2,2,1 October 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Cute and entertaining characters in a too familiar story.
","Yeah, I'm not going to lie to you. I didn't expect a lot from this movie, but I had a good time watching cute talking animals doing mischievous antics.Not that it was terrible, because the voice work was energetic and delivered some funny jokes and the animation was nice to look at. The story, however, was pretty standard. A dog loves his owner, the owner gets another dog whom he instantly dislikes and tries to get rid of and they end up getting lost together and learn to appreciate each other.But even though some side characters steal the show, the film makers went way overboard with the quantity of characters. A lot of them sadly didn't make much of an impact on the movie other than following the leaders or being one-off jokes themselves.I wonder why a sequel is hitting theaters later in 2019, but what the hell, I guess TSLOP made enough money in theaters to green-light it.TSLOP is fine as a time-waster, but nothing that special.",6,0,1,8 January 2019
Finding Dory," Ties in well with its predecessor.
","After hitting rock bottom with the release of Cars 2 and the mostly disappointing Monster University, I'm happy to see how Pixar was able to capture the essence of what made Finding Nemo so memorable yet again. I always wondered where Dory came from and all that stuff. And how that journey was strung together is yet again filled with memorable characters both old and new. The flash backs used for Dory's steady recall of who her parents are and how she got away from them was a clever choice of narrative, because that was how it was supposed to be in 'Nemo' about how Marlin lost his wife and children. It works so well in here because of the short-term memory loss of Dory.With that said, I must address a few problems with the movie. You see, I loved how both Nemo and Marlin figured out there escape plans in the first movie, and that is only occasionally the case in Finding Dory. Many times it just seemed like something just happened to go that way or that just happened be there. It made me feel like: 'oh, that was adequate'. But aside from that, it captured all the things that made me love the original, so all in all it is a solid movie.",9,1,2,1 August 2018
Rango," Something you don't see every day.
","Rango was definitely an inventive movie when it came out. Not only that, but also something that's not very common in animation like a western themed movie. And much more convincing at that than let's say Home On The Range or Fievel Goes West.While I must admit that the plot had its predictability in some places. The beginning showcases exactly that when the domesticated lizard Rango ends up in unfamiliar surroundings and pretends to be a hot-shot. Even if the script offers many mature themes and interesting ideas, that choice of story made me guess a handful of outcomes.But that's the only criticism I have towards Rango, because everything else is astounding like the animation and the characters. Animation wise it even looks like something Pixar could have made or even better, and that's the biggest compliment one can get.",8,1,1,9 October 2019
Despicable Me," The perfect family movie.
","Not since Pixar's smash hit Toy Story back in 1995 has a newcomer in the industry taken the world by storm like Despicable Me did. To this day I regret not seeing it in theaters, because you're in for a fun, colourful and heartwarming ride through the life of the villain Gru and his mission to steal the moon.In these times where too many animated features pander towards little kids with bright colours, non-stop dialogue, dated pop songs and unfunny gags, I appreciate the effort put into this movie to make it watchable for all ages.The humour and the heart of the story are the biggest highlights, because the story itself can be rather predictable. The execution of it saves it from ending up in the generic camp, and that's a definite plus.An immensely enjoyable family picture with its heart the right place and its sense of humour up there with the greats.",9,0,0,2 January 2019
Back to the Future Part II," The interesting question of 'what if'.
","While the sequel to the classic Back to the Future doesn't offer much new in the character department, we do get an entertaining movie filled with funny guesses at how the world would look in the future and what Marty McFly's life would be if the timeline was altered.This is that kind of movie that can't exist without its predecessor, because of how their timelines cross and affect each other.But it all flows very well without relying too much on the events of the first movie. The meeting of the timelines has a purpose and doesn't feel forced. And the movie has some strong scenes you can't help but feel all the more with these likable heroes and fierce bad guys.And while that form of time travel in theory could make up an endless amount of sequls, I'm glad to see that the Back to the Future trilogy only is a trilogy, but also that each sequel serves a purpose and is connected to each other.",8,0,0,10 March 2020
The Iron Giant," Warner Bros'. masterpiece.
","Only one and a half year prior to this heartfelt and passionate movie, WB released the bland and nonsensical Quest for camelot. That's a major improvement, because The Iron Giant delivers on every level! First of all, the setting of a Cold War America creates a wide range of possibilities of making conflict and is used to the fullest with a government agent being on the search for an unidentified fallen object. The tense atmosphere increases every time he acts, because of the relatability created by the setting. Speaking of the government agent, he is not the only character to add depth and dynamic to the movie, every character plays off of each other perfectly to add heart and soul to the movie's atmosphere. The relationship between the giant and the boy Hogarth is really heartfelt and well developed, what else could you desire but great main characters? The story about paranoia and how we perceive the unknown makes you think it's a dark and serious movie all throughout, but it manages to give some hillarious comedy as well without damaging the overall tone. Hogarth and the giant are lovely to watch and the junkyard owner share some hilarious moments with them when he discovers the giant.The animation has also taken a giant step upwards (no pun intended) since the underwhelming expirience in Quest for Camelot. The backgrounds are gorgeously detailed and mange to show the size of the giant's appearance in general and capture the even grander feel when he flies and especially in the epic climax. The design of the giant himself is also brilliantly done and how much emotion he is able to show despite the restraints of it.The initial release was not kind towards this animated gem due to bad marketing and lack of confidence in the movie from WB thanks to the failure of Quest for Camelot. I'm glad to see that The Iron Giant has gained praise over time and today is considered a modern classic. One of the best animated movies ever made if you ask me.",10,0,0,9 April 2018
Shrek," Highly enjoyable fairy-tale spoof.
","Shrek has become a modern classic in the field of animated comedies with its brillint take on well-known fairy-tale tropes and characters. No wonder it spawned three sequels with mixed results and a possible reboot coming in the near future.But this laugh-filled adventure started with a bang when the evil tyrant Farquaad banishes a horde of fairy-tale creatures to the swamp to the utmost dismay of our titular green ogre. He then contacts Farquaad to make him free the swamp from all these creatures so he can live in peace once again. They strike a bargain and Shrek goes out on his hunt.Every cliché from fairy-tales is taken into consideration to get a laugh out the audience, but that's what makes Shrek so funny, because it works and was a new thing at the time. Many tried doing a similar job but failed every time. The humour in Shrek can be a little too juvenile at times, but it's not ruining the mass-appeal, because the overall outcome is well thought out and delivered with excellence.If this was the masterpiece that started it all, then the sequel was the one to add the last bit of icing on the cake to make it the perfect parody movie.",9,0,0,22 August 2019
X-Men: First Class," This was a really good prequel.
","X-Men: First Class is one of the best prequels I have seen in a long time.Even though I ultimately knew the outcome of most of their fates, I still kept guessing as the movie progressed. The whole set-up with Charles Xavier and Erik Lansherr brought the whole friendship of them to the screen in the best way possible. They do amazing jobs as younger versions of their respective characters.The political side of the story was well chosen as a fitting suspenseful piece of history where to vastly different mindsets are fighting against each other like the Cold War was. And it was a nice touch making the different nationalities speak their native language.I think that every character gets enough development to make everyone both likable and more than just hollow shells. Seeing how they mature from these silly youngsters into the characters we know and love was both engaging and entertaining.The music was competently composed and added good tension to every scene to make it bigger and heavier on the feels. Good job everyone, you made an excellent prequel.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
The Croods," A pleasent surprise.
","I had a good time watching The Croods. It had fun, heart and and a good message to delight the whole family.Is it one of DreamWorks' best? No, but absolutely not one of their worst. The voice cast is solid as usual and the animation is colourful and filled with a wide range of characters equally so.The pacing is a little uneven and the movie begins rather slowly. The beginning when we meet our main characters might be the movie's weakest spot, because of all the clihéd characterizations. An overly protective father who forbids everyone to go out of the known and explore and his rebellious daughter who defies his orders and changes it all for the family.But as soon as they all get moving with the new acqaintance of the family, both the fun and the creativity of the movie kicks in. From that time on, you enter a rollercoaster ride of wonder and excitement right till the end.",8,1,1,4 August 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," Maybe not a Disney classic, but a hilarious original worth your time.
","The Emperor's New Groove is enjoyable with plenty of laughs provided mainly by our villainess, Yzma, and her dim-witted sidekick, Kronk. The comedy is also the movie's biggest strength along with its vocal cast. David Spade as emperor Kuzco gives this self-absorbed and bratty character a weird likability which is admirable. John Goodman as the peasant Pacha is pretty much your average John Goodman role, but he does that well. They are also good for some great laughs when they are together. As I mentioned at first, Yzma and Kronk are simply hilarious. I slapped my thigh several times watching them. Eartha Kid and Patrick Warburton both do excellent voice-work. Aside from the comedic proficiency I find it pretty average. The animation looks a lot like a Saturday afternoon show, but still better than the later 2D abomination of 'Home On The Range' (2004). The setting of the story is pretty original, but the story itself is kind of recycled, not bad, just an average 'egotistical-asshole- learns-how-to-be-nice-to-others' story. But what the hell. It works! The Emperor's New Groove is definitely worth your time.",8,1,2,1 November 2017
Monsters University," Good, but a little rushed at times
","I may be a little harsh on MU, but I have two major issues which bucked me after watching it. More on them later, let us start with the good stuff. MU took our favourite monsters, Sully and Mike, and added so much to them as characters. It was a pleasure watching them and their interactions at MU. Even Randall has had a different relation to them in their past. The general idea is interesting enough. At the same time, we are acquainted with new and well executed characters. Everything is well done so far. My two problems with MU are as follows: Firstly, when Mike and Sully's team enters the competition to prove themselves worthy of being at MU, we only get to see a couple of the challenges. The rest is just quickly showing us the crossing of finish lines or something. I would have liked to see more of that competion! The story was very rushed at that moment.Secondly, the climax when they accidentally get into the human world felt like it was just squeezed in. That just how it felt to me, a little unnecessary filler. And if adult screams are more effective than child screams, why weren't they using them in Monsters Inc.?I would be eternally grateful if Pixar some time in the future will make and actual sequel to Monsters Inc. The ending of Monsters Inc. made obvious to begin working on a sequel. Perhaps something with Boo being a teenager and meeting Sully and Mike again? Or something with Boo having children being scared by monsters? It would be great! But back to MU. It is an enjoyable watch, I just have a few problems which bug me.",7,0,0,11 August 2017
Toy Story 3," Just WOW! Explanation below...
","I am positively surprised in every way possible! Toy Story 3 is a spectacle of a movie to a spectacle of a franchise which has captured the hearts of millions of kids and adults from all over the world.In its (at the time of release) 15 year life span, Toy Story has done what most franchises fail at: 1. expanding its universe without getting repetetive or far-fetched.
2. Improving the animation
3. Showing an evolution in its characters (growing up, you can call it)
4. Adding new characters with depth and a purpose in the story. TS3 deals with yet another issue of being a kid which is inevitable, growing up! Andy is now going to college and must decide what to put his toys in the attic or throw them. They're accidentally thrown out and ends up in a daycare. From there they must find their way back. That's a great set-up, and TS3 is easily the most emotional and dramatic of all three movies. I admire how they managed to cram so much stuff into the movie without making it feel like filler. Seriously, there are plenty of good laughs in it. But it will not only have you laughing a lot, because what makes TS3 the most special is how dark it is! Perhaps that is not suitable for the youngest viewers, 'cause believe me there are some disturbing images and charaters among the lot. To avoid spoiling anything I will sum it up shortly to finish. Toy Story 3 is an amazing if a little dark addition to the franchise which leaves no stone unturned and no eyes dry when it comes to an end.",10,0,1,3 May 2018
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Really funny and at times touching.
","For a debut in animation, Fantastic Mr. Fox delivered more than expected. The voice cast was top-notch, the humour was sophisticated and the story quite unique. I don't know about the book it is based on, I only review it as a movie.Mr. Fox's longing for old times when he was on top of the game of stealing chickens really gets him and his fellow animal friends into trouble with the farmers who deal with it in a quite brutal way to be honest, but the execution of the story with the humour added makes the ride very enjoyable.The music was also very well composed and added much to the atmosphere of the rural setting and the different situations the main characters end up getting themselves into.I especially liked the subplot of Mr. Fox's son and nephew. That part was one of the major reasons this movie also has its heartfelt moments and an uplifting message about teamwork and that being is not a crime.Immensely enjoyable with an appeal to both kids and adults.",9,0,1,18 February 2019
X2: X-Men United," An amazing sequel.
","I recently watched the first X-Men movie and enjoyed it a lot, but I had never expected this sequel to be as good as it was.Everything had been turned up to eleven, the story, the performances, the tension between humas and mutants. It just worked perfectly.The X-Men are forced to join forces with their enemy Magneto to battle a tremendous threat to them all when William Stryker and his son kidnaps Charles Xavier to fulfill his diabolical scheme against all mutants in the entire world. During the chase we learn more about the origin of Wolverine without solving it completely, leaving room for future installments which is also quite obvious with the ending.Some of these settings are actually very eerie and atmospheric helped on by the power of most performances. One in particular is Christopher Lee as the imprisoned Magneto after his capture in the first movie, he just gave me the chills. Another highlight is Brian Cox and Michael Reid MacKay as William Stryker and his son Jason respectively. Stryker is just diabolical and Jason, even though he never utters a word, is powerful in his own right.Many good action scenes and effective moments of suspense, because you don't want it to end in tragedy for anyone. Not predictable like many superhero movies can be, but neither disorganized or messy. Just an enjoyable treat and a rare example of a sequel improving upon its predecessor.",10,0,0,12 June 2019
Cinderella," Beautiful animation and an intimidating villain.
","Cinderella is a classic Disney fairytale and has both the great villain who psychologically abuses our main character and the cute animal sidekicks to support our main character as seen in earlier classics. Lady Tremaine is one of my all time favorite villains in Disney's animated movies. Her calm and collected persona even when being a monster towards Cinderella makes her intimidating and believable. I often see her as an inspiration to my absolute favorite Disney villain, Claude Frollo from 'Hunchback...' (1996). They share a couple of traits. Eleanor Audley makes a brilliant develish voice for her. What did you expect from the voice of Maleficent? As fantastic as the Disney magic is, it also has its drawbacks. Cinderella herself is a passive female main character. I admit that she is an innocent, kind-hearted, hardworking maid, and that is a great contrast to the spoiled stepsisters and Lady Tremaine's abusive nature, but it stops their. She is supported by her little animal sidekicks and her fairy godmother and never does take matters into her own hands. It is justifiable as a product of the time and by the fact that it is a fairytale where everything magically comes true. The one thing I find lacking is the development of the prince. He barely says anything and that annoys me a bit. His father and his right hand man speak way too much and that could easily have been more balanced. Enough of my complaints. I think Cinderella is a great fairytale and I really like it. Go see it if you haven't already.",9,2,3,1 October 2017
Tarzan," A few adjustments could possibly make it perfect.
","Firstly, let me say that Tarzan is a wonderful piece of animation with CG-backgrounds blending in flawlessly behind 2D rendered characters. In some movies I CG-backgrounds ugly and unpleasant (Titan A.E. for instance). I like the action scenes and the soft moments, both do good jobs at catching the audience. The songs are memorable as well, probably the finest work of Phil Collins as a singer/songwriter. And now for my few adjustments. They should have scrapped Clayton as the villain and made Sabor the main villain. Sapora kills Tarzan's parents! And brutally battles Tarzan in one scene! I would have loved to see more of that. Perhaps that would have changed the story significantly, but I would still love to see it. Aside from that little thing I really like the final product",8,1,1,17 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The one story every later filmmaker takes inspiration from.
","I can't say anything new to this massive spectacle of a movie. Everything has already been said, but I can share my personal expirience with you and it was epic, grand, exciting and every positive adjective you could think of!For too long I had gone without watching the original Star Wars trilogy, because reasons unknown, but when I finally sat down and put it on so much felt familiar. Not in a bad way, because I see it like it has made such a huge impact on pop culture that everybody knows Darth Vader is and qoutes the movie's lines and so much more! I hadn't seen it as I said, but it still felt exciting watching every move they made and listening to the magnificent score by John Williams! The big reveal was still epic even though I knew it from people talking about it and saying the famous line.The story structure and the surprise reveal of something to completely change our hero's view on everything he thought he knew has been done so many times after The Empire Strikes Back wrecked theaters and became a phenomenon, so it definitely is the most impactful of all Star Wars films.Everyone tries to make a phenomenal movie, but only few ends up like The Empire Strikes Back!",10,1,2,18 January 2019
Minions," Harmless but also charmless.
","The first two Despicable Me films were charming and funny while the third one was trying to do too much with too many characters including the minions getting too much screen-time. And that's exactly what made their own movie subpar, they can be fun in small doses as background characters, but simply do not stand strong enough to be the main focus.I did not have any high expectations towards, because I thought to myself that I'd get exactly what the title promised me, a movie starring the minions doing funny stuff in different situations. But here's the thing, since the minions are supposed to be funny and disappointed in being exactly that, their solo movie ended up disapointing me.I guess if you absolutely love seeing the little yellow oddballs getting into trouble it'll be harmless, but everyone else will be disappointed. You have been warned, Minions does not posses the same heartfelt charm of the Despicable Me films.",5,0,0,25 August 2019
Aladdin," Great comedy, great songs, great villain, great movie
","I like this movie a lot, because it does something for a Disney animated classic, which still holds up: The comedy! Well, I have listed the great stuff in the headline, but let me just for a moment say about the comedic aspect of this movie. Casting Robin Williams as the Genie was brilliant. In many of the other classics fro Disney I have grown a little out of the comic sidekicks, but not the Genie! Moving on to the other stuff. Jafar is also a great villain with just the right amount of slimy arrogance to his voice and also a devilish sidekick of Gilbert Gottfried! Brilliant! The only issue I have is the Arabian and setting and Aladdin's dialog. He is a likable character, but once in a while his cool guy attitude is a little distracting, but it does not ruin the movie. You know the songs, they are just memorable and catchy. No more, no less. The visuals are also pretty amazing. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,6 August 2017
Incredibles 2," The most anticipated animated sequel succeeds for the most part.
","Incredibles 2 had enormous expectations to meet and a does a pretty good job, but lacks the last bit to make it another masterpiece. The animation, though, is noticably more detailed and increases the rush of adrenaline we'll get whenever the action kicks in.No doubts about my enjoyment watching this long awaited sequel, because I know of Brad Birds expertise. It had a whole lot of heart and humour put into it, but became rather predictable in terms of who the villain was. But Jack-Jack's antics while being with Bob at home was hilarious and pretty much stole the show.The whole villain thing is actually the only really noticable problem with the movie, because of the lack of originality or surprise in the identity. Let's just say that you can figure it out pretty quickly. Syndrome is also a hard one to compete with in terms of memorability.The movie manages to expand the world in which they live in and add some more of the superheroes we only got few glimpses of in the original. It was a nice addition, and who knows, maybe we'll get to see more of them in the future? In conclusion, it's a worthy sequel, despite a weak villain.",9,2,3,24 September 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Madagascar goes out with a bang.
","The Madagascar trilogy has been a weird expirience meaning that the first one wasn't actually that good while both of the two sequels were so much better.The second movie is probably still the best story, but Europe's Most Wanted steals the price as the most wildly energetic and absolutely crazy one of them which I mean in the best way possible. The first one was also kind of crazy, but came off as rather noisy while this is controlled insanity in my eyes.I mean that every new character has certain characteristics like these circus animals of different nationalities and personalities and some are more fleshed out than others, but the tiger has a nice character arc to follow. Oh, and that French police woman is just hysterical! No doubt the funniest part of the movie.And the animation here is just top notch with much vibrancy in the colours and swooping camera movements all over the place in the big circus acts and what else of these crazy chase scenes they embark on.Not as heartfelt as the second movie, and to be honest, I think that the Madagascar adventure could have ended there, but Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted wrapped it all up nicely and gave us a hell of an entertaining ride.",8,1,1,25 September 2019
Pocahontas," Definitely not their most exciting film.
","The biggest problem with Pocahontas is that it's boring and predictable. How they managed to make a movie about colonialization and racism so boring is a mystery to me. And you can predict every step the movie takes from the romance to clash of the two parts and what triggers it.The character development is one of the big sinners here, because the main characters and the villain are either boring or stupid. Mel Gibson's performance as John Smith just sounded monotonous and detached and his romance with equally dull Pocahontas just felt forced. And yet there are not very much more to them than that romance. But the way they ended it all was pretty well done. The villain was the generic money hungry white man. Ratcliff had some pretty cringe-worthy lines which made him sound really stupid. His singing voice is good, but the lyrics to his song-sequences are either just generic (Mine Mine Mine) or over simplified serious topic (Savages).The animation is a highlight along with the songs. Colours of the Wind is an amazing song and delivers the most magic in the movie and Gibson's singing voice in Mine, Mine, Mine isn't half bad. But that is surface level aspects of a movie, and if a story isn't very engaging or exciting it ends up lackluster.The list goes on, because aside from a couple of beautiful songs and eye-popping animation, Pocahontas has remarkable problems which makes it fall into the category of wasted potential.",5,2,4,16 February 2019
Back to the Future," The perfect time travel adventure.
","Back To The Future has not become a classic without reason. It's an engaging time travel adventure with high entertainment value without being gimmicky.The intereaction between the 1985 Marty McFly and the '55 environment is so well written with lots of wit and heart that you can't help guessing what will happen next and what consequences could happen. And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them. Seeing Marty's family and acquaintances in the past is also a whole lot of fun.Good music, a well written script, great performances, good pacing and an instant classic is secured to delight everyone.",10,0,0,23 June 2019
Shark Tale," Ugly and stupid.
","Where do I even start?Shark Tale is DreamWorks' lowpoint in quality in every category from the story being lazy and predictable to the characters being stereotypes and in the main character's case an unlikable jerk. And all those puns and pop culture references are just cringeworthy.The under water world was kind of creative at times, but not that special, but the character designs were horrible. I just stopped remembering their names, because these fish designs are modeled after their respective celebrity voicing him/her and it was distracting.I guess Shark Tales falls into the category of so bad it's enjoyable, but as a movie made to tell a story it sinks into the far depths of the sea.",3,0,0,9 May 2019
Princess Mononoke," Spectacular epic!
","Princess Mononoke is awesome! For a long I had wanted to watch this movie, but postponed it because of its long running time. The running time didn't affect the expirience the least! It just kept on bringing interesting and exciting creatures or spirits to the screen. The humans live separated from nature and that's the true conflict of the movie, because everything else is connected to that. Some people may call it preachy, but honestly guys, that's too low to be taken seriously. The animation and the building of the fantasy world are what makes this movie an tremendous epic! The landscapes are gorgeous and the power of nature is brought to life with breathtaking effects and animation. It kept my excitement up through the entire movie, and if you like fantastical elements and creatures taking up many gigantic battles this is a movie for that!",10,0,1,17 July 2018
The Wizard of Oz," Prime example of movie magic.
","The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies whose appeal to all ages hasn't withered away with time. The beautiful set-pieces, the loveable characters and their journey through the magical world of Oz is still as immersive and captivating as ever.Both our main character, Dorothy, and her wonderful friends in Oz are so brilliantly acted that you might call them the definitive version of their respective character. This may be a part of the reason why every attempt at a sequel or a re-imagining of the story either fails or gets a lukewarm reception, because with this movie held in such high praise, you have a lot to live up to.But I am one of the people who will defend the underrated Return to Oz (1985). Check it out if you haven't, because even though its tone is far darker it also did a magnificent job in the special effects department just like this timeless masterpiece.",10,2,3,26 August 2019
