Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Big & Bland & not worth seeing again
","What a disappointment this film was!   I watched this in New York the day it opened and within an hour or so you could feel the vibe in the audience go from excited anticipation to various shades of letdown.What's wrong with the film?  There's a lack of interesting characters and too much emphasis of special effects for one.  There's the eternally annoying Jar Jar and the bland plot.   Natalie Portman, a fine actress, is ice-cold and very unlikable as Queen Amibdala and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker gives no hint of what his character to suppose to eventually become.   He's just a kid who happens to be in a Star Wars film and it's not enough to have Yoda say he's got `anger in him.'   You would think George Lucas would have gotten someone who could act.  He brought nothing to the film. A few bright spots:  Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as the young Obi-Wan and Liam Nessson does a fine turn as a Jedi himself.  I wish more time had been spent developing them as characters.    Watching CGI effects like Watto is not interesting after a few minutes and neither are robots because they can't act.   And why didn't we see more of Samuel L. Jackson?!   Star Wars fans have been waiting for years to learn more about the Jedi but we see mostly droids, computer-created creatures and more droids.The only cool part of the film is watching Darth Maul and the fight scene at the end.   Too bad Jar Jar wasn't killed there.    I like George Lucas but he has limits as a director.  He seems more comfortable with special effects & robots than working with actors.  For example, it would have better to have Watto, the slave-owner played by an actor.   Wouldn't you rather have watched Christopher Walkin for instance as opposed to some flying green thing with a big nose?It's hard to believe that Lucas directed American Graffiti and its worth pointing out that he didn't direct the best Star Wars film, the Empire Strikes Back.    Hopefully, Attack of the Clones will focus more on human characters and plot.",Null,3,6,4 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Bores
","Something is really wrong when a video game has more interesting characters and a more intriguing storyline than a film version of the same setting. This actually happened last year when a Star Wars game called, 'Knights of the Old Republic' was released for the Xbox.I recently rented the DVD version of 'Attack of the Clones' and I was surprised at how bored I was watching this film again. I saw it in the theater when it was first released and I thought it was just OK back then. It was better than the very disappointing 'Phantom Menace' but not by much.It seems like most people here have the same thoughts that I do: There is too much focus on special effects, the dialog is awful and the plot is boring.There are a few bright spots: Seeing Jango Fett was cool and so are the Clone troopersbut the characters in this film have all the depth of paper.What is with the plot here? Why should we be concerned? So some planets want to break away from a large, bureaucratic Republic and want to be independent. Why is this bad? Why should we care? And apparently they want free trade too. Oh, no! This is not an intriguing plot for a Star Wars film.George Lucas does not seem to have a feel for character or plot development nor does he seem to know how to direct his actors. There is no real chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen and their love story is awkward to watch. In addition, there is no suggestion of the friendship between young Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi that Ben Kenobi spoke of in the first Star Wars film in 1977.Sadly, Lucas seems to think that special effects alone are enough to tell a story.Lucas could have given 'Attack of the Clones' a great start and set a new tone with the death of Jar Jar. Can you imagine the applause that scene would have generated? But no, Lucas brings back this worthless and annoying CGI thing back. At least with the DVD, I was able to fast forward those parts. All in all, 'Attack of the Clones' is strike two for Lucas.I am not optimistic about the next Star Wars film, 'Revenge of the Sith'.",Null,22,45,7 October 2004
The Village," Disappointing but I think I'll see it again.
","I have enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's films and he is one of the very few Directors today whose films I'll watch based on his name alone.SPOILERS HERE: I decided not to read any reviews before seeing the Village last night.   I had expected to see a horror/thriller film about creatures in the woods threatening the people living in a small village in the 1890s.   I thought this was a good premise for a film and it's the kind of story I like.I'm disappointed because `The Village' turned out to be something very different.  The fact that they were NO creatures at all really disheartened me.    And then the film becomes some sort of social commentary of the perils of modern day life.The use of the actors here is odd.  I thought Joaquin Phoenix was going to be a central character to follow throughout the film but he is only seen in the first half.   The William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver roles could have been played by anyonethey really didn't come alive for me in the story. Bryce Dallas Howard however, is really special in this film. 
I am somewhat confused as to what Adrien Brody's character was supposed to be about.  I felt that his actions happened without any specific purpose with regard to the plot.  It is never explained why he tries to kill Lucius or chases Ivy.  Given what happens at the end, I found it very difficult to believe that a man would send his blind daughter out to the woods to fetch some medicine from a world she has no knowledge of.   Especially when Hurt's character simply could have done the job himself and created fewer problems for his friends and family.  This is a very weak plot element in the story.   
Also towards the end of the film, when Ivy is being pursued by the `creature' I was wondering why this scene was shot in broad daylight.   It looked like she was being chased by a guy in a chicken outfit wearing a robe.  You could clearly see this was a man in a costume.   Had Shyamalan filmed this at night, it would have been much more effective.  I'm amazed that he made this oversight.  The Village is a complex film and Shyamalan is certainly being ambitious with this one.   I think I will see it again to give it a second chance. Maybe I'll feel differently.   There are SO FEW good films coming out of Hollywood these days that even Shyamalan's worst films are going to be far better than your typical movie today.The Village is not a bad film.  It's interesting with some good spooky moments but I had hoped for a different kind of film.",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Titanic," LA Confidential was the best film of 1997
","Some day there will be commission of people consisting of film critics, movie fans, and of people with good taste & intelligence.  They will investigate the crime that was 'Titanic' winning the Oscar for best picture for 1997.   It was bad enough that Titanic won anything at all but for it to be named Best Picture over LA Confidential (or any other good film that came out in 1997) is a crime against anyone who values well-acted, intelligent and well-crafted films. Titanic is basically an overblown soap opera featuring a man-boy hero (Leo DiCaprio), a cartoonish bad-guy (Zane), and an inaccurate portrayal of life in 1912 and of events that took place that terrible night.    Women in those days did not flip the bird.  No Titanic officers or crewmen killed anyone or committed suicide with a gun. What is worst is that Titanic is simply a banal film.  Yes, it has very impressive special effects and looks quite real but it's boring to sit through it a second or third viewing.  It has no more depth than an episode of BayWatch.",Null,2,3,1 December 2001
Signs," One of this year's best films!
","'Signs' is one of this year's best films.  I saw it on its opening night and everyone in the packed theater seemed to have enjoyed 'Signs'.   This may be the year's best film. I am truly amazed at some of the negative comments posted here on the IMDB site.  The only reason I can think of why someone may not like this film is that audiences have been so bombarded and saturated with bad films & special effects is that some people can't tell when they see something of quality.`Signs' is a well-crafted film with tension, plot, mystery, and good amount of humor which I didn't expect but was welcomed.  `Signs' also has characters you care about and makes you think about the unknown and the role of faith in our lives.   Can you think of ANY film that has come out this year that you can describe this way?One reason `Signs' works so well is that M. Night Shyamalan knows as much about what NOT to show as to what should be seen.  To make a film that is truly scary or tense, the suggestion of what is out there is often much more effective than revealing all the details.  Yes, this film involves aliens but the worst thing Shyamalan could have done here would be to have shown lots of scenes showing alien spacecraft and aliens chasing after people etc. Go see the idiotic 'Independence Day' or 'Men In Black 2' if that's what you want.  You won't have to strain a single brain cell to watch those flicks.     That's not what 'Signs' is about and some people who saw `Signs' are probably just confused as to why they didn't see special-effects in every scene.  `Signs' requires you to follow what going on in the story unlike your typical big-budgeted Hollywood special effects show which only requires that you buy a ticket and watch the screen with satisfied numbness.     
People who appreciate intelligent films are thankful that M. Night Shyamalan is making films and we look forward to his next one.",Null,0,1,3 August 2002
