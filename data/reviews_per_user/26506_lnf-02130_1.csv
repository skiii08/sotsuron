Hereditary," Was almost great, spare the cheesy 'jump' scenes
","It was a good story, I wish they would have worked the psychological aspect more than the classic 'gotcha' horror. Toward the end it got a little cheesy but the story carried to the end. I personally am not scared of gore or those 'jump' scenes and find them pathetic, this could have been a solid horror film if the characters were developed a little more. It would probably have been an amazing miniseries as well. However, we saw the attic, it was a wood house, if a person was engulfed in flames, how did the rest of the house not burn?",7,0,6,13 June 2018
