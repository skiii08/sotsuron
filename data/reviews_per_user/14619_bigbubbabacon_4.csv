Spartacus," Doesn't feel, or look, like a Kubrick movie. ie, it's not very good.
","It's not good...it's just not good. The plot is a giant mess, the lighting is, to say the least, inconsistent, and the acting, oh boy. Yeessh.Apparently though, we have this movie to thank for the control-freak Stanley Kubrick that is now the stuff of legends. But that's what happens when you make a director like Kubrick mad, he sets out to gain complete artistic control over his projects.So, the movie itself gets one star, but, because it helped to bring about control-freak-Kubrick it gets another two stars. Therefore: 3 stars.",3,10,20,3 October 2010
Aliens," Practically destroys every thing intelligent about Alien.
","Alien is a brilliant film. The atmosphere, acting, direction, and story progression are near perfect. Aliens, however, is the near opposite. The movie is one absurd action scene after another; which culminates in Sigourney Weaver's character, Ripley, fighting a giant alien while operating a mech suit. The entire movie was just ignorant.But, as bad as everything was, there was one thing, one thing, that really, really made me mad: Aliens seems to disregard everything we learn about the 'monster' in Alien. In Alien, there was no way to stop the thing, it was a tank, and if you got within a few feet of it, you were probably going to die. Not in Aliens though. In this movie the creatures (now dubbed Xenomorphs) are mowed down like deer. That's not the creature I remember. I remember that thing being unstoppable.Overall, all James Cameron accomplished with this flick is to make me respect Alien, more than I already did. I love Alien. I wish Aliens had remained in Jim's brain though, along with Avatar.",2,63,126,30 September 2010
Grave of the Fireflies," A well crafted film that lacks anything resembling hope.
","I have this belief that there are certain 'rules' movies are suppose to follow. One of those 'rules' is the build and release of emotion. It goes back to Hitchcock talking about a bomb being hidden under a desk: We show two people talking while cutting to short shots of the bomb. This builds emotion.But, the bomb can't go off. If the bomb goes off there isn't a release - just an explosion. All of that tension stays built up inside of you.That's my problem with this movie, no matter how gut-wrenching, sad or even realistic it is, it has a fatal flaw. The audience, in my opinion, is never given a moment to release the tension - just an explosion.This movie, following Hitchcock's example, is a series of tension building moments, followed by small, quiet, extremely depressing explosions.But, maybe the intent of the movie was to build emotion/tension and not release it. Maybe that was the point.",6,1,12,6 August 2010
Inception," Christopher Nolan is NOT Stanely Kubrick. He's Christopher Nolan.
","There are quite a films in theaters that you can go see right now. But Inception is the only one that you need to see.Inception is a brilliant piece of film-making. It shows Nolan's ability to handle multi-layered subjects without losing control of himself or the film. The story is told in a whirlwind, nonstop manner but without sacrificing intelligence for all of the flair and style. You will be on the edge of your seat from the word go and you will remain there long after the movie is over.At the time of writing it is 11:15 at night. My showing of the movie ended at 9:28. I'm still thinking about this film. In fact, the only other film that has ever stuck with me like this was also directed by Christopher Nolan: The Prestige. The Prestige, in fact, is my favorite movie of all time.Or it was. Inception tops it in every way. Where The Prestige is slow and methodical, Inception is a lightening joyride for the senses (including the intellect). Where The Prestige ties up in a nice little bow, Inception leaves you with things to wonder about. Where some people claimed The Prestige seemed to break its own rules, Inception does not.Christopher Nolan has, in the past, been compared to Stanley Kubrick. That's wrong. Christopher Nolan is Christopher Nolan, and he keeps consistently proving that fact.He is the most talented director working in the industry today. Period.",10,3,7,17 July 2010
