Vertigo," On the one hand...on the other hand...
","Well, I guess my comments would come somewhere in the middle.  Yes, it was brilliantly photographed, scored, and acted.  But that ending...am I the only one who felt cheated? After all this buildup, she trips and falls, and Stewart looks down, The End, run the credits....the only think I could think of at that ending was:  'duh....Ooops!'",Null,1,2,3 January 2000
The Fifth Element," El Stinko...but who WAS that soprano?
","Everyone who comments favorably on this film seems to be of the school that says SFX + color + action + weird, offbeat ideas + supercool protagonist + sexy love interest = great movie.  Sorry, it just doesn't work that way, not even in this post-Tarantino era.  A great movie is always more than the sum of its parts.  This one, despite getting an 'A' for effort, just doesn't make the cut.  The direction is too frenetic and frantic. The director seemed afraid to take his time and establish a rhythm.  The result is a jumble of images that do little more than jangle the nerves. The one exception was the counterpoint of the fight vs. the singing diva sequence. (Borrowed, of course, from The Godfather and countless other movies).  And just who was behind that incredible voice?  Why have we not heard more of her?",5,4,6,20 November 1998
The Exorcist," I guess you had to be there....
","I've read most of the comments on this film, and I am struck by the extreme polarization of views.  While the majority think it was the best horror movie ever made (and I quite agree), a large percentage found it boring and even funny.  This strikes me as especially interesting because...THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO.  Most people were genuinely terrified, but a lot of people LAUGHED at it.First of all, this deserves the title of classic for the same reason King Kong (1933) is a classic:  Nothing even remotely like it had been done before. Even those people who weren't scared by it, have to acknowledge that fact. Laugh all you want at the cheesiness of King Kong today, but rest assured women really DID faint at its premiere. Same with The Exorcist. Second, the film especially terrified those of us who had a Catholic upbringing.  Blatty was able to reach into the deepest recesses of our fears, and pull out the....for want of a better word, 'gothicness' of the Roman faith and shove it in our faces.  Third, the Exorcist terrified on a completely different level than most other horror films.  You can sleep tight KNOWING that  Freddy Krueger is a Hollywood invention, along with Jason, etc.  Do you know the devil isn't real?  Today I am an atheist, and don't believe in the devil, yet I can still appreciate what the director was hinting at, and what buttons he was trying to push.I  challenge anyone to name a more viscerally terrifying movie than the Exorcist.",9,0,0,13 April 1999
There's Something About Mary," There's Something Wrong With Our Taste...
","Yeah, OK, some scenes were funny. But not $100 million worth of funny.  And I'm sorry, but pain is not funny.  Handicaps are not funny.  Retardation is not funny.But then, I'm one of those 'out of touch' 40-year-olds.",6,0,0,19 April 1999
Pulp Fiction," Am I blind?
","You know that series of ads for Blockbuster Video featuring the oh-so-artsy film student that is really quite superficial and pseudo-intelligent? That's what everyone who sees greatness in Quentin Tarantino reminds me of. Come on, people, there are certain rules for movie-making that are indelible. You can't get by forever writing the script on the same day of shooting while hung over.  Maybe I'm the blind man in the world of the sighted....or just maybe Tarantino has you all fooled, like Peter Sellers in 'Being There.'",Null,1,2,19 October 1998
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A for Effort, C for Execution.
","I really wanted to like this movie. The amount of effort, painstaking attention to detail, and creation of a gothic atmosphere, were all herculean.  But something - and I can't really put my finger on exactly what - something just didn't click.  It didn't work.  Whatever magic wand Coppola waved over the Godfather to make it -click-, didn't make an appearance in this film.  I'd recommend it as a study in the fine art of filmmaking, from a crafter's point of view, and yet at the same time, I don't think I'll buy the video for my collection.",Null,0,1,19 October 1998
Sherlock Holmes," Couldn't Understand Robert Downey
","Note to Hollywood film directors: You can pour 100 million dollars into a movie; you can hire top-name actors; you can splash it up with dazzling special effects; you can do product tie-ins and other state-of-the-art promotion; you can put up eye-catching billboards, and sell merchandise in Happy Meals...it won't make a damn bit of difference if NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ACTORS ARE SAYING.Maybe it's just me, maybe my ears are going, but I couldn't understand a word of Robert Downey Jr.'s dialogue. It sounded like he was trying so hard to pull off an authentic British accent that he was afraid to speak up for fear of unmasking his deficiency (what little I did hear sounded fairly authentic, so he needn't have worried). Regardless, I could hear Jude Law and everyone else just fine, so I'm pretty sure it's not my ears.In this day and age of instant digital filming, when they don't have to wait for the rushes to come back to review the day's filming, why don't directors make an extra effort to listen to the scene they've just shot and make sure the dialogue can be heard? The worst offender in this regard is Soderbergh, he seems to be trying so hard for 'natural' dialogue (people mumbling, talking over each other, disdaining any hint of exposition, etc.) that it makes otherwise good films a real slog. It should not take an EFFORT to enjoy a movie.Please tell me I'm not alone in this.In any case, I didn't rate this film because I shut it off halfway through and sent it back to Blockbuster. Too bad, it looked like a good movie otherwise.",Null,0,1,12 November 2010
The Wizard of Oz," Why Isn't This In The Top Five?
","I've just watched 'The Wizard of Oz' for what has to be the 400th time. Of course I watched it every year as a kid when it came on TV (usually in the spring, usually on CBS), and of course it was always a family favorite. But now when I watch it, I try to view it through my 'film buff glasses,' trying to see how it compares with other films of its day.  I'm attempting to put sentimentality aside and view it critically from all angles.  Sorry to say, either I'm a 'failure' as a film buff, or this is certainly one of the top five movies ever made.First off, the special effects, set design, costumes, art direction and overall cinematography are absolutely astounding.  The creative energies that went into the look and feel of the movie are beyond comparison, even dwarfing most of today's productions. Just watch the Munchkinland scene and ask yourself how long it took just to design the costumes.  Sure, they're over-the-top and frilly...this is a FANTASY! The use of color is spectacular, considering this was the first Technicolor movie ever made.
The set design compares favorably with some of today's blockbusters - check out the scene on the top parapet of the Witch's Castle, for instance, when Dorothy and Company are trapped by the witch's guards.  Compare it to scenes in the Star Wars trilogy that take place in gigantic locales like the Death Star, looking down over impossibly huge constructs.It's been said here that the acting was overdone, and again I say, this is a fantasy film.  How can you overdo a talking, dancing scarecrow? And if Bert Lahr hadn't overacted as the Lion, would we have had as much fun?(That word 'fun' is the keyword here.  Film buffs of the world, take off your snooty little librarian glasses and join in with the rest of us - have some FUN watching a movie for once!)Even some of the stunts were amazing.  The Tin Man falling to the ground after being picked up by a 'spook' - that had to hurt!  And the Cowardly Lion's dive out the window would make Greg Louganis jealous.And of course, there's the music.  Every song in the right place at the right time, and every one a classic, with gorgeous orchestrations and arrangements.It's been said here that the acting was overdone, and again I say, this is a fantasy film.  How can you overdo a talking, dancing scarecrow? And if Bert Lahr hadn't overacted as the Lion, would we have had as much fun?That word 'fun' is the keyword here.  Fellow film buffs, follow my lead, take off your snooty little librarian glasses and join in with the rest of the world - have some FUN watching a movie for once!I've watched 'Citizen Kane' a few times now, and I acknowledge it's greatness, but I don't see how it comes anywhere near this timeless gem. 'Gone With The Wind'?  Sorry, can't get through it, it bores the crap out of me. So I believe it's time to rethink that list.  Mine now goes:1) The Godfather I & II (easier if you consider it one movie in two parts)2) 2001: A Space Odyssey 3) The Wizard of Oz <-- 4) Ben-Hur (shutup, it's my list!) 5) Casablanca",10,1,2,6 July 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Come on, it was BETTER than 'Fargo.'
","I guess I'll be different, and say that I don't usually like Coen Brothers movies, but I liked this one.  Maybe it's the amount of hype a movie receives, both pre- and post-release, that influences me.  This was a kind of word-of-mouth sleeper, most of which I find delightful.  'Fargo,' on the other hand, is continually held out as 'one of the great classics of all time,' but I found it absolutely pointless and unfunny.  Both movies seem to rely on quirky characters, yet the quirkiness works well in this one - you care what happens to these yutzes.  The various story lines gel at the end, and you realize you've seen an adventure with all the classic elements of great storytelling - a beginning, a middle, and an end that justifies it all.  The music is appropriately 'old-timey' and darn good (did someone here complain that it had no 'mainstream appeal'??  Did you want the gravediggers to break out into a hip-hop number or something??) Just one other thing...did anyone notice the similarity between George Clooney's 'Ulysses' and John Ratzenberger's 'Cliff Claven'?",8,2,3,7 February 2003
