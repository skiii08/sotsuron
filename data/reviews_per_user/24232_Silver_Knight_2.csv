The Incredible Hulk," Miscast and formulaic
","A lazy, formulaic mess of a superhero film. It's not a patch on 'Iron Man' which was Marvel's first 'in house' production, and it suffers terribly when compared to that offering. When the standout sequence is a rehash of the rooftop scene already done (and to much better effect) in Bourne Ultimatum you know you're in trouble. Ed Norton is, unfortunately, totally miscast in this take on Bruce Banner. He's far too bland to command leading man status. The action scenes are tired and lifeless, with poor fire FX and some terrible 'eye line' work on the CGI. Only the end scene fight between The Hulk and The Abomination look vaguely convincing. And it's the sort of fight scene that we've seen endless times before in other, better superhero movies.",5,2,5,19 September 2008
Wanted," pretty damn cool
","Wanted is based on a controversial comic of the same name written by Mark Millar. It will be hard to believe for those that see the movie without having read the comic book, but the film is actually toned down. 'The Fraternity' has their own code of ethics. They are doing what they feel is right and are unconcerned with and unapologetic for any collateral damage. They train Wesley in the ways of their world: special baths that accelerate healing, the power to slow down their perception of time (thereby increasing their own reaction time) and the ability to bend the trajectory of bullets.And let's be honest, it looks pretty damn cool. Tooling around Chicago in Dodge Viper, killing bad guys and using Angelina Jolie to make your ex-girlfriend jealous makes for a fun Friday night in my book.",10,4,16,19 September 2008
