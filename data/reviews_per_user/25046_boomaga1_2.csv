The Longest Yard," Buy the soundtrack and a big mac
","I'm a white guy. Saw this movie in theater where the entire crowd (full house) was nearly all black. So I'm watching this movie, realizing that every single white character on screen (with exception to a charisma-free Sandler) is utterly terrible: one-note, shallow, flat, weird/creepy, etc. (oh yeah, the former governor of Minnesota, too, but as he's wearing an 'X' jersey, I suppose a self-deprecating reference to the XFL debacle, he fits in the last category). And all Texans are racist and sadistic, by nature of being Texan. Okay, well, I don't know many Texans, maybe MTV does. But I'm not just getting my liberal-white-guilt dander up: this movie REALLY is racist, and very violent - I mean, not just football rough-and-tumble, but I mean just taking grim pleasure in punching and kicking, in very personal 'gangsta beat-down' kinda ways. Everybody loves to see a prisoner get punched in the stomach with a truncheon, repeatedly, with a sound effect like a giant slab of meat splatting on a marble floor - but after four or five dozen times it loses its dramatic impact. The race baiting is really so deliberate, it's insulting: the filmmakers could defend themselves by claiming that the one scene where 'n*****' is used as the worst possible fly-off-the-handle taunt (and practically right INTO the camera, repeatedly) is an indictment of racism. It's not at all; it's re-enforcing stereotypes and reactions, re-enforcing subservience vs. dominance roles, re-enforcing grinning complicity vs. dignity, as well as just being the basest kind of audience manipulation. Oh, the movie CONDEMNS racism on the surface, sure - and thank God, because I don't think enough people knew that racism was bad. And it IS a prison movie - so naturally, every black person you see in the movie is a criminal. What's funny is that no crimes happen in the movie - a little harmless B&E, a little sabotage, but the only violence perpetrated by anyone in the movie is by the white drawling guards, and mostly upon Adam Sandler - and normally, that would be entertaining enough for me. To give the movie credit where credit is due: a bunch of great songs all the way through. What a sweet music supervision deal this movie must've been, for MTV, for Sony, for a bank of happy lawyers ! Oh yeah, another message of the movie: McDonalds is better than drugs or sex. Believe it ! What's their big popular sandwich, a something something with cheese ? Oh, they repeated the product name at least twenty times, how could I forget ?I like football movies cause I like football. Sometimes movie football is more drama than realism, and that's okay. This movie moved away from the realistic, and moved away from the drama as well. Football is a plot device, a tool, providing many soundtrack song placement opportunities. Oh yeah - this movie, in one of the opening bits, also shows how much fun driving while stinking drunk is - fun and ultimately harmless. Many cars get totalled, terrible wreckage, flying down the 101, then BOOM, our hero stumbles out drunk as hell, with maybe just a scratch on his head. But it's okay ! The wrecked cars are all cops, no one gets hurt, and it's all good fun. See, honey?, this is what grownups do to let off steam !Shame on Chris Rock for being in this turkey. For a comedian who's gotten so much mileage out of race stereotypes and sub-textual racism in society, he's not doing his beloved peoples any favors here - and he doesn't really do anything funny. One bright glimmer of hope for comedy: Tracy Morgan as a classic-flavor prison bitch. He plays it to the hilt, and makes it as funny as the boneheaded script would let him. Good for him.Shame on everyone else. There's a lot of them to be ashamed - all the way through the movie, I kept saying to myself, 'Damn, HE'S in this, too ? And there's THAT guy !'. Thanks, MTV power ! Now see if you can Premiere-plugin airbrush the age spots off of Courtney Cox's cleavage. I walked out of this movie during the last third, wandered around the theatre, dropped in on other movies. Came back just in time for an anticlimax that Bert Reynolds, I'm sure, had insisted upon in his contract - HE was going to get the big winning touchdown. Hoo. Ray.Oh, I see that Adam Sandler's production company is called 'Happy Madison' - Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, very clever. See, if I ever made just one crappy horrible sports/retarded flavored comedy after another, I'd want people to remember me for them, too.So what was up with that 'Punch Drunk Love' crap, anyway ? Who thought THAT was funny ?Seriously, I just have to come to the conclusion that the reason Adam Sandler did a great movie there was because of P.T. Anderson, because his talent is of a school-cafeteria-lunch table clown level.One great thing about this movie, too - good sound. A very good sounding mix on this movie. Good sound.",3,6,12,3 June 2005
Cold Mountain," The stars are the weak points
","'Cold Mountain' - a movie that you can watch.Script: tight, if you can mentally insert the 'Years later...' card between a few scene cuts, and I know you can. A few Oscar-bait monologues are clunky in that adapted-from-the-novel way... but that's just me, I like to be shown rather than told by a character what they're going through.Production design: convincing, believable, with that old movie-magic feeling of being a window into the way people lived oh so long ago and far away... (though when Kidman walks in front of it, the jarring incongruity jumps out that, despite her partial grime-over, there simply were no women as pretty as Nicole Kidman 140 years ago. Squinty-eyed pout-machine Zellweger looks more like Appalachian mountain breeding stock.) Cinematography: Amazing. Everything has the natural light look - absolutely absorbing. One of the most beautiful winter snow scenes ever filmed.Story: Good Guys good, Bad Guys bad... with their character conflict/resolutions built right in. A series of long, protracted tragedies you don't have to see comin' round the mountain when they come. But still, the familiar crudeness and cruelty of events have that original-source feel - when life was more of the hardscrabble scrape than the dreamworld we live in. Casting: Ahhhhh... this is where the movie both succeeds and fails. It's mostly inspired. Jude Law and Brendan Gleeson are very good... no, they're excellent. The character actors are all first-rate - I mean, you could SMELL the backwoods witch goat-lady. Jack White does a fine understated job, though I found it impossible to stop seeing Jack White and thinking how cool it was that Jack White was in this movie, and wondering if Jack White was really playing his instrument. (It couldn't have been more amazing if his character's name was 'Jack White' too - I mean, that even sounds like the name of a traveling mountain musician. Anyhow, the point is it kind of breaks the spell. )And Philip Seymore Hoffman is good in anything.But this movie belongs to Ray Winstone. His Confederate villain is more than just menacing. He's got the violence of battlefield madness in his quiet voice. (Can you believe he's British ? His Southern accent wasn't just convincing, it was FLAWLESS, something that even American-born Yankees can't manage.)I know villains never get For Your Consideration treatment - but this one should've instead offfffffffff..... (*drum roll*)ZELLWEGER-MANIA !She won award after award for this. People gushed about how great she was as the comic relief. Hm. I didn't find anything she said or did particularly comic. And I could spend a little while detailing why she shouldn't have all those awards. Cause Renée Zellweger stinks. Her accent is inconsistent and drawling - it's Appalachian mountain folk accent, Renée, not Savannah, not 'Bama, not Texas or Nawlinz... Study the dialect tapes, honey. Amazingly, she's up against British, Australian, and Irish lead actors, and yet her accent is the weakest. Maybe that's why she kept changing her mind about it as the movie progressed. (Do like Kidman does - pick one wrong accent, and stick with it.)Zellweger plays her character with three emotions - mad, madder, and wounded-&-mad. But it's not the bitter anger of a young woman whose life has already let her down and had to come up fighting - it's more like the pouting petulance of a teenager who spends most of the day brooding cause she's mad at her mom. She's so ADORABLE when she pouts ! Oh no, her pouting is out of control ! Ha ha, oh, Renée !How does Zellweger keep getting work ? Beats me. I wonder if her British affectation is any more convincing. Who would've been better in this role ? Oh, I could say something cruel like, 'Hold an open casting call and throw a rock.' But instead, let me ask who might have been a WORSE casting choice for Renée Zellweger's role. The answer springs immediately to mind: Winona Rider. An only slightly worse choice. Also, it seems Nicole Kidman is in the movie. 'Cold Mountain' may have originally been a vehicle for her. I like Kidman, and she's done good work elsewhere; it's just that this was just not a standout role for her. Next to the wailing klaxon horn of Zellweger's acting, Kidman seems merely to perform adequately. And again, it doesn't help that she's just too Hollywood-pretty for the part. Truthfully, both female leads could've been cast better. Because the other issue is that not for a MOMENT did I believe that Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters were attracted to each other. Sting, who used to be a rock and roll singer, wrote the theme song that uses the word 'ain' in the title, which just gives me Reason #98 to want to kick him in the *ss. But I can't fault the movie's music at all. Good score, great sound.So there you go. 'Cold Mountain.' A movie that you can watch.",7,0,4,6 November 2006
