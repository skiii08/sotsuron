Ford v Ferrari," Meaty Racing; Meaty Acting
","(Flash Review)All cinematic facets were hitting on all cylinders. Ferrari had been winning the 24 Hour of Le Man's race again and again and again. Enzo Ferrari rejected Ford's offer to merge companies which angered Henry Ford II and he decided to challenge Ferrari's Le Mans dominance by building a better racecar. Carrol Shelby was put in charge of building and designing the car and racing program with the help of Ken Miles as driver/engineer. Watch as they battle it out on track and in the garage. Can the American behemoth snatch victory from the innovative Ferrari? This film nailed the engine and racing sounds and had very good racing effects although I feel Rush was a bit better. Complimenting that with deep character emotions made for a well-rounded film. Christian Bale was dialed in as quirky and unrefined Ken Miles, which the film emotionally hinged around, and Damon was pure Matt Damon and able to tease out genuine feelings; enough that a tear was shed. Even the supporting characters had genuine emotional moments. All in all, this was top notch with a briskly paced story.",10,3,6,14 December 2019
The Lobster," Original and Peculiar
","(Flash Review)I watched it 90% because of the title alone (ha) and 10% the plot seemed original, which it most certainly was. In this world, people live in a society that dictates that you must be in a relationship at all times. Anyone 'found' to be without a mate, is bused to a hotel where you have 90 days to find a mate OR be turned into an animal.an animal of your choice at least. The staff at this hotel institute certain measure to facilitate the 'guests' to find mates. The film's tone is semi-dark and offbeat and all the color is heavily muted; lacking color saturation. There are some surreal moments and a fitting score while the story plays out at an methodical pace. The story tends to drag a little in act 2 but act 3 leaves many story points open ended with intrigue. The sub-message appears to hint at society's influence that people should strive for relationships/marriage and those who don't tend be treated as blacks sheep. Certainly worth a look for those seeking something anti- Transformers.",7,0,1,15 September 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Every Frame Is Striking
","(Flash Review)If this does not win an Oscar for Best Cinematography I'll be appalled. My eyes were tickled with glee throughout the impressive 2:45 runtime. This film was reminiscent of the original and honored the atmosphere, music score and the clean, minimal and captivating shot framing. It moved the core story points along 30 years in the future of what does it mean to be human, how emotions effect humanity and can beings that are 'made' truly feel human. The main objective of the film is for a more modern blade runner, named K, to track down Deckard, an older model for a crucial reason. Can or how will he achieve his objective? Much like the original the plot was slow to evolve which was OK for me as it left more than enough time to soak up the visuals and ponder the story. There were moments where the future technology reminded me of the film Her and Gosling's acting was right out of Drive. One quibble I had was I wish there was a bit more story detail to chew on or context of the future world we are presented with. A few times I was so swept up in the visual smorgasbord that I had to re-calibrate and think wait, where's the story going? Overall, it was an honorable sequel to a cult classic with meaty visuals and a deep yet sparse story.",10,1,9,2 November 2017
First Man," That's How You Chronicle A Life
","(Flash Review)The director doesn't treat us like infants needing to be spoon fed a bullet list of Neil Armstrong's life's achievements. Instead you ride co-pilot feeling, hearing and even smelling the rawness of the his piloting career in NASA's cutting edge technology as he and they shoot for the moon. While seamlessly blending in the sobering reality of his life as a husband and father, his career is not shown as glossy perfection but in brutal honesty which is brilliantly echoed by the cinematography, editing and production quality. The tense moments were also very tense for the viewer because you are sitting co-pilot or even in Neil's POV. This was great film making that avoided being another chronological checklist movie. Bravo!",10,1,4,11 July 2019
Changeling," Police Corruption
","(Flash Review)A mother loses her child and after a few weeks the police find a boy that isn't hers but heavily force her to accept that it is her child to avoid embarrassment to the police department. She tries to fight and prove their wrongdoing and the police fight back with extreme measures. Will the mother ever find her son and will the police ever admit their wrongdoing? This is based on a true story and is a very well-done period piece with great production value, good pacing and a compelling story. Jolie put forth a solid effort even though, it is hard for me to see past her Hollywood persona. Some nice shot framing mixed with some honest feeling scenes made for a quality picture.",8,2,3,30 August 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," More of the Same Antics
","(Flash Review)This neither exceeded nor was below my modest expectations. This time Jack Sparrow gets roped into helping locate the Fountain Of Youth by a woman from his past whom partially deceives him. The intimidating pirate Blackbeard also ends up in the mix to no surprise. They all go on the hunt for the fountain, cross paths with a flock of mermaids, of which they need to capture a single tear from one of them, when mixed into a special chalice will allow the fountain of youth to work as they hope. Overall, it is a stereotypical story with some low tension and amusing action scenes, occasional bad jokes, some swords clanking and Sparrow constantly fleeing his foes. No new ground is explored.",5,0,0,21 November 2018
The New World," Life, Love, Culture & Challenges in the 1600s
","(Flash Review)1609 is the year and three English ships find land. An insubordinate man, John Smith, gets taken by a Native American tribe and earns their trust and is kept alive to tell his English settlers they must leave at Spring. In the meantime, he finds love with the Indian chief's daughter, Pocahontas. Turns into a Romeo and Juliet situation where both groups remain adversarial. At this point the film contrasts the Native American honest and open and trusting society to that of the combative and distrusting English. Being a Terrence Malick directed film, the visuals and atmosphere are the primary communication vehicle and it does not apologize for that. Will Pocahontas and John Smith find a way to be together peacefully? Pocahontas does spend some time living in England and the film analyzes how she adapts to a new world. The beautiful visuals are accompanied by rising and falling hopeful instrumental music. Malick uses lots of handheld shots to accentuate the wide open lands to bring the viewer further into the films atmosphere. If you like Malick's style, you'll like this and if you don't like minimal dialog and sparse storytelling, this may not be for you. Through the DVD special features, I did learn that the film tried super hard to make the sets as true to period as possible and only used natural lighting.",8,1,1,14 December 2019
The Incredible Hulk," A Basic Hulk Movie
",(Flash Review)Bruce Banner is struggling to live with his Hulk condition and seeks out a cure to eradicate the Hulk. While at the same time the military tries to acquire that amazing power and Bruce sees the danger if the military steals the power. There are lots of cat & mouse chasing and Hulk battling the military scenes and later a faces off against a very powerful foe as the story slowly progresses. The story is rather unengaging with many characters that I just don't really care about. The Hulk shows the most genuine emotions surprisingly. This was an okay film with solid special effects but far from exhilarating.,6,0,0,21 March 2020
Lucky Number Slevin," Reeks of Hollywood
","(Flash Review)Not that Hollywood is always bad but this is super glossy, has big star power, has an overly engineered story and just feels trite. This movie has several twists, twists that cheat the audience as it doesn't really leave you any clues that you can trace back to earlier scenes; aside from the overarching plot arc which is abandoned for the majority of the movie. The granular twists come out of nowhere and you just have to go along with it, thus they weren't smartly interwoven into the script. And for a film with so many A-List actors, Hartnett is the main actor.Hartnett! and half the time he is wearing a towel and acting overly snarky. I'll give credit to the production crew and the cinematographer as the scenes looked bold and were visually striking however the pacing felt awkward. Overall, this tried to and succeeded in coming off cocky enough to think it outsmarted such classics as The Usual Suspects or SE7EN, for example, without giving you enough charm to care for any of the characters. In the end, I just cleared out some stale movie queue fodder which was only in their because the movie title was unique enough to stick with me from '06.",4,0,2,1 November 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," This Was Really Unexpected; In A Good Way
","(Flash Review)This film fires up real quick with a woman having a car accident and waking up in a compound built by a man (Goodman) to survive any type of worldwide or chemical attack. The woman seeing no evidence of an attack and being trapped in the compound looks to escape as the man retains a power position over her. Will she witness any proof of an attack and feel safe inside or will she keep trying to escape from the compound? Much of the story is a little cat and mouse, what is to be believed and is he telling the truth. As that develops and unless you have read detailed reviews, you'll never guess the final act to this, which was really fun and it worked for me. Kudos to believable originality.",8,0,0,13 September 2019
3:10 to Yuma," Exciting Remake With Warts
","(Flash Review)Based on the core story as the 1957 original, it tried to honor it on the 50 year anniversary. Again, a local rancher Dan, for the sum of $200, assists with escorting the dangerous and clever-minded Ben Wade to the 3:10 pm train to Yuma to go to trial for his years of robbing and murdering. Dan agreed to this as he is desperate for money to help save his ranch and his personal pride. Will Dan and his crew get Ben on that train? How many will survive this adventure as Ben's gang is hot on their tail? This movie had some very exciting action scenes, a nice constant tension formed the spine of the story and there were frequent morality jabs back and forth. There were also a few moments you questioned why a character did this or that like how a key charter took a bullet to the gut and was trotting on a horse again within hours without a grimace. So if you don't pick it apart too bad, it is a fine and entertaining movie. It was a high quality production with solid acting.",7,1,2,24 May 2018
War Dogs," Plot-Rich, Modern Fluffy Adventure
","(Flash Review)This was more plot-focused and less comedic-focused than I expected which wasn't a bad thing. Anticipating modern fluff, I didn't pick apart the plot to the nth degree which could easily be done. I just went along for the ride which was fairly entertaining. Solid acting, a rather engaging and detailed plot and a smattering of humorous bits. The story is 'loosely' based on a true story of a couple young guys taking advantage of a under-publicized Federal Government program to send small defense contracts to 'the little guys'. Selling arms and shipping them where needed. They get in over their head by bidding on a large contract which required more coordination and within the country of conflict. Will they be able to manage the contract? How will they manage to navigate international business in dangerous area? Fun and easy with a few smirks and better than average for the genre.",6,0,0,13 November 2017
Spartacus," Kubrick Directed; Not His Vision
","(Flash Review)The rise and fall of a strategic slave uprising lead by the famous Spartacus. This epic tale takes place in 73 B.C. where slaves are trained to fight as gladiators (training later used battling for their freedom) to the death for the shallow enjoyment of the upper class. The side story is how Stanley Kubrick was urgently hired to direct this picture and not truly tapped for his renowned creativity so he Kirk Douglas wrestled for final decisions. It is a high quality production with good acting, engrossing pacing and a believable romance with Varinia another person to be bought and sold. When she is sold away from Spartacus, it sparks him to lead a rebellion. Will he have the skills, the manpower and the strategy to take it to the might of Caesar's Rome?",7,1,2,14 December 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Countless Explosions & American Heroics
",(Flash Review)We all know the real story and this movie put you right in the thick 'oil' of it. The first half builds up the characters and their backstory so in the second half the movie can tug at your heartstrings as you watch them try to handle and survive the explosions and endless fires. Very good and realistic production and effects. It was really believable. The script was a little too narrowly focused. It is mainly about the worker's heroics and their escape. I would have liked to learn a bit more about why the drill failed. You get a little bit in a couple scenes but they could have added more time to flush that out more in my opinion. They also pitted BP vs the Deepwater crew as BP the cost-conscience big oil company vs the downhome American blokes. My understanding was BP was most at fault but Deepwater wasn't totally innocent of fault but this doesn't claim to be true to life so can't fault it too much. It was good and entertaining and emotional; an above average Hollywood blockbuster movie.,7,0,1,30 August 2017
Minority Report," Spielberg + Cruise = Dynamite
","(Flash Review)What's the best way to reduce the murder rates? Not more police. Not a better social system. But stopping murder before it occurs. This is possible due to three special women who are hooked up as they are able to see murders before they happen giving police time to stop it. This system is questioned on the grounds of is it justified to arrest people BEFORE they commit a crime? And how error-free is precrime, which is believed to be 100% accurate. Every so often the precogs disagree and generate a minority report. When a lead officer is accused of a precrime, will he be able to solve his own case before he commits the crime while eluding authorities? This has top tier creative future concepts, with an engaging story, slick cinematography and action sequences. Spielberg, Cruise and Hollywood at their best.",9,0,1,5 June 2020
Star Trek," Consistent Stream of Action and Effects
","(Flash Review)This review is from someone WITHOUT much classic Star Trek knowledge or experience; I know the characters but am far from a geek. I was highly entertained throughout this movie. The opening scene was visually stunning as well as emotional. No reason to go into the plot as many other have done in serious depth but this was at the same level as the 3rd pass at the Star Wars movies which makes sense as J.J. Abrams was the director. I was emotionally drawn in to the story, characters and the entertaining action. The one knock against it was, as this was a movie to explain the origin of the original characters, that objective felt accelerated especially for Captain Kirk. For someone who doesn't understand Star Trek Nuances, I was entertained and engrossed.",10,3,9,27 August 2019
Darkest Hour," The Chameleon Is Back
","(Flash Review)As a big Gary Oldman fan, I was excited to see him sink his teeth into the role of Winston Churchill. The film opens with the end of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's tenure and the beginning of Churchill's. He is thrust into navigating the political waters of negotiating peace or going to war with NAZI Germany as well as at home with appeasing or irritating various political parties, including his own. All this occurring during the month of May in 1940 and one of his core objectives to safely return over 300,000 British soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. The film is full of communicative shot framing, aggressive use of colors and to my surprise had some very funny moments. Kudos to the makeup team who convincingly morphed Oldman into Churchill. Overall, it focuses on real life moments while mixing in some fictional scenes for a dramatic touch and Oldman earned his Oscar win!",9,0,2,9 May 2018
Passengers," Conceptually Stranded on a Desert Island
","(Flash Review)As a spaceship with 5,000 passengers voyages from Earth to a new planet for habitation, a man's hibernation pod malfunctions and wakes him up with NINETY years remaining before arrival. Alone on this vastly elegant spaceship, he copes with being the only human awake. Facing a lifetime of solitariness with 4,999 other sleeping people, will his natural desire for companionship lead him to make a rash decision? What ramifications will result? Other questions, why would someone migrate from Earth and travel 120 years away to a new planet? Flush with modern and stylish sets and concepts, the core of the story is very raw with human's internal need and desire for company and companionship. It was a well-told story with a few questionable moments yet didn't detract from the heart of the engaging and fun story.",7,1,1,9 January 2020
Zootopia," Fun. Solid Story
","(Flash Review)In a world where all the animals live together in harmony there is still corruption at play. Much of the police force consists of the stereotypical big and strong animals. And here comes a little bunny, who is intelligent and crafty, who decides to join the force. Since she is small she is scoffed at and giving the task of meter-maid. She stumbles into something larger and important and the story gets even more exciting from then on. The simple storyline is even if you are small and viewed as less important, if you have courage, you can still have a large impact. One other 'parents storyline' is a satire on the political system and how it is corrupt. The animation is really good, the story is well edited and has many funny moments. The funniest parts are still the scenes from the trailers with the slow moving sloths.",9,11,17,30 August 2017
Au Revoir les Enfants," Overrated
","(Flash Review)This film takes place in 1944. The viewer is placed in a Catholic school in France where a mother has abruptly sent her Jewish son to go to school to avoid getting captured in Paris by the Nazi's. The film focuses very little on that heavy topic but primarily on the Jewish boy and the friendships he makes with a Christian boy who keeps his true identity a secret. There are endless scenes of boys being boys in school and doing their things, which is fine for character development which eventually builds up to a heavy emotional scene at the end. It was a good drama, nice little scenes but lacked intrigue. One of these films I heard tossed around a lot in discussions so I had to check it out.",5,3,10,23 June 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Just Me or is This Rather Brainless?
","(Flash Review)This was a bit of a letdown after the previous one with a weaker and thinner plot that hurt emotional engagement. I am far from a Star Trek guru but this felt more like a super hero story line. The Star Trek crew must stop evil powerful guy with an additional hurdle or two thrown at them. Complete with big CGI action and effects more to dazzle the eye than truly impact the story. Some head scratching moments didn't help such as from the start when the Enterprise emerges after being submerged under water for a significant amount of time and just flies off. That didn't ring true, even in their fictional world that a hyper-sonic spacecraft could do that. I hope the next one had a meatier plot and more memorable.",6,1,2,27 August 2019
The Other Boleyn Girl," Template For Rapid Family Implosion: Greed
","(Flash Review)It becomes painful watching bad decision after bad decision get made as a happy family chases greed and status. The King of England is tired of waiting for his wife to provide him with a male heir. This family with two daughters, strategizes a way to 'help' the King in hopes of gaining immeasurable wealth and increased family standing. The father maneuvers his eldest daughter, Anne, into the eyes of the King yet she is quickly overlooked by her sister, Mary, who is already married. The mother clearly disapproves this plan. As the family elders reach for more status, even the brother is set up to be married to a woman he does not like. Will this this strategy tear the family apart? Will Anne exact revenge on her sister? Will the Queen flex her muscles at the King's immoral actions? Lots of twisted drama and obvious life lessons to be learned. There are an abundance of shots with decorative fencing in the foreground and the movie lacks bold and bright colors; perhaps hinting at a fancy prison world? The cinematography was professionally done and the acting was solid. I couldn't believe this was a true story.",7,0,0,20 April 2019
Balls of Fury," Mixes Spying and Ping Pong: How Well Do You Think That'll Work?
",(Flash Review)This was a terrible mess. I counted and I laughed thrice. Not even a Christopher Walken character can save this. A washed up and slobby former ping pong talent with such a drab life he is doing Vegas style ping pong performances gets recruited by the FBI to go undercover in an Eastern country table tennis tournament to flush out a killer. He is set up with a Mr. Miyagi type coach and he faces some interesting opponents and implausibly gets cozy with an attractive gal as he gets ready for his mission. Will the FBI's plan work? Will the goofball make it through the tournament? Walken had some good moments and funny costumes but this was terribly written and often over-acted....even for a late night slapstick movie.,3,0,0,30 April 2020
The Irishman," The Quad Gang All Together For Gangster Goodness
","(Flash Review)Another high quality gangster film entered into this plump genre. It was a special delight to have Scorsese direct De Niro, Pacino and Pesci in the same film. The film revolves around De Niro who plays Sheeran, a labor union leader turned hitman and Pacino who plays Jimmy Hoffa whose lives were intertwined for many years. Primarily told in a series a long flashbacks, the film shows how the two men started and became linked in crime. It was more an introspective look at these aging gangsters and the choices they made in their lives. Clocking in at a beefy 3.5 hours, it had ample time to develop the characters and follow them through many events and prison stints. It had all the tried and true gangster film characteristics, told the story well yet failed to truly impact my emotions. There were very few memorable scenes or lines found in other notable gangster films. This was certainly very good yet it didn't exceed my lofty expectations and (speaking of Irishman) I actually enjoyed Kill the Irishman more despite the acting firepower in The Irishman. Ha",7,1,3,24 January 2020
Batman Returns," Cleverly Creative & Fun
","(Flash Review)This felt similar to me from the original Batman movie with Keaton, Nicholson and Basinger, which was great thanks to worlds only Tim Burton can create and the wonderful score only Danny Elfman can dream up. DeVito was stellar as the visually repugnant Penguin living in the gruesomeness of Gotham City's sewers. He is the core of this film as he tries to learn who his parents are and why he was discarded soon after birth as well as being respected by the city he lives underneath with a political scheme accompanied by Max Shreck (Walken). Additionally, we learn how Catwoman (Pfeiffer) comes to be and she later joins Penguin in attempting to foil and frame Batman. So lots of fun characters in a realistic-feeling world, free from much(?) CGI, giving this movie an honest and gritty atmosphere. Keaton is the best Batman in my opinion and his dialog, along with the others, have amusing double meanings at times. This is a well-written, directed, scored, acted and visually creative movie with fun energy and tension. A classic Hollywood success.",9,1,16,19 February 2018
Spotlight," Best Picture; Really?
","(Flash Review)OK so yes, this is an important and impactful story. No denying that. Does simply making a film about it warrant winning best picture? As I look at it from a cinematic angle, it is rather run of the mill and doesn't seem to take advantage or be inspired by the medium of film. Sure, the acting is solid but the film doesn't make following reporters covering the story or even the couple of in depth interviews feel very engrossing. Most of the drama comes from reporters arriving minutes after closing time and being frustrated. If the story really isn't visually dynamic then make the cinematography more intriguing to compliment certain plot points or emotional moments to make them more impactful. There is better cinematography on Law & Order. This is far from comparable to All the President's Men as many have compared it to. See it if you need to check off watching all the best picture winners.",5,2,5,24 August 2018
Insomnia," Endless Sun = Endlessly Awake
","(Flash Review)Pacino nails a great character study of an experienced detective on the verge of losing his reputation, integrity and mind. His character also finds himself in a game of outwitting the suspect he is attempting to capture played very well by Robin Williams. In perusing Williams, Pacino makes a couple decisions that Williams takes advantage of partially due to Pacino's lack of sleep during the endless light in Alaska of Summer. Will Pacino nab him in the end or let him slip through his fingers to protect himself from his bad decisions? This was a solid mystery/thriller with great acting and a nicely packaged story.",8,1,1,26 September 2017
Aquaman," Gallons of CGI
","(Flash Review)This is a visual smorgasbord of fantastic underwater places, people, creatures and action. What else would you expect? The story overview is Arthur Curry, who is born on land, discovers he is half human and half Atlanteean descent, which actually makes him heir to the throne of the kingdom of Atlantis. Neato! Bummer his mean half-brother Orm is currently ruling. So you guessed it, Arthur must discover his true purpose and ability while securing the throne. This was fun Hollywood action fluff with a decent story and oodles of 'mammouthly' majestic and spectacularly clichÃ© shots that came with such frequency it was a little bit corny and silly while mixing in intended dashes of humor. The water effects and accurate water physics were very well-done and spectacular yet a bit too glossy looking. Whatever, this is a popcorn movie so sit back and relax.",8,1,4,14 September 2019
Concussion," Didn't Hit Me Hard Enough For Any Brain Swelling
","(Flash Review)A very straight forward movie about the neuropathologist doctor who discovered CTE brain injuries in NFL players. He was drawn to this issue as several former players had died in very unusual ways without any obvious cause. CTE can only be found after a person has died. The movie was professionally executed and slapped the hand of the NFL and their hiding of their own true findings yet didn't really dig into that storyline. The story mainly followed the doctors' life and his research as well as the hurdles placed in his way as he was potentially damaging the NFL's reputation and revenue stream. I never really felt emotionally vested or concerned for any characters, even when there was cause for it, and nothing about the story was particularly noteworthy. Will Smith did a great job playing a character with a distinctive accent and after 5 minutes, he became that person. Safe and quality.",7,1,2,30 August 2017

That'll all change when he must battle the Sandman, Venom and Harry Obsourne who puts the moves on Mary-Jane. With his plate full, Peter begins to make bad and painfully awkward relationships decisions. The first half of the movie has a big focus on relationships and Harry avenging his father's death against Spider-man. Later, Peter ends up in a black costume that turns him cocky, full of himself and mean, which is a key problem for his Mary-Jane relationship. How will Peter and Spider-Man handles adversaries at all angles and not lose his girl? Overall, solid action scenes yet they felt squeezed into the second half.

Thor: Ragnarok," Perhaps...Best Super Hero Film I've Seen...Top 3?
","(Flash Review)And the most apropos usage of Led Zeppelin's 'The Immigrant Song' I've ever seen! I did have recently loooow super hero movie expectations after seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. First off, this was actually really funny with the right tone of humor for a big movie like this. Such as super heroes using their super powers used for insignificant and routine things. There were actually good excuses for super heroes to battle each other rather than a rumble at an airport. The best part was the plot was well-written and compelling. The special effects felt...well...special. Basically, the plot is that Thor discovers that he has an evil sister who claims the throne of Asgard. Thor has been imprisoned across the universe and must fight in a gladiator match to free himself; his opponent turns out to be the Incredible Hulk. Good action fight ensues. Thor needs to resolve that predicament and get back to Asgard to save his home. Very fun and entertaining action movie!",9,3,5,21 November 2018
Cloverfield," Effective Approach
","(Flash Review)A taught and modern spin on a classic monster invades a big city movie. The approach of appearing to be filmed with a handheld camera worked for me as it echoed the chaos. The chaos triggered by some huge monster ravaging Manhattan. The film starts at a condo party to introduce the characters and then abruptly turns into a survival film as the authorities try to protect the city and people. While the characters aren't really sympathetic, they do show concern for their close friends and the film with all the mayhem and tight editing is engrossing. And you have a turn a blind eye to the cameras battery life and durability but it didn't impact the movie for me as it is a monster movie! Not sure if this is a spoiler or not but the film owned the found footage approach by not revealing how this started or ended, you just get a snapshot of the attack from a few people's harrowing perspectives.",8,1,1,6 March 2020
The Hateful Eight," An Uninteresting Bloodbath
","(Flash Review)There was a lot of dialog in this which is usually a strong point for Tarantino films but here it dragged, especially with a hefty 3:07 run time. Sure a few interesting quips now and then but nothing close to or as slick and clever as the diner coffee scene in Reservoir Dogs. The story has a little timeline shifting as with his classic films yet not so clever story twists and turns in my opinion. Then throw in some fairly pointless chapter title cards. This of course being a Tarantino film, there is the expected Tarantino over the top bloody moments and cold blooded killing that were nasty gross at times. Part of what took me out of the film was the overly accurate sound effects that didn't feel authentic as well as scenes with rich details that also felt fake and obviously a stage. On to the plot: a stagecoach rumbles through a rural land during a winter in the Civil War era with a bounty hunter and his apprehended female bounty. He is taking her in for an old fashioned hangin'. Yet not everyone wants her dead. Will she get rescued and by whom? Who will end up with the upper hand? How many gallons of blood will Tarantino spill and splatter this time around? Overall, this should and could have been much better. Needed a better and smarter script.",3,3,6,17 November 2017
"I, Tonya"," A Satirical Look At Tonya and the Incident
","(Flash Review)This exceeded the hype for me. Spot on with its tone, this mixes dry humor and wit with realistic moments while completely pissing all over Tonya's mother. Arguably a 'mockumentary', it touches on Tonya as a child while the film primarily focuses on her mid-career through Lillehammer and ends with her boxing shenanigans. Overall, this was just fun film making; creating caricatures of everyone involved, clever editing, with character asides, well-paced, ample smarmy gags, colorful scenes and great acting. It didn't excuse Tonya's behavior but helped to better explain her personality by continually bashing her mom.",9,1,1,7 April 2018
Molly's Game," Crashed Into A Different Life
","(Flash Review)Molly crashed out of her freestyle skiing career and gets thrust into a life underground high stakes poker. Molly is intelligent, a quick study and is able to work her way from scheduling game times and players all the way up to persuading A-List actors, star athletes and wealthy men into the card game she establishes and runs. As she rakes in large sums a cash, she also makes a name for herself. A name the authorities will soon be keen to learn about. The story moved quick with an abundance of confidently articulated narration. The story moved between her current legal troubles and the past when she was running the card games. This certainly felt like a modern movie with a smart story without the overly styled rapid editing.",7,1,1,9 January 2020
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of the Best Chase Movies Ever
","(Flash Review)I had a chance to catch this in a theater and did. This was one of the first Westerns I had ever seen when I first saw it was the story gripped me for every frame. Butch and Sundance are bank robbers; brink and mortar banks or the train cars that haul the cash. They do this enough and the banks hire the best trackers to track them and they are off through great open plains scenery shots and tense adventures. This film has great dialog, acting, script, character development, scenery and chases. And believe it or not, I don't think there is any music aside from an old chap playing piano at a saloon. The modern equivalent of this endless chase reminds me of No Country For Old Men. Both are great films. This film and the ones with Clint Eastwood changed my perception of Westerns from negative to positive.",9,1,3,30 August 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man Learning The Ropes
","(Flash Review)This was OK and mildly entertaining but didn't leave a strong impression on me. Sure telling the tale of how a young Spider-Man learns his craft is part of the character's history and should be told but most of the movie was a clunky Spider-Man fumbling around, which was amusing, sort of funny and a change from the norm but it wasn't amazing by any means. For me, the boy tended to get a bit grating as he was a little whiny and the jokes were only of smirk level. I did not buy the love interest and their emotional connection as well as the school kids interactions as they all felt rather forced and fake. I also didn't believe the Washington DC special police force would not have heard of Spider-Man by now as they tried to halt his rescue progress on the Washington Monument. There were some neat action scenes, the acting was solid as well as a decent plot twist but thinking back on it, the plot twist wasn't very original. Fluffy fun but nothing more.",6,0,11,1 November 2017
Battleship Potemkin," Overall Film Better Than The Famous Scene
","(Flash Review)For its time, this film is an editing masterpiece. It was a pioneer in stitching together and juxtaposing different scenes to generate strong emotional tension. Many scenes have quick back and forth edits as well as some noticeable and challenging tracking shots which were novel for this era. That combined with a great music score and dynamic shot framing with rich blacks and whites also make this very appealing to the senses. The film jumps right into regular sailors, on Battleship Potemkin, who are angered by the poor living conditions and the rotting food they are forced to eat as the officers don't respect them. A large and dramatic scuffle/mutiny ensues after the captain's dramatic threat. A sailor is killed and word spreads to the local town of Odessa who are outraged and come in droves to the port where the ship is located. This being a true story, what happens next is truly shocking. What happens on the steps of Odessa? Aside from the technically significant and memorable sequence referenced in film textbooks and film classes, even by today's standards the pacing and drama is still engrossing.",8,0,2,8 October 2019
Taxi Driver," Solitude >> Descent into Madness >> Hero?
","(Flash Review)This film launched De Niro into stardom and for good reason. He gets into the psyche of a lonely and isolated man named Travis; a man clueless of many social norms. Yet he has an erratic moral compass. Travis is fed up with the filth that embodies much of the city he lives in and the uncouth population around him has overwhelmed his rickety mental state. When he does try to interact with a decent person he fails, which sends him into an even more precarious mental place. Deep down he means well and tries to do the right thing in his own 'special' way. What will he do and whose lives will he alter? The dark, gritty and gloomy 70s cinematography is complimented by unflinching and atmospheric music that envelops Travis in his despair. There is an important moment late in the film that can send Travis into two completely different directions. Interesting to ponder his fate after that moment as what was or could have been. This film has many memorable and parodied dialog bits and Travis's appearance late in the film is unforgettable. This is a somber character study where everything feels realistic.",9,1,2,27 August 2019
Doctor Strange," A Visual Feast
","(Flash Review)Venture along as neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange goes from serious car accident victim to a potential savior of the universe. Prepare to get your mind blown as reality folds in upon itself, conceptually and physically, as Strange crosses paths with unique and powerful characters who attempt to aid him or are his foe. There were so many meaty and mind blowing visuals that they were simply mesmerizing. To top it off, they complemented the story and weren't not just for fluff. While being a serious and weighty subject, there was an appropriate level of dry wit comedy mixed in as Strange is just a normal human. Some may see that as foolish cockiness. I didn't give it a full 10/10 as the story was a bit to expected or done before from the 10,000 feet level as I pretty much knew how it would end up. And several scenes could have been pulled from The Matrix.",9,0,0,1 November 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Someone Needs Anger Management
","(Flash Review)It is completely understandable to be angry, frustrated and restless when authorities are unable to apprehend the culprit who violated and murdered your daughter! Renting and posting messages on three billboards on an infrequently traveled road to spur action is a clever move. Many actions the mother does after that are...to put it lightly and not to spoil too much....highly inappropriate and dangerous. She basically calls out the chief of police who you learn early on is dying of cancer. His story arc is rather morbid and the mourning mother is not easy to root for or relate to. I feel this is an overrated film. The story bumbles about, there is an unrealistic and unnecessary amount of vulgarity, many call this a dark comedy yet I didn't crack a smile, certain plot points remain hanging and when the final frame rolled past, I was left unsatisfied. The acting was solid and there were a few nice shots but the story fell short and I failed to emotionally mesh with it.",4,1,4,9 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Satisfying As Always
","(Flash Review)This was pretty much what I expected. Some huge battles, characters learning more about themselves, illuminating family lineage, a couple new characters to sell new toys to children and a trip down memory lane. The special effects were great, there were many tense moments and I was genuinely concerned for Chewbacca for a while, the Emperor shows his true mammoth power and C-3PO was more involved than R2-D2 or BB-8. Even though it still had some flimsy dialog, I felt it wrapped up this current set of films nicely. I bet in 5-10 years, Disney will grow the story out more to rake in the billions and I'll throw in my $15-20 again and again. No reason to go into the story as oodles of people will do a better job than I.",10,3,19,5 February 2020
American Sniper," Soldier's Character Study
","(Flash Review)This story's focus is the man, Chris Kyle, less the Iraq war. Kyle becomes known on the battlefield and back home as a highly effective sniper amassing a record number of enemy kills. The movie follows his reason for enlisting, honing his skills and shows his effectiveness over a few tours. It also shows how he is mentally effected back at home with his family. The story feels like a bulleted list told very straightforward; not very creative. Bradley Cooper immerses himself in the role and becomes Kyle and does a great job portraying a wide range of emotional states. His performance is what keeps this movie from drowning as just another bland Iraq war movie. Complete with many expected emotional scenes to draw out audience emotions and true sad ending to the life of a awarded soldier. No mention of whether or not he actually punched Jessie Ventura at a bar. Ha.",6,0,14,18 May 2017
Lion," Gripping True Story
","(Flash Review)Imagine being lost, at age FIVE, in a different country that spoke a different language! This is about the true story of Saroo and his quest to return home. I won't say how he gets lost but that first act of the film is highly engrossing and emotional and the little boy actor is convincing, charismatic and adorable. The gritty cinematography helps drive the emotions of being lost and searching. This is a clever little boy as later on the film focuses on him as a young adult and how his intelligence has carried him far with an education and girlfriend. The final act focuses on his obsession to find where is from and of course to locate his family. All the acting and emotions are raw and honest with much told through expressions, body language and shot framing. The pacing was good for a film covering large spans of time. Overall, this is a tremendously told story.",10,0,1,1 November 2017
The Lost City of Z," Deep Into The Jungle; Shallow Story Content
","(Flash Reviews)What would you sacrifice to journey to find an unknown civilization? Wife, kids, friends, health? British explorer Percy Fawcett did put all those secondary to his long duration adventures into the depth of the Amazon in the 1920s. Much to the chagrin of his wife and kids as well as to the mockery of many of his fellow peers. Perhaps he was driven to succeed in reclaiming the social status of his family name that had been downgraded as well as his passion for adventure. While the movie had quality cinematography and stellar settings, it felt a bit choppy as time passed and many characters' emotions took 180 degree turns without any explanation aside from the passage of time. Seeing why specific feelings changed would have ratcheted up the drama and better tied together the various periods of time. Of course, the big question is will he discover a new civilization? What risks will he encounter and what will he risk in order to succeed? Overall, it was pretty good and entertaining but warts arise when you look more closely.",6,0,0,19 January 2018

He's rolling in dough, material possessions and fame. Suddenly, a surprising tragedy strikes and his life as he knows it is altered forever. The tragedy caught me off guard as if I was the one taking one to the jaw. Will Billy be able to claw his was back to his level of fame or will he be KO'd (couldn't resist) by the weight of the tragedy? Will he learn to be humble to learn what matters most in life? The story is told with strong emotions and dramatic scenes. The rise is rather predictable but felt fresh. Strong acting and quality cinematography help make this above average for the boxing genre.",8,1,1,1 November 2017
Ant-Man," Light, Easy & Silly
","(Flash Review)This time Marvel went small in concept and of course big with CGI effects. I was unaware that Ant-Man was a comic book character until this movie came out. The high level plot is a wise old scientist and his underling grapple with the moral uses of a shrinking suit and person technology. When the suit technology falls into the wrong hands, a seemingly regular Joe gets recruited to steal it back. Throw in a father-daughter relationship conundrum and the ubiquitous shout out to Iron Man (that guy seems to be referenced in all Marvel movies) and those are the shallow plot points that are the bases for the special effect. Effects that are really good. Lots of clever shrinkage scenarios around kids toys and other everyday happenings. Turn off your brain and watch this movie for the fun effects, light humor, silly tone and to see if Ant-Man will save the day.",6,0,1,1 November 2017
The Godfather: Part II," Pacino In The Thrown This Time
","(Flash Review)If a duration of 2:55 wasn't enough meat for you in Part I, Part II clocks in at an immense 3:22. This films tells the story Michael Corleone's upbringing in Sicily and into the 1950's as a Don in New York and his ambition to expand the family business into Vegas, Florida and Cuba. Much of this film revolves around family relationships and how hard it is to keep trust with various family members as well as others in his...line of work. It additionally portrays that the more power, respect or control Michael strives for the more he actually loses what matters most; trying to be vague there. That is the 10,000ft overview. This movie flows in from Part I and smoothly matches the tone and atmosphere and brutal violent moments. The absence of Brando is noticeable but of course Pacino has the chops to carry you through. It is a true epic.",8,0,1,31 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Go Along For The Ride
","(Flash Review)This was a thorough account of the rise of Freddy Mercury and Queen which culminates in their famous Live Aid performance. A couple bits are hurried and under developed but it does dive more into Freddy wrestling with who he is at his core. It highlights the origination of Queen's biggest hits and how Queen's sound evolved as they went. Also about Freddy's persona was as equally towering as the band's hit songs. Rami Malek became Freddy, gave a stellar performance and really carried the film. To top it off, won the Oscar for Best Actor. They did Queen justice so if you are a fan, you'll certainly enjoy this.",9,2,2,29 June 2019
Baby Driver," An Ill-advised Stir-fry Of Styles
","(Flash Review)This movie is hard to pin-point as I'm still unclear of what tone they were going after. There were some clever and stylish scenes and some really dumb scenes. Some scenes tried to be realistic while some would fit well within a superhero movie. I assume they hoped the audience would root for the protagonist yet they made some of his actions irritating. What is this peculiar movie about with its unusual title? It is about a young man named Baby and how he is forced to be a getaway driver for a powerful man he once tried to rob without knowing he was powerful in order to settle his debt with the man. After he pays off his debt, he thinks he'll be free but will get be granted a clean break for a normal life? This must be aimed at a younger audience aiming for a cult status as there is an assortment of unique music and all the car chases feel like Rally Cross racing. While the music tried to be a character in the movie, it was actually forgettable and not intertwined very well as for example Reservoir Dogs. There are many plot holes, questionable character decisions, under-developed characters, a fakey-forced romance and some over the top gore. Oh and if there is a definition of 'phoning in a performance' Kevin Spacey did just that. All that said, it is fun, dumb, fluff. All of which could and should have been better written, more impactful and memorable, which it wasn't.",5,1,3,31 January 2018
21," Run-O-The-Mill Gambling Movie
","(Flash Review)If this movie was at Arby's and about to order a meal deal, it wouldn't be quirky or clever enough to get the small size, nor would it be bold or brash enough to go large. It would select the medium option. This movie was full of clichÃ© moments and expected story arcs. The character development was done just professionally yet didn't go anywhere new. The rough plot is a brilliant kid doesn't have enough money to attend Harvard Medical School and rather easily gets persuaded to enter into a Blackjack card counting scheme as justification to help him pay his way. Will he earn enough before or if he gets caught? Who will end up being his hot romantic love interest and who or what will he overlook during his quest for money and thrills? Competent movie that brings nothing new and over-easily justifies various character's decisions.",4,0,0,30 November 2017

","(Flash Review)Would you lend a hand to your father after he has been imprisoned for doing something terrible to your mother? What would it take to forgive him? These are some of the questions raised in this film. The father's objective is made clear from the start as his son, a high school basketball phenom is being recruited by various colleges to commit to their school and he hasn't spoken to his father since he was a kid. The father must persuade him to play for a specific school to help reduce his prison sentence. The film is very well acted with a wide range of emotions displayed. Even by Ray Allen who is known more for draining buckets vs his acting prowess. There are some very smart edits, transitions and the music used is very original for an urban-centered film; it was scored by Aaron Copland!",8,0,1,25 July 2017
Trouble with the Curve," Cliché Yet Effective
","(Flash Review)Ten minutes into this movie, I was thinking oh boy, this is clunky, forced and simplistic. But as it progressed the character development began to take shape. Not stellar by any means, many characters were stereotypical and the scenes used to illustrate those traits werefunctional. The story was about a veteran baseball scout, think anti-Moneyball, who is matched up against a scout who only looks at statistics and whether or not a MLB team should draft a certain player #1 in the draft. The secondary storyline was the veteran scout's relationship with his daughter whom he gave sparse time to during her childhood. The story and dialog for the most part grew on me and as the father/daughter relationship began to take center stage it helped the movie. You also end up easily rooting for certain characters if you let yourself enjoy the film without picking apart the small details that aren't critical. Although, one did bug me. Where the daughter who apparently used to play baseball, was able to catch a top prospect's best fastball and curveball with ease. With that much time away from playing, those skills wouldn't immediately be finely honed. Anyway, fun sport drama with decent emotion and some cliché moments.",7,0,1,1 November 2017
Bridge of Spies," Professional; Lacks Emotional Grip
","(Flash Review)This movie's story is very linear and straightforward. The story objectives are clear as lawyer Hanks is tasked with negotiating an international exchange of a downed American pilot for a Russian spy while in Germany in the 1950's. Hanks must manage a few negotiation twists and read between the lines to keep and get leverage. The movie highlight must go to the sets and production crew. It looked and felt greatmuch like Munich. Hanks was quality as usual and the editing kept the pacing moving along at a nice clip. The best character was the Russian spy; tremendous performance. The movie could have somehow added more tension or emotion or to help me care for the character's outcomes. Overall, a very solid movie without causing much cognitive effort.",8,0,0,14 September 2017

This time the Terminator's mission (Arnold's mission) is to keep John Connor safe from the nuclear war of Judgement Day and alive from the female terminator.

At the 30 minute mark, I had to decide to turn it off or stick it out. I made the wrong decision and stuck it out. This is about two unsuccessful imbeciles who create a nifty driveway basketball game using baseball rules and it catches on and a pro league is hatched. Then a plot point about playing the game for fun vs money and fame. The rest of the slapstick movie is full of unfunny, vulgar, not clever, potty humor. Every character is irritating. The slapstick's of the 80s-90s (Airplane, UHF, Naked Gun, Top Secret) had more charm and 'smart' stupid humor; pleasantly silly. This was bottom barrel rubbish.",2,0,1,11 July 2019
Apocalypse Now," Surrealistic Perception of Nam
","(Flash Review)It would be overly-simplistic to call this film intense. It is visually and physiologically intense in the hands of a director who took bold chances and with top actors in the prime. While many describe this film as a surreal look at war, many others call it realistic as war can be that insane. Nevertheless, the Army assigns Captain Willard (Sheen) to make his way up the Nung River to locate and assassinate a highly intelligent and decorated officer Col. Kurtz. (Brando). The film is about the journey up stream and the bizarre, brutal, surreal and unexpected encounters that cross their path. Many unforgettable scenes yank emotion from the viewer accompanied by an effective and at times novel music score. The acting and screenplay are tremendous and this is a definitive epic not to be viewed on a whim.",10,2,2,7 November 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Cruise cheats death and defies age yet again
","(Flash Review)This is your high end, glossy, mega summer action flic. The plot is the bland baked potato to add on the glitzly thrills and action scenes. Thus as the plot fades from memory, when I saw it a couple weeks ago, what remains is that government is trying to close down Ethan and his team as they are too high risk. Of course they prove their worth through many wiz-bang scenes, special effects and some really good chase scenes. Of course Cruise finds his way, once again, onto a crotch rocket. A very fun and thrilling popcorn movie that will help Cruise shovel cash into his bank account.",7,0,0,26 September 2017
Dark City," An Old School Thinker
","(Flash Review)Is life meaningless or even....real....without one's true memories? Imagine if what you thought was reality constantly changed under your feet. This unusual tale is told in Terry Gilliam style with imaginative sets, characters and a compelling story that slowly reveals itself. The rough story is some otherworldly beings pause time to rearrange the physical city as pieced together from everyone's lives and memories in order to learn about humanity. Thus causing everyone to have faulty memories and confused and altered relationships. Occasionally, a few people become immune to the pausing of time. Will these people be able to end the endless shifting rubrics cube of life? What is intriguing about the style of this film that is while it appears to be a 40s Noir, the architecture and style are a tapestry of other styles and eras due to the rearranging of memories; the current reality is a visual mixture from different periods of people's lives. Really well done and mixing brilliant creativity with a substantial story.",9,2,2,29 June 2019
Dunkirk," Tight & Tense Evacuation Spot
","(Flash Review)Not a location I'd like to be stranded at that point in time. 338,226 men (including 123,000 French soldiers) needing to be evacuated from the shores at Dunkirk as the German had them encircled during WWII. The film chronicles their evacuation and the tense moments while waiting on the beach and the mole (a large dock). The film follows a few storylines. One is the perspective of British pilots, men waiting at the beach and the many civilian vessels sent to rescue the troops as large battleships were needed elsewhere. For me the main character was the Zimmer music score as it kept a mesmerizing atmosphere of the tension. While this was the opposite of Saving Private Ryan, as there was no true hero character, the visuals felt similar with saturated and muted color tones. The editing provided smooth transitions from scene to scene which helped hold the tense atmosphere. This was a solid war film yet there were a couple egregious continuity fouls such as one fighter plane that was able to glide around without fuel for a literally unbelievable amount of time while shooting down another enemy fighter to boot! As well as a couple questionable character decisions. Enjoyable nonetheless.",8,1,2,3 March 2018
The Machinist," Bale Beasts
","(Flash Review)What life events or conditions drives someone to insomnia? This film explores a man, who is an industrial machinist, and how insomnia effects his everyday life to the point of perceived delusion. There is second plot point that I'll leave as a surprise that is the crux of this film. The film feels small and well-focused with an atmosphere of cool steel colors and confining shot framing that give it an ominous tone. Bale literally got into character and starved himself to become the character with an emaciated appearance. Amazingly a year later he was super ripped for his role as Superman. Overall, this is a tight little character study that'll keep you engaged and thinking.",9,1,3,26 December 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Royal Superhero Rumble!!!
","(Flash Review)Since when did Captain America movies become a movie where most every superhero makes a substantial appearance. Maybe I don't watch enough of this genre but Captain America barely felt like the main character. Anyway, the movie was mainly about should superhero's be able to fight crime as they chose without consequences or should they be forced to follow some rule of law under governmental supervision. With my lack of expertise, for some reason half of the them were OK following rules and half were anti that measure. Valid points being made that in this movie (and past ones) many humans have been injured while the heroes fight the villains and the heroes skate free. It also appeared that a new superhero Spider'boy' was launched here? Anyway, the fun and fluffy mega action Royal Rumble felt odd as many of the superheroes are friends so they aren't going to fight to the death so I didn't understand the goal of the rumble. At least the rumble clearly showcased each hero's superpowers during the battle rather than a visual mess that are the Transformers action scenes (I'm talking to you Michael Bay). It was an OK and lightly entertaining moviesprobably a better script would have helped; case in point being that during a short stretch they let loose on the comedy which wasn't there before or after (aka: unbalanced tone) aside from some amusing Downey Jr. quipshe's always good in this genre.",5,1,3,4 August 2017
Jackie," Jackie's Raw Emotions
","(Flash Review)Bang! JFK has just been shot and the audience is thrust into the mind of Jackie Kennedy as she deals with the infamous event. The film's foundation is Jackie being interviewed calmly at her home. The interview is interspersed between the few days immediately after the shooting and gets into raw detail of her state of mind, shock, lonesomeness and beginning to say farewell. Portman IS the film as many scenes are her face in close-up as she powerfully portrays a myriad of emotions. From what I can recall, the score is often a somber violin softly complementing her frequent moments of grief. Great cinematography with many muted colors aside from Jackie's red dress. A very interesting and effective approach to this historical event.",8,1,2,1 November 2017
Tropic Thunder," Comedic Satire On All War Movies
","For the first time I can recall, Tom Cruise attempted to visually get into a character rather than be the Top Gun pretty boy, as it took me a while to be certain it was him as a balding and stocky chap. This movie kicks off with the filming of a big budget war movie. They are over budget and there is strife on the set. So the director and producer decide to take a new approach a toss the actors into a real world war scenario with hidden guerrilla cameras around the area to get an authentic feel. Turns out the actors encounter actual drug maker vigilantes. Will they break character or figure out the other guys with guns aren't actors? Will the movie actually get produced? This is a slapstick satire on many famous war films over the decades yet it only brought me light smirks rather than hefty chortles. Choppy pacing and average gags didn't help it. Overall, it was a fairly unique slapstick movie with effort put forth with the core story yet many characters were annoying or too strange aside from Jack Black who had some crazy and funny scenes.",3,0,8,14 December 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Creative and Lively Young Adult Romance Tale
","(Flash Review)So yah, at its core it is the typical story about high school to college social situations, awkward relationships and friendships and video games but it was so unique, clever and creative that it was highly entertaining. Scott breaks up with his younger girlfriend to date someone he thinks is out of his league. He now must battle, in a mix of video game and comic book styled battle scenes, her seven x-boyfriends. Will he advance to the next level or be KO'd? Along with a slew of humorous and cringe worthy boy/girl dialog and interactions, this was produced with strong creativity. From editing, graphics, audio, scene transitions and unique story. There was hyper originality with transitions so smooth, clever and unexpected it probably worked perfectly for its youthful core target viewer. This made the most of the medium of film and will make you smile.",8,1,1,21 November 2018
Inside Out," Personification of Emotions
","(Flash Review)This is the most creative and brilliant way I have ever seen emotions visualized. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how they envision a person's mind managing emotions and memories in granular ways. Very cool. The core plot is about the 5 primary emotions of this girl and how they help steer this girl through life as various life events impact her. The big impact was how she is effected and deals with a move from Minnesota to San Francisco and the challenges she faces. As all that happens the personified internal emotions try to maintain control. While much of the story is sad, it is also very touching and honest. There are plenty of comedic moments, energetic moments and adventures. This movie was very well thought out, smart and clever with colorful and vibrant animations.",10,6,19,25 July 2017
Flashdance," Better Soundtrack Than Movie
","(Flash Review)With a story as thin as a White Castle burger, the story gets totally squashed by the vibrant and avant-guard dance scenes which are over the top 80s in style. The director failed at evoking any emotion from the young protagonist dancer who tries to work her way from, believe it or not, a welder to getting accepted to a prestigious dance school. The failings lie within a story that is choppy, unfocused, poorly paced and edited. That being said, there is a killer break dancing scene and I give it credit for actually focusing on the dancing, more than other 80s dance-focused movies, which are boldly memorable. Lastly, why are there so many scenes of people walking down industrial train tracks in the 80s? There was a random scene of that here too.",3,1,1,1 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Epic is an Accurate Descriptor
","(Flash Review)Obviously picking up where Infinity War left off, this was the epic conclusion. I won't spoil the plot but this was epic and mammoth in duration, scale and amount of superheroes. The Avengers are trying to find Thanos to kill him after wiping half the population from existence but will they be able to find a way to undo all the evil he has done? Will anyone actual perish during this mission? So pretty much every superhero makes an appearance, some just for mere seconds and some just get one shot to showcase their specially so the bulk are barely utilized. I felt that could have been better orchestrated and showing more of the big battle that was staged. The superheroes that carry the movie get the most action and drama. The drama was so intense for some heroes that people were openly weeping in the audience as well as cheering. This was an entertaining movie. I liked Infinity War more because I felt the core plan to undo Thanos's evil was a bit ho-hum. Thor was HILARIOUS and did his best 'The Dude' impression.",8,1,8,9 May 2019

Will he be able to transform this diverse bunch of inmates into trustworthy soldiers and achieve their objective?

The Favourite," An Elegant Cat Fight
","(Flash Review)What does it take to be the right-hand to Queen Anne and attain a high social status? Worse yet, how low or to what degree will these two women stoop to maintain it to get into the 'favorite' spot? These women know no bounds and are truly despicable and devious. As Queen Anne's health deteriorates and her desires...'widen', the women tend to her every need. This is a very dark film. The two bratty woman manipulate, claw and scratch into Queen Anne's good graces. This was also much more frisky than anticipated and semi-surreal at times. Not sure I'm buying the fish eye lens shot choices. Unless it is intended to help to accentuate the surreal or absurd atmosphere of the film. I didn't realize this was from the same director as The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster both of which I enjoyed watching more and both were very strange and creative; although I felt this was less uniquely creative.

","(Flash Review)You know you are in for an epic film when the first 4min 40sec is only intro music over a black screen! Peter O'Tool carried this 3:48 epic film which is impressive. Impressive too was the score, the amount of extras and the endless Arabian dessert which was a character itself. The story is a chronicle of British Lieutenant T. E. Lawrence's life gaining power in the Arabian desert. He is sent off to get an inside scoop of the Arab rebellion against the Turks during World War I. Will his rebel and confident personality, he eventually unites a diverse groups of Arab tribes to fight the Turks. They embark on an arduous journey across the harsh dessert to unexpectedly attack the Turks with the goal of helping the British General destroy the gargantuan Ottoman Empire. What an epic adventure this was. Mixed with many majestic musical moments combined with cinematography that is vast in minimal and bleakness. Certainly, a film to be watched for every film buff.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Legend," Romance With A Gangster
","(Flash Review)Based on a true story, the twin Kray Brothers (BOTH played by excellently played by Tom Hardy) are hard as nails gangsters who start buying up prime London clubs and casinos by intimidation and force. Their influence stretches into holding some politicians and police under their thumb as their power increases. How far can their lawless activity last? The film is narrated by Reggie's girlfriend as she hopelessly attempts to keep him away from gangster activity. The other brother Ron is mentally unstable and adds a plethora of additional challenges to everyone's world. There are some brutal violent moments (especially a raw and gruesome stabbing), the acting is great and the production and cinematography are stellar.",7,1,1,3 March 2020
The Little Mermaid," Ariel Is Bad Role Model

Because of course everything will work out perfectly in the end. Really? This is a very shallow movie with very little character development and Ariel has no arc as she learns nothing and gets her way in the end. Aside from the good animation, for the time, and the catchy tunes and outstanding voice acting by Ursula there was literally zero message to be taken from this. Almost worse than a Barbie cartoon in terms of message.",5,3,8,7 November 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Maximum Superhero Smorgasbord to the Max
","(Flash Review)I feel like Marvel managed to get each character into this movie; as far as I could tell. They all team up to halt Thanos from collecting all six colorful Infinity Stones. Once he possesses them all, which fit nicely into a stylish metal glove, he will force the universe fit his personal will. Which is the destroy have the population of the entire universe as he feels overpopulation is a problem. That of course is a contrast to all the people who live in the universe. Aren't there better solutions!? So the Avengers team up to battle him without much success. Thanos is able to thwart each special power thrown at him. Can Thanos be stopped or will the expected happy ending come through? This movie was full of comprehendible action, dazzling effects, solid humor and some somber moments. Not being a superhero guru, I'm sure many insider points flew past me as there were so many superheroes, the action felt a bit scattered about but I got what I expected from it and to the MAX.",8,1,2,6 April 2019
Get Out," A Novel Approach For A Thriller
","(Flash Review)This was a unique mix of director intentions. Thriller, comedy, horror, racial views and overall it worked for me. I understand why it doesn't work for some. The suspense and of plot was intriguing. Yes, the social commentary was bop you over the head obvious, yet it was tied into the plot enough I rolled with it. The story kicks off with an interracial couple going to meet the gal's parents for the first time for the weekend. Plot points arise around, what will my parents think? And gosh they have African American servants. How awkward! From there, creepy things start to happen and there are lots of strange racial commentary from assorted characters. Things escalate to the finish with some decent twists, blood and interspersed comedy which is actually amusing. The acting is solid. The main actor is a quality Oscar nominee but the movie is by no means worthy of a Best Picture nod. Overall, it is a fun quality thriller with some gore, well-timed comedic rest moments and an interesting and likely divisive social commentary.",8,16,30,13 February 2018
Drive," Don't Let His Quiet Demeanor Fool You
","(Flash Review)You know when you eat a really old un-chewed stick of gum? For this smart majority who doesn't, the gun crumbles apart and never joins together. That was this movie. Not that it was stale but its diverse oddness never jelled. It was slow and quiet, had car chases and cold brutality. How well do you really know the person living next door. This film is about an awkwardly quiet and calm mechanic and stunt driver by day; a steely cool getaway driver by night. He gets involved with his attractive neighbor and young boy whose father just got released from prison. He gets himself involved with the father's latest problem to help the mother her boy. Of course this means driving. What happens when getting involved goes awry? What happens when you ruffle the feathers of the easy going driver? Duh, duh, duuuun. This is film was full of calmness occasionally offset by some brief heavy violent moments and was a light case study of this dude and what makes him tick. Good acting and atmosphere.",6,2,3,29 January 2020

","(Flash Review)This chronicles the life of Stephen Hawking from his University days through his book A Brief History of Time. It starts off with his touching courtship of his wife and his early flashes of scientific brilliance, the tough times as his body is ravaged by ALS, he and his wife's adjustment into his wheelchair and finally to the prototype for his talking device as they was an early technological experiment. Overall this was a basic professional and well-done Hollywood movie. Very orderly, clear and approachable. Shot with crisp and warm period colors and rustic English settings. The topic of Science v God is a running theme through Hawking's life and with his wife who has a strong faith. Overall, it was a good overview to his life.",8,0,0,9 February 2019
The Lives of Others," Raw, Real Yet a Bit Stiff
","(Flash Review)Perhaps that is the way it was in East Germany at the time just before the wall was turn down; ridged and strict. This film is about an exacting and no nonsense secret police officer/agent, Gerd, who works for the Stasi (German Secret Police) as a spy to uproot any anti-socialist movements. He is sent to spy on Dryman, a notable playwright, as there is suspicious he isn't as loyal as he seems to the Socialists. While Dryman is the one in the crosshairs, the main character with the deeper character arc really is the agent Gerd. As he lurks into every emotional aspect of Dryman's life and relationships he begins to actually warm up and care for him and those omit occasional details. When Gerd's boss asks for detailed reports, will he notice any omissions in Gerd's reports? Will Gerd allow Dryman's true intentions to be discovered or will Gerd's boss uncover his diluted reports? This film's tone was serious with a color pallet complimenting the rigidness of the era and government overreach. The story moved at a methodical pace that matched a thorough and detailed story.",7,2,2,9 May 2019
Room," Imaging Living in a Small Room Your Whole Life
","(Flash Review)The five year old character in this film did just that along with his mother. Early on, you learn that the mother was kidnapped and has been held in a room for quite a long timeÂ….even before she had a child. So pretty gross thought there. Semi-spoiler: this film is more about how does one readjust to living a normal life again and reconnect with various relationships strained by the horrible time apart. It has some good dramatic moments but too much of the film is filled with inconsequential moments that attempt to develop the characters and set various tones but they fail to truly convince or increase my emotional stake with them. Interesting approach and story.",6,3,5,26 September 2017
Across the Universe," Beatles Lyrics Progress The Story
","(Flash Review)Hope you like Beatles music as the film is told through the use of their unique song lyrics. Many of the characters are named in the same manner as there is a Prudence, Jude, Lucy, Sadie, etc... Even Bono makes a cameo singing I Am The Walrus. And it wouldn't be true to the Beatles without a bit of psychedelic in a few scenes. The film is based around young adults being sent off to war during the anti-war movement of the 60s and how these young adults manage relationships, friendships and their futures during these events. This is a representation of what the perceptions of those who were part of the anit-war movement and much like John Lennon was in his later years. Overall, I didn't find the characters very sympathetic which made me feel less vested in their outcomes. The music was obviously well-done and the visual production was bold, colorful and snappy. When the pretty veneer is pulled back, the film was a typical anti-war story with a couple romantic youths running around, finding themselves or going off to war.",6,0,0,24 January 2020
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino's Early Intensity
","(Flash Review)This film captures Pacino in his fiery youth and range as an actor. He portrays a kind-hearted bank robber needing money to give to his male partner for an operation. This film is a comedy of errors and poor decisions. Nothing goes right even though Pacino has put some planning into this. Awash in the middle of the grimy and drab 1970's styles as well as the hot day in the city, this adds to the awkwardness of the robbery plan. Pacino's acting is emotional and rich and the story unfolds with some solid surprises. A must for Pacino fans.",8,0,1,5 July 2017
Cars 2," Lighting McQueen as Bond
","(Flash Review)Cars 2 switches tracks a bit from being based in a small town to world-wide jet setter and oddly Mater seems to take center stage in this film. This film plays out like a Bond film and Mater sort of like the Pink Panther (if I understand that character correctly) as someone who inadvertently gets in the way of criminals and their plans and sort of helps the secret agents along the way, while McQueen competes in worldwide races. As an automobile and racing fan, I loved this film as there were a plethora of fun, foreign and classic cars all mixed in along the way and the races mixed NASCAR, Formula 1, Rally, and other endurance sports cars; pretty neat. From a parent of a small child perspective, it was a little advanced for kids as there was a theme of big oil vs alternative fuels and a lot more guns and peril for a G Rated movie and from the first Cars. Overall, it was fun and exciting and amusing humor of Mater the rural bloke vs international high scale people.",7,4,4,25 July 2017

",(Flash Review)Four expert swordsmen/women craft a clever plan to assassinate the ruthless and powerful king of one of the neighboring kingdoms. Will their pride and love of their land ultimately allow them achieve their goal? Will the King be able to persuade them otherwise? The serious story is told through interwoven flashbacks as the story pieces itself together. It asks is fighting the only answer and isn't there another way to ultimately unite all the kingdoms harmoniously? Many scenes are flush with interesting and bold color choices and dazzling effects. The sword fighting scenes are similar to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as they are fantastical and surreal in style. This is a visual feast for the eyes with an engaging story and a meaty core.,9,0,1,9 May 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Halts the Downward Trend of this Series
","(Flash Review)Another stereotypical plot yet an improvement over the last couple, which is not a high bar. The plot for me was more intriguing and the effects felt more elaborate and fascinating at times. This time Captain Salazar has released the most deadly ghost pirates of the sea from the Devil's Triangle. The only way to beat these pirates is to gain control of The Trident of Poseidon as whoever possesses it will be in control of all the seas. Will Jack and his allies reign victorious? The movie is a rehash of the gags, physical comedy, sword battles and character personas as you'd expect but the effects seemed more impressive. I have to agree with a comment from an actual critic about the more I see of these movies the more I begin to 'retroactively wonder why I liked the original film so much in the first place.'",7,0,1,21 November 2018
The Longest Day," Granular Chronology of D-Day
","(Flash Review)Many WWII films hone in on the Omaha Beach invasion. Certainly important, heroic and frightening yet this film touches on each aspect leading up to and during the D-Day attack including of course the Omaha Beach invasion. The movie goes into interesting detail on the planning, strategy and decisions that went into the battle not only from the American's side but Germany and occasionally other countries. It was fascinating to hear the behind the scenes thinking from various high ranking officials for how and why certain decisions were made. As the film enters the battles, it reminds me of A Thin Red Line as you get a peek into a complete assortment of scenarios from big to small and the emotional perspectives of those involved; from a paratrooper stuck high up on a bell tower to residents of a cottage in the battle zone to German officials afraid to awaken a sleeping Hitler. The pacing was stellar as this is a 3 hour war epic shot in rich black & white, thus their approach of including an assortment of scenes shot with stunning cinematography (won Oscar for cinematography) helped this epic feel lightweight. Sean Connery even makes an appearance as a jovial soldier with his James Bond smirk. Getting warmed up for Dr. No as he starred in that immediately after. This is a high quality war film with impressive effects with an engrossing screenplay.",9,2,3,1 November 2017
Meet Joe Black," Death Personified
","(Flash Review)Imagine if death introduced itself to you in human form and hung around until he was ready to do his thing and while hanging around he dated your daughter. Yikes you may say! This is the surface plot to this movie and is played out tactfully over three hours. I suppose the underlying crux to the movie is about not taking life for granted and enjoying the little things in life. While death is in human form, he finds the most unusual and simple things novel and pleasurable. Pitt plays death very well. His 'human' character bookends his death character and plays them both distinctively and with fun charms. While being three hours long the dialog is interesting enough not to bore yet is certainly doesn't feel short. Clever story to wrap around a romantic tale.",7,0,2,14 September 2017
Hidden Figures," Pleasant and Inspirational Story to Share
","(Flash Review)I'm really happy this story was told and happy these African American women got credit for the role they played in helping NASA succeed in the early days of space exploration and the race to the moon. These woman had brilliant brains tuned for mathematics who helped solve complex engineering and physics problems. The story focused on how they got hired, were initially treated, were later treated and how they collaborated with their team to aid in NASA's success. The overall approach was very straight forward, expected and pulled zero cinematic surprises. Thus, it was very accessible to all. High quality production, very good acting yet perhaps a bit heavy handed with hammering the points home about the racial inequalities. Great historical and inspirational story.",7,0,1,4 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Met Uber High Expectations: Didn't Exceed
","(Flash Review)Without getting into the story, go see it, this was a quality entry into the Star Wars legacy. It wasn't flawless but highly enjoyable for me. It ticks all the expected boxes for action, CGI, charm, creativity, humor and rich story. To pick at it, I did feel the editing or pacing during the first third or half was a bit heavy handed or scattered and a bit uneventful. They did mix in enough amusing moments to hold it together until it really found its flow and energy. Some of the humor felt forced but may appeal more to kids. There were a few plot decisions I could quibble with, not fully grimace, but overall the story and characters did progress, there were many meaningful battles and Mark Hamill had solid and well-acted screen time as did the rest of the key characters. I'd still favor Rogue One over this as well as The Force Awakens but this is certainly entertaining enough for re-watches.",9,1,6,20 December 2017

","(Flash Review)True love trumps everything else in life in this somber tale. During the Cold War through the 50s, a rural Polish folk composer, Wiktor, starts a cultural signing group of peasants. Headed by his female music partner and a talented younger female singer, Zula. When the government catches wind they 'persuade' them to focus more on communist political themes rather than heritage. His upset partner then leaves and Zula climbs the status ladder and forms a lustful bond. Shortly thereafter, Wiktor is tired of the government meddling and decides to flee Poland for France and asks Zula to join him. At the last minute she doesn't go. The two get separated and there are many country border issues and deportations to come and they move on with their lives and still try hard to be together. Will the things they need to do to get back to each other actually tear them apart? Do those who strive to leave Poland for a better life regret what they left?

Black Snake Moan," Dirty, Grimy, Lewd
","(Flash Review)The main story intent was overshadowed by the unbelievable and sensational nature of how the story played out. The story revolves around a man finding an abused girl by the side of the road in the Tennessee back country. Beyond her recent beating, she has serious issues. The man feeling compelled to help heryou could say fully takes it onvery sensationally. In what could have otherwise been an uplifting tale just ends up getting twisted on itself in strange ways. The man is working through his own issues so the pair sort of try to lift each other up for the better. Whatever hope the director intended to get at never gets passed onto the viewer. Good acting but Timberlake's character wasn't properly developed. Bizarre movie. Avoid.",3,0,6,2 June 2017
Black Hawk Down," Powering Through a Flawed Mission
","(Flash Review)Prototypical war action movie with oodles of gunfire, emotional American heroics and pride with a constant stream of tension and concern. Objective: abduct two top Somali warlord lieutenants and return to base. Estimated to be a swift mission, it turns into a long and deadly ordeal with the initial crash of a Black Hawk helicopter. Now they had woken up the hornets' nest of enemy combatants in the 'danger zone'. Apologies to Top Gun. The high contrast lighting and lots of camera movement added to the hecticness of battle. The movie flowed without a lead character and jumped between assorted tense conflicts and endless gunfire with the screen often littered with flying debris or bullets. Early on the soundtrack had notable big hits that faded away as the plot got serious. There was a huge cast of notable male actors sprinkled throughout. Anyway, with the moto of 'no one left behind', how will the rescue turn out? How much emotional drama will ooze out in this high quality production war movie?",7,1,1,29 June 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Super Heroes Doing What They Do Best; Thin Story
","(Flash Review)If you want to mindlessly watch super heroes using their cool powers and battle evil and pulverize a city, then look no further. The crux of the plot felt like a weak way to generate a dramatic threat to the world. I had a few raised eyebrows as it unfolded. Tony Stark recklessly creates a program called Ultron to protect the world and fails to run quality assurance on the code. ZING. The program launches to life and immediately is out for no good. Now all the Avengers must chip in to help destroy it, while giving Tony Stark light grimaces. There's your plot. So this computer intelligence, Ultron, Stark whipped up that is malfunctioning wants to turn the world to metal and destroy all the humans. The CGI was quality and it was packed with action as well as amusing running jokes about the heft of Thor's hammer. Hire better script writers next time!",4,0,2,4 October 2018

As opposed to getting a job or acquiring an advanced degree, this fellow sets off into the wild world to live in nature or very rural locals without anything aside from a shotgun for hunting. This film follows him through encounters with assorted people across the country and some time of him surviving in nature.

Annie Hall," Gloss-Free Neurotic Romance
","(Flash Review)For those who can't stand a babbling, cynical, neurotic, intellectual person then take three steps back and run. Run far. For those who can, they will enjoy a film full of heavy dialog that takes center stage. Allen portrays a too brainy for his own good Alvie, in an up and down relationship with Annie Hall. From the start, this is turmoil-filled due to his self-sabotage that is full of his obsessive and neurotic tendencies. He has such a constant negative and pessimistic view is everything large to small that he drives the females he wants to pursue slowly away. Alvie is obviously frustrating and irritating to watch as he shares his options and concerns. While this is not a visually intriguing film, Allen does add dashes of cinematic whimsy as he directs characters occasionally to step out of the scene and talk directly into the camera, called an 'aside'. Will Alvie be able to hold down a relationship with Annie who actually likes him or will he driver her away and himself back into therapy? Overall, this is a rapid fire, intellectual-based script in pure 70s style.",8,0,1,12 April 2019
War Machine," Off Target Humorless Satire
","It portrays commanders and soldiers as simple-minded, incompetent, chowder heads. If they were aiming for a humorous satire laced with dry humor, they misfired. Showing the preposterousness of war can be done without the appearing to insult American soldiers. Look at Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line or even Pitt's own Inglorious Bastards. In this movie, Pitt portrays the newly hired general, with unusual and distinctive mannerisms, as he tries to turn the tide of the war and claim a victory. This wasn't funny, as satire needs to be, as it leaned too serious at times.",3,2,3,17 February 2020

Once Upon a Time in America," Failed to Achieve Lofty Goals
","(Flash Review)This is a serious epic at a beefy 3:49 that tediously moved at a restrained pace. The extensive duration did lead to good character development told through well-edited flashbacks, present time and flash forwards. I felt that this strove to emulate The Godfather and Goodfellas, perhaps even Scarface, yet pales in comparison because it failed to connect me to characters in a way that I cared what happened to them. It bred indifference. I didn't care about anyone. Even the bad guys in a slew of other gangster films, I certainly formed an opinion about; positive or negative. That = viewer connection. The editing between eras was clever yet the editing within each scene often really dragged at times. While occasionally effective, as it can deliver a dramatic charge when needed, I had to keep my eyelids from dropping at other times. It had all the right ingredients just mixed and stirred poorly. Especially, if your bad ass protagonist is named Noodles! C'mon! See it if you must check it off your gangster or De Niro list.",6,1,1,21 November 2018
This Is Spinal Tap," Deadpan Rocker Jokes
","(Flash Review)This is an amusingly accurate satire on rock musicians and their inner circle; 80's hair band style. The story follows a once popular rock bad and how they deal with their vanishing popularity and influence. The film's comedic details are spot on as they mock things from band member's lack of intelligence, performance snafus, corny lyrics, silly arguments and much more. This is all done from a documentary perspective, or what known as a mockumentary, so it has the feel of realism. This approach is a relief from the modern immature and physical comedy all too common today. It is subtle and witty and if you are paying attention some gags will sneak by you. Funny but Best In Show still takes the cake for me.",8,1,3,28 September 2017

Wrong place, wrong time for two blokes who witness gangstersÂ….erÂ….umÂ….doing business and run away after they are spotted is how the movie starts out. While it starts off rather serious it quickly switches to a screwball comedy with a gluttony of gags around the two guys trying to keep their female cover within the band as long as they can while not getting aroused (double entendre) as they befriend Marilyn's character. How long will they be able to keep their cover and their lips off Marilyn? Will those Chicago gangsters ever catch wind of their whereabouts? Overall the plot was fine, nothing great.

The film's visual tone is bold and compliments the aquatic theme, had many dreamy scenes in water, the camera felt like it was ever-moving as if you were floating in water yourself and an endless rain plays into the water theme as well. Contributing to the overall strangeness were several odd and overt sexual innuendos that tie into the story. There were a few short moments of alarming blood and gore, which didn't seem to advance the story and felt jarring.

","(Flash Review)As tight as the last twist or two of a screw is how the intensity ratchets up in this film. Taking place in Mississippi in the 40s during WWII, the story revolves around the relationship between a white farming family and an African American family that is paid to work the land with them with lively racial discrimination afoot. The tough life as a farmer out on the farm with the long and heavy rains is frequently highlighted. The film contrasts the ways African Americans were treated overseas vs in America that builds to a critical flashpoint. The cinematography is often dark and shadowy while the pacing is very.... easy going Southern. Certainly an emotional viewing.",9,0,0,1 April 2020
All Quiet on the Western Front," Definitive Anti-War Film Of Its Time
","(Flash Review)From the abundance of war films created, not too many cover as vast a spectrum of being a soldier from their point of view. The film follows a group of young boys from initial recruitment, to basic training into actual combat, down time, killing the enemy, what happens to wounded soldiers in the hospital, their family and close friend's perspective and it really dives into the psyche of the soldier through authentic scenarios. Overall, the film shows its age but it did stage some serious battles and explosions for 1930. It holds your attention yet can't compete with the modern war films that ooze with deep and riveting emotions. I am aware I just used the ubiquitous riveting descriptor in a movie review. This is an all-time classic so check it out for educational purposes if nothing else.",7,1,1,29 June 2019
12 Years a Slave," Powerful, Not Emotional
","(Flash Review)Wait, how can you say a brutal slave movie isn't emotional? To cut to the chase, this was a well-produced, well-acted yet not well- written movie about a free African American who gets kidnapped into slavery. Unlike Amistad or other human sufferage films like The Pianist or Schindler's List, those films drew more emotion from me such as a misty eye, tears or the feeling of needing to vomit during the slave ship scene in Amistad. Yet this movie failed to connect me to the character or the story with the same depth. Perhaps it was the lack of a true goal and story/character arc. Sure ESCAPE was his goal but there wasn't a big plan so there was a lot of biding one's time and taking it day by day. And then Brad Pitt shows up which sort of takes you out of the story because there is Pitt with a beard. He was good but his inclusion and his 'star power' was jarring. There were plenty of unpleasant scenes that were powerfully brutal that made you feel various people's agony yet it didn't draw the out emotions as if they had better intertwined them in a more compelling story.",7,0,0,26 September 2017
There Will Be Blood," Exquisitely Executed
","(Flash Review)DD Lewis owned this character. One of a cold-hearted and hyper-driven oil prospector. He became this character who lets nothing stand in the way of his next deal or progress towards wealth. His performance was accentuated by outstanding editing, camera movement and punctuated by an evocative music score. The film follows from what I assume was his first oil discovery in 1898 through his successes including life hurdles that he just kicks down rather than overcome. The crux of the film is watching how his character is paralleled by a youthful preacher whom he encounters through a land deal. Both characters have their flaws, which are exposed through a similar lens and highlighted many times as their paths often cross. It is intriguing to see how they both gain notoriety and attain notable levels of success despite their flaws and to see their lives follow a similar trajectory. Deep down it becomes unnerving to see what humans will do for their personal competitive victories. The end seemed to need a bit more meat to paint the picture that attempted to do. Overall, a stellar achievement on all cinematic fronts.",9,0,0,24 August 2018
Joker," Let Me Catch My Breath...That Was Madness Awoken!
","(Flash Review)Joaquin Phoenix brought the deranged persona only he can portray in this character study. No one could have played this role better than Phoenix. He became the gritty, grimy, troubled, wacky, and demented Joker and was also able to bring a tiny dose of sympathy. The music score paints a hauntingly eerie atmosphere with cinematography and color pallet that is spot on. The film is full of abstract emotional vignettes in his pre-Joker days. It had subtle to alarming examples where he was an outcast, even amongst fellow clowns, who frequently shunned by society and had a severely troubled upbringing; hence the sympathy. He has a strong desire to be funny, even a comedian and admired. What will it take for him to be accepted and respected? This film ran the gamut from subtle to extreme shock and really is virtually flawless...if you can tolerate the film's unsettling tone.",10,3,6,26 March 2020
August Rush," For Pure Music Lovers
","(Flash Review)If you like the aura of music, sappy melodramatic moments yet a dash of interesting intrigue, then this is for you. An orphan boy, age 10, with an uncanny ear for sounds and playing music, refuses to believe his parents didn't want him and that through music he can hear this parent's emotions. While being swept up by a street musician pimp, his real parents, who have been apart since his conception, begin to get drawn back to him by the spirit of music. Will his true parents and the boy ever meet up together and will he be able to reach his true musical potential as a conductor? If you go along for the ride, this is totally watchable yet too often it was overly far-fetched and it telegraphed plot points yet the core idea was intriguing. One far-fetched point was how fast this kid could actually learn musical instruments even for a savant.",6,1,1,9 February 2019

During the war, one of the residents lost track of her daughter and has never learned what happened. The writer assists in tracking down her whereabouts. This has a bunch of actors from Downton Abby and there are also jokes made in the film about the clunky and long title of the film. Watch this tame drama unfold as she hears their tales, often shown in flashbacks, and how it affects her personal life. This was a little dry and hard for me to get into the emotions.",5,1,2,21 November 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Plot Fails to Fully Deliver
","(Flash Review)Another one of those movies about the movie industry in the golden era; the 50s. A main figurehead at Capitol Studios spends the movie trying to deal with and appease big star actors, keep movie budgets under control, free a kidnapped star by Communists and deal with the media. The Coen Brothers tried their approach of a humorous, sprawling and plotless film but sadly it failed to have the same great impact of many of their previous films. Perhaps they tried to include too many story lines that they were all to thin, which lacked the depth and meat that makes his past films memorable. A quality production with less than anticipated intrigue and impact.",6,0,0,24 December 2018
The Reader," This Dares You To Sympathize with a NAZI Guard
","(Flash Review)This film is told in three segments. It kicks off with a length physical relationship between a teenage boy who inexplicably hits it off with an older woman who helped him out once. He was educated and could read while she could not. He reads to her most every day which I guess comforts her and oh ya, they are very frisky. Skip ahead to a trial of female guards of NAZI concentration camps and their role that atrocity. One of the defendants is the older woman and one student lawyer observing the trial is the young boy. During the trail the boy may hold a piece of information that might help his former lover. Will he have the nerve to share it with the court to save help her or will he hold back from what he learns during the trial? Jump ahead to him as an adult and now he is a lawyer.

Jaws," Not An Easy Catch
","(Flash Review)Rewatching after a few decades. I didn't recall anything past the famous beach scenes so good to get a refresher. Jaws takes place in a small resort beach town that depends on revenue from vacationers. When a shark victim surfaces (pun intended) there is a battle between the mayor and the local sheriff on whether to ban swimming (lose revenue) or keep the water open (risk deaths). We all know where this is headed. Anyway, the beach scenes have the famous Jaws music theme and a bit of blood, while the second half is three guys trying to catch and kill the gargantuan shark, which I completely forgot about. It is well shot, had great tension, some good character development and some good 70's era shark battling scenes.",9,0,1,10 September 2017
Inception," Several Intriguing Concepts to Ponder
","(Flash Review)Ideas are a parasite. That is a novel notion. To play this out in a modern world, of course someone will use this as a scheme to benefit themselves. The crux to this story is to plant an idea to change someone future decision: Inception. The objective is to have a wealthy man break up his father's business empire to benefit a 3rd party which he is unaware of. To execute an inception, one must get into the subconscious of someone and maneuver that 'world' to modify memories to influence that person in reality. This plot involves concepts of defending your thoughts while unconscious and can people who operate in people's minds, lose track of actual reality as they are able to dream within a dream? The film did a good job setting the rules of the subconscious world so the viewer had a chance to follow along if they focus! There were some nifty special effects and noticeably good sound editing. It was intriguing how the three subconscious levels affect each other with various risks and how speed of time increase the more subconscious levels deep you go. This is a really fun and complex thinkers film.",9,0,1,5 February 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Like Watching a Good Book
","(Flash Review)Aside from adding more CGI moments in this remake, detective Poirot still uncovers every clue to a murder with unbelievable swiftness. I still am not fond of how this story is told. Even with a gargantuan cast, I was once again bored. Mainly because the audience never really gets a chance to figure things out. They are just along for the long train ride and dryly told what is discovered. This is just like the original with a well-known cast for the time period and Poirot does his thing. This time with a preposterous mustache. If you didn't like the original, don't bother with this remake.",6,0,1,19 March 2019
The Waterboy," Perfect Story for a Silly Movie
",(Flash Review)What a crazy character. Do I dare say Waterboy is a deep character...? At least for a stupid comedy. Waterboy is a gentle soul who only wants to hydrate the local losing college football team as he has a crazed obsession for H2O. He has a ton of hidden aggression that once surfaces lands him on the team against his Mama's wishes. As an immediate successes he delivers oodles over the top brutal tackles with a hilarious sound. Can Waterboy help the team become winners? Sandler does a great job playing an unusual character. The movie is full of good-hearted and randomly funny scenes that'll leave you smiling. I miss the Sanders good old days.,8,3,3,13 September 2019
Arrival," Needed More Meat To Chew On
","(Flash Review)Latest film from the director of Sicario. Thus I had hopeful expectations. The story started off with some strong, minimal and arresting imagery as once again aliens visit Earth and park themselves across the globe and sit their silently awaiting human contact. The protagonist is a linguistics expert and is tasked with attempting to communicate with the aliens to learn their intentions. Nations across the world attempt their own approaches for communication. Will all nations take a calm and peaceful approach or will some use fear as a means to attack and will humans be able to work together? What do the aliens want and are they peaceful? These are the core questions. While the film built up a great and compelling opening it began to falter for me as the process of finding these answers became repetitive and of minimal intrigue. The linguistics partner is a physicist yet never uses his knowledge to advance the story and becomes an underdeveloped sidekick. There are many vague and open-ended aspects to the film which can be fun to ponder but there wasn't enough meat or depth to mentally chew on to keep my brain processing potential possibilities. For me the film fizzled out and didn't amaze me.",6,0,2,27 August 2017
The Cannonball Run," Zany and Screwball Car-Focused Movie
","(Flash Review)Not knowing the tone going into this, I was hoping for some fun car chasing scenes yet I was slightly disappointed despite opening up with a Lamborghini Countach speeding down the highway. Based on a real event, Cannonball Run is an illegal cross country race where the winner is the one who averages the highest speed while avoiding cops and other obstacles. Who will win, will sabotage come up or will the police be able to stop the race? There are assorted cars and characters who join in the fun. Burt Reynolds is the main character along with Farrah Fawcett and Roger Moore, who plays his real life self as the mega Hollywood James Bond star, is a close third and drives his classic Aston Martin DB5. The film quality is rather poor with clumsy editing, cuts that avoid having to stage expensive accidents and MANY scenes were guilty of speeding up the footage to give the false impression of actual speeds. Some bad jokes, some decent ones but mainly light smirks. I thoughts it was going to be better than it was.",6,0,1,20 March 2018
Parasite," Well....I didn't expect 'that' after the first half. That's for sure!

The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder.",9,16,24,5 February 2020
Wonder Woman," Proper Kick-off for the Character
","(Flash Review)Perhaps trying to draw more females to the movies and to celebrate the strength of females, this summer action blockbuster dove into the origins of how Wonder Woman came to be. From her mythical beginnings on a hidden away Amazonian island and into WWI due to a fluke encounter with modern society. Throughout the movie Diana struggles to comprehend modern societies' appetite for war and destruction as this is a stark contrast to her peaceful world. She fears the God Eres is the main culprit and makes it her personal mission to stop Eres. Will she succeed? How will she adapt within a modern society? This point is the driver for much of the movie's humor, which is complimented by entertainingly slick and rich action as well as he modern lasso and powerful bracelets. This was a high quality, CGI rich, Hollywood blockbuster with an engaging story and fun scenes. Sure one can pick away at it but its rewardingly fun with properly set expectations.",9,2,3,5 January 2018
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Take On War: His 2nd Film
","(Flash Review)This is a somber look at the absurdity of war. This story revolves around a general's order to stage an attack on 'Ant Hill' which is psychologically a Mt. Everest scale of risk. Ant Hill is a key foothold in the war so the attack is ordered even though the French commanders know there will be hefty casualties. When widespread hesitations occur on the front lines the general is furious and three randomly chosen soldiers are court-martialed and tried for cowardess, which has a penalty of death. Will a sub-commander be able to talk sense into everyone during the trial? This film asks you to ponder what happens when common sense flies in the face of military orders no matter how daunting. In some regards, this is a parody of the absurdity of war. Much like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, this was very picturesque, great shot framing, rich film stock as a meaningful script.",8,0,1,29 June 2019

Only problem is her mother is a religious extremist and refuses to let her have friends, let alone a prom date, part because she knows her daughter has a special power. So, how will prom go? Will the guy be a true gentleman? Will the bullying continue? Will people witness Carrie's special power? This is full ubiquitous 'Hitckockian' fright screeches and slowly builds to some memorable intensity.

Marriage Story," Sobering Raw Reality of Spiraling Sadness
","(Flash Review)If you want to see pure acting front and center with cuts long enough to let actors dive deep, then this fits the bill. Early in the film you see a husband and a wife sitting with a marriage counselor lightly trying to save their marriage amicably. Following that there is no surprise for guessing the trend the film will take. The path the story takes smashes any facade the characters have built and drives to the core of their internal feelings and feelings for each other. It is sobering to watch the couple's relationship escalate in negative intensity. The raw acting takes center stage due to smart yet non-flashy cinematography. This doubles as a PSA for not hiring lawyers for divorce cases as they are portrayed as vile scum. Those seeking acting should not miss this.",9,3,4,24 January 2020

Starting off with pot, he quickly escalates to cocaine and catches the attention of Escobar. After his first bust, he mother loses her love for him as his father, while disappointed, still loves him. While in a rocky marriage, he enjoys raising his daughter as she is actually something he would hate to lose from his life. The fathers/son and father/daughter narratives help the viewer feel sympathy for George. Amazing how you sort of root for a heavy weight drug dealer...because the people around him are even worse. The story rips right along with crisp editing with a Scorsese type soundtrack. Depp is classic Depp and truly embodies this character.",9,0,0,16 June 2020
Raging Bull," Watch A Modern Barbarian Destroy His Life
","(Flash Review)The film follows the early career of rising boxing star Jake LaMotta as he battles middle weight contenders and personal decisions as he strives to get a title shot. While he is working up the ladder, his true persona is illuminated on how controlling, violent and distrustful he is off his wife, brother and pretty much everyone. From scene to scene, he is angry, inquisitive, schmoozing or scheming. This is one of those rise and fall stories that starts with arrogance and ends with humility. While the acting is rich with emotion, the lighting helps give a unique atmosphere to the scenes which are shot in rich black and white. Scorsese uses some creative cinematic moments to accentuate the emotional mood of specific scenes. It appears De Niro gained a bunch of weight from Jake's fighting weight to his post career weight. Don't pass up the Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci trifecta in their early days.",8,1,1,21 November 2019

But a Lord Farquaad has expelled all fairy creatures from the town and into Shrek's neck of the woods. To get his swamp back he strikes a deal with Lord Farquaad to rescue princess Fiona from a dragon so the Lord can become a real King by marrying a princess. Many positive lessons for kids are learned along the way. Shrek needs to learn that being separate is no way to live because some people find him ugly or scary and that what's inside matters more than one's appearance and that it is more fun to have friends that live by yourself. Many things are revealed through fun plot twists accompanied by amusing jokes and situations and some real drama. A fun, simple and memorable movie.",8,2,2,10 September 2018
Black Panther," Nice Change From Ubiquitous Avengers Characters
","(Flash Review)This super hero movie felt fresh for me. New characters, locations and styles. It actually had a solid and meaningful plot as well. T'Challa, (AKA Black Panther) returns to Wakanda to. Part of the swearing in ceremony is that challengers from local areas in the country are allowed to respectfully battle him to take his throne. There are some really neat fight scenes around that part of the movie. Later and based on some historical revenge another challenger is granted his chance to fight for the throne. This new challenger will lead the country into war while T'Challa hopes aims to protect his people. Overall, the story was coherent and the battle scene graphics high quality. For those who like super hero characters and are tired with seeing Iron Man show up everywhere, this is refreshing.",7,0,1,4 October 2018
Mother!," Crescendo of Insanity
","(Flash Review)'Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb.' To quote Pink Floyd, this is exactly what Aronofsky does with this film. Wow........where do I..........even begin with this film? First off, I was unaware what I was about to unleash on myself as this is an unforgettable film with an insufficiently 'light' IMBD summary. So the surface plot is basically a husband and wife are living together in an isolated, large, classic, southern-style house. The husband is trying overcome a creative writing block and the wife is remodeling the house interior. A stranger visits their house as he admires the husband's writing. As the story progresses many strangers come to visit and the husband graciously invites many more to stay at the house much to the dismay of the wife who wants intimate quiet time with her husband and to start a family. Enter the crescendo of insanity from here on out and maybe some light spoilers. What sort of people will arrive and with what degree of passion for the husband? Will the wife be able to calm the household? Much of the story harks back to biblical references and metaphors as well as scenes that are open to personal interpretation. Many reviewers try to rationalize the wife as a symbolic 'Mother Earth' being trampled upon; I can see that perspective. Many reviewers as well as myself describe the second half as a jarring nightmare, fear of lack of control and boundaries. Combine that with increasingly madness behavior including some alarmingly disturbing and putrid moments!!! I contemplated turning it off but I had invested too much I was curious to see how it would wrap up. It had great production value, good acting and a manic story. What's the intended message? I dare you to watch and try to figure it out for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you! Ha!",8,1,2,9 May 2018
Creed II," Squeezes the Rocky Story Dry...finally...?

Adonis also wants to fight Viktor to get revenge for his father's death. Let the boxing testosterone and blood flow! Who will emerge with their pride? Much of the story is Adonis maturing and his relationship with Rocky as well as Drago and his son's relationship. Overall, this MILKS the drama out of the large udder of an ultra-familiar plot. The boxing felt less believable conceptually and artistically as I could see the punches yet seeing or feeling the impact. Nothing surprising here yet was well-produced.",5,1,2,23 October 2019

The story touches on his childhood, early career, rocky start to his entrepreneur vision of curiosities and how he elevated it. Also how he gave peculiar and different people a place to feel accepted and welcome, which was driven home with a heavy hand. We got it the first couple times.

Saving Mr. Banks," Magical Subject, Lacks the Magic
","(Flash Review)Mary Poppins a movie I still have yet to see (!!!!) and this movie is about the creator of the Mary Poppins character, Mrs. Travers, as Walt Disney attempts to persuade her to give up animation rights so they can make the historic classic. As there is no surprise spoiler at the end, this film is about how they get the movie produced. Travers is portrayed as a stereotypical uptight and overly proper British lady, in contrast to Hanks, who plays Mr. Disney. There were some amusing moments and tidbits of musical numbers with Travers and Disney and his creative team on how they don't see eye to eye. But a big side story was Travers's backstory, told through many flashbacks, about her alcoholic father and him never being proud of her. This tale brought to focus Travers's buried emotional issues and how it interfered with the movie's production. Overall it was more drab emotions versus humor and not much was told about why Mary Poppins is so universally loved yet it was professionally scripted and produced without enough creativity or charm.",6,0,1,3 August 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Thin Story Thick CGI
","(Flash Review)While I was entertained during the semi-serious action sequences, the script was too vague and at times discombobulated. The plot is that every 3,000 years five worlds align to allow for things to pass through. Some generic bad creature guys try to destroy or control the universe by using time and universe travel as well as some peculiar powers. Of course Thor and his hammer come to the rescue to stop them. There is a lot of fun brainless action and some fun with things and people zipping around the different worlds but much of it is just fun and games and doesn't advance the story and actually becomes severely redundant. The actress from 2 Broke Girls (I don't watch that sitcom!) adds sassy comedy but ultimately is a jarring addition and distracting. The bad creature guys were thinly developed as was the script so it ended up being Hollywood fluff.more than I thought it would be. Overall, it was fun but certainly not great.",6,0,0,27 August 2017
Unbroken," Normal Epic Movie
",(Flash Review)Go America! This movie certainly touches on American pride as many scenes illustrate American grit and determination in the face of adversity and fear. This movie follows the life of a young man who is fleet of foot enough to qualify for the Olympics as well as a strong- willed American soldier during WWII. The movie cuts between his childhood track days and his time as a soldier. There are many epic and well-produced battle scenes and Olympic settings yet leaves the viewer with a mix of bland and good emotions. Perhaps a lack any true surprises; you could see the plot arcs. Good acting from no-name actors. A few cliché moments but they blending into the storyline just fine. Simply put: a very well done period piece; entertaining with emotional hooks yet failed to truly grip you.,7,0,1,29 June 2017
Rear Window," Stationary Suspense

He believes he has spotted a crime occur...based on witnessing chopped up segments of time, his limited vantage point and visual obstructions. As his imagination runs wild, he begins using a long range lens to help back up his assumptions! He contacts a few other able bodied people and they get into mix to find the truth. Is what he think he saw really what he believes? This is a really unique approach to a film, even by today's screenplays. I love the opening series of panning shots to paint the picture of the location from the POV of the main character stuck in a wheelchair trying to entertain his mind. Hitchcock slowly builds suspense through small details, sticky situations and good storytelling. Never once was a bored watching a man watching other people. Impressive!",9,0,0,14 September 2019

The film kicks off explosively with a tight group a robbers executing an armored truck heist lead by DeNiro. Pacino heads the detective unit who are quickly on the scene and will play an escalating cat and mouse game to try and catch them in the act. Much of the film is also an introspective look at the personal life of this crew and how they manage a family or how they deal with being alone. Additionally, while Pacino is laser focused on his job, his personal life suffers. Enjoy the rare Pacino and DeNiro duo as they try to outfox each other and see if either of them will be able to give up the life they live when opportunities arise. The film's tone is no nonsense with acting as the main focus. Mediocre cinematography yet has a couple outstanding shoot 'em up scenes.",9,1,1,9 February 2019

The Thin Red Line," Atmosphere of War
","(Flash Review)Rewatched this now that I 'understand' who Terrance Malik really is as a director. This film takes a unique approach to war, which is a feat considering the plethora or war films a person can watch. The approach is less of a story with an expected story arc and more shadowing soldiers at different moments during their time in combat so you never stick with the same person for too much time. Each soldier has a different take on war; some get power hungry and aggressive, some cower in fear, some stay calm, some fight effectively and some lose their marbles. As with much of Malik's work, there is plenty of visual analogies and symbolism. The war is Vietnam and a narrator is often philosophizing about how can there be so much beauty in the land and nature and why are humans slaughtering themselves amongst it. The film is real and raw and at times mentally surreal as it meanders through the war in a similar way as Apocalypse Now does except much less dark and insane. It clocks in at a hefty 2hr 50min and its point is certainly made by then. Let the visuals sink in which give the brain time to contemplate and let Malik wash over you as only he can do.",8,1,3,23 June 2017

A 'colored' man, Don Shirley, is being chauffeured by a 'white' man, Tony Vallelonga, of Italian decent. Even deeper than that is how Don is much more sophisticated and proper than the more casual and brusque Tony. Don hired Tony to drive him to a series of musical gigs. Through the journey they slowly learn to respect each other as well as expand their social views while dealing with the racism of the time in the South, thus both characters have meaningful story arcs. The production quality is rich with a great color pallet which complement the meaty dialog which is told through a straight-forward story. Quality.",9,0,2,29 June 2019

","(Flash Review)Every time blood is sucked, there is a cringe worthy crunch sound as the fangs enter the neck or wrist. Much like someone biting into an apple. Shudder. The whole story is told through long interview flashbacks as Christian Slater is conducting the interview, which is sort of funny in its own right, of the protagonist vampire played by Pitt. The stories help to illuminate what life would be like living as a vampire with the pros/cons to eternal life and their daily struggle for survival as well as many mundane parts of life told through two male vampires and a pre-teen girl. It was interesting to see the progression of a man convert into a vampire and his first few days. The new vamp is conflicted with taking lives for his own survival as his mentor shows him the ropes. The two guys transform a little girl with the fatherly need to take care of her. Watch how the vampires progress through time and how their relationships with one another evolve. This felt more authentic than a more typical and modern movie with lots of action and spectacular scenes.",8,0,1,21 November 2018
Saboteur," Watch It For The Climax
","(Flash Review)An aircraft carrier worker is framed for a massive fire that took a man's life in the hanger in Los Angeles. Trying to un-frame himself, the man follows leads based on the name on a letter he finds and winds up in New York city partnering with a woman who previously doubted his innocents. They uncover that some wealthy fascists are behind the two deadly events yet their motive feels secondary to the main story line. As he closes in on finding the culprits, they begin to squeeze him. Who will be held accountable? The story build up was too vague as I never really found the culprits motive concerning. The film is capped off with a famous chase up and into the Statue of Liberty. Overall, the film felt uneven yet had some exciting and very well-done effects for the period.",7,0,0,10 April 2020
Joy," A Woman, Her Mop, Her Vision
","(Flash Review)'It's only a mop. Only a mop! Only a mop....you don't understand.' Nope, this is not a spin-off of Stanley Spadowski from UHF. HaHa. This is quite the opposite and is about a housewife with a stressful life, dramatic, dysfunctional and unsupportive family dynamics with financial difficulties who invents a new self-wringing and more absorbent mop that can be washed in a washing machine. She makes a risky investment after she meets a buyer from QVC (live television selling channel). Will the mops sell like hotcakes? What other struggles will she face trying to make a profit. This was a well-produced film with great acting, good cinematography and a unique and emotional story with a strong female lead. It was paced well and while it had good depth to most scenes, I felt the ending was rushed or crammed in. Well worth the time.",8,0,1,24 December 2018
Moon," Story Was More Crescent Than Full
","(Flash Review)This film was too basic with too thin a story and it thought it was more grand and philosophical than it was. It's one of those films where the protagonist wrestles with the solitude of being the ONLY human working at a mining plant on the Moon which sends resources back to a mineral starved Earth. Does being the sole human strain his mental state or is something else strange afoot? Plots like this are typically interesting yet this one was unconvincing or that the main 'characters' were irritating. The drab and bland writing and the jarring unsophisticated emoticon faces the talking robot had didn't help. The preposterousness of the logic they established for the Moon mining activity encourages a furrowed brow. On a positive note, the Moon special effects were very good.",3,0,1,10 April 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Hell on Earth
","(Flash Review)They used GraveDigger the monster truck in this!! It would have been fun to be part of the vehicle design team as they were all wild, mean and powerful looking. This movie kept the vibe and atmosphere of the originals, dirty, grimy, gross and vast in landscape, to paint a picture of an evil overlord who enslaves people and withholds water in a hopeless desert land. During an escape attempt, Max encounters a few women and they begin to team up to escape the wasteland in hopes of reaching the women's homeland. Like many in this movie series, the plot felt thin and a vague and barely enough to contain the wild and spectacular car chase battles. This movie did not disappoint with its pure action which was well- choreographed, elaborate, full of dirt, blood, sweat and fire; a lot to visually digest on the screen. I wish this story had better character engagement or reward for watching as by the end I just felt dirty and that I needed a bath.",7,4,5,1 November 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Unique WWII Story
","(Flash Review)I've seen many a war movie and the core of this story is original. This is about a man who enlists in the army yet refuses to fire or touch a firearm. He nobly just wants to be a medic. For a movie with a main character who is anti-violence, this movie is awfully bloody and highly graphic. I had to avert my eyes multiple times. As a comparison, I didn't bat an eye during Apocalypse Now nor Private Ryan. Hacksaw Ridge is, as you guessed it, a tall ridge. A mammoth cliff ridge on the edge of water. US troops approaching below and the Japanese hold the high ground. There is a cargo net the soldiers must scale to get up there. Whether this is a flaw in the movie, it is a true story, or a true flaw by the Japanese, why didn't the Japanese just cut the cargo net down.? Without giving too much away, a long battle ensues. The gun-less main character, dubbed the 'conscientious objector', performs many heroics during the battle. Overestimated everyone that mocked his integrity during basic training. Overall, it is a high quality production with much more bloody gore than really needed. Vince Vaughn as a drill instructor initially took me out of the movie flow but he actually settled in nicely but he was still Vince Vaughn. The movie also had its share of ubiquitous war movie and romance scenes but it was fairly unique for the genre and highlighted American patriotism.",8,2,3,18 May 2017
Me Before You," Unusual Romance
","(Flash Review)Lou is a quirky young woman much like Amélie, whose family is struggling financially, takes a job as a daily personal helper for a quadriplegic young man. This young man just happens to be handsome, intelligent, successful in business before a tragic accident and extremely wealthy. And of course his name is Will Traynor. As with many typical romantic story arcs, the two start off with opposing personalities but learn to soften as it is her job to help him. Will the she look past his limitations, will he allow her connect emotionally or will she remain his professional helper? There are some cute and unique plot points that drive this story in unique ways along with an unexpected twist or two. Set in picturesque locations, this is very visually appealing. Along with quality dialog, this is a nice twist for the RomDram category.",6,0,2,16 October 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Too Hokey And Corny
","(Flash Review)The final of the core three movies, this wasn't as good as I remember or it has aged poorly. This opens with an off-putting flashback of how Jones got his funny quirks with his attachment to his hat, fear of snakes, etc... It felt poorly done and hokey with lame humor. Back to present time now, Jones is on the hunt for the chalice Jesus drank from at the Last Supper. He follows some clues with an attractive woman, gets followed by some bad guys who know what he's is searching for; cue hammy hi-jinks and you know the drill. The antagonist believes he will acquire eternal life if his drinks from the chalice and he must snatch it before Jones can. While fun and adventurous, it felt stale as the humor and gags felt tired and worn yet it had decent effects for 1989. It was fine but was a far cry from the amazing Raiders of the Lost Ark.",6,1,10,20 March 2018
13 Hours," Bay Restrained
","(Flash Review)Compared with the indecipherable action of many of Bay's movies, this wasn't over the top..for him. He took a more factual and documentary angle with this film about the tragedy in Benghazi. And it really didn't take political stance. Never was Hilary's name mentioned nor her title. Only that additional security or reinforcements were requested several times and ignored. The movie was more about the soldiers and how they handled each tense situation. Of course it had the tell- tale scenes of showing soldiers talking or thinking about their families before battle scenes to ratchet up the emotions. It could have been stronger if more backstory was there for why there was so much tension with Lybia to begin with and why was the embassy continually asking for increased security and defense. For a straight-shootin' modern war/battle movie, it was very exciting and enjoyable. It even showed actual footage of the locals apologizing for what happened to our embassy at the end.",8,1,3,2 June 2017
The Birds," Props to the Bird Trainers!
","(Flash Review)This film may not be what many are anticipating mainly because of how Hitch leaves story lines completely opened ended and to the viewer's interpretation. Once the credits began to roll, I went to a film forum to read other viewer's thoughts. The story follows Melanie, a city socialite, who follows a lawyer Mitch to a small boating village of Bodega Bay. Her excuse for her trip is to bring, what else, two love birds for his much younger daughter. Upon her arrival local sea gulls and crows begin to increasingly attack the locals. Why is the million dollar question. This film is pure Hitch. A crescendo of tension, peculiar happenings and great cinematography. Not to mention it was devoid of any music. All sounds, aside from dialog, were birds. Bird wings fluttering and birds chirping. Silence aided tension of the tense moments. This film will leave you thinking, thinking and thinking.",9,1,1,10 September 2018
Cinderella Man," Punching Out of the Depression
",(Flash Review)Boxer James Braddock became an inspirational hero during the Great Depression as he like many others felt the true blow of poverty and fought his way back to his feet. He began his boxing career with lots of promise and potential until a couple of injuries derailed his hopes as the country's economy collapsed. His passion or desperation to get and keep his family out of poverty helped drive his miraculous boxing comeback. A very high quality and well-acted story told in a very expected and traditional way. Similarities to Rocky's story with the grit and determination but family was at stake for Braddock rather than just personal pride. The boxing scenes were well-shot and the editing was solid as a close to 2.5hr film didn't feel long. Quality.,7,1,1,27 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Hire a Smarter Crew for a Better Outcome!!!
","(Flash Review)Ridley....you learned nothing from your egregious mistakes directing Prometheus. Yarg! This is a sequel to Prometheus which was an embarrassingly poorly written movie and while far from a comedy it contained an abundance of laughable moments. Again the crew is extremely unprofessional for being entrusted to manage an expensive multi-year mission!! They are much too cavalier; smoking and littering just after setting foot on a new planet!!, making lewd jokes while executing a risky landing, ignoring quarantine protocol, exploring without protective breathing gear while inspecting and handling and SNIFFING foreign objects. I learned that in junior high science class!! Why!?! Why are they so idiotic? It ruins the movie! I believe the crew of the original Alien were along the lines of intergalactic trash haulers and they made smart character decisions. The main plot is the crew of The Covenant are searching for a safe planet to start a new colony yet the captain is easily swayed to deviate due to some initial findings of a unmapped planet that looks inviting. Secondarily, are themes that revolve around created beings deciding to become creators of the alien species. And what does it mean to be created or be the creator. The movie is not a smart or cleverly written by any means and there is absolutely zero tension even with mean and hungry alien things running around. To top it off, It reused the historically famous original Alien opening movie titles. I'm not yet sure if I approve of that.",3,1,3,23 October 2019
The Godfather," Stellar Cast, Script, Cinematography = Classic
","(Flash Review)From the opening 6+ minute long tracking shot that starts with a close up and ends over the shoulder of Vito Corleone listening to a man, the films is engrossing and much credit goes to Brando's unforgettable portrayal of Don Vito. His voice, demeanor, style and wiseness set the tone for the hefty film. While the story is highly intricate, of shifting power down the family lineage, it is also an majestic look inside the engine of a mobster family and their world which often flows from New York and Sicily. My reviews are too brief to get into plot details but the acting is top notch with a gluttony of famous actors, the pacing while slow is measured appropriately to let scenes and dialog sink in. The violence is effective and raw as well as memorable yet not over the top. This is an ultimate classic of mobsters playing angles trying to get the upper hand. Who will outsmart who and who will survive within the code of honor?",9,0,0,31 January 2018
