Howl's Moving Castle," Wonderful movie, entertained completely
","I don't know what I can say that so many other people have not already said.I have enjoyed every movie done by Miyazaki, and this is no exception.I have seen a few reviewers complain that there is no plot, or the story is disjointed. As well as poor character development. All I can say is how very western of you.I had no trouble understanding the plot at all. All the performances were superb. I did not find anything disjointed. I found it to be a wonderful story from beginning to end.Some people complained about 'loose ends' such as why the war was occurring, which was explained in the movie (neighboring kingdoms prince had disappeared and they blamed it on the kingdom where the story takes place, turns out a spell was cast on him), or where Howl's apprentice came from (it just doesn't matter in the movie, but viewing the movie one could assume he came across Howl in a similar fashion as Sophie did). These people should watch the movie again, I'm sure they will notice the answers the second time.The story was so unusual it completely captivated me right from the beginning.Every bit as good as any of his other movies.If you love animation, take a break from the commercial works of Dream Works and Pixar (which are fine movies) and treat yourself to something different. You'll be glad you did.",8,1,2,26 August 2009
Star Trek," No where near as good as I was led to believe
","This movie was 'OK'.I am a Trekkie, and have been since I watched the first series air.I have seen everything Trek over and over, and I admit I've been getting a little bored of it lately. I have never believed any of the series or movies have really captured the feel or the original series.I grew up on Armed Forces bases, and one of the things I liked about the original series was that it felt military. I loved Kirk snapping orders MISTER! It gave the series a little legitimacy.Then came The Next Generation, and while I liked the series over all, one of the dumbest things I have ever seen was the inclusion of children on the Enterprise. This was a military vessel, could be destroyed at any time, and the writers would have us believe the crew would take their children with them. I had to overlook that stupidity every time I watched.At least DS9 was a little better even if it did over do the religion aspect (why would an enlightened race 'worship' wormhole aliens?).Voyager was different, but not as much as I had hoped. Then came 'Enterprise' that basically drove the nail in the coffin of the Star Trek franchise. The crew was fine, as was the acting. Unfortunately, once AGAIN, the writers figured canon didn't matter. Now, on to this movie. 'Not bad' is the best I can say for it. I could understand the story, and even go along with most of the things they did. But some things were just stupid. What's a young Kirk doing being able to steal an antique car, be able to drive it, be able to get gas to make it work? And excuse me, but Federation Starships being constructed ON THE GROUND? Stupid, impractical and impossible considering none of the large star ships were ever designed to fly in an atmosphere (excluding Voyager). Spock is barely even Vulcan in this movie. Writers just have to have their own way. If you come up with an alien in a movie, and he's very popular to the fans, and you have a new writer for the next movie he's just got to try and make the character something he's not. Sure, Spock always had his human emotions to fight off, and apparently now so do all the rest of the Vulcans. I know that it's always been alluded there were emotions buried under layers of logic in Vulcans, but not to the extreme that would have us believe in this movie. Spock was always the exception because he is half human, not the rule. And even so, he was damned good at burying his emotions, almost as good as other Vulcans. Spock's father admits he married his wife because he loved her? Shoot that writer and move on to the next.The entire planet of Vulcan is blowed up REAL GOOD, and where's the Federation? They send a few ships to what they think is a rescue mission, and they get blowed up too. After that, there might as well not even be a Federation. Here's this giant ship, blowed up Vulcan and is currently working on blowing up the Earth, and not a single ship around to challenge it. Not a single one. You would hardly know that, at this period in time, the Federation was not on good terms with any number of races, including the Romulans, and the Klingons. You'd think there would be a few ships in the neighborhood to defend the seat of the Federation. As other people have mentioned, the Evil Villain had no good reason to have a hate-on for Spock in the first place, unless he had the IQ of a doorknob (like the writers). To top it all off, he could have used his massive ship to SAVE ROMULAN, but NNNNNOOOOOOO, that would make too much sense for these writers. No one ever accused Hollywood writers of having brains. Just don't get me started on the 'red matter'. Doh!To top all these problems off , JJ weed smoker tells us (on the blu-ray extras) he didn't have the money for some of the sets he wanted to build, so what does he do? He uses an old power station to stand-in as the engine room for one Federation ship, and uses a freeking beer factory for a stand-in of the Enterprise engine room. This is the worst, stupidest, most moronic thing I have ever seen. Not only do these places not look anything like any engine room conceived anywhere ever, but other than just looking stupid they also make no sense. If you have a huge spaceship, do you waste reams and reams of space on 'emptyness' or do you use every cubic centimeter to good purpose?I have seen a LOT of bad scifi in my days. Many of these bad movies had very low budgets, and since they couldn't afford sets guess what they did? They used factories, water plants, dams and maybe even power plants and beer factories to stand-in for real sets. Well JJ, guess what you made this Star Trek movie look like? You made it look like you ran out of money half way through, and then went the way of the 'B' movie.Sure, this movie was entertaining. And there were some excellent spots. One of the things that really kills me is that they did not have to ignore canon. They were just lazy writers. It would have been simple for a true fan to work with this story, make the movie every bit as exciting as it is, but not beat the crap out of canon at all. I have to say a lot of 'fans' are better writers than the people who wrote this movie.",5,2,6,18 November 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," Kids movie most of all
","I've got 4 or 5 Miyazaki movies, and I love them all. Unfortunately I did not find myself quite getting into this one. It really seems for kids, even more than his other movies. I've watched them all multiple times and will watch them again, but I think it'll be a rare night when I pull this out of the collection for a re-view. I suppose I'm happy to have seen it at least once though.This movie doesn't really have much of a story, and if it weren't for Totoro being around, it would be pretty mundane. It picks up a little as Totoro helps the little girl find her sister and then go off to visit her mom in the hospital. If you can get them to sit still long enough, kids should love it because it still has that Miyazaki feel. It just seems like it was made a little more for kids than his other movies were.",5,4,12,4 November 2011
Pitch Black," Very original, great story effects and acting
","First I have to say I never give ANY movies a 10 out of 10. Unfortunately, since so many people have trashed this movie just because they didn't understand what they were watching, or claim it's a ripoff of other movies, it has a lower rating than it should have.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.Overall, excellent acting, effects, story and script.The crew and passengers of a space ship crash land on a planet with three suns. One of the survivors is a chained criminal who manages to escape shortly after the crash.The survivors find an old research camp a short distance away from their crash site (unlikely on such a large planet). Here they find a machine to reclaim water from the atmosphere, a small shuttle-like spacecraft and all the belongings of the people who inhabited the camp.By now, the criminal has agreed to rejoin the rest of the group in exchange for a promise of freedom. This criminal (Riddick) makes everyone else realize that the original occupants of the camp never left, but were killed by some animals that earlier killed another of their party.Their task is to bring back some energy capsules from their crash site to power the spacecraft at the camp.Throughout the story they discover that the planet goes through an extended period of darkness due to an eclipse every 27 years (unlikely they would crash during this time), and soon discover that sightless animals come out to eat anything they can find including each other during this eclipse. Our group has to retrieve the energy capsules while avoiding getting eaten, with Riddick leading the group.Many people claim this movie is a ripoff of the Alien series, or even Jurassic Park. This is utter nonsense. There are hundreds (if not thousands) or monster movies out there, and if this movie is a rip off then every monster movie ever made is a ripoff of whatever the original monster movie was.What do monsters do? They chase you, they rip you apart, they eat you. So, in so far as the monsters in this movie do those same things (as every good monster should) then it is a monster movie ripoff as much as Star Wars is a ripoff of Star Trek.The monsters (I prefer animals) in this movie fly, they have no eyes but 'see' using a type of echo location like a bat does. One person asked how Riddick could stare down one of these animals without getting eaten. This person should have paid more attention as the movie clearly shows Riddick examining a skull of one of these animals and finding a 'blind spot' where the animal could not 'see' what is in that spot.Of course, this movie has a couple of unlikely things like most scifi movies do. One is that the planet has a breathable atmosphere, one is that the gang should crash so close to the research camp on such a huge planet, and of course they happen to crash just before the eclipse takes place.Come on people. If the story was, ship crashes, people die because of a poison atmosphere there wouldn't be much of a story, would there? Same goes for people crash, people wonder around and die of thirst. And, of course, people crash, people find camp with water, people fix small spacecraft and leave. None of those plots would make much of a movie.The way the people are portrayed is perfect for the situation they are in. The animals are quite unique and not intelligent as the aliens are in Alien and Predator. It's a fast paced intense action movie that will give enjoyment to anyone who sees it.If you are a scifi fan and have not seen this movie, you are in for a treat. If you're not a scifi fan, go watch something else.",8,1,3,4 August 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Another fine movie from DreamWorks
","I saw this movie in 2D which is fine by be because I've always found 3D movies to be a bit gimmicky and a distraction from the movie itself.This movie is as good as most of the other DreamWorks animations. I would put it on par with Over the Hedge, or Flushed Away.I am a big animation fan, and will watch anything animated. This movie is entertaining all the way through. It has a good story, the actors do an excellent job. There are plenty of yuks all the way through. A treat for almost anyone, and a must see for animation lovers.If you like other DreamWorks animations, you'll like this movie too.And just in case you've read some of the other reviews, don't worry. There is no 'propaganda' (omg), and it's nothing at all like a 'cross between Monsters Inc and The Incredibles'.",8,0,1,29 September 2009
Spirited Away," Awesome movie, Miyazaki has done it again.
","Great movie. Once again Miyazaki has made an animated movie that is entertaining all the way through. Good story, performances, characters and animation.Please don't be put off by the few bad reviews. There are always people that just don't 'get it'. Don't let the lower than average IQ of these few reviewers be your deciding factor.This is indeed a masterpiece of movie making, and if you're an animation lover like I am you'd be poorer for not having seen this movie.If you are someone with just an interest in animation, please see this movie. It is quite different in style from other animes. Some other reviewers would have us believe that all Japanese anime is the same art style, I can only rebut this by asking if they might be visually impaired? This is not your Saturday morning anime, nor is it like any other. If you only get a chance to see one anime, this would be a good choice. If you like it, seek out Miyazaki's complete works. They are all of this caliber. They will add just a little more joy to your life.As for the people who gave this movie such nasty undeserved reviews, you people should just stop watching animated movies all together. Obviously you are the very people who just 'don't get it'. Stop reviewing things you don't understand or are too dim witted to enjoy.",8,1,3,26 August 2009
Shrek the Third," Not bad, could have been better
","I have read quite a few of the other reviews, and I have to say that I agree with most of them overall.I really loved the first two Shrek movies. They were fresh, and funny.This movie was pretty good, but lost me towards the end. I liked that the ladies had to 'take care of business', and especially the animal scenes with Beauty.At one point, Fiona tells Charming how much trouble he will be in when Shrek comes back. At the end of the movie I was thinking to myself, why would Charming be worried about Shrek when the studio has turned him into a wuss? When he gets back from his little trip, he is immediately captured and spends most of the rest of the movie in chains.This made me think about the first movie, when Shrek takes on the prince's knights all by himself. Kicking butt, because HE'S AN OGRE! None of that here, Shrek obediently gets captured and just sits there and takes all the abuse.As well, during Shrek's little trip, they spend entirely too much time with the kid Arty, trying to convince him to come along. It got a little boring at this point, however the beginning of the trip was actually fairly funny. At one point, a girl in a high school asking Shrek if he would take her friend to a dance because she's into fairy tale creatures, and of Shrek 'thou doth vex her so soothly'.Not a bad movie but just doesn't live up to the standards set by the first two.",7,1,3,7 August 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not bad if you like slower mysteries
","When I saw all the great reviews and the trailers for this movie I was really expecting something a little more exciting.This is a mystery movie about a girl who disappears sometime around WWII. Her uncle (old rich guy) hires a reporter to find out what happened to her. He suspects someone in the family offed her.At the same time another story takes place that eventually merges with the main story. A girl (19? 20?) who had no parents and is taken care of by a guardian works for a company that does 'research' for old rich guys or whoever else is willing to pay I guess. The old rich guy in this movie hires her company to check out the reporter to make sure he's on the up and up.Her guardian dies and is replaced by a man who sexually abuses her. She manages to get back at him, and blackmails him into leaving her alone.She discovers some facts regarding the girl who disappeared and sends them to the reporter. The reporter finds out who she is and recruits her to help him. Here is gets a little gross as the reporter looks to be in his late 30s or 40s, but they have an affair anyway. I think they just had to throw a little nudity in to keep people interested. IMHO they could have left out the entire sexual abuse thing and had a much better story (or at least just used a few short flashbacks so we could understand why the girl is so hardened).Early in the picture the old man shows the reporter some pictures made of framed flowers and plants the missing girl used to give him as birthday presents. He shows the reporter an huge collection of these and claims whoever killed her is sending them to rub it in (since she was a favorite relative). At this point the end of the movie was completely ruined for me as I knew right away she must still be alive and sending him these gifts every year. This was such a amateurish mistake. I don't know if it came from the book or the movie, but it sucked.There was some excitement in the movie as someone tries to kill the reporter, and eventually they find the bad guy, the girl kills him off (justifying all the scenes with the sexual abuse and some flash backs), finds the missing girl (who is an older woman now) and reunites her with the old man.Too long, and some slow boring parts. I did not watch it with the subtitles so it may have been a little better in the original language. It reminded me of some boring Canadian movies from last decade, but not quite as boring.I rewatch movies in my 600 strong collection quite often, and even though I bought the blu-ray version of this movie I doubt I will ever take it out, dust it off and watch it again. I liked the actors. The production values were adequate for a movie of this type, so I guess it was just not my cup of tea. Some reviewers seemed to think it was the best movie since they figured out how to pre-slice bread, but I don't see it myself. Each to his own I guess.",6,3,7,7 October 2010
Evil Dead," A great movie
","I am a big fan of the original movies even though the second movie was basically identical to the first movie. I loved the Army of Darkness. Great camp there.The first two movies were low budget attempts at semi serious horror. At the time they were made, this wasn't exactly a common type of movie, and they were just about as low budget as a movie could get.That was OK though because of the talent of Campbell and Raimi. They made the movie what it was. I really don't understand why they made the second one though as it was basically exactly like the first one.However, both of those movies evolved into The Army of Darkness, which was way less horror and way more comedy. That was fine too, as it gave us something different from what was expected in an Evil Dead movie.Fast Forward to 2012 and we see what Raimi really wanted in his originals. True horror, and lots of realistic blood and guts. The plot is very similar to the first two, but as others have mentioned, there is no 'Ash' in this movie, which I did miss, but it really didn't take anything away from this movie as it stands on its own as a great horror movie.So, what you will get is: The cabin in the woods (check). The roads impassible (check). The necronomicon (check). Multiple dumb teenagers just asking for it (check).At this point, things take a change for the serious. Unlike the previous films, this is not a comedy, or a cheap horror film. This movie goes all out to show us exactly why people should stay away from books bound in human flesh. If this was back in the 60s or 70s, they would likely be giving away barf bags.I've read some of the reviews from some fanboys who think the first movies were the second coming or something. They were really fun movies, and I love them, but they were not great movies by any stretch of the imagination. The Army of Darkness came closest to being a great movie, but it was more comedy than horror, while the first two were obviously going more for horror, but were low budget affairs.I believe this is what the first movie would have been like if Raimi had the cash to make it at the time.So, if you want to see a real horror flick, with lots of blood and gore (and really, not 'just for the sake of blood and gore' but because, as we know from the earlier movies, blood and gore is what you get if you read that damn book) if you like horror, absolutely see this movie. Just be ready for a real blood bath.",7,2,6,16 October 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Loved it
","I really enjoyed the first movie. The second movie gives you more of the same. The parental units have become a little more familiar, and I actually enjoyed their antics this time.They have introduced a few more bots, but unfortunately I don't think we get to see enough of them. There are a couple of wise cracking hiphop 'twins' that reminded me a little or JarJar Binks (I know I know, but they weren't as bad and don't ruin the movie). They had a couple of 'lady bots' that transformed into hot mamas on motorcycles, and I don't think we got to see anywhere near enough of them.They added in a few new bad bots, and one mega bad bot made up of multiple construction vehicles. He was pretty cool.There was pretty much non stop action all the way through the movie (my kind of movie). And although you may have heard different, the story was fine. Not overly complex, but we do learn that the transformers have been to earth in the past and the Decepticons had actually tried to destroy our sun to somehow gain energon. This was against their laws and so the original Autobots defeated the Decepticons and hid the key to their giant sun killing machine by making a tomb out of their own bodies.The majority of the story is devoted to the Decepticons trying to resurrect Megatron, chase down the remaining fragments of the Allspark, and find the key to the sun killer to destroy the sun. Of course, the Autobots and main characters have to try and stop them. Optimus Prime is killed along the way and has to be brought back to life because only a 'Prime' can destroy the original Decepticon (who needs killing REAL bad). The battle where Optimus is killed was awesome. Optimus really shows his fighting skills and kicks some butt, only to be brought down by being stabbed in the back by (who else?) Megatron. There are quite a few new bots, but anyone with half a brain can keep track of them.I was glued to the screen all the way through. Fun fun fun. Anyone looking for more than fun from a Transformers movie is looking in the wrong place. The worst thing I can say about this movie is that I felt that a few of the battle scenes might have been a little rushed. It seemed there was a lot happening and it all went by so fast.Hope they make another one. What do you expect, War and Peace?",7,1,4,21 October 2009
X-Men: First Class," It was OK.
","I'm sorry if I'm sexist or something, but Emma Frost in this movie is nowhere near as sexy as she is in the comics and cartoons. Also, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique was a really poor choice. She just doesn't do it for me. She has this little chubby baby face, the makeup on here wasn't anywhere near as well done as the first 3 movies, her acting wasn't the greatest and, again I'm sorry, but she didn't come close to Rebecca Romijn in the first three movies. Not for makeup, not for acting, not for the action sequences and not for her sexiness. I feel she was a very poor choice for this roll.But hey, other than that it was a good movie. Great story, good actors, script and effects were well done. No other complaints about it.I loved Logan's small roll in this flick. Perfect.",6,1,2,14 September 2011
Contact," Could have been good except for the last half hour
","All the way through this movie I was kept interested. The acting was top notch, the production values good, the story interesting. Even the script was good. I was glued to the screen all the way to the last half hour.When the 'alien' turned out to take the form of her father, I felt it was a real cop-out. On top of this, when the lead finally returns to earth, no one believed she went anywhere. Conveniently all the recording equipment fails and everyone seems to think Jody's character was hallucinating or something.I think the only real failure here was the writers imagination. The ending of this movie really pi$$ed me off, and ruined the entire flick for me.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. At least you won't be feeling ripped off at the end. One last thing. PUHLEASE, don't even try to compare this flick to 2001 A Space Odyssey. Not even close. Completely different leagues. 2001 is an all time classic science fiction film, perhaps the best ever produced. This movie is in a whole other time zone.",5,2,4,6 November 2010
