First Man," Slow moving at times, exciting at others
","I had high hopes for this film...I mean, who wouldn't? A movie about the first human being to walk on the moon's surface? Instead of the thrill of perhaps the most momentous event in history, we are treated to a brooding, fearful, almost regrettable version of the tale.As others have mentioned, first and foremost, this was an American event done in the name of the human race. Regardless of your politics, I think we can all agree that the American flag being planted on the moon's surface should at least have been recognized in the film given the historical significance it had at the time.As to historical accuracy, the scene where Armstrong drops his daughter's bracelet into a crater makes one wonder if it really happened. While the records show that Armstrong wandered off by himself for a 10-minute period, they do not indicate what he did during that time. From a practical standpoint, one cannot help but wonder how an astronaut, with those extremely bulky gloves on, would be able to retrieve the tiny bracelet of a two-year old girl from a pocket on a spacesuit? I am not saying that it didn't happen as the film shows, however, I think when one looks at it objectively, the event is probably more Hollywood than history.Secondly, as we watch Armstrong go through the training and selection process, we get the sense that he really didn't care about the program...that it was just a job. While that may have been the case in real life (I didn't know Neil Armstrong personally, so I'm afraid I can't say with certainty one way or the other), it makes for a pretty poor movie. If the main character is acting as if he's not interested in being there, we as the audience can't help but wonder why WE are there as well. As to Gossling's brooding portrayal of Armstrong, we see it is in direct contrast that with all the images taken during and after the mission itself of a smiling Armstrong and fellow crew. Which is the truth? I can't say for certain, but I'll go with the mission photos and tone of the speeches Armstrong made instead of the Hollywood portrayal.On the other end of the spectrum, and the reason I gave the film as many stars as I did, was it's ability during the mission scenes to draw a viewer in to the action. The creaking and groaning of the rocket as fuel was pumped in and the ignition sequence was initiated had us strapped in alongside Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin. The stuck thruster sequence in the Gemini 8 scene had us on edge, despite knowing that the outcome would be positive. If you choose to watch this movie, those scenes will allow us to 'experience' the hazards of spaceflight those pioneers braved.In summary, don't expect this film to be historically accurate. Should you choose to watch it yourself, enjoy the spaceflight sequences where your surround sound system can envelope you in the action.",5,0,2,15 April 2019
