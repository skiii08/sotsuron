Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the vengeance is continued
","The Bride has finished the first two people on her list; O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. But before we see the rest of the vengeance to take place, we are taken back to the massacre at the Two Pine Chapel. The Bride and her husband Tommy are rehearsing their ceremony when a surprise visitor comes; Bill, setting this vengeance story into motion. Now come back to the rest of her Death List Five, next to come is Budd. Living in a camper van and working in a strip club, Budd is very unhappy with his life. When Bill gives him news that The Bride is out to get him, Budd couldn't care less. Entangled with Budd's fate is Elle, who despises The Bride; who in return The Bride didn't like much either, setting up for one down dirty grudge fight; an ultimate cat fight with very sharp claws. But the the highlight come to the dramatic conclusion when The Bride finally confronts Bill, but has a shocking revelation in store for her.Kill Bill Vol 2 is a spectacular conclusion to the masterpiece of Vol 1. Like Vol 1, Vol 2 is a patch work of movie influences and references. While Vol 1 was more in the realm of Japanese Samuria films, Vol 2 is set more in the Spagetti Westerns and Chinese Martial Art films. While Vol 1 has more action, Vol 2 has picked up more of the Tarantino Dioluge, adding more weight to the story, as we do finally see a lot of the background to The Bride and Bill. Though it doesn't suffer from the drop in action, as the dramatic tension is raised a lot; especially towards the end and the confrontation of Bill.The violence is very dulled down in Vol 2. The blood has been with drawn and there isn't much blood to see, but it still has that vulgarity from Vol 1 that still has that mesmerising effect. Being the main fight sequences, the grudge between Elle and The Bride is a fight to remember. It was a dirty slug fight that wasn't afraid to bring the low punches out, and there were some very low punches from each. Though the fight of Bill many have found abit underplayed and not what they were wanting, it was a very fitting end. The tension in the small fight was so gripping that it resolved it wonderfully.Uma Thurman out does herself from Vol 1. Her reaction to many situation were so believable; it was painful to see her face when she sees her daughter for the first time and when she was being buried alive that was also painful to watch hearing her crying. David Carradine does an excellent job as Bill. Though there were a few times it seemed he was talking to so for his dialog, kinda putting the emphasises out of place, yet it was a minor flaw in his role. Michael Madsen was great as the begrudged Budd, he showed a lot of hollowness in Budd, with Budd thinking it can be fixed with money. Daryl Hannah was just outstanding as Elle. She played a perfect bitch. She was a character you loved to hate. You could hear all the malevolence in her voice. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was just perfect. You can't help but laugh with every whip of his beard he makes with his hand.Kill Bill Vol 2 is a wonderful conclusion to this tale of revenge. It would be great to see Vol 1 and 2 in one whole film.",10,2,4,27 November 2005
Howl's Moving Castle," such beautiful artistry
","Working in a fashionable hat shop, Sofie feels under-appreciated, yet she's to shy to change. Talk has been spread of sightings of Howl's moving castle. While walking down a back street, Sofie unexpectedly meets this mysterious Howl. People have known Howl as a vicious wizard that eats pretty girls hearts. Though the wizard Sofie meets is a confident, care wizard. That night, Sofie also meets the Witch of the Waste; a vain and selfish witch, places a curse upon Sofie, cursing her with the body of a ninety year old woman. Desperately to have the curse lifted, Sofie travels across the country. Meeting a strange scarecrow, Sofie soon finds herself upon Howl's moving castle. The legged castle is a rusted, decrepit place, which looks to fall to pieces in any given moment. Here she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who is also under a curse, and a young boy Markl, a training wizard.With the success of Hayao Miyazaki's last film Spirited Away, it was a hard step for him to make a film to equal that wonderful film. While you shouldn't really just compare Howl's Moving Castle just against Spirited Away; though it doesn't come to it, Howl's Moving Castle is one of the weaker films from Hayao Miyazaki. Based upon the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the story of Howl's Moving Castle seems inconsistent, jumping around to much, making an uneven flow. When an important piece of information is told, the scene jumps somewhere else. The story starts very clear, yet during the later half of the film the story seems muddled and abit chaotic from the strangeness that Miyazaki presents.Though the story of Howl's Moving Castle does hinder the film somewhat, it's the artistry that really creates this film. Much like many of Miyazaki's film, the world he is presenting to us is so out of this world; inhabited by some outlandish characters, wizards and demons. What so impressive about the animation is the handcrafted style, where animations are so heavily made with computer animation. The warmth just emanates from the screen, and you can see so much sweat and blood went into the vibrant detail.While Howl's Moving Castle isn't one of the better films from Hayao Miyazaki, it's still a very impressive film all the same. You can't help but be drawn into this beautiful world.",7,1,3,14 March 2006
Walk the Line," Phoenix and Witherspoon on fire
","Opening at the Folsom prison, before Johnny Cash takes stage, we're shot back to his child hood. Living on a poor farm, with a cold hearted father, Jonh's brother Jake is killed in a freak accident. Stone hopping through the years, we go through Cash in the army, where he started writing songs and the beginnings of his marriage to Vivian Cash. Stuck in a door salesman job, Cash soon cuts a record, based on the songs he wrote in the army. From the popularity of the record, he sets on tour with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. On the tour he meets singer June Carter; in a recent messy divorce.With a turbulent life, Cash spirals, with alcohol abuse, drug addiction and his adultery love for June. From the beginning of his marriage to Vivian, the marriage was rocky, only getting worse over the years. Still carrying the guilt of his brothers death, Cash is always in a constant state of making his father proud and accept him.While not a fan of John Cash's music; and while this doesn't change my stance, Walk the Line is one of the most powerful film biography's, on one of country musics greatest musicians. Walk the Line blends perfectly a balance between the music and Cash's life, keeping the target audience wide for the non Cash fan. The drama between Cash's wife, father and June are so intense, and the raw emotion of the drama is vividly brought to the screen.Giving powerhouse, mind blowing performances, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are electrifying as Cash and Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are at the top of their game, delivering such powerful dramatic performances. Topping this is the singing, with both Phoenix and Witherspoon singing all the songs. While the supporting cast give great roles; Robert Patrick is wonderfully as Cash's father, they are over shadowed by Phoenix and Witherspoon.Whether your a fan of Johnny Cash or not, Walk the Line is a excellent biography film on a singing legend.",8,0,2,26 January 2006
Mission: Impossible III," slick action that doesn't call for much of the viewer
","Ethan Hunt has moved from missions, into training new recruits, settling down with girlfriend Julia. Happy with his current status, Ethan is called in by John Musgrave, in a rescue mission for agent Lindsey Ferris, a former trainee held captive in Germany. The mission busts, yet Ethan uncovers a deeper conspiracy. Owen Davian is currently planning to obtain an item coded The Rabbits Foot. Ethan tries to foil Davian's plan, though Davian throws a wild card, kidnapping Julia and will kill her if Ethan doesn't bring The Rabbits Foot to him.The first Mission: Impossible was an entertain espionage thriller. The second installment was an unfocused action flick, dragged down by its flaws. With the new go to guy J.J. Abrams in the directors chair and part of the writing team; with his television hits Alias and Lost, Abrams injects new life and energy into the franchise.The production is sleek and highly stylised. The action runs at a constant pace and done of a high caliber; while location jumping around the world. The stand out side of Mission: Impossible 3 is bringing Ethan is reality; trying to hold a relationship while hiding his true profession, and drawing out a fallible side. He isn't as enigmatic as from the previous two films. Though no back story is shown, he's more dimensional and easier to grasp to. Ultimately this development is only a small part of what essentially is an action flick.Reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise walks through the numbers, yet does it so well, bringing lots of energy to Ethan. Also reprising his role as Luther, Ving Rhames is good company. Mosty know from the show Felicity; also created by Abrams, Keri Russell takes great stead leaping to the action genre. Simon Pegg, Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne don't really bring that much to the table, showing below average performances. Also jumping from the other side of the spectrum; from iconic literate to menacing villain, Philip Seymour Hoffman has fun with his role, yet could have gone all that much further, he's not disturbing for a villain.Mission Impossible 3 is basically is a highly crafted, action film. It doesn't ask for much, except to deliver and highly entertaining film; which it delivers in spades.",8,0,2,6 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," a great mystery, yet not a wholly effective film
","In the wrong place, wrong time, Slevin has had bad luck constantly struck him. Moving to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, Slevin becomes entangled in a debt held by Fisher. Selvin is mistaken to be Fisher, who owes debts to two crime bosses; The Boss and The Rabbi. Fisher owes money too both, yet caught in the problem, Slevin is forced to kill The Rabbi's son, revenge for The Boss. Circling around in the shadows of both bosses is assassin Goodkat, who seems to be setting Slevin up. Helping to solve Slevin's problem is Lindsey; the girl next door.The Wrong Man (Australian release title), runs under a false misapprehension. A look at the trailer would have you believe this is a quirky, jazzy, gangster flick; great laughs to be held. Instead The Wrong Man is a much darker tale of coincidence, mistaken identity and retribution. That's not too say there isn't comedy, there are touches of humour spread through this story; just don't expect full out hilarity.The Wrong Man has a smash up of influences; pulpy Tarantino dialog with touches of Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Payback. The most distinctive part of The Wrong Man is it's dialog. Writer Jason Smilovic has cleverly tried to created fast paced, pulpy dialog, yet never reaches the effectiveness of Tarantino or its ambitions. It lacks a lot of subtlety and the intellectual stability to keep it captivating. Conversations run around in circles, never going anywhere; where's the focus and cohesiveness. Smilovic wants to bite you with forked tongued wit, but lacks the teeth.Patience is a virtue. A virtue needed for The Wrong Man takes time to focus itself, from a very muddled beginning. The mystery surrounding all the characters and their part in the overall scheme takes awhile for pieces to start clicking; similar to the dialog, it is abit of a run around for some time. Misdirection is used exceedingly well by director Paul McGuigan; as Goodkat said, when everyone is looking to the right, you should be looking to the left. McGuigan really gets into the guts of the story post mid-point, but pushes the line to far with too many twists in quick succession. When the darker elements are finally injected, you start to feel its grip dragging you in; but too little to late.Bruce Willis is cool and collected as Goodkat, walking in the shadows and behind his mystery plan. Josh Hartnett is at his best as Slevin, constantly holding his down trodden character in good esteem. Lucy Liu is beautiful as innocent Lindsey, jumping in head first to help Slevin's problem. Morgan Freeman not near his best, yet still strong. Ben Kingsley takes lead from his character Don Logan from Sexy Beast, toning Don's sheer vulgarity for a head strong Rabbi.While The Wrong Man does run around in circles for some time, when it finally heads in a clear direction, a great, dark mystery can be found to unravel.",6,1,3,5 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," Sofia likes her cake
","Let them eat cake. Maybe a cake that the masses will not enjoy, but Sofia Coppola likes to have her cake and eat it also. Marie Antoinette strictly not a film that falls back on historical facts to drive its narrative, Coppola focuses on the woman Antoinette and the illustrious aristocracy of 18th century Versailles, a place of set behavior and formality of crass and asinine levels to Antoinette.Marie Antoinette, of Austrian descent is betrothed to French dauphin Louis XVI, to create ties between the two countries. Marie is naive and embodies and eagerness frowned upon. Her cheer doesn't run with the occupants of Versailles, who's currency is scandal and gossip; which Marie finds herself in the center of, when her and Louis fail to consummate their marriage for some time and unfulfilling the wishes to produce an heir. Marie though is a lady of leisure, filling the void made from her unromantic marriage and isolation being an outsider.Marie Antoinette is a change for Coppola. Not a drastic one, her deep exploration of loneliness and isolation which has been the main point of focus her last two films; Lost in Translation and The Virgin Suicides, leans off the heavy emotions for Marie Antoinette, while still incorporating her slow burn, gentle exhale, visual eye and simplistic approach are all in tact. Simplistic may not have been in the vocabulary on costumes, production design and mountains of sweets and cakes. Eye candy galore, with lush and rich design; costumes designed beautifully by Milena Canonero and production design by K.K. Barrett is exquisite. Coppola still explores personal isolation, conveying this and so much with little verbal interaction. The quietness speaks so loudly, with Coppola adding wry humour of the whispered gossip and simplistic moments. More conceptual than historical accurate, Coppola mixes in a contemporary soundtrack to pin point procession; Gang of Four's Natural's Not in It encapsulates the entire film during the opening credits.Teaming up again, Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Antoinette. Portraying Marie's exterior naivety, hidden strengths and strong loneliness, being an outsider in a foreign country. Dead pan not Jason Schwartzman strongest strength, though still manages an awkward Louis XVI. Steve Coogan and Judy Davis are wonderful in the supporting roles as Ambassador Mercy and Comtesse de Noailles. Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson grasp the wry humour perfectly as the gossiping Aunt Victoire and Aunt Sophie.Marie Antoinette may come off as a vanity project, and lack a resonance and poignancy as the softly spoken Lost in Translation or the emotionally haunting The Virgin Suicides, though to all the cakes, Sofia Coppola has made a sweet little treat in Marie Antoinette.",8,3,5,15 February 2007
Minority Report," a thrilling ride
","In the year 2054, crime has been abolished. Three cognitive people are used to predict crimes before they occur; creating a police force or Pre-Crime. Chief John Anderton is head of his divisions, scrubbing through the images seen from the Precogs. The Precogs have never been wrong, but when Danny Witwer from the Federal Bearue investigates any possibilities of problems that may arise from this new type of investigation; things go arise. The Precogs fore tell a murder; the death of a man Leo Crow. When Anderton scrubs through the images, to his shock sees he is the perpetrator. Believing his innocence and is set up, Anderton is now on the run from his own people and starts to find out the mystery behind this murder before it occurs.Based upon the book by Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is a bleak and haunting view of the future. Though the premise behind Pre-Crime is creating a safer society, but there is still that force of human nature that can change and effect the future beyond any precognition. The future Steven Spielberg is a very alienating place. The steely blue, harsh white and drowning gray washes make a ghostly, unfriendly place, when it is meant to be nothing short of safe. It heightens the underbelly of society, where all the malevolent forces are still at work, in places you don't expect.Minorty Report has some great intelligent fundamentals. How can people be guilty of a crime if they never committed the crime, stopping a crime doesn't erase the fact that it was going to happen, is our future already written or do we have a choice in our fate. These woven with a great mystery and some spectaculars action makes a winning combination. This is one of the most intelligent mysteries in awhile, having so many layers to the story and depth in the characters.Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton all brought great performances. Tom Cruise brought so much pain and guilt to Anderton, bringing out the flaws in his tormented character. Colin Farrell also great as Danny, same to Max von Sydow as Lamar Burgess. Samantha Morton evoked so much pain and misery as Agatha, tired of seeing so much pain from the murders she foretells. Though Lois Smith's Dr. Iris Hineman and Tim Blake Nelson's Gideon were overacted, they are a minor flaw in the other wise great acting. Spielberg does another perfect job of directing. Really hitting the bulls eye making a wonderful thrilling ride of a bleak future.Minority Report is a surprising intelligent mystery from a master director, a spectacular, visually mind blowing watch.",10,0,1,11 December 2005
Fight Club," dark, provocative subject matter
","When our protagonist cant sleep due to his insomnia, he gets addicted to self help groups. Then out of the blue Marla starts to copy his following, going to all the same groups. Then we meet Tyler. Tyler makes soap and is full of facts about explosives. After they bash each other senseless one night, everyday people want to join in the fight; fight club is made.This is the modern day classic. With the dark, provocative subject matter to the engulfing visuals, its just pure brilliance. The social commentary here is like no other. Complexities of individuals, consumerism; not having the answers, masculinity and freedom. Just to f**k it all and cut the strings and be free. All the people who join fight club have a very hubris attitude, using fight club as a way of escaping their problems. This shows how its hard to change who we are, we do sometimes need to become sheep to then break away.Daivd Fincher is our modern day Stanley Kubrick, one of the most detailed directors around. In his bio, he did roughly 100 takes for one scene in the movie panic room. You could call that obsessive, but it makes his movies so flawless.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are just great together and its the best work they have ever done. Helena Bonham Carter, who i feel is very underrated, is so perfect as Marla. She makes Marla so naive yet she is the strongest character in the movie.If you haven't seen this movie, you better run out now and see this.",10,1,3,19 September 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," more wild adventure
","On the day of Elizabeth's and Will's wedding, the weather forebodes another mood. Both are arrested by Cutler Beckett, for accessories in the escape of Captian Jack Sparrow. Striking a deal with Beckett, Will is set to find Sparrow and awarded a full pardon on the return with a possession held by Jack; though Jack has his own Problems. Sent a message by Bootstrap Bill, Jack has been given the black spot, marked for Davy Jones on a debt Jack has to repay.When the idea of a sequel comes around, it's actually quite exciting. When you love a movie, you can't help but want another film to spend time with the characters. Though the down side of a second installment to a film is the terrible, often terminal disease Sequalitise. Every thing is done bigger and 'better', with more action that suffocates, while you watch your beloved characters shrivel away into mediocrity. Thankfully Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest survives this fatal blow.Writers of the first POTC; Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have once again stuck gold, delivering one engulfing adventure. Digging deeper into pirate mythology, this goes beyond the simple realms of pirates searching for treasure; treasure that isn't silver and gold. Characters are developed further, with more dimensions and further layers to reveal, while introducing new characters that are deeply developed.Much to many sequels, the action over runs and ultimately ruins the film. The action is quite sparing, in the sense that the action scenes are spread out and organically evolve from the story and characters, not the story playing second fiddle to the action. The characters are the real driving force of the film, with Sparrow's hyperbolic idiosyncrasies leading the front. Direction from Gore Verbinski makes the action so interesting, with intricate and engaging shots, adding a fast ferocity with a unrelenting grip.With the original cast reprising their roles, Johnny Depp steals and takes over every scene. He is so charismatic and brings so much wit with simple gestures. Never much an Orlando Bloom fan, he has actually matured second time round, dropping the love lorn stares and angst. Keira Knightley isn't that strong as the rest of the cast. Bill Nighy is so unrecognisable as Davy Jones, yet perfectly cast for the role.With the inevitable opening for the third installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest carries the same wild adventure as the first.",9,2,8,6 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," wild adventure
","In the fog at sea, a small boy, Will floats on a scrap plank. Picked up by the British Navy commanded by Governor Swann and Norrington, Will is taken into care by Elizabeth, Governor Swan's daughter. Elizabeth discovers that Will is a pirate carrying a gold trinket, yet keeps this secret. Eight years later, Norrinton is soon to be announced as Commodore Norrinton and reveal his love for Elizabeth. Will is a black smiths apprentice, with a hidden love for Elizabeth. Arriving at Port Royal on a sinking ship, pirate Captain Jack Sparrow is looking to commandeer a ship to continue his travels. When a phantom ship, the Black Pearl comes into port, commanded by Captain Barbossa, Jack, Will and Elizabeth become entangled in the Black Pearls cursed crew and their goal to lift the curse.Strangely based upon a theme park ride at the Disney theme park, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting adventure. For a long time, pirate movies have been a disappointing venture; its hard to say when a good pirate movie was. The genre was close to be non-existent. Director Gore Verbinski and screen writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought to pirate film into a new age and revitalised a very dwindling genre.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all the standard elements of a pirate film; savvy characters, treasure, boat caught in thunderous storm, people walking the plank, but its the induction of the supernatural element that elevates Pirates of the Caribbean from just a standard pirate film. The cursed pirates turning into skeletons in the moonlight spins the whole notion of the genre. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought a real authentic element; the lingo and dialog, the pirate code, adds more realism and authenticity.Really making Pirates of the Caribbean all the better is the character driving force it holds. The character are detailed and fleshed out; they are all so unique. The life of the film rests upon Johnny Depp, bringing his most memorable and best performance of his career; he is the most versatile actor of this age in cinema. Johnny as the miscreant Jack Sparrow, with all his blasé idiosyncrasies, are impossible to turn away. Orlando Bloom at time over plays, with his love lorn looks, yet does a great act. As the beautiful damsel Elizabeth, Keira Knightley is wonderful. Making for an ultimate pirate, Geoffrey Rush is just flawless. He makes Barbossa so charismatic, with some tongue in cheek wit.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one swash buckling adventure and one of the best pirate films in such a very long time.",9,1,4,2 June 2006
Hostel," humanities dark side
","Two friends, Paxton and Josh are backpacking across the European country. In Paris they join with Icelandic traveler Oli, now the trio are resting in Amsterdam. These three have one focus; drugs and sex, with T & A filling every scene possible. You could call them misogynistic, but they are just acting out what basically every backpacker does. While at the Hostel in Amsterdam, they receive a tip on a hostel in the town Bratislava in Slovakia. Beautiful women and drugs await them in this place of paradise. Hitting with the local women at the hostel, the three can't believe their luck. The following day Oli disappears, no indication of his whereabouts. Soon Josh disappears, with Paxton revealing a dark spot in this town. Held in a dilapidated factory, people can pay to fill their wildest, more to the point disturbing fantasy, to torture and kill people; preying on the tourist that flow through.Unashamedly, we are thrown into this dark, disturbingly sick world by Eli Roth. The torture unleashed upon the victims are slow and painful, through such emotional, primal screams that fill the halls of the factory. Violence and disturbing images have always been apart of horror, with directors pushing the limits as time has moved forward. Though it has been moving slowly into the main stream market. While the violence is raised, the film loses that psychological edge, where subliminal violence greatly enhanced that psychological mind set. Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, worked on the psychological tension, using subtlety and unknown elements that never reveal themselves, which worked much better than just being served everything up front; it takes the mystery away.Hostel lacks a lot of suspension and builds no real tension. The town Bratislava has so many small streets, and tightly close together builds, yet it doesn't feel suffocating, nor any ominous mood. The tension only rises during the torture scenes, perfectly joined by the dark and grungy rooms, with endless tool of pain.While the suspension does lack, there is an element that Eli Roth does tap into with Hostel. There is a reason why these people spend so much money on the pain of their unwilling victims, the primal entity that resides in all people. That adrenalin that shows through the tortures eyes, showing the pure ecstasy. What made this element hard hitting is the one conversation that procured it, from a man about to take part of this 'fetish'. While this does say Hostel is based on actual event, though it isn't, it does provide much food for thought, constantly thinking that this may actually happen.Eli Roth has craftily created this disturbing place. While his script does fall in a lot of the dialog, the situation is made disturbingly. The acting doesn't give us much empathy. Jay Hernandez gives an average performance, though shows great arrogance in Paxton in the early scenes. Derek Richardson shows the best of all the actors, though by no means great. Eythor Gudjonsson is wonderfully irritating as Oli, giving much relief when he's picked off early.Hostel does has its disturbing moments, and takes a disturbing look at humanities darker side; snuffing people off for an adrenalin rush like no other, Hostel relies to heavily on the confronting violence and lacks a lot of suspension, cutting itself short for a great horror film.",5,0,1,23 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," captivating
","London is in turmoil during the war, with the Pevensie family abandoning their home. The four children; Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy are sent off to live with Professor Kirke. The house keeper Mrs. MacReady has strict rules, with the children finding it a very dull place. During a game of hide and seek, Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to another world; the world of Narnia. Soon Lucy meets a faun Mr. Tumnus, inviting her to tea and and reveals the implications of her presence. Lucy returns through the wardrobe to tell the others, with a lot of disbelief. Lucy unable to make the others believe, during the night goes back through, with Edmund not far behind. On Edmunds arrival, he accidentally meets the White Witch, who is eager to meet the rest of his siblings. Soon Lucy and Edmund have Peter and Susan in Narnia, but with their presence, Narnia is about to change. When two beavers take them into protection, they tell the Pevensies that there is a prophecy that foretells that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will come to Naria and end the eternal winter, ending the rule of the White Witch. On Edmunds meeting of the Witch, she promised him glory, so Edmund runs off to her castle. When the Witch is alerted to their presence, she keeps Edmund captive and sends off her wolves to kill the other Penvensies. With the three children needing help to save Edmund, they ask help from Aslan, the lion who once ruled Naria. Willing to help them, Aslan leads them and an army to fight back for the rule of Naria.The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a magical, captivating film. As Lewis and Tolkien were contemporaries of their time and friends, its hard not to see similarities to The Lord of the Rings. Yet once you past this tiny stone, your transported into a world that is wholly different to Middle Earth. The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is more of a children's version of Lord of the Rings, yet it doesn't fall into the trap of being solely a children's movie. There are adults who have read these books and this is raised so it captures the adults inner child, while bringing a new generation of children into this celebrated book.The World of Naria is a broad, sweeping place that is magnificently brought to the screen. The heavy winter snow of the forest and the plains are so captivating, that you get distracted by them. When the snow melts away you find a bright and warm world being released from the cold. The creatures of Narnia are a wonderful array of fairytale creatures and modern animals. Whats great is that Andrew Adamson didn't rely so heavily on CGI to create the creature; using a lot of puppetry in the mix to make a more realistic feel. Aslan is wonderfully created, perfectly integrated with a high level of realism.Andrew Adamson has done a huge leap from directing computer animated films, to the live action. While Adamson is great on the computer animated films, there are times his direction seemed to drop, as it is very different directing live action to CA. Though it only drops a few times, he has done a wonderful job at bringing this world of Narnia to life. His directing abilities really shine during the battle sequence, bring his eye of detail out. The battle was a spectacular sequence, with all the creatures doing battle. The acting was one of the weaker elements of the film. The four lead children while doing good jobs, didn't reach a performance that emotionally grabbed you. Though Georgie Henley as Lucy really takes your heart, she has so much talent for such a young girl. Tilda Swinton was really cold hearted as the White Witch, though i felt she could have gone further and brought an even more menacing performance, where ever word she said was just tainted with coldness. The voice talent of the creatures was also great. Ray Winstone and Dawn French do great jobs as Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe does fall short on the epic grandeur that it was aiming for, yet it doesn't fall short of a wonderful family movie that will captivate your imagination and bring that inner child back to life.",8,0,1,25 December 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," an entertaining watch, one of the better sequeals
","The ice age is nearing its end. Global warming is heating everything up, melting the ice that has kept the rising water back. As our three companions; Manny, Sid and Deigo realise the valley is about to become the new sea floor, they set across the land to find higher ground. Though the rising water isn't their only problem, Manny believes he's the last mammoth alive. After Sid and Deigo encounter two possums; Crash and Eddie, they soon find another mammoth, Ellie; only problem is she thinks she's a possum too.The first Ice Age was a welcome change in computer animation, with Pixar ruling over the area. Ice Age: The Meltdown, follows same suit, not really changing the formula around, only with the human characters taken out. This sequel doesn't really pull out many punches with the laughs, it plods along at a steady pace, yet keeps the jokes at a constant pace, so it doesn't fall flat; even if the jokes aren't ultimately that funny.Still the funniest of all is Scrat, still on a never-ending quest for his unattainable acorn. Scrat is much like the Wyle Coyote to his acorn Road Runner. No matter how hard he tries, it never ends happy. In this respect it becomes a redundant situation; yet it's such a farce and still the highlights of the movie.Reprising the roles, Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary are still perfect. Adding to the voice talent, Queen Latifah as the confused mammoth/possum Ellie, Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as the energetic possums Crash and Eddie. Will Arnett is great as the Lone Vulture stalking the animals and Jay Leno as the con-turtle Fast Tony.Just shy of the first Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown is one of the better sequels, not trying to make everything bigger and better, just an entertaining watch.",7,1,1,13 April 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," the brown liquid
","This is quite an interesting view. With a series of short films that are linked by the act of drinking coffee and smoking, its quite original. Though this is abit of a mixed affair. Some of the films are quite slow or not very engaging, while the other are brilliant and so funny and totally engaging. But that can happen when you don't have a straight forward story.The stand outs are Some where in California with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits; with them talking about quitting smoking while they're smoking. Cousins; where Cate Blanchett plays both roles. Cousins?; where Alfred Molina tells Steven Coogan that they are relate and should make a movie about this. And Delirum where Bill Murray is hiding as a waiter and serving GZA and RZA from the Wu-Tang clan.If you know Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man, you know how well he handles the Black and White medium. The black and white is actually symbolising the subject of this films, Coffee and Cigarettes - Black and White. The direction is striped to bare essentials. Shots are kept simple and is very affective; enhancing the mood, it kinda feels your there in these conversations.If your looking for something different, and want to listen to some very out there conversations, this is a great watch.",8,1,2,29 August 2005
Oldboy," Shocking
","After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released from his tiny cell. Though he doesn't know why he was imprisoned in the first place, or released. Though this is his task. He has five days to find out who did this and why it happened, and seek his revenge.This is a great romp through the revenge genre and for the violence. This does have intense violence, but its not all in your face. A lot does happen without you seeing it, but psychological violence is so much worse. I wont talk about any of the scenes as the impact wont have that kick to the face that it deals out.The look and feel is real dark and gritty. Mostly using a bleak grey wash to up the disturbing atmosphere, there are shots of seedy wood grain, contrasting scenes and giving you a few moments to relax before your shot back into the dark side of this revenge tale.Oldboy i found did feel like the movie Saw, but did it much better. Like Saw, person is taken and locked away and must learn what they have done to survive. Though there is Kill Bill thrown in here as well; revenge to be bestowed upon all who get in Oh Dae-Su's way. The music is also like 2001, a space odyssey. Contrasting ultra modern settings with classical music, mostly violins, creating a tight dark atmosphere.Oldboy is violent, dark, thought provoking and somehow beautiful within and very disturbing tale.",9,9,79,12 September 2005
Batman Returns," fantastic squeal
","It has been apart of all sequels to go bigger and better in an attempt to surpass or even match the original film. While many fail and fade away, their are those few sequels that hit all the right buttons and not surpass, but leaves the original behind. Tim Burton's return to the Batman franchise, takes it to an all new level.The first Batman, a classic in its own rights, is a dark, Gothic tale of revenge. The visual aesthetic has a distinct tone; dark heavy shadows with deep pastels. Batman Returns shows Burton evolving and changing Batman's world. Batman Returns is a dark, romantic fairy tale; with a more monochromatic style working to this tale. Returns does follow steps like all sequels with hard challenges, more villains, fights are more stylised and happen more often, but Returns goes even further to bring a more interesting story.Written by Daniel Waters, Batman Returns is better written and digs deeper into it's characters and reveals more layer in Bruce and Batman. Bruce still grapples with his parents death, but more focus on his love life and the problem he faces with his alter ego. Batman himself become more humane, falling for the wrong woman and hitting public despise. The villains themselves follow a different pattern. Penguin starts off as an animal with a hidden agenda, but he develops as he also tries to work into humanity and for people to accept who he is, and the forgiveness of his parents abandoning him as a child. Catwoman is one of the most interesting villains, as a sexy femme fatale. While she has a motive of revenge against Shreck, her ultimate goal is fun and exerting herself from her repressed and empty life.Doning the black cape again, Michael Keaton brings an even stronger performance as Bruce and Batman. Danny DeVito is amazing as Penguin, really bringing an ugly side to Penguin, not just visually. Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and sassy as Selina/Catwoman. Christopher Walken is greatly vulgar as Shreck.One of the few sequels to surpass the original, Batman Returns is a fun dark tale.",9,1,2,29 August 2006
Hot Fuzz," hot stuff
","Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, director/writers/actor respectively, struck gold with their previous film Shaun of the Dead, for what is a cult hit. Wright and Pegg, tapping the same source of Shaun, are far from bleeding their well dry. Spinning conventions of the zombie genre around with the rom-com, Wright and Pegg give action it's due in the small village of Sandford, where death is more prone from an over indulgence of tea and cake at the local NWA.Sandford starts to become lively on the arrival of hot shot and all round saint of the law, Officer Nicholas Angel, transfered from London after being extremely to good at the job and making everyone pathetic in the shadows of his commendations. Teamed with lout Danny Butterman, Angel unable to shed his rock solid adherence to the law, loses mental stability in the sleepy village where the law is transparent. After a series of seemingly unfortunate accidents, Angel smells foul play, though convincing the locals their village has a murderer is harder than apprehending the killer.The chemistry of Hot Fuzz lies upon Pegg and Frost. Perfectly complimenting each other, whether Pegg is stiff and robotic and Frost runs with the shenanigans, or both in action mode, there is a natural play off one another, never fighting for the punchline or spotlight. Writers Wright and Pegg, don't really reach the creative level of Shaun of the Dead, in retrospect the revelation of who's behind it all is rather esoteric, but that and plot holes are quickly filled with a 'who cares' mentality. The comedy is non stop, along with a constantly spiked energy level, with Wright showing of his flare as a talented director in one bombastic yet creative shoot out. Pegg and Wright have laced moments, heavily on Point Break and Bad Boys 2, with myriad of references to virtually every buddy cop film, cop show and other films and shows to spark the childhood memories.Together Pegg and Frost make strong leading actors, though they are surrounded by countless solid supporting actors and cameos. Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan as the London officers is Angels transfer. Bill Bailey, Olivia Colman, Kevin Eldon, Karl Johnson as the woeful Sandford officers, a solid performance from Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as ignorant detectives Wainwright and Cartwright. Stand out performance by Timothy Dalton, as the sly greasy shop owner Simon Skinner, and all the members of the NWA. Whether a Shaun of the Dead fan or not, Hot Fuzz has all the goods for anyone wanting an intelligent comedy/action film.",9,2,4,15 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," a rare gem
","In 1963, two strangers, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are looking for work. Both find work herding sheep for Joe Aguirre on Brokeback Mountain. Both men are completely different from each other, Ennis is extremely introverted and emotionally isolated, not connecting to others through his mumbled words. Jack is open and self confident, with inspirations of glory on the rodeo scene. Over the days stuck in the isolated mountain range, their friendship makes a strong connection between them, soon becoming a highly intimate and emotionally charged relationship. When the season is over, returning to humanity, they both go their separate ways. Ennis marries his fiancé Alma and have two girls, while Jack tries the rodeo with little success, though soon meets Lureen both marrying with a baby boy soon to follow.Brokeback Mountain is one of those exceptional films that come ever so rarely, that instantly marks itself in history. The emotional manipulation is wielded so strong that its hard not to be swept up in the emotionally charged relationship of Ennis and Jack. While Ennis is happiest with Jack, he understands the ramification of public scrutiny, which Jack fails to understand, not wanting a hidden life. Taking the brunt end are Jack and Ennis's wives, stuck in their empty, impassioned marriages, constantly questioning themselves and the nature of Jack and Ennis's friendship.The subtlety of Ang Lee's direction reveals the beauty of Brokeback Mountain. Lee superbly connects the dilemmas of the characters and the landscapes they wonder. The breath taking, sweeping, remote landscape of the Wyoming Mountains, brilliantly captured by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, are so lush and alluring that your uncontrollably drawn in. Brokeback Mountain could not have been placed in the hands of another director, Lee never being didactic while shooting you right into the heart of the film. While set in the open plains of the mountain, the story is so emotionally suffocating. The claustrophobia is tautly constructed by Ang Lee, tightly grabbing you and never letting go.The truth and honesty is the real distinguishing facet of Brokeback Mountain. Never does the story feel artificial or unrealistic. The themes are so universal of love stories, perfectly depicting unrequested love; where everything doesn't work out and doesn't end happy. Enahncing this is the somber, mellow acoustic guitar, constantly encapsulating the heart break and angst between Ennis and Jack.Nothing short of exceptional can describe Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal performances. Never have both actors been so revelatory in their career so far. Heath Ledger perfectly embodies the introversion and depth of Ennis. Ledger wonderfully shows the change of Ennis over the twenty year period the film takes. Jake Gyllenhaal does an equally brilliant performance, vividly bringing the angst and heartbreak to Jack. While it is the male actors that are center stage, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are both sorely overlooked. Michelle Williams is outstanding, with her shining above Ledger and Gyllenhaal. Williams is so dramatically charged, giving her career defining performance. While she has a minor role, Anne Hathaway is great as Lureen, finishing the perfect touch of brilliant casting.Deserving of all the accolades it's given, Brokeback Moutain is a heart breaking love story like no other. It's simple perfect in every way.",10,24,27,11 February 2006
Ed Wood," Wood was one interesting man
","Ed Wood is a man who strives for what he wants. Visions of making Hollywood films; to direct, produce, write and star in the film, like Orson Wells. Backing him along, Dolores sticks with him through the falls. When a small production company plans to make a film on sex change, Ed feels he is suited to direct, for a special talent. Ed is a transvestite, a hidden fetish since childhood. Taking control over the film, Ed changes the film into a semi-biographical film about his secret desire of wearing ladies clothes; while coming out with this to his girlfriend. The movie flops and Ed is stuck again. On a chance meet with veteran actor Bela Lugosi; Dracula, Ed tries to make a monster film; yet needs to raise the money first.A semi-biography, Ed Wood is a great satire on Hollywood, film making and the lives in entangles. Ed is such a hubris man, believing he faults no wrong and is the next Orson Wells. Only one who doesn't believe him, Dolores, when she finds out about his fetish. Though Ed charms everyone to follow him so blindly, while he is walking blind himself; the blind leading the blind. It's hard not to see why Ed Wood became the worst director of time, never taking second takes; no matter how bad the first one was.Tim Burton, a brilliant visual director, uses the monochromatic black and white film to excellent measure. Using classic shot and camera angles, Burton gives homage to the noir 50's cinema. Johnny Deep is an absolute knock out as Wood. He encapsulates that hubris nature of Wood so perfect, and the charm he uses to pull everyone along. Martin Landau is stellar as Bela Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as Wood's two loves are both amazing. Bill Murray is glamorously flamboyant, he steals the show every time he's on screen.Ed Wood is an amazing film, looking at the starting point on one of film histories worst directors.",8,3,4,7 April 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," could have been a lot more
","The earth's climate is change, at a phenomenal rate. From effects of global warming, the earth is unable to take this ever increasing disaster. The counter effect of the global warming is a climate shift to the next ice age. Natural disasters are occurring one after the other; tornadoes, hail storms, relentless rain, all growing in magnitude. Stuck in the middle of it is Jack, who had predicted this change of weather. In New York is Jack's son Sam, on a school trip. Stuck in New York after a giant wave flooded the city, Jack is determined to get Sam out before the city falls to the impending storm.The day after tomorrow is an interesting look at the current weather trends that have been predicted by scientist. At its core there is the message that we have to start looking after our earth or this could be our fate of the future, and it does present this well. The downfall though is that this doesn't elevate itself from the standard disaster film. It has all the clichÃ©d characters and events; iconic monuments being destroyed. The dramatic scenes are over done with no help from the over acting cast. Dennis Quaid is no stranger to over acting, being the main culprit. Jacke Gyllenhaal gives the only good performance, though nowhere near his best.Though this is not an exercise of brilliant acting, its the spectacle of the disasters that take center frame, and they are outstanding. The tornadoes ripping through Los Angelas, the hail storm in Japan, the gigantic wave flooding New York and the eye of the storm instantly freezing everything are amazingly captured by Roland Emmerich. They are so captivating and wonderfully done with the special effects. But though the disaster side of Day after Tomorrow are great, they don't care the slack of the human elements and the plot holes of the story.It isn't the best disaster movie, though it's no where near the worst. It's an interesting look at what may happen.",6,0,0,7 January 2006
X-Men," wonderful adaptation
","Evolution has created the next link in the chain, people who have special powers. They have been classified as mutants by the 'normal' population, who fear these different people, greeting them with trepidation. Rogue has only realised she is a mutant after she place her boyfriend into a coma; she takes peoples' energy. On the run she runs into Wolverine; another mutant with fast healing abilities and three retractable blades on each hand. The two are attack by an mutant Sabertooth on unknown intentions, Rogue and Wolverine are saved and taken into the care of Professor Xavier; with his protégés Storm, Cyclops and Jean. Xavier has been fighting for equality between mutants and people, but a former friend Magneto has the opposite idea. Magneto want superiority over the human race; believing mutants are the next ruler of earth. Magneto has devised a plan with his henchmen Sabertooth; Toad and Mystique that will make people think differently about mutants.X-Men is a faithful adaptation of the comic book series, without ever falling into the pit of over the top sensibilities. Bryan Singer has played it on the lower keys where the characters come to the fore front; instead of the action. There are a lot of character in X-Men, yet it doesn't over load you. They may not be fleshed out a lot, but your still are able to understand them and attach yourself to them. The most developed is Wolverine who has a lot of past to uncover, yet it still would have been nice to have more depth on the other characters.The action is kept on the low down, there isn't a lot of it, and it soars in that respect. With action and special effects kept to the minimum, they have been able to develop the characters and the story. As the special effects are used a lot, it allows the scenery to come forward, and the scenery is visually rich and detailed. X-Men has a real quiet tone, but from this the subtexts really are uncovered. There are a lot of ideas and morals beneath the surface; acceptance, tolerance, bigotry,social stature, and that fear that everyone has when they don't understand the unknown. There are some great scenes between Rogue and Wolverine that elevate this from just am action film and really humanise the story. There is a sense of realism to the story, reflecting a lot of the racial intolerance in humanity at our current times.X-Men shows what great casting can lead to. All the actors perfectly fit their roles, with a lot of unknown actors showing some great talent. Hugh Jackman is great as the rugged Wolverine, Famke Janssen wonderful as Jean, same with Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin shines as Rogue, James Marsden also great as Cyclops. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart both are great in their roles, Ian as the determined Magneto and Patrick as the humble Xavier.X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations as it goes beyond the action and delves deeper to bring a very deep and meaningful story, with so much subtext to explore.",9,0,0,24 December 2005
Zodiac," Fincher's craft maturing
","The release of a David Fincher film is a time to celebrate. Fincher has staked out an impressive claim as a director, with only a handful of films in his cannon, a few already cemented in cult and contemporary classic status. Zodiac feels a long time coming, five years between Zodiac and Panic Room; his longest gap, yet a gap that shows Fincher has grown as a film maker. Returning to the detective/crime genre, a genre Fincher redefined with Seven over a decade ago, Zodiac is by no means another Seven, stripping off controversial, heavy subject matter or Seven or Fight Club, or the free roaming camera work of Panic Room, for Zodiac see's Fincher with his most restrained and mature piece of work.The Zodiac killings in San Fransico' is one of great unsolved cases, numerous suspects; namely Arthur Leigh Allen, with no conviction ever place upon anyone. Zodiac based upon Robert Graysmith's novel, follows Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Fransico Chronicle newspaper, Inspector David Toschi and Paul Avery, a crime journalist for the Chronicle, three men who were the most affected by the Zodiac investigation. For an un-shut case, Fincher with James Vanderbilt's screenplay, wring every note of tension, with bated breathlessness, from the eerie opening scenes, to an ending that dwindles into thrilling nothingness. The dramatic exhale Fincher builds to never arrives, for credit to his craft as a film maker, makes Zodiac compelling viewing for a film that reaches no real conclusion. Set around the case and the investigation, Zodiac explores the obsession, turmoil and sheer pain caused from the investigation spanning decades. Harris Savides's cinematography is classically captured with still H-D cameras, bronzed out nights, information lined everywhere, capturing the time period with precession.The actual killer of the piece, is actually not the main story arc. After witnessing the murder of a young couple, with a few more to witness soon after, Zodiac focuses more on Graysmith, Toschi and Avery, who become entangled with this investigation; unwillingly or compelled to uncover the murderer. The most affected is Graysmith, his obsessive urge to solve the investigation, at times when no one else will. Constantly hitting dead ends, the audience along with Graysmith, sift the never ending clues and leads, heading to nowhere. To Zodiac's conclusion, you can feel Fincher is smiling over the fact that nothing is resolved in the end.Pushing nothing but perfection out of the cast, all actors deliver performances at the top of their game. Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery and Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi are nothing short of brilliant. Surroundded by an impressive supporting cast, all give amazing performances; most notedly by Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Brian Cox cameo as Melvin Belli and John Carroll Lynch as suspect Arthur Leigh Allen.Zodiac is David Fincher's most muted and mature film, evolving in his craft. It may not be the controversial slice of cinema many might be expecting, though like Fincher's previous films, Zodiac is compulsory viewing.",8,1,2,17 May 2007
The Prestige," Nolan is the real magician
","Robert Angier and Alfred Borden have worked together since stage hands. Both wish to be the grandest magician, creating tricks that the world has never seen. Their friendship goes sour after Angier's wife, Julia, dies during 'the drowning woman' trick. Angier continues to build his act with craftsman Cutter, a designer for the illusions. Borden tries to crown himself as the greatest magician, yet lacks the style to drawn an audience. Borden and Angier's rivalry thickens after Borden performs the greatest trick 'The Transported Man'. Obsessed to know his secret, Angier is consumed to discover Borden's method.Angier is a showman. Style, grace and charm are his weapons. A magician relies on miss direction to fool us all. Angier is his own miss direction. His showman ship out reaches his craft, knowing his limitations and playing to that strength. After his wife death, revenge is his only driving force. He doesn't want to be the greatest magician, Angier wants Borden to know he will always be better than him, with no restraint to his conquest. Borden is no showman. Lacks pizazz and style, unable to make the simplest of tricks seem unreal to the audience. His hubris strains his progression, over confident in himself; but with reason. 'The Transported Man' is the greatest illusion beheld by any magician, he finally makes the simplest trick into the grandest of all; no wonder Angier becomes consumed with figuring out the method. They are each others opposite and equal, their antithesis. Their rivalry isn't one of brawn nor of words; they don't talk much after Julia's death. Their fights are of the mind, psychologically and game of wits to sabotage the other.Obsession and identity crisis is deeply explored through out The Prestige. Stated by Cutter, you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Though this is not about the death of a little bird for the sake of a trick, lives are torn and destroyed over two mens bitterness. Obsessed with each other, Angier and Borden's original identities are unrecognisable, with those they hold dear holding the brunt of each ones torture. The real magician of this act is director Christopher Nolan. Like a magician, Nolan draws us in nice and close. Cinematography by Wally Pfister, our view of the periodic time is confined and constricted. Our surroundings are blinded by whats happening. Smoke and mirrors, miss direction utilising the non linear time sequence, confuse us from what we are meant too see. Nolan is gifted with his craft as a film maker, playing with the audience. Offering his pledge, creating the turn, then the prestige of the final act, where the revelation finally emerges.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as Angier and Borden respectively, are both amazing. Jackman greatly evolves with Angier from a man of craft, to a man torn of revenge and obsession. Bale perfectly shows Borden torn between his love and his love of magic. Michael Caine shows his talent and perfect as Cutter. David Bowie is a real stand out in his minor role as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson wraps beauty and talent nicely.The Prestige is one film that is simple magic. Another mile stone from Nolan.",9,6,10,15 November 2006
Sleepy Hollow," wonderfully Burton
","Sleepy Hollow is a town in the late 1800's, at the turn of the century. Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a series of murders that have happen. All the murders are connected to the myth of the headless horseman, who cuts off all the victims heads.Once Ichabod arrives at Sleepy Hollow, you know there is more happening under the surface than just headless murderer. With red herrings thrown over the place, the mystery of the headless horseman and his murders becomes quite thick and entangled.If you are very accustom to Tim Burton films than you know what to expect. Like all of Burton's films, this is just visually stunning. The seedy greys create such a bleak and miserable atmosphere to great extent, giving the town and woods a very claustrophobic feeling. Burton's direction is flawless as usual, he is a master of his craft.Johnny Depp has created a great partnership with Burton, always giving a great performance. Depp handles the flaky yet over eager Crane with great fun. Ricci is perfect as the love interest, never overacting in places of danger. Gambon, Jones, Griffiths, McDiarmid, Gough all do well as the town elders.This is one movie where i didn't solve the ending. From the great script and plotting, this gives you clues, but never spoils the surprise. Which a find a welcome surprise. Most others you can figure it out before the end. I always praise movies that make me gasp at the twist.If you love Burton, or need a movie to get into Burton films, this is a great starting point, and is a must see.",9,1,2,19 August 2005
Silent Hill," runs just like a game
","Rose has been having trouble with her daughter Sharon, who suffers from sleep walking. Each night this has been putting Sharon in more danger, with her constantly saying Silent Hill. In an attempt to help Sharon, Rose takes her daughter to this town Silent Hill. The town itself is a ghost town, laden with fog and never ending rain of ash. No one lives there, with good reasons, with a dark, benevolent force haunting the town.Silent Hill walks a very fine line between film and its game roots. Screenwriter Roger Avary, has faithfully followed the source material, to bring a film squarely aimed at the fans. Just like the game there is an a constant accumulation of strange and awe gaspingly weird events and creatures, but there lacks an internal logic. Silent Hill runs just like a game, with a lot of things never making ultimate sense and lacking a central coherent plot. Conheriance may not ultimately be needed in a game, but it doesn't translate well. Avary seems to have aimed low for his skills, with great work for Killing Zoe, The Rules of Attraction and work on the stories for Pulp Fiction.Even for its incoherence, there is this engaging element that just constantly keeps you fixated. Largely part of this is to the set design, art direction and special effects. The sets are so detailed; so much dirt, grit and grunge exceedingly evoke constant dread of forthcoming death. The hideous, deformed creatures are nicely freakish, ripped out of some demented nightmare. The rapid deterioration of buildings and rooms are mesmerising. The fantastic dark, ambient, electro soundtrack is perfectly used to the visuals.The disappointing part of Silent Hill, it's not scary or very thrilling. Your pulse doesn't raise nor quicken, from so many missed opportunities to get the blood pumping. The mood might be eerie and creepy, but that's not enough for a film of this genre. The scares at least don't ride on a soundtrack turned onto eleven, yet it's ear piercing from every scream leaving Sharon's mouth. A heavy handedness also comes with revealing information. The time when all is revealed, it all goes clunk, from it's bluntness of giving all answers at once instead of bits to pick up along the way.Paper thin accurately describes the acting. While the strongest link, Radha Mitchell is disappointing as Rose. Laurie Holden looks more like a dominatrix then a cop. Sean Bean is weak as chalk as Christopher. Deborah Kara Unger in unrecognizable as Dahlia, getting real dirty and one crazy hair style.When you step back, not doesn't completely hold together, but it keeps your attention from wondering away.",6,2,3,31 August 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," the ultimate satire
","When you look at the films of Stanley Kubrick, comedy never seems to make a appearance. The bulk of Stanley's films contain very serious and dark matter; a lot being very de-humanizing and so detached from being connected to actual reality. You can look at a Clockwork Orange and you call that a very black comedy, where the comedy walks in hand with perverse sexual behaviour. But Kubrick only has one comedy in his line of films, and its the greatest war parody to be ever made, and has no real equal.A general sets out orders for his troops to make a nuclear air assault on the USSR, he believes that they are trying to hurt out 'prescious bodily fluids'; hence the theory why the Russians only drink vodka. His aide Mandrake trying to stop this assault tries to reason with Gen. Ripper, trying to get the recall code, but becomes painfully hard after the generals suicide. Meanwhile the president is on the hot line, telling a drunken Soviet Premier of the USSR that there has been a silly mistake and are about to be bombed; but so called friendship problem halt this. You never call to say hello the Premier drunkenly says to the President. The president's adviser, a crazed ex-Nazi, Dr. Stranglove brings forth bad news. He reveals that the USSR has a doomsday machines; capable of wiping out the inter human race; for good.Dr. Strangelove, or how i learn't to stop worrying and love the bomb is a comedy classic. With subject matter that deals with nuclear Holocaust and doomsday, you wonder how this can be a comedy. The satire runs so thick though. Any movie that can say, ' you can't fight in here, this is the war room' shows this is a very forked tongue satire. The bases of the script was upon the book by Peter George, which was actually a serious look at war. Somehow when Stanley was writing the script, he turned a dramatic book into a full blown comedy. This does have some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history; the riding of the H bomb by Slim Pickens has been homaged so many times. Army men shooting out in front of a sign say Peace is our Profession. The compromise of intelligence if the Russian Ambassador sees the 'big board'.The standout feature of Dr. Strangelove though is the acting. Peter Sellers is brilliant as all the characters he plays. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and of course Dr. Strangelove, the standout is Strangelove. In the end where Strangelove rises from his chair in shock, you can see Peter Bull - the Russian ambassador laughing; they could not get a shot without him laughing.If you haven't seen this, your missing out on Kubricks one and only classic comedy.",10,3,5,22 October 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," magical, adult fairytale
","Fairy tales have always been with us. Tales for children, stored with life lessons, morals and universal parables and themes. Fairy tales all carry a dark element, dug into their subtext or subtly played upon. The Grimm Brothers tales played on that darkness more, while Disney left it in the background to be dug out. Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale that isn't one for the young; an adult fairytale, yet tapping into the imagination of the young at heart and that inner child. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth draws out that darkness, pushing it right to the forefront, creating a magical film to behold and go down as a defining film in del Toro's career.Comparison and a parallel could be drawn between Pan and Alice in Wonderland; but this isn't rightly so. Wonderland had it's nexus point at the rabbit hole, the fantasy of Pan's Labyrinth roots itself into reality, grounded by the protagonist Ofelia. Set at historical point, Pan starts on the decline of the Spanish Civil War, and the Fascist regime. Ofelia with mother Carmen, pregnant with child, move to live with Capitán Vidal, right in the middle of his mission of eliminating the guerrilla army and his own emotional war of so to be fatherhood and demons of his own father.The Labyrinth World is an elusive place. It's depth and grandeur are hinted upon, with our exploration only the tip. The allure of the Labyrinth World wields so much pull, it's deterring we're dropped back into reality and the emotional drama. Yet both realities carry one another and require a harmonious balance. The Labyrinth world draws it's power on imagination and power of the innocence, but it's the war ridden world that really plays on the darkness of fairy tales. While reality may be laced with a magical presence, the darker elements are used heavily in del Toro's use of violence. Not the bloodiest story told on film, but del Toro unflinchingly doesn't turn from the torture and violence; many deaths leave gruesome impressions. But both worlds exhibit that true nature of the fairytale; a true danger and horror. Ofelia's task in the lair of a child eating monster exudes this perfectly.Guillermo del Toro is an extremely visual director. The wonder and beauty held in Pan's Labyrinth is the visual aesthetic. Pan the Faun, other creatures and their worlds, are so vividly brought to life with brevity, based that they are created in a 'old fashion sense'; utilising sets and puppetry. Computerised effects are minimal for a more visceral experience. You can feel the dirt and grit of the Labyrinth world, with a genuine warmth. Pan is a wondrous sight to behold, amazingly acted by Doug Jones, along with strong performances by Ivana Baquero, Maribel Verdú and a commanding performance by Sergi López as monstrous Capitán Vidal.Superbly imaginative, beautifully dark and wondrous, just like a labyrinth, del Toro takes you on a journey of twists and shocking turns, leading to the inevitable center for one emotional ending. Pan's Labyrinth is truly magical.",9,2,4,14 January 2007
Final Destination 2," holds itself beside the original
","Kimberly and her friends are taking a road trip to Datona. The news reports that it is one year later from the airplane incident where Alex had a vision of a plane exploding. While waiting on an on-ramp to the freeway, Kimberly has a premonition of a massive highway crash. After she stops people for dying in the pile up, the 'survivors' have cheated death. Kimberly believes that the recurrence of this cheat to death, means that death is now coming to take them.Final Destination 2 doesn't really deviate from the first movie. A group of people cheat death, then death comes after them one by one. Though screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have changed things around, changing death tactics and order in which people go, so this doesn't end up as a cut and copy; like so many sequels do.Like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 isn't that great of a film. The acting again isn't great, nor is the dialog of the script. Taking over from James Wong, David R. Ellis direction is just a notch better; making the film look more slick and glossy; though Wong's grittier look help the suspense more. What made the first film so interesting were the elaborative death scenes. Ellis has increased the violence, and the death sequences are even more meticulously played out. The opening sequence of the car crashes is one of the most mind blowing, well crafted, orchestrated pile up crash I have seen in a movie.Just like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 is a guilty pleasure of a watch.",7,0,0,24 April 2006

Ending up being married to a cadaver is a great twist on the usual love story. Just like The Nightmare Before Christman, the stop motion animation is great, yet is more refined here and flows better and has much more detail to it. The blend of computer animation adds those touches that makes the animation flawless; its just astounding.All the character are wonderfully made. All the characters have been made to the extent that they basically become caricatures, bar from the three main leads who have been made more humanised; being that their characters are more innocent while everyone else is more jilted and two faced. The bleak, gray Victorian setting suits the story perfectly; suiting that rigid and conforming way of the Victorian life. The underworld is so bright and colourful; juxtaposing that notion there is more fun in the after life than in the living.The voice cast of Corpse Bride is great and perfectly casted. Johnny Deep is perfect as the timid Victor; he does have believable English voice. Helena Bonham Carter also is great as the Corpse Bride; making her so lively and a wonderful character. Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant and the great Christopher Lee all flourish in their roles and really make them their own.Though this is a short film, its a great film.",8,1,2,21 November 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," a fitting conclusion
","Picking up right we left in Reloaded, the machines are about to breach upon Zion, Neo is in a mysterious coma stuck between the matrix and the real world, Zion's defenses are being prepared, and finally Bane awakens; but in a very hostile manner. When Neo awakens too, he realises that he has to confront the source of the matrix and finally confront Agent Smith if Zion and all the people to survive. While he and Trinity both go to the Machine City, the others; Morpheus, Link, Niobi and the crew of the Hammer go back to Zion to help its defenses. Inside the dock of Zion, its an all out war. The machine diggers have breached the walls and thousands of sentinels are ready to kill all its inhabitants.The Matrix Revolutions is an all out action packed, visually amazing climatic conclusion to the matrix trilogy. The war of Zion is just amazing, the sentinels moving together as one being is just a sight to see. The action just keeps coming at a relentless pace. The chase of The Hammer ship being crawled over by hundreds of sentinels is also an amazing sequence. The Machine City is so detailed and has a real haunting presence with all the blue hues. The highlight of the film which everyone was waiting for is the final explosive showdown between Neo and Smith. While its a fight to remember, the only annoying part of the fight is when Neo and Smith start fighting in the sky and start flying around the place. It really took away from the intensity and over all impact of the fight.The visual effects are flawless, they are just so integrated that its hard to pick faults in them. Yet they do take away from the story. All the action and effects side step the narrative, making the plotting confusing at times. The fighting has also seem to lost that nobility from the first matrix, going for more style, losing that emotional core. The acting from everyone is very good, though abit over acted in places, but overall very good from all people. One part that didn't really need explaining though was the change in actor for The Oracle. Mary Alice who took over the role when Gloria Foster sadly died. It seemed pointless that they needed to explain why she looked different, adding confusion unless you've played the matrix game.The Matrix Revolutions is a great conclusion to this trilogy and will become a sci-fi classic in the years to come.",8,0,0,4 December 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," one great remake
","Between 1945 and 1962, the United States conduct 331 atmospheric nuclear tests in the New Mexico desert. Present day, the radio active fallout has deformed and mutated people living in the test area. When a group of scientist are savagely attacked, the Carter family are not far away, travelling by caravan to California. Head of the family, Big Bob, an ex-cop is stubborn, and despises his son in law, Doug who votes democratic and anti-gun lobbyist. Doug's wife Lynn tries to separate them as much as possible, while caring for their baby Catherine. Daughter Brenda rather be at the beach, mother Ethel once a hippie finds solace in religion and son Bobby who's along for the ride. At a decrepit gas station, a nameless attendant tells of a dirt road short cut through the hills. When the tires blow and the car crashes, the family soon find they're not alone.The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of Wes Craven's film of the same title. Unfamilar of Wes Craven's version, director Alexandre Aja has created a well crafted and suspenseful horror film. Aja takes time to set the scene and to flesh out the characters. The family dynamic is believable and honest; Bob dislike of Doug, small squibs between the siblings and parents. The emotional investment in the characters is genuine; which a lot of modern day horror films lack, making the experience all the harder to watch.Aja has also injected a lot of subtext, with the anti-nuclear testing and the governments denial. One point shows one of the mutated villains singing the Star Spangled Banner and honoring the American Flag, even to the knowledge that the 'normal people' made them the way they are. There is also small looks on family dynamics.As shown from Aja previous film High Tension, Aja is not ashamed to throw the blood and gore around. High Tension had a sense of violence for violence sake; it was really untamed. This time Aja restrains himself; though this is still very graphic and very violent, it has more style and holds more merit to it.This has some of the best acting in a horror film of late. Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are great as the parents. Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd and Vinessa Shaw are also great as the siblings. Really driving the film is Aaron Stanford as Doug. He makes Doug's transformation from weak anti-gun man, to gunslinging, ruthless killer credible.The Hills Have Eyes is one of the best remakes and horror films of late; it's unsettling and an exhausting ride.",8,0,0,23 April 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," stunning film
","Films of dysfunctional families come at a constant rate. Usually in the rom-com section and mostly used for cheap laughs and a reminder that your family can't be this bad. Though there is this ring of falseness to the proceedings. Little Miss Sunshine looks into the family dysfunction, crossed with a road trip and that stab of satire, to bring an honest look at family dynamics.When Frank, a gay scholar and ex number one expert on Marcel Proust, survives a failed suicide attempt, he is taken in by his sister Sheryl. Sheryl has a smoking problem and tries to keep the family together. Sheryl's husband Richard is a failed motivational speaker; with one monochromatic look at society. Their son Dwayne idolizes Nietzsche, and vowed an oath of silence till he is reaches his goal of being an air force pilot. Also shacked up is Richards dad Edwin; a fouled mouth man who speaks his mind, without hesitation.When daughter Olive wins a spot in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, Olive is screamingly beside herself, too the rest a nightmare. All agreeing to driving from Alberquerque to LA, crammed into a falling apart, bright yellow VW, people's limits hit boiling point. Richard's nine step program is not taking off with a book deal hanging in the balance, Dwayne laments his family, Sheryl tries to keep everyone together and looking after Frank, to stop him relapsing. With dysfunction all around her, Olive is the most sane of the bunch.Little Miss Sunshine is such an honest look at family dynamics, the dysfunction and border line meltdown many families run. First time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, with first time writer Michael Arndt, have created a stunning, debut feature film. Michael Arndt has created characters that are honest, holding a reality to them. Each character detailed with unique idiosyncrasies, and grow over this trip. The humor perfectly blends a mix of situation and character derived comedy, while mixing genuine pathos. Adding to the humour, Dayton and Valerie make some heart wrenching moments, adding some harsh juxtapositions with Arndt's script, making you laughing in some of the most inapt times.While not the biggest part of the film, the young beauty pageant is great satire. Much like mock-doc Drop Dead Gorgeous, you are taken to the back stage scene of this young pageant, and the sheer crassness they are. The young girls are from space than earth, looking more like aliens; Olive the only human girl, with the imperfections, glasses and pot belly. The pageant holds the crescendo of the film, with hysterical results; it's side splitting.The cast is the real driving force of Little Miss Sunshine. Greg Kinnear begins as one of the most irritating characters, though as Richard grows and realises he's the loser he constantly telling others they are, you really warm to him. Toni Collette is strong and flawless as Sheryl. Steve Carell steps out of the comedy and really shows his versatility, with a great dramatic role. Alan Arkin spits out all the great lines with such mirth. Paul Dano does very well showing much range while not speaking most of the film. Abigail Breslin is beautiful as Olive, with such innocence and the most together while everyone around her is falling apart.Little Miss Sunshine a real gem. Absolutely exhausted from laughing and running the ride of emotions.",10,1,4,6 October 2006
American Beauty," just brilliant
","Lester has hit a crisis in life. Unappreciated at work, his marriage with Carolyn falling apart; the intimacy has disappeared with a non-existent sex life. His daughter Jane's life resembles any teenager; confused, angst, unclear, while her friend Angela, loaded with self esteem dreams of being a model. Carolyn holds her facade of perfection, while her real estate job become more painful with every depressingly negative customer. Moving in next door, Ricky wanders on the edge of the social scene. His father Frank is emotionally repressed, never making conversation longer than a few sentences with Ricky. All of them have been stuck with their lives, yet while they break free from their dead ends, freedom has its price.American Beauty is one of the most beautiful movies ever to grace the history of film. The notion of suburbia's dark side; behind the white picket fence is a world of secrets, has been explored by many, though Sam Mendez has created such a deep and rich pathos of the characters; freedom and individualism, sex and desire, anxiety and change. Alan Ball's script is darkly witty, grabbing us from the get go. The humor slowly morphs, as the emotional tensity builds upon itself, buildings to its heart breaking crescendo.Sam Mendez's direction is beautifully enhanced by Conrad L. Hall's cinematography. The widescreen perfectly shows the irony of the world the characters live in. Rooms of the houses have symmetrical design, while the furnishings balance out each other; when the dilemma's of the characters are anything but balanced. The rich pastel colour palette is so vibrant. Thomas Newman's amazing score harmoniously works to the story, increasing the tension of every scene.In his Oscar winning role, Kevin Spacey is amazing. Embodying a man who has hit bottom, fitting his way out to his ideals, Spacey is just mesmerising. Annette Bening is also wonderful, bring the her best role of her career. Thora Birch brought so much beauty to Jane, matched wonderfully by Mena Suvari. Chris Cooper emotionally withdrawn role of Frank is amazing. Wes Bentley injected so much mystery and awe to Ricky, creating such an enigma of a character.For a comedy that makes you cry, and a drama that makes you laugh, American Beauty is one powerful film, becoming an instant classic.",10,1,2,31 August 2005
BASEketball," great satire on sport
","The world of sport has lost its meaning. Sports stars have lost joy and love of the game; caring more about the big bucks and the dealerships from companies. Its not until two friends; Coop and Remer create a new game that takes the world by storm. It baseball crossed with basketball; BASEketball. We have come to the end of the fifth Denslow cup and the Beers; Coop and Remer's team, have lost the game. Making it worse their owner how made Baseketball huge; Ted Denslow has died, chocked on a hot-dog. In Denslow's will the team goes to Coop; instead of Denslow's new wife Yvette. But the team reverts to Yvette if the Beers lose this season. Baxter Cain wants to change BASEkeball so that teams can earn more money, but Coop wont change the ideals of the game; where members cant switch team and they all earn the same amount of money. So Baxter and Yvette join together to make the Beers lose.This movie has that great Zucker comedy to it; which made the naked gun movies so great. What makes this movie good is that there is this satire on the sports world; fickleness of fans, themed sports night - free range chicken night is just a brilliant idea. But the opening sequence has so much truth to it. Many sports lately have become more about the money and the spectacle of winning; it has lost the honor and dignity that use to make sports great, but now all the morals have gone.Trey Parker and Matt Stone fit perfectly into their roles, its just tailor made for them. But that said the acting is nothing special, its so over acted, but thats the charm to it. The comedy runs at such an even pace, its constantly punching out great one liners and sick humor. Its just a riot some of the situations that arise; and the psyche outs are just awesome, some are so wrong.This is a great comedy on the world of sports, though the satire isn't completely explored, its still makes you think about sports today.",8,1,3,15 November 2005
Over the Hedge," dreamworks finally makes a film to hold against shrek
","Desperate for food, raccoon RJ decides to steal Vincent's, a black bear mound of food. The food gets destroyed, with RJ having one week to restock Vincent's supply. It's the end of winter and the mixed group of forest creatures are coming out of hibernation. During the winter season, the forest was enclosed by a massive hedge, with a new suburban estate. Unaware of what to do and where to find food, RJ tricks the group to collect food from the surrounding houses to pay of his debt to Vincent.Of late Dreamworks has released very average computer animated films; with Shrek being their most successful. Over the hedge is the first film since Shrek that can actually be placed beside it. Firstly the animation is a great step forward, leaving the caricature style of animation of Madagascar and Shark Tale behind; all for the better. The animation is bright and colourful, with great detail to the animals and their gleaming bright eyes.The biggest step forward is the driving force of the jokes; switching from pop cultured references to dig into the characters for the meat of the jokes. Cultural references end up as easy laughs, that lack a lot of punch. While there are some pop culture references, they are minimal and not glaringly obvious. Adding depth is the subtext on humanities consumption and waste; it's no wonder many have called the recent rise of obesity an epidemic. Also added into the subtext is our impact on the environment and animal life.Feeling more of a star vehicle, the voice talent is some what disappointing. Garry Shandling delivers such a lumbered and monotoned voice to Verne, lacking so much energy. Avril Lavigne should stay in music, with nothing special as Heather. Wanda Sykes exaggerated jive attitude is so tacked on. William Shatner does his usual style of over acting, and works great. Nick Nolte and Thomas Haden Church bring fun as Vincent and exterminator Dwayne. Bruce Willis does great as RJ and really carries the film. Though basically stealing the light in everything he does, Steve Carell just takes over every moment he's on, perfectly suited to the hyperactive Hammy.Over the hedge is fast paced and never looses your attention, one of the most interesting animated films of late.",7,1,1,18 June 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," unzip this....
","Just by the title you know the story. Andy works at a tech store and when he plays a night of poker with his work mates, they find out he's a virgin. To his friends they think this is some huge disorder and set out to rectify this problem. They set him up with girls, but Andy has his eyes on Trish. After a few dates they make a deal that they wont have sex for twenty dates; this just suits Andy but just halters the ending result.This was quite a good comedy. Steve Carell can hold your attention and shows us a wider range of acting than what we saw in Anchor Man. He has quite good chemistry with Catherine Keener, who is a grandmother here, you don't see that in many movies where the protagonist is dating a grandmother. All the back characters David, Jay and Cal add another dimension to the story, adding abit of depth.Though what i found disappointing is it wasn't as funny as i was hoping it to be. Not being a fan of Anchor Man, i thought i would be another rehash of that, but 40YOV is a lot funnier, as you can connect with the characters here. But there are still great laughs, that waxing scene was killer to watch. I don't know how they got that in one take. The directing was really simple as well. The camera sits in one position most of the time, so we're stuck at one angle, and we don't see anything else. Sometimes the attention thats made in the background can enhance the movie, which could have raise this movie even higher.40YOV does also have a Wedding Crashers format. It started off really awkward, then it really sent in the punches, the laughs kept coming, but then it went really sentimental; really dipping into the clichés and handing out a predictable ending. But the strength of the middle of this movie does pick up a lot of the slack of the start and end, still making this a real enjoyable movie.A well spent two hours.",7,1,2,9 October 2005
Jarhead," gripping film from mendes
","Anthony Swofford's life has been a deterrent, with family troubles from every family member. His father is a war veteran and the Marines was a final choice to receive fulfillment. During his training he becomes a sniper, and loves every second of it. Shortly after Swofford is shipped to the gulf war, ready for action. Yet action never arrives and the marines are meet with boredom, with more marines always turning up. Ever distracting themselves with masturbation, constant rehashes of conversation about sex, religion, male order brides, their wall of shame as their wives and girlfriends one by one become unfaithful and always more masturbation. The futility of their constant mind distraction just ever increase their tension, all are constantly ready for action, if and when it arrives.Jarhead is the name of a marine from the regulation haircut, yet more to that the marines head is an empty vessel. Pitched by the opening, which is undoubtedly comparable to Stanley Kubricks's Full Metal Jacket, where the marines are stripped of their identities to become these empty vessel. Though is isn't the extreme degradation of Full Metal Jacket, with satirical comedy of the marines training and the comradeship between one another. The metamorphose of Jarhead hits in the declaration of war, with the troops sent off to the desert land of death to call home. The tension rises from lack of stimulation and mind games between troops erupt. Many troops more annoyed that they haven't yet fired their gun and received a kill to their name.Sam Mendes has constructed a tightly tense world where the tension doesn't come from the action, yet the drama between the troops and the unseen enemy. Jarhead doesn't take any real political stance or an anti war point of view, yet shows the psychological view of the mind set of a soldier during war. There is an openness to Jarhead where you make your own conclusion and answers, as we're taken behind the curtain; the marines freedom of speech taken, taking unapproved medicines for gases treatment.Enhancing Mendes's direction is Roger Deakins's cinematography. The colour pallet is deep, harshly filtered through stark white, capturing the bleakness of their surroundings. The visual effect is haunting in the desert landscape. Swofford and his group walking through the bomb laden highway is so tautly haunting. There is the constant state of an unknown enemy. We never see the enemy yet you feel that they are all around them, constantly watching but never attacking; that mind game state of affairs.Jake Gyllenhaal is stellar as Anthony Swofford. Gyllenhaal is gripping and captures that slow deterioration of sanity over the what seems never ending, action less war. Peter Sarsgaard finally focuses and gives a worthy performance as Troy. Jamie Foxx is great as Staff Sgt. Sykes, keeping a wonderful balance of humanity and leadership is Sykes.While Jarhead does at times become unfocused, its one tense ride of human emotions during war.",9,0,1,9 February 2006
The Machinist," very moody
","When Trevor Reznik has slept in a year, he starts to doubt his own mentality. Not sleeping for a year he is very thin, very thin; so thin its scary. Trevor works at a machining company and when an accident cut off a fellow workers arm, people start doubting him; thinking that he's a heroin junkie and losing his sanity. His only two friends is a prostitute Stevie and a waitress at the airport, Marie.The theme a paranoia and identity crisis has been done a lot; Meneto, Pefect Blue, Identity, Fight Club, Insomnia, American Psycho, and its been done good before, but in the Machinist its not as good as it should have been. The story is abit thin and its very noticeable, the movie is a slow burn and takes ages to build up. This one is hard to put together as well, it doesn't give you many clues, with there only being about 5 jigsaw pieces, instead of about 20 pieces. But there isn't a lot to this as there isn't a lot of depth to it. If there were more sub-plots and if it moved at a quicker pace it would have been more intense.The direction is detailed and the cinema photography is great. the use of blue-grey washes added a very bleak, depressed mood. Reflective surfaces are used to great extent; reflecting Trevors distorted and fractured life. The acting isn't great, but Christian Bale does a good job, but you keep focusing more on his body than his acting. You kinda need to watch this twice, once to see his stick of a body, then the second time to pick up all the pieces you missed from the first distraction.This is more of a mood piece than a thriller, its kinda like if fight club was an art house film.",7,1,3,21 September 2005
The Fast and the Furious," great action cant save a crumbling script
","Welcome to the world of street racing. Fast sleek car, hot women, and lots and lots of money. The man everyone looks to is Dominic, but he is being put under investigation by undercover cop Brian. There have been hijackers robbing trucks of their merchandise and Dominic is the main suspect. Though Brian is on the case, his judgment is clouded when he befriends Dom, but more to when he becomes infatuated by Dom's sister Mia.The Fast and the Furious is a head first trip into the world of underground street racing; but the film doesn't do it justice. It doesn't explore the notion of why people do it and just shows us that street racers are petty crimes looking for a break. The plotting is paper thin and the dialog is so hammed; they sound childish. The guys gruff their way through not showing much intelligence and the girls are given this fragile ego. All the actors try to look tuff but they don't show any sign of intimidation. The have surly looks but are giant pussy cats. They should have gotten lesson from Clint Eastwood on how to be a tough guy.Rob Cohen, though not a favourite director, does have en eye for action sequences. Most of the time his direction is very heavy handed, but when the action starts he is in his foray. The action is high energy and come at a relentless pace. He does get you right in the middle of it. Though the problem is that it doesn't keep its impact over time. Once you've seen it a few times the car chases don't really have the same intensity they had when you first saw it.It fast and has a very slick look to it, but with a script lacking development and very mediocre acting, not even the good car chases can save it from it plot holes.",5,2,5,28 November 2005
Saw III," most intense of the three
","Leigh Whannell and James Wan created one of the most intriguing films/franchises, that most notedly arrived at a trend of torture porn. While violence has been always present in horror/thrillers, it's a key element, though contemporary film makers have taken heed to throw their audience into the violence head first without hesitation. The victims suffer pain and agony, while similarly we the audience suffer in respect having to witness such anguish. Unsuspecting people thrown into intricately designed 'games', to inflict pain and suffering, with death as the usual outcome.Jigsaw, with his new apprentice Amanda continue there quest to free people from their lives, which they act is worthless; they soon release how much they value their life when placed in a live and death situation. Saw started of as a simple two hander, Saw 2 up the body count with multiple victims. Saw 3 is a strip back to basics, stripping the cast back, ultimately creating the best of the three films.Saw had amazing concepts and potential, yet not executed well; a flawed yet effective thriller. Saw 2 dropped the ball, with characters you wouldn't give a second look, just waiting idly by while each one meet their maker in grizzly deaths. Whannel taking helm with the pen again, Saw 3 regained focus and drastically change the formula around. Saw 3 takes time and doesn't rush; you may think other wise when two victims are dispensed straight off. Whannel calms the chaos of simple consecutive killings and develops characters you care and connect with.Running two games parallel, Jigsaw has kidnapped Dr. Lynn Denlon, to keep him alive or she dies along with his fate. Concurrent is another game with victim Jeff, a depressed father unable to move on from his son's death. Jeff is faced with a series of tests, in an ultimate battle for him to let go. Unlike the previous installments, pathos is given to both Lynn and Jeff, trapped in both their predicaments. Layers are revealed in Amanda, trying to take on Jigsaw's legacy and her initial genesis. Time slips back, new angles revealed upon parts of Saw and Saw 2. Developing the story and digging into the characters payed of enormously.Back to the torture porn. It's an element used extremely well by director Darren Lynn Bousman. While used minimally and effective by James Wan, Bousman over drove the gore and violence in Saw 2, without much merit to be given; violence for violence sake. Taking focus, slowing down the hyperactive quick cut directing, the violence and gore works more effectively; extremely more effectively. It's gut wrenching and energy draining; it's exhausting after this ride is over. Each test sees an increase of extreme torture, hitting to the most disturbing center pieces; The Wrack. Paradoxically, the violence is the main drawing power to this franchise and the most deterring for Saw 3. Bousman pushed to the boundaries too far, becoming all too much at times; but credit due exceeding in his plan to make you shift uncomfortably in your seat.Raising the level in another aspect is the acting. Tobin Bell evokes eeriness just from his voice. Shawnee Smith is steely cold and maniacal and the best out of the whole cast. Angus Macfadyen mixes pain, resentment and sorrow in Jeff's turmoil. Bahar Soomekh is amazing stuck in a conflict on interests and morals. Maybe as Bousman took time to pull better performances out of his cast you care more about them and what actually happens to them.With time and focus given to the story and development of the characters, instead of churning out a simple money spinner to play off the original Saw's success, Saw 3 supersedes it's predecessors.",7,1,3,6 November 2006
Batman Begins," great revitalization of a dwindling series
","Batman Begins is a sorely needed revitalization of what was a dwindling series. By the forth installment, Batman and Robin, the Bamtan series had really lost its way from the Tim Burton originals. Rising from the ashes, Batman Begins creates a new genesis. Director Christopher Nolan has taken the only path to revitalize this franchise, complete destruction to rebuild and reshape to start all over again. Schumacher drove the franchise into a inescapable dead end, for which no amount of back tracking would help.Starting from scratch, Nolan has taken the story back to Bruce's roots and his journey taken to become the Dark Knight. Bruce's self discovery and to fight all who stand for injustice, his training taken under Ducard, to establishing his iconic figure. Bruce's parents, especially his farther Thomas, are no longer enigmas, Thomas played a stronger role than once thought. The discovery of the cave, the creation of his suit and gadgets, and a new Batmobile to die for.Biggest change to the Batman world is Gotham City. Nolan has placed this more into reality, which works to its advantage. No more Gothic architecture, with a sky scraper metropolis sky line, yet still contains some of the Gothic fairytale feel of the Tim Burton originals. The city is dark, crooked alleys and claustrophobic. Transferring Gotham City into a visually recognisable symbol of modern day cities, along with the sub text of the story, creates a parable of our modern times.The villains of this tale are no longer rooted into the comic book aesthetic. Business man, crooked cops, gang leader with thugs, puppet masters in the shadows, wreck the terror on the city; not just one face of evil, as evil has many faces. Connecting back to the comics, the villain Scarecrow is the real menace. Dr. Crane and his scarecrow mask are visually amazing, evoking eerie and disturbing images. Dropping the cartoon design and creating a serious villain sets Scarecrow apart.Creating a new image for Batman, Christian Bale takes on the cape. Christian Bale is the most charismatic Batman of them all. Unlike past actors that have played Batman, Christian Bale can be childish one second them switch to dark and menacing the next. Micheal Cane as Alfred is perfect same as Liam Neeson as Ducard. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is perfect casting. Murphy made him so icy cold. Tom Wilkinson just verges from making Falcone a caricature, with his gangster voice not hitting the right notes.Creating a dark new world for Batman to thrive, Christopher Nolan has brought dignity back to the Batman saga.",9,2,3,23 October 2005
Saving Private Ryan," outstanding
","The American army are about to land at the Omaha beach in France. The moment they land its a blood soaked fight to take the beach. In this fight is Captain Miller and his troop of men. After the Omaha assault, Miller is given a mission to find a man and take him out from behind enemy lines. The man is Private James Ryan. Ryan's brothers have been killed in action and to bereave his mother the American Army want him home. Ryan's location is unknown as his paratroop were miss dropped. Miller and his troop now have to go behind enemy lines to find Ryan, that is if he's still alive.Saving Private Ryan is an outstanding war drama from master director Steven Spielberg. The opening beach scene is so brutally violent and harshly real, yet it honestly conveys the horror of the war. This was the first movie I saw that violent, but accurately, portrayed the violent nature of war and the emotions of the soldiers. You are placed right into the battle; with people being dismembered and shot apart. The final fight at the bridge crossing is the most intense battle of the film. It doesn't have the sheer unrelenting violence of the opening battle, but it is so emotionally charged.Though the violence is confronting, but there is so much drama and character depth behind the violence. All the people of Millers troop are three dimensional, you can emotionally attach to them. They all are bonded too, you can see their comradeship between them. There is also that naivety to them; they will follow their captain not just on orders but they trust him without question. Captain Miller has so much depth to him. You don't find a lot about him, yet you can tell there is much anguish and longing to leave in his face.Spielberg has taken a more head first look into the second world war. Shinder's List was about the men behind the scenes and the politics, while in Saving Private Ryan we are taken to the view of the soldier. Spielberg's direction is flawless, getting you right into the battle and evoking so much emotion from all the actors. The acting is also flawless. Tom Hanks gives one the his best performances ever, he was brilliant. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies all bring great performances as the mix matched group of people, their friendship for all of them was so believable. Matt Damon though only appearing towards the end as Private Ryan does a great job also.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, it is a masterpiece of cinema.",10,2,4,11 December 2005
Cars," the pixar machine finally stalled
","Pumping himself up before the final race, Lighting McQueen is a rookie car sensation, only starting at the beginning of the season and already one of the top cars. Lighting is cocky and egotistical, but the crowd loves him and he's happy for the attention. The race ends, but on a three way tie between Lighting, Chick Hicks and defending champion The King. For the decider, another race is held in California between the three cars for the championship. On the way to California, Lighting gets lost on the old highway Route 66. While trying to find the interstate, Lighting is impounded in the small town of Radiator Springs. The town is inhabited by an old mix of cars; leader Doc Hudson, a porch Sally Carrera, a rusted tow truck Mater, a low rider Ramone, stoned out VW Filmore, plus an assortment of others.Pixar have always been ahead of the game they started of computer animation, back in 1995 with Toy Story. They changed the world of children films, with deeper and layered stories that tailor to the young and the older audiences. Each film they have gone in boundless leaps, bringing the best in artistry of computer animation, and Cars is no different. The animation is flawless and at times mesmerising, the world these cars live in is wonderfully detailed.Amazing animation aside, the driving force of Cars isn't that strong. The story is one road that has been very well travelled. Self centered McQueen learns life lessons about friendship and loyalty, with his ways changed by unlikely strangers. So Cars becomes a little to predictable as it moves through the numbers. The jokes are also too sparing. The jokes are to far apart, and many fall flat; even the opening short film One Man Band isn't that entertaining as other previous Pixar Shorts.The Pixar team have always been excellent at suspending ones disbelief. One wondered if our toys were secretly alive, humanizing insects and sea creatures, or our closet was a doorway to a monster world. While writer/director John Lasseter has attempted to humanize cars, it doesn't feel that believable. The cars come off as caricatures of what type they are; one look and its not hard to click onto what personality they will have.The voice talent like always is the defining part. Owen Wilson is great as the cocky Lighting McQueen. Paul Newman husky voice brings that pain to Doc Hundson and his past. Bonnie Hunt is good as the protective Sally. At first, Larry The Cable Guy's exaggerated southern voice started off irritating, but it not hard to fall for Mattor and his antics. Other voices include Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Tony Shalhoub and Michael Keaton.Cars is not as strong as the other Pixar films, but it's still one journey your happy to go along with.",6,4,10,16 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," a fitting climax to the x-men trilogy
","The in-differences between humans and mutants are starting to simmer; a moment of peace. Though this peace doesn't last long when a pharmaceutical company has discovered a cure for the mutant race; a cure to suppress the mutant gene forever. Division is drawn through the mutants. Many look towards this as a way of freedom from persecution and a path to normality, while others say they need no cure. Still grieving over the lose of Jean, Scott is an emotional wreck, while Logan still mourns, he figures best to move on. From the ashes of Jean's resting place, Jean has resurrected, but not the Jean she originally was.When director Bryan Singer, of the previous two films of the X-Men, dropped from the third installment to direct the next Superman film, tension had risen. Taking the director seat, Brett Ratner has been given the argues task to deliver the final installment of the X-Men series. Screen Writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn have tapped into a vital themes that underpins the X-Men; acceptance, intolerance, change, individualism and the uniqueness of everyone. While Simon and Zak have tapped into these themes, when you look at their previous films they've penned, they all been in the realm of action. While the X-Men franchise has been in the action genre, it has gone above the limits to dig into the characters, to drive the film. X-Men: The Final Stand has lost that character driven force.From the get go, the action shoots in ever direction, with an opening fight that draws upon the original cartoon series. The energy doesn't drop from there, the pacing is lighting fast without stop for a breath. It's chaotic and frenetic. Not until the second act does the pace slow down and characters are fleshed out and the sub-text starts to be drawn out. While mutants divide on the cure, friendships are torn and tested to there limits; Rogue and Bobby, Xavier and Magneto, Jean and Logan, the human population and the mutant population.While the action does over run the film, its hard to say that it isn't of a high standard. The adrenaline pumps so hard and fast. The special effects are outstanding and visually amazing. The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is breath taking, while the final battle is perfectly crafted and executed.Reprising their roles, the original cast return, though Nightstawker to be seen this time. All do a great performances in their roles, with the induction of new character that are added to the mix. Kelsey Grammar is amazing as the humble Beast. Vinnie Jones brings a tongue in check quality to Juggernaut. Ben Foster is good as Angel, yet very under used. Dania Ramirez as Callisto and Ellen Page as Kitty are good too.Brett Ratner has delivered on all accounts a fitting end to the X-Men trilogy, it just would have been better to see Bryan Singer's version, to finish off his master piece trilogy.",8,1,3,25 May 2006
The Lives of Others," has its flaws, still an important film to see
","The real surprise on the 2007 Oscar’s had to go to, The Lives of Others, winning over the crowd favourite, Pan’s Labyrinth in the foreign language category. Maybe seeing The Lives of Others after this surprise win, when having back the crowd favourite, makes viewing hard, but all Oscar tid bits aside, The Lives of Others is a competent debut from writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. In 1984, when Germany is split into the East and West, member of The Stasi; government secret police, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is their top interrogator, and is compelled to surveillance play writer Georg Dreyman and his wife/actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who seem to fit all the markings of a loyalist, but Wiesler and friend Anton Grubitz suspect a liar and a traitor. Wiesler heads the surveillance on Dreyman, though as Wiesler become more a voyeur of this couple, and Dreyman’s workings with the West, Wiesler is entranced by them, turning a traitor himself to save these two from Grubitz and the government. The Lives of Others is a grim reminder of life in a Totalitarian regime, nods to Big Brother and Orwell’s 1984. Donnersmarck writes with competence, utilising some provocative subject matter and some thrilling moments. The draw back is he doesn’t keep this at an even pace, dragging at times, though enough tightly executed scenes rise above this. There is a quite interesting scene with Wiesler and a child inside an elevator, and though Donnersmarck takes his time getting there, the coda and final moment is so poignant and heart felt. Performances all round are top notch, most notable are from Ulrich Mühe, saying so much with his expressionless demeanour as Wiesler, and Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman. Hagen Bogdanski’s cinematography and Donnersmarck’s direction are impressive, with their still and restrained shots, penetrating scenes with a tight atmosphere. The Lives of Others, is an impressive debut from Donnersmarck, and though it’s major flaw is it’s length and loses it’s grip occasionally, The Lives of Others is still an important film to see, and should be seen.",7,0,4,9 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a step forward
","The fellowship has been broken and friendship torn. But new alliances must be made. Frodo and Sam stuck in a maze of rocky landscape must ask for help in the enemy; Gollum. Gollum despises Frodo, as he holds the ring; or the precious to Gollum. Gollum leads them to ht black gates of Mordor, but he knows another way. Aragon, Gimli and Legolas are hunting down Merry and Pippin; meeting an old friend. Saruman has built his army and has sent his forces out to destroy the people of Rohan, leading to one of the best battle sequences in the trilogy; the battle of Helms Deep.Unlike many sequels, this actually moves forward and surpasses the first chapter. While the Fellowship of the Ring built the foundation, The Two Towers continues to build upon it. From the mind blowing sequence of Gandalf fighting the Belroc demon to the explosive Helms Deep battle, it never faulters. While keeping all the characters, giving them equal share on screen, it introduces new people, adding more depth and dimension. The Ents have to be the best new characters, they are just astounding and visually amazing.The fight sequences are wonderfully directed. The battle of helms deep is worth the weight. The inter time i was just amazed and clutching my seat at the intensity of the battle. Though its a minor battle, but the Ents storming Saruman's tower was equally great, those Ents can fight.While Fellowship of the Ring is still a classic, this moves even further and breaks the boundaries, setting up for the biggest ending in this masterful trilogy.",9,0,1,23 October 2005
Shrek the Third," no longer a fairytale
","By now it has become apparent that animation has mutated to a state, that with each new computer animated film, the quality will constantly increase, where time will arrive we will not realise we are looking at something computer generated. It's awe gasping to marvel at what is achievable. But a very beautiful picture is all Shrek the Third will ever be. No longer a parody/satire of fairytale stories of old, of childhood memories, it's terrible to see when all things pop culture and easy jokes become the norm. Shrek 2 started this norm, though rising above this limitation, kept proceedings fresh and interesting; with new characters added to the mix and keeping its fairytale roots close to heart. A big heart still resides in Shrek the Third, the main driving force of the whole film, but those fairytale roots have been crushed, replaced with schmaltzy, over sweet life lessons to drag it down. All of the Shreks have held those 'life lessons', but only as after notes, to think on the way out. Shrek the Third is a constant lesson class; never judging yourself by others opinions, family and responsibility. The little ones will soak it up with glee, starring upon their cinematic heroes, yet the older generation will feel tiresome by halfway, wondering where that adult humour went from the last two films. Maybe if the laughs were up to snuff, Shrek the Third could reside with its predecessors, the jokes have run dry and bland. The whole reliance of pop culture and in-jokes; not helped with Justin Timberlake added to the bill - he ain't bringing no sexy back to help boost this, but bitching beauties with Snow White, Sleeping Beauty Rapunzel and Cinderella, acting from some forth rate soap opera; maybe some classy Dynasty cat fighting would have helped, is tiresome from the go, and clichÃ©d high school kids; girls talking like drones of Little Brittian Vicky Pollard and Mean Girls, spewing 'whatever' and 'ew-eth' at nauseating rate, Bill and Ted stoners, cocky jocks, and the braced up nerds. Enough material keeps proceedings above the water, yet not far from drowning. Charming's plays at the start and end are highlights, and the few out of the blue jokes. It's sad when events like a crazy aged Merlin, Puss and Donkey's body swap, are real missed opportunities and never really russel up the punch they require. All stars returning to their roles, own them easily like a second skin, many of the new actors bring nothing special; which is hard as they have no good material to work off. Shrek the Third runs far off course from it's predecessors, sitting now squarely in the kids section. Shrek the Third - you said it honey, ew-eth.",5,1,1,12 June 2007
The Illusionist," no spark of magic
","Magic has always been captivating. The impossible made real, yet with the ever lingering knowledge that it's all a trick. As the old saying, 'nothing is what it seems', something grand only occurred through the simplest effect. Nothing is what it seems is director Neil Burger's aim for The Illusionist, for magic is his smoke and mirrors surrounding what is simply a love story. Situated around Vienna towards the turn of the twentieth century, illusionist Eisenheim has propelled himself as a famous magician, with many claiming he holds supernatural powers. During one of his shows, Eisenheim discovers his childhood love Sophie is betrothed to Prince Leopold. Both wanting to rekindle their love, Eisenheim becomes investigated by Inspector Uhl, by Leopold.The Illusionist walks a line of reality and fantasy, where the magic of the impossible enters reality. The illusions presented while gasping one second lose credibility. The Illusionist grounds itself in reality, though it's illusions run in a realm of fantasy. Suspension of disbelief may be the ultimate trick for this film, but lack of revelations stunt this from happening, for the illusions are deemed impossible for this point in history. It's a brave move on Burger's part, keeping answers locked away on the workings of Eisenheim's tricks, his exercise in the slow burn pace to find your own answers in the surrounding details, which will enthrall or irritate, lead to a conclusion with missing pieces. Burger's main concern is the love story.While it's at the heart of The Illusionist, the romantic arc between Eisenheim and Sophie works best as a soap opera. Dull and no spark of romance, with a lack of chemistry between Norton and Biel. Norton walks around so wooden and stiff, Biel maybe in her best performance, lacks depth. Giamatti is flat as Inspector Uhl and Sewell is overly pompous and one dimensional as Leopold; his tyrant prince and wife hitter miss much subtlety. The all round flat performance are not helped either by Philip Glass's score, which constantly rubs against the grain, failing to inject any dramatic tension. Burger's directing rather heavy handedly, increases may of the awkward moments, though cinematography by Dick Pope makes for some visual intrigue, while the amber seeped into the visual mix tries to pound the note of a period theme to hard. The Illusionist will captivate many, with too many lose ends floating around and flat performances, the magic surrounding The Illusionist is rather empty and non-captivating. Inspector Uhl sums The Illusionist up best, 'You Look Ordinary'. This is an ordinary affair.",4,0,0,3 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," still struck by its limitations
","The Fantastic Four comics were the crown jewel in the Marvel comic book cannon, being the most popular with fans. So it's disappointing (or poetic depending on your stance), that the film adaptations sit on a mediocre level. The first installment weighed heavy with flaws, a thin screenplay, uninspired acting and bland directing. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfers, pulls out the trump cards to pull this franchise from the murk, yet ends in a case of flashing their cards to early. All the usual tricks of a sequel are here; bigger action set pieces, more enemies with more layers reveled in the protagonists. Script writers Don Payne and Mark Frost attempt to rise above the flaws from the first installment, with inner turmoils of the four leads, while fighting their new foe, but this never amounts to anything captivating. Being stuck in the media light, Johnny's power crisis, Sue and Reed's relationship problems and constant wedding postponements, great material to mine for character development, but Payne and Frost only scratch the surface, while still writing some cringe worthy and emaciated dialog. Director Tim Story's pacing faults proceedings, jumping from problem to action scene to problem to action scene. There seems to be notes taken from X-Men 2, yet Singer took time and found even ground for character development and big action pieces. Story seems to have too much on his plate, implementing too many elements in a short time frame. The set pieces, while imaginative and fast paced, are short and end just when they are about to lift off into eye candy spectacle. The confrontation with Dr. Doom is impressive, while the real enemy Galactus is gone as fast as it arrives. Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, and Michael Chiklis reach for their best, but have forgettable performances. Chris Evans, while down playing Johnny's cocky side, seems far from his talents, after pulling one mesmerising performance in Sunshine. Julian McMahon seems to be having fun as Dr. Doom, while being under used. Doug Jones displays the best performance as the nearly expressionless Silver Surfer. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer has tripped on its way to sit beside its comic book peers. For many this will be a popcorn affair, but it's very flavourless popcorn.",5,2,5,24 June 2007
Empire Records," surprising
","It's closing time at empire records. Lucas has close and he is anxious about it being but with this responsibility; but then he does something wrong. He takes off with nine thousand dollars to Atlantic City and loses it in one grand gesture on the craps table. The next day he comes to realise his mistake; but he's not the only one with problems today at empire records. Through this one day we meet the rest of the employees and one day they wont forget in a long time.Today is Rex Manning day; Rex is making an appearance for signings. Corey loves Rex; she's loved him since she was a child and wants to offer herself to him. A.J though loves Corey, but cant decide whether to go to art school or not. Debra is the black sheep and is suicidal, but she wont let anyone get close to her for anyone to help. The rest of the employees are some of the craziest people; it would be awesome to work at empire records.This was such a surprise watch. It doesn't really try to be anything prolific about teen life; instead is a honest comedy about a group of odd characters trying to set their lives on course. The jokes are perfectly timed; just before it seems to drop the ball and go flat, it quickly catches it and your attention is brought back. This does towards the end dive deep into the sentimentality, but it fits perfectly and it works to its advantage. Its also great to see a lot of actors at the beginning of their career before they became big. Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler and Anthony LaPaglia give good honest performances, and Robin Tunney is great as the misunderstood Debra. All the performances are actually good, everyone gave their character an honest and unique personality, they seemed like real people and you could identify and relate to them.Empire Records comes from the left field and delivers a great comedy of teenage life.",8,1,2,7 November 2005
Children of Men," engaging, greatly crafted film
","One of the staples in sci-fi is a dystopia future. Film makers have constantly from films inception, imagined where we are heading into the unknown and unforeseeable. The deterring part is our future is a dystopia hell, utopia is not even a shimmer light in the distant. Based upon P.D. James's, not so distant future, novel, Children of Men shows humanity in its decline, sliding to extinction. Women are unable to become pregnant, with no answer to this mystery. Humanity rests its hopes on the worlds youngest man, Diego Ricardo, who was murdered along with the worlds hope.Ex-activist, now bureaucrat Theodore Faron, lives in war ridden London. Along with womens infertility, the world is struck with climate change, pollution, illegal immigrants, terrorism and society just falling apart; the seems about to explode. Theo's only escape is friend Jasper, an aging hippie selling marijuana. Theo is contacted by his past lover Julian, who wants to get a refugee girl, Kee, to the coast. Things are complicated when Theo discovers that Kee is pregnant.When film makers started to predict our future, their vision was decades away, and the likely hood of it coming to fruition was minimal. Lately films of our bleak heading, lurk around the corner, with Children of Men set in 2027, with the plight of womens infertility only a few years away, starting in 2009. Children of Men is basically holding a mirror to our faces, this is where we're heading if things don't's change. An apocalypse not high from above but of our own creation.Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a master piece of art. Visually Children of Men is exceedingly detailed. So much information, references and detail is placed in every scene. To Alfonso's credit, it never reaches visually overloading, with a style reminiscent to Blade Runner. The cinematography is amazingly shot, with grainy visual harmoniously working to Alfonso's bleak vision; dragging us through trenches, war zones and refugee camps.With fat to chew, intelligent sub-text is injected. Current war on terrorism, global warming and pollution, governments treatment of illegal immigrants, and the all world collapse with society tear itself inside out. Its looks like time has gone cyclical and humanity is reverting back to caveman ideals; not the sophisticated utopia we always dreamed about. Offsetting the constant downtrodden view, is a wicked slice of humor, perfectly formed in Jasper, and one strange, yet highly effective soundtrack.Clive Owen believably shows Theo's turn into his unwanted hero status. Dropping his activist dealings, unpleasant being dragged back into the world he left. Michael Caine is solid and heart warming as Jasper, with his childish jokes. Julianne Moore is also strong with hidden strength in Julian. Claire-Hope Ashitey is beautiful and wonderful as Kee.With so much going on; ideas, concepts and sub-text too dig into, Children of Men is one of the most intriguing and unique films.",9,15,30,18 October 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," if only journalist were like Murrow today
","The nineteen fifties were a turbulent time for journalism. Senator McCarthy was on a head first conquest to rid America of communists, people of left-wing actions and communist sympathisers; no matter what it took and who it hurt. No one dared stand against McCarthy, fear of being labeled a Communist or sympathisers was to great a deal. On the CBS, one show, See It Now was committed to presenting factual stories to the public. After Edward Murrows presented a story on Milo Radulovich, a serviceman who was discharged on grounds that his farther may have a tainted past. Senator McCarthy attacks Murrows, claiming he has a communist past and still is. Murrows and his producer Fred Friendly finally take the fight to McCarthy, he's been untouched for too long.Civil liberties and freedom of speech have been a delicate element of human rights. Good Night and Good Luck presents a time when journalism was about the stand for these rights. While many never acted in brash manner as Murrows, yet he and his team were the only ones who fought for the truth. Even with the precognition of being attacked and labeled communists and dangerously controversial, their fight to bring the truth behind McCarthys egomaniac fight to rid so called communists in America, was the most honest work of journalism.While the film is stamped with the monochromatic look of black and white, the story sings depth beyond doubt. George Clooney having a history in journalism; his father being one, he has knowledgeable depth of the subject. You can tell the subject matter is close to heart, the research can not go unseen, bringing this story with truth and honesty, much in the vain of Murrows. The use of actual footage; Senator McCarthy's rebuttals against Murrows, court cases, interviews with Radulovich and even commercial ads, shoot the realism of Good Night and Good Luck through the roof. All the stock footage is seamlessly blended in from the black and white visual.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind wasn't really the breakout nor great standout for Clooneys first feature. For Good Night and Good Luck, his focus never falls, with a brilliant screenplay and wonderful direction. His direction has taken a simplistic approach, which it soars for. Your kept at a distant, never taken into peoples lives. At times shots are done through glass or different rooms, giving the reminder that you are just the fly on the wall, not an actual participant. David Strathairn delivers a powerhouse performance as Edward Murrows. Through each deliverance of his speeches, you are locked to him and can't look away. George Clooney brings one of his best performance as Fred Friendly. The supporting cast all deliver great performances; highlights from Patricia Clarkson, Frank Langella and Robert Downey Jr.While at first this does get stuck in the haze of cigarette smoke from all the actors, after the story on Radulovich, the haze clears and the target of McCarthy is set, for some of the most revetting drama. Good Night and Good Luck shows what journalism used to be, the search for truth. It's a disappointment that journalist today aren't like Murrows.",8,3,5,10 January 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," a romp in the blood soaked vengeance
","The Bride is on a path of revenge. Left for dead by her old colleges, she's out for their lives after their failed attempt on her life. She is left in a coma for four years after the massacre at the church in El Paso, soon as she wakes up, she doesn't waste time. Her we are taken through her first two victims; O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. First on her list is O-Ren Ishii, who has become Queen of the Tokoy Underworld. Her second victim; though first in the movie, is Vernita Green.Kill Bill is another great film for director Quentin Tarantino. Quentin has dropped a lot of the heavy dialog that he's done in his other films, and has replaced it with outstanding action. Kill Bill is a patch work of film influences and references, ranging from Japanese samurai film; the later half very heavy in this, Chinese martial arts, animation, spaghetti western and a range of others. Some parts are ripped right from other films, but are given that Tarantino feel. Though they range from all different sorts of cinema, Tarantino has done a great job and joining them all together to create his own world for this bloody tale. The violence is vulgar and very bloody, yet its very mesmerising. There is a beauty to it that raises it beyond pointless violence. The blood though does come by the truck load; it flies everywhere. The animation sequence of O-Ren's past sits so perfectly, it doesn't seem out of place, heightening the Japanese influence.The action is nothing short of outstanding. This has the best fight sequences in an action film. The battle of the blue leaves blows the burly brawl from The Matrix Reloaded right out of the water. It's great to see that Tarantino didn't rely on CGI for the fights, making it all the more realistic. They flow so well and are choreographed wonderfully.The fight between The Bride and Vernita, though short is so fast paced and high in energy.All the acting is perfect. Uma Thurman is just brilliant as The Bride, you cant fake tears like she did when pulling herself into the back of Buck's Pussy Wagon. She brought so much dignity and malevolence to The Bride. Lucy Lui is so elegant and ruthless as O-Ren, its shocking how one minute she is laughing and smile then next she is chopping some guys head off without a second thought. Vivica A. Fox though not having a major role is very good as Vernita. Sonny Chiba is just hysterical as Hattori Hanzo.Kill Bill is violently beautiful, darkly funny and has a soundtrack to die for. Bring on Vol 2.",10,2,5,26 November 2005
Saw II," the saw comes around again
","Jigsaw is still on his conquest to help change the human race; one person at a time. He believes that we all lack that instinctive sense of survival, testing us to see whether we will shed as much blood needed to keep our lives. In the opening we see his newest victim come to a bloody end, but he was part of a bigger attack; Agent Matthhews. Jigsaw has a new batch of victims; but instead of two its eight people this time, including Matthews son. They are trapped in a house and are breathing in a deadly nerve gas. Now they must all play their set games in order to receive an antidote or die a slow painful death.The first saw movie had one of the most original concept ideas for a movie in a long time. But the overall film itself was a let down. Though it had a winning formula to it. For Saw II, they just took the same formula, tweaked it abit and gave us a rehash of the original. The only thing really different is the increase of people in jigsaw's game and a location change. Instead of elaborating on the concept they played it safe to give us what we have already seen before in the first one.The acting is so flat, they don't evoke much sympathy for their characters. You don't care what really happens to them, no matter how brutal or bloody of an end it is. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction is a complete copy of James Wan's direction of Saw, instead of giving it his own distinct style, which would have separated it more from Saw. The mood is dark and dirty, but it doesn't have that claustrophobic feel to it, so its not that intense. This does have a lot more violence in it, but its not that disturbing; its to over the top so it lose that impact. The most disturbing scene, 'the needle in the haystack', was the one with the least amount of blood, there was hardly any blood, and it worked so much better for it.Just like the first Saw, i was stumped by the twist. It does come right out and punches you in the face; but the twist here wasn't as hard hitting. You have some of the ending already pieced together by the end, but its still surprising, and it does once again leave it open for a third saw to come.I give this film though the benefit of the doubt, its still one of the best ideas in a film, but the overall package just doesn't give it the impact and disturbing nature it was aiming for.",5,0,0,16 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," very sweet indeed
","Charlie and his family live in a dilapidated house, constantly having trouble making ends meet. His father has lost his job and his four grandparents are bed ridden. Charlie's idol is Willy Wonka, the most celebrated chocolate maker in the world. Charlie's Grandpa Joe use to work in Willy Wonka's factory, till Wonka closed it due to the mass theft of his secret recipes. No one has been in Willy Wonka's since he re-opened the factory, till now. Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in five random bars. The five children who find these tickets are given the honor of being able to enter the factory and take the tour of this mysterious place. The five ticket winners; Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee and Charlie Bucket.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a perfectly suited story for director Tim Burton. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually amazing take on the Roald Dahl story. There are so many layers and themes present; bonds of family, parents being run by their spoiled children, consumerism, greed, while the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory had these themes to, Tim Burton has taken them from a more cynical view, making the satire more tongue in cheek and hits you harder. Willy Wonka isn't such an enigma any more, as we're given a back story to his past, with his over bearing dentist father, stopping Willy from eating chocolate. Also we are given origins to the Oompa Loompas.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is more of an update of the story than a remake. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory took more freedom with the story, while Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is more faithful to the Roald Dahl's book. The films Willy Wonka and Charlie while based on the same story, they are so different from one another, which separates them, as they both can stand on their own merits. The references sprayed around are perfectly done; the reference to 2001: A Space Odessy and Psycho are hilarious.Tim Burton is such an excellent visual director. The colour pallet is such eye candy, making the film so bright stunning, juxtaposing those darker undertones of the story. Burton can take the visuals to a level where there is so much to take in, yet you aren't overloaded with them. The tunnel ride is a great psychedelic acid trip, as to the room containing the chocolate waterfall and river, and candy trees and plants. There are injections of that dark Gothic feel from Burton's Edward Scizzorhands, which works perfectly here. Johnny Depp is the most versatile actor and is perfect as Willy Wonka. He presents such a creepy Willy Wonka, making him more restrained than eccentric from Gene Wilder's interpretation. Freddie Highmore is such a talented kid, making Charlie sympathetic yet strong, there is such nobility in his performance. The four other child actors; Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop, Julia Winter as Veruca Salt, AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde and Jordan Fry as Mike Teavee all in habit there parts, really evoking the ignorance and overly spoiled child. Though his role is minor, Christopher Lee is great as Willy's cynical father.With so much chocolate to induce hyperglycemia, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one film to indulge your sweet tooth.",9,2,4,22 January 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," one unusual love story
","In a dazed morning, Joel is heading to work, yet takes an impulsive move and ditches; heading to Mantauk. On his day visit he meets Clementine. She energetic and speaks before thinking, the complete contrast of Joel who is very closed and reserved; yet they connect just as the saying goes. It's three days before valentines and Joel has hit a wall; Clementine doesn't know Joel anymore. Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, which in effect makes Joel do the same. Lacuna Inc has devised an operation that will destroy memories for people wanting to leave a bad memory behind. While Joel is asleep, we wander through Joel's memories of their relationship; starting at the latest times of their relationship falling apart to the beginning where the connection first happened. When Joel starts seeing the good times with Clementine, he doesn't want to lose them, with him and Clementine racing through memories and his mind to stop them before he loses her completely and forgotten her.After the success of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, Charlie Kaufman has become synonymous with eccentric stories. While Confessions of a dangerous mind was more straight forward, Eternal Sunishine returns him to the non conventional world; the extreme left field. The concept of erasing memories is wonderfully explored by Kaufman and Gondry. While everyone has memories they want to forget, its those that define us. Lose is a powerful emotion that we don't understand till we have lost, as it is that reality check of life. Though Joel had fixated on the worst times, it wasn't till he remember what made their relationship so great that he realised what he was losing, trying to desperately in vain to salvage what he could.Michel Gondry's direction compliments Kaufman's story. Gondry having started in music videos has incorporated that creative style, making a very off centered world; for an off centered story. The memories of Joel are creatively envisioned, where they start to merge on each other. There is so much detail to ESOTSM, even after several views there are minute details to pick and find. How objects start to disappear or blur are so perfectly done, at times you don't realise things are disappearing. A great scene is when Joel and Clementine are talking in a bookstore and all the books start turning white and blank; it really hits the situation of the story and brings out the symbolism that Kaufman has embedded.Jim Carey while being a comedy master gives his best performance. It such a huge leap from Carey to act such a depressed and introverted character, yet he shines for it. He has shown he has a broader scope of ability from his comic eccentricities. Kate Winslet perfectly matches Clementine, adding so much energy and contrasting Joel's rigidness. While Kate makes Clementine so energetic, she creates this mysterious aurora that there is more too her, she is really insecure but she hides her emotions behind a facade of impulses. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as the technicians performing the procedure, both play it minimalistic. They don't show much emotions, yet your still able to understand what their thinking. Kirsten Dunst gives one of her better performances as the receptionist of Lacuna Inc, same to Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, head of Lacuna Inc.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is such a spectacular love story, as it never falls into the clichéd formula. There is so much heart in Kaufman's non linear story. It's a mind bending story, yet one of the most original and heart warming movies you'll see. You seriously want to hug someone after watching this.",10,1,4,18 December 2005
Saw," a great yet flawed thriller
","When two men who seem to have nothing in common find themselves trapped in one of the worst bathrooms, (one that rivals the toilet from trainspotting), they come to realise they are at the hands of the serial killer Jigsaw. The irony of Jigsaw is that he isn't really a killer; he hasn't killed anyone. Instead he sets up 'games' which will either kill the victim or they have to fight to survive. Adam and Dr. Gordon are chained either side of the room and in between them is a dead body. Not long after they find their messages from Jigsaw and the game has started. The aim of this game is for Dr. Gordon to kill Adam before 6 o'clock; if not his wife Alison and daughter Diana will die. There are clues everywhere for them to escape, they have to figure out the clues to survive.The idea behind Saw is great. It's twisted, macabre but overall its a step away from the mainstream thrillers. The idea though was brought from the draw back of having a small budget, yet stripping it back to a simple one location and a small cast makes to more focused and the concept can flourish for it. You can see though that there is a mix from other films that have influenced Saw. The killer teaching people the preciousness of life; Seven. People waking in a strange location and need to figure out how to escape; Cube. People thrown into a situation to fight for their lives at the cost of other lives; Battle Royale. Though Saw has a very solid foundation, it does have its flaws, which does effect the overall impact.The acting is the least desirable factor. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover are so way under par; its nowhere near their best job. Danny seemed really rigid and Cary was to over the top in the more dramatic scenes. Being his first major role, you can see Leigh Whannell doesn't have a lot of acting experience yet he still does alright. Monica Potter while having a minor role just walks through the steps without much enthusiasm.The intensity of Saw has a problem of keeping it at a constant pace. There are times when the intensity blows through the roof and you find your hand is searching for something to grip onto; Amanda cutting into a mans guts to find the key to her head trap and Paul stuck in the razor wire trap are very intense, but then it falls flat and takes awhile before it starts to pick up again. The feel of Saw though is very dark and bleak. There isn't that sense of hope that lies within many thrillers. All the games that are quickly looked upon in flash back are some of the most macabre situations ever. Though it would have been so much better if they were developed and fleshed out more; adding more dimension to the world of Jigsaw, instead of the quick glances. The biggest problem with Saw is due to the small shooting schedule that James Wan had. He had only eighteen days of shooting and not a lot of time in post production. Give that if he had more time, he could have made those touch up and been able to fine tooth the over all product. Yet credit has to be given to Wan and Whannell for getting this done on such a short schedule and a small budget.Though it has its flaws, Saw is still a great watch. It has one of the best twists that comes right out of left field and punches you so hard that it resonates in your mind for days.",6,1,1,20 November 2005
The Descent," one thrill ride
","Film is a great medium. Film makers have utilised the medium to entertain us, but the greatest element of film is its ability to force an emotional response from us. Laugh, cry, enrage, move and scare. Horror has always been a genre with drawing power. Whether to simply scare, or injected with a contemporary or political edge. A current trend of horror films is torture porn. Agonising scenes of pain and misery, violence through at the audience without restraint. While some film makers have made great pieces of cinema with the torture porn, many have lacked the merit and style ending with a pointless film with an abundance of gore.The Decent is a drawn back to the classic seventies horror; Alien the main point of reference. A year after Sarah loses her husband and child, she and five other friends pick up their thrill seeking trend on a caving expedition. Obviously while the expedition starts fine, yet soon after goes wrong. When their only point of exit collapses and traps them, they need to find another way out, but that's not their only problem. Fear, claustrophobia, paranoia from the dark, and the current inhabitants of this cave.Director Neil Marshall's previous film Dog Soldiers was an interesting yet muddled film. Not sure where he wanted to take it; dark comedy, action or full on horror. The Decent sees Marshall knowing exactly where he wants to head, with methodical precession. The Decent is one of the first horror films in a very long time that hasn't relied upon violence to make the audience uncomfortable. From the get go dread and the most foreboding atmosphere surround you. The beginning of the caving routes are extremely claustrophobic and unsettling. Deafning silence and minimal sound effects, perpetually keep the anxiety levels high.Marshall has brilliantly use the widescreen format by hardly using it at all. Crawling through tunnels and paths, only small amounts of the screen are lit, highlighted and washed from the womens flash lights, red flares, glow sticks and the eerie, grainy night vision camera. The crushing, empty blackness intensifies the unknown and unseen. Marshall wrings every last bit out to scare and unnerve, he shows he's a horror fan boy, brings out all he can to pull out the biggest punches he can muster.While the story may not be very complex, the character interactions are far from it. Friendships strain from past events, Juno's ego of leadership which only leads to recklessness. The danger starts internally of the group, even before the unknown starts to draw its head out. The dynamics of the group is kept believable by a very strong cast. Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Nora-Jane No one, Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid and MyAnna Buring are all strong and fight against the stereotypical heroin in trouble.The Decent is fist clenching, terrifying and physically exhausting. Niel Marshall has created a brutally scary film that encapsulates what horror is all about; sitting in a dark room being scared witless.",9,2,6,22 November 2006
Inside Man," a strange turn for Lee...
","Opening center screen, our mastermind lays out the deal; who, what, when where, why and how. He's cool, calm and collected; you can see the gears ticking in his mind. Dalton Russell has planned the perfect heist. Confidently walking into the bank with his colleagues, they cut security and take all customers hostage. Making the hostages wearing painters uniform, people are unaware who are the hostages from the perpetrators.Called onto the case is Detective Keith Frazier. Handling the situation like other heist, Frazier lets Dalton sit. Soon Frazier smells something wrong; Dalton isn't interested in money; he has something better planned. Owner of the bank, Arthur Case, hires Madeline White. Case has personal belongings stored in a safety deposit box, which he feels might be compromised, which he wants Madeline to protect.Spike Lee has become synonymous with film of racial intolerance. Deceiding to make a genre film of a heist comes as a welcome change for Lee. Screen writer Russell Gewirtz has created a master plan for the heist, and worked out how it will play; yet there lies the conundrum. From a perfect start, Inside Man starts to split the seams on Spike Lee's inability to not venture away from making a film without making a statement. Inside Man could have been a perfectly constructed genre film, but the injections on race, tolerance, religion force Inside Man to collapse upon itself.Inside looses a lot of focus as it moves along. It doesn't really know what type of film it wants to be. The conflicting context between the heist and the racial intolerance fight with each other, instead of work together. By the end it doesn't really matter, as either of the conflicting side wont surrender; creating a rather muddled film.Over confidence can easily be said about all the actors. Denzel Washington playing the same sort of character again has become redundant; yet hard truth is he does it so well. Clive Owen is cool and calm as Dalton, yet doesn't feel like a mastermind behind this plan. Jodie Foster is disappointingly underused as Madeline, so to with Christopher Plummer as Arthur. Willem Dafoe flounders in the background, it looks like he doesn't know why he's there. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers one of the better performance, yet not his best from his other recent film.What started off as a perfect crime, soon becomes a crime itself.",5,1,3,11 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," doesn't translate that well to screen
","Ablino monk Silas is searching for an artifact, the whereabouts only know by curator of the Lourve, Jacques Sauniere. Jacques is shot by Silas and left for dead. Symbologist Robert Langdon currently giving a lecture on symbols, is asked to the crime scene of Jacques. Before death Jacques had left clues and carved symbols into his body. Grand daughter of Jacques Sofie Neveu, a cryptologist, is compelled to find the killer and to understand what her grand father was hiding. Helping to uncover these secrets, crippled Leigh Teabing tells of secrets held by the Christian church and the location of the holy grail; the riddle Jacques has left for Sofie and Robert to solve.With all the hype and controversy surrounding both film and book alike, this screen adaptation Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code has suffered. Dan Brown's book has become the highest grossing book of our time, also been attacked against the Catholic church for the theories about Jesus and his lineage. The Da Vinci Code in all was an entertaining page turner, blending fact and fiction, a great farce of a read. For entertaining as the book is, it hasn't survived the translation to screen that well.With all the facts about art, mathematical equations, secrets sects, religious cover ups, Browns's narrative kept them in a steady flow and had a natural element to them. Screen writer Akiva Goldsman fails to grasp that flow, the interesting facts are awkwardly injected and miss important information about them; probably to make you read the book if you haven't already. Akiva hasn't changed things around, it is a faithful adaptation, but its so straight forward for anyone who has read the book, it doesn't bring any new surprise.The translation to screen isn't the films only problem. The performance are well under par. Tom Hanks is no where near his best, he nearly wears the same expression the entire time. Audrey Tautou is a beautiful actress, yet she is nowhere near her best. Paul Bettany as the albino Silas just stays off a flat performance. Delivering the better performance, Ian McKellen is the only one bringing energy and enthusiasm to his character Teabing. Jean Reno reforms himself after his terrible acting in The Pink Panther. Alfred Molina is sorely underused as Bishop Aringarosa.The Da Vinci Code is a disappointing adaptation. Yet for all its misfires and flaws, The Da Vinci Code is still entertaining.",5,4,9,18 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," keeps getting better
","The World Quiddich Final is being held, and the Weasly family, Harry and Hermione are off to attend. Joining them are Amos Diggory and his son, Cedric Diggory. During the aftermath of the match, the camping ground is attack by Death Eaters; followers of Lord Voldemort. At the start of the schooling year of Hogwarts, two other schools have come to compete in a legendary and dangerous tournament; The Triwizard Torniment. When the three contestants are chosen; Cedric Diggory, Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, under mysterious circumstances a forth contestant is chosen; Harry Potter. People start to question when Harry is chosen as he is under age and there are only meant to be three contestants, but its binding and Harry has no choice but to compete.The three tasks are designed to test all contestants strength and knowledge, each harder than the last. Though there are much harder tasks at hand for Harry; the world of dating. Apart of the Torniment is the Yule Ball, and friendships start to wain and stretch. Ron is annoyed that Harry is in the Torniment, they both cant find dates, and Ron become irritate with Hermione when she is Viktor Krums date; to him being Harry's enemy. Though there is a darker, sinister force being awakened, with a re-occurring dream of the resurrection of Lord Voldemort.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is in essence the better film of the series to date. The book being a very thick book that has so much depth and story to it, starting to hitting emotional chords about teenage life. This isn't just about magic anymore, it starts to weave in the coming of age story; growing up, dating, betrayal of friends and being independent and seeing that adults don't have all the answers. The darker tones of the story are also being drawn out. The resurrection of Voldemort, back stabbing and betrayal of once thought allies and adding much more back story to characters, giving them more dimensional; instead of flat background characters. Though the draw back is that there is too much information in the book to bring to the screen. The opening Quiddich match is not shown and it jumps and moves really fast making it very erratic. Though it is about two and a half hours long, it would have been better if they went for another twenty minutes or so, adding those little details which would have given much more story and giving a better flow to the over all pace. They could have easily extended the length as the kids were taking in every second and would have sat through another twenty minutes easily.The three tasks in the tournament are each spectacular and breath taking. The fight of the dragon is fast and has a great claustrophobic feel when inside the ring, and keeps it intensity even when it takes to the skies. The underwater challenge with the Mermaids, though not as intense is visually amazing. The mermaids are not the beautiful creates people are use to; they're brutal, menacing creates in the eerie algae green water. The giant, shape shifting garden maze is a wonderful sight. The very deep violets and blues add a very haunting feel, creating a very creepy atmosphere. Though it would have been better if they kept the creatures and challenges of the maze from the book in the movie, yet dropped from time constraints. The darkest part of the film is during the resurrection of Voldemort. Whats makes Goblet of Fire a lot better than the other films is that they attained a more competent director. Mike Newell's direction is more comfortable for the story. Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuarón both did great jobs on the previous films, but Newell was more adapt to the story and forced better performances from the cast. The acting also has made a jump for the better. The three leads Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown older and so has their acting. While still they are not great actors, they have gain a broader emotional range evoking much more drama between them. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith don't seem as bored in their roles, Michael Gambon, as we saw from Prisoner of Azkaban he's no Richard Harris, but holds a strength to Dumbledore. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Lord Voldemort, with a very creepy performance. Brendan Gleeson seemed to have had much to fun as the crazy, eccentric MadEye Moody. Miranda Richardson was also great as the forked tonged Rita Skeeter.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is step further forward in the series and shows that they just keep getting better.",7,0,2,30 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," reload
","Neo has been have nightmares over trinity; a repeating dream of her death. Adding to his troubles is the over bearing people of Zion, who look to him as a prophet to save them. The leaders of all ships are meeting as they have found new startling information. The machines are digging directly down to Zion; reaching in roughly seventy-two hours, but there are other things going on in the matrix. The agents have had an upgrade, but someone has come back; Agent Smith. He has been unplugged from the matrix and has become free, yet he is on a forceful fight to find Neo. Smith has also become able to copy himself; there are hundreds of Agent Smiths now.Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are now on a mission to save Zion, but first have to find the Key Maker; who holds the key to Neo's final destination. Neon has to go to the source of the matrix, where he has to make a choice; save Zion or save the one he loves.The Matrix Reloaded is an full throttle, action packed sequel to The Matrix. The look and feel though is very different though to the first one. The first Matrix had a very dark atmosphere to it; through the dark green and black colours, the green wash is present again, yet its mixed with white and light colours, making a much brighter feel. As the first matrix set up so much of the story, the Wachowski's were given more freedom in incorporate more action to the mix, though it wasn't evenly spread through the movie. At times you were given loads of information, some hard to digest on first viewing, than huge action sequences would follow, knocking out most of the information you just had. The scene between Neo and the Architec seemed over complicated; where the Wachowski's seemed to have swallowed a thesaurus, making it hard to follow the conversation.The special effects are so much better, creating much more detail to the matrix and to the fights. Yet it was disappointing that the burly brawl did have to rely on so much special effects, losing some authenticity where you can see when Neo or Smith were computer generated. The rest of the fights though much more gracefully, flowing much better. The car chase is just mind blowing, being one of the best car chases i have seen. I remember the first view of it and i couldn't breath and my heart skipped beats, it was so intense and moved at such a fast pace and has such a climatic ending that just makes your jaw drop.The acting was as of the same level of the first. At times people seemed to overact, losing some of the dramatic tension. Harry J. Lennix as Commander Lock seemed to gruff and mumble a lot, not making him seem to serious. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss all give good performances again. It is sad that it was Gloria Foster's last performance as the Oracle, which she does great again.It just falls short of the first Matrix, though continues the story and ends on such a high note, keeping you hanging for the final one.",8,0,1,30 November 2005
The Departed," scorese returning to what he does best
","A remake of any film is usually a woeful moment. Only a hand full have reached the mark of the original film, a few soaring above it. Hollywood has been pillaging the Asian cinema, with many remakes of their horror films and action/dramas. Based upon the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed looks to be exempted from this. While not have seen Infernal Affairs, the argues argument of comparing the films; 'which one is better', is left muted, and all for the better.It has been some time since Martin Scorese made his last gangster/crime film, with Casino back in 1995. During that time, his most major films Gangs of New York and The Aviator, where great yet muddled films. The Departed sees Scorsese returning to great form in a genre he does best. While not reaching Casino, Taxdriver or Goodfellas level, when the starting tune of The Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter rolls in, arms open saying 'Welcome back Martin'.While it is rejoicing when The Departed starts, it dips not long after. The major flaw is the editing. Scenes run so lightning fast making a disjointed flow to the narrative. Scene cuts are erratic and images shoot past without time to comprehend what was shown. It's all the set up, Sullivan getting into the police to be Costello's mole, Queenan and Dignam setting up Costigan to infiltrate Costello's organization, you start to doubt whether Scorsese has dropped his form.Yet things do settle, breaths are taken and proceeding calm down. Its the change from a urban setting. When both sides realise they might have moles in their midst, The Departed jumps tracks changing into one gripping and taut thriller. The intensity spikes and doesn't drop, with twists and turns, as Sullivan and Costigan hot on each others heals. Screenwritter William Monahan has succeeded in transfer the story into a complete American setting, with little presence of any Asian cinema influences, with Scorsese making it his own film to stand by itself.Martin Scorsese's directing is impeccable, the shoot out between the police and Costello's drug shipment enforces this, perfectly executed and staged; though the editing during the first part does detract from his talent. Continuing his collaboration with Scorese from The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers his best performance, growing better with each film he does. Matt Damon, while not his best, is great as crooked cop Sullivan. Jack Nicholson perfectly mixes comedy and vulgarity in Costello. Mark Wahlberg doesn't drop a note as fouled mouth, hot headed Dignam. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are great in their supporting roles.While not his best work, The Departed is Scorsese's best film in awhile.",8,0,1,15 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Just See it....
","Ray has divorced from his wife Marry. Ray has custody of their kids for the weekend; Robbie and Racheal. He's not much of a father, caring more about himself. When a strange storm starts to shoot lighting to the one spot and all electrical appliances shut off, Rays off too see what has happened. The lighting has created a hole into the ground, unearthing what was hidden beneath; an alien tripod. When the tripod starts to destroy everything in its path, people realise the aliens are here not in peace. Now has to protect himself and his kids from the impending doom of the alien invaders. I have read a lot of what other people have been saying about this movies and most of the time its about what Tom Cruise is doing in his personal life. I don't really care what he does with his life, he can act as much of a dick as he wants, it doesn't discredit his as a good actor.One thing I've noticed about Spielberg is that he either hits the bulls eye dead centre, or he'll miss completely; here he hits the mark perfectly. This has been so far been the best movie i have seen so far this year. At first i thought it would be like most other alien invader movies but this is so much more. This movie is like a world war II movie. It was an interesting twist to see a refugee situation from an American perspective. The action is so intense, though its not always constant. The action only come every now and then; as the story is focused more upon the family, but the action sequences are really intense that it doesn't need a lot of it. There is also a grainy look to this, giving it a hyper-real feeling, making it a lot more realistic.With the use of all these and other references, this movie is dark and very intense. there were times i wanted to look away but couldn't as i couldn't miss a moment. The special effects were mind blowing. Unlike Star Wars where it was mostly special effects and you knew it wasn't real, here the special effects were so integrated, you thought the tripod ships were real. Though what i thought was better was the sound engineering. The sounds effects were flawless and the cinema was shaking from them.The acting was very good. Tom Cruise earn't my respect again, though Dakoda Fanning was just brilliant. She is one of the best actresses around. Spielberg's directing is just great; like it always is. Though what made this one of his greatest movies is he didn't take the sentimental cop-out at the end, which he has done with most of his movies.Many people have been complaining about the ending of the movie, though when you think about it, there are more layers to it than what they say, it is very ironic.In all just see this movie.",10,1,4,1 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," epic masterpiece
","If not from his previous works, There Will Be Blood will finally give credit where due, and announce Paul Thomas Anderson as one of the best American story tellers working in film. Magnolia, a cinematic experience like no other, and a bold statement to come from Anderson, Blood is a further honing of his craft, and catapulting him to another level of mastery. Based upon the novel Oil!, Blood has something to say, but this isn’t a very uplifting message. The main foes, Plainview and Sunday, each are not lost souls, they are demonic creatures, crawled out for the black oil that surrounds them. Not so much about the oil boom in the turn of the century California, Capitalism and Religious Zealots are butting heads, each possessing their vessels, yet both are kneeling at the alter of greed. Man’s soul is at risk here, but way of redeeming it is a bigger question.Standing at the heart of this monster and screaming ‘I’ is Daniel Day-Lewis. A villainous monster, equally repulsive and eerily inspiring, Day-Lewis possesses Daniel Plainview with such demonic fever. Plainview is charming and charismatic, a likable man with his small limp and smile, and family man exterior. Behind the squint of his eye, evil deeds await for all who fall prey to him and his conquest. ‘There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.’ Plainview is a monster; with such content towards man, people are nothing more than meat to discard once he’s dried the land, yet he also carries that wonder and excitement that comes with discovery in industrialism, and a man that sticks to his ideals and principles, even if they rest in the extreme. You can’t call Day-Lewis’s performance a performance, he is Plainview. Standing beside Plainview with his cherub face and innocent demeanour is Eli Sunday, with Paul Dano leaving an impressive mark. The smoky veil of evangelical religion, the empty rapture and redemption he offers, as Sunday looks to control his minions and his self fulfilment as a prophet and vessel of God. Conjuring Kubrick through his direction, from the wordless opening and extended scenes, dramatic shifts, it all goes with a purpose. Anderson makes a dramatic and epic statement every scene, as there is always interaction, verbally or non verbal, or through the piercing stares between characters. Jonny Greenwood’s discordant score cuts through the landscape and characters, raising the tension to blood boiling levels, before dropping it in an instant. Robert Elswit’s cinematography captures the Western landscape magnificently. If the long wordless opening made some viewers wondering where will this all end, the yang to this are the two final gut wrenching conversation, and the bone crushing final moments (diabolical with its odd humour, many will be talking about this than the layers of themes, allegories and mythology to dig through) that will permeate and linger long after leaving the cinema. There Will Be Blood is an epic masterpiece from a master story teller.",10,1,5,9 February 2008
Downfall," you must see this!!!!
","This film is set in the Berlin bunkers where Hitler took refuge in the closing days of the second world war. We see what happened down there in those last days of the war and Hitlers life. The story is multi-linear and shows different people's perspective. We see from Hitler's perspective, his personal secretary and from some of his generals.This isn't like other war movies. instead of the fighting taking place in battle fields, the fights are in tiny claustrophobic rooms. The fights are psychological, not physical. As its set in a bunker, it has this suffocating feel the whole way through.The acting in downfall is just awesome. Bruno Ganz who played Hitler did the most mind blowing performance i have ever seen. it was scary how much he got the idiosyncrasies of Hitler so right. He even had the same power and passion Hitler put into his speech's, and when someone argued with him, i wouldn't want to be on his bad side. But Bruno brought another side to Hitler we haven't seen. At times we see he was a human, he still was caring and sympathetic; not this Satan figure all the time.The last half hour of downfall though is so depressing that it is hard to watch. It gets so down right depressing you think you'll never be happy again. i really felt like leaving it was that hard to watch. that has never happened in any other movie i have watched. just all the suicide and genocide that went on was so bleak and depressing. When they started kill the children i nearly broke down crying. But thats why its so great. movies that can take hold of our emotions and rip them apart should be praised, as they have mastered the art of cinema, and this does it perfectly.if you get the chance see this in the cinema, watching it at home wont create the same atmosphere",10,0,1,19 September 2005
The Last King of Scotland," strong film, out shined by Whitaker
","Kevin McDonald has been walking through documentaries for some time now. Historically significant events of One Day in September, biographies and the spellbinding re-enactment of mountain-climbing tragedy of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates in Touching the Void. The Last King of Scotland sees McDonald moving out of the documentary field, yet not stepping away from portraying a historical point of time. The Last King of Scotland, blending fact and fiction, circles around the appointment of Idi Amin as President of Uganda, and the beginning of his dictatorship.After finishing his medical degree, Nicholas Garrigan wants a change of life, and escape from his father. Taking his new degree, Nicholas travels to Uganda, to help the sick while searching for adventure. Being taken to a car accident involving newly appointed leader Amin, Garrigan impresses Amin with his confidence, but mostly on his Scottish heritage. Taking a liking towards Garrigan, Amin appoints him as his personal physician. Garrigan is easily charmed by Amin, going up the ranks to Amin's consultant to right hand man, though Garrigan starts to question Amin's leadership when his real personality crawls out and becomes witness to many unsettling events.The Last King of Scotland catches you off guard. Told throw Garrigan's eyes, our initial scenes take us through his travels, his work with the villages doctors, and the beginning of his friendship with Amin. Used as an easement of what's to come, all the civil unrest and killings under Amin's rule are all unseen, as Garrigan isn't witness to them; yet. The closer he get's to Amin and what was unseen now faced on, the darker Garrigan's journey becomes. His ideas of coming to Uganda to save the dying and look the savior shatter on his realisation of that simplicity, when clasped so tight to Amin, a man who almost has that sparkle in his eye, switches instantly to cold blooded murderer.Kevin Macdonald shows his competence jumping from the documentary to feature film. Those initial scenes he takes you by the hand, as we start to spiral into this hellish world he taking us too. Trying to show us his craft as a film maker, he does push too hard than needed. Macdonald's directing is competent, but reaches didactic and awkward at times. This hits a point during Amin watching the film Deep Throat, trying to encapsulate his world of sleaze, along with his pool party where Garrigan makes his ultimate mistake. As the political side is only subtle laid in the background during the start, when Macdonald begins to play upon it, the darker themes move to the foreground, but fight with the paranoia edge of Garrigan's fight for survival and Amin's megalomania. Macdonald pushes one then the other, instead of wielding them in a double edged blade. While Macdonald's directing dips occasionally, there is outstanding cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle, and viscerally executed violence, with a gut wrenching climax between Amin and Garrigan.While The Last King of Scotland isn't told through Amin, Forest Whitaker is a commanding force to behold. Like Amin he charms you and draws you in to his world. As the charm fades, the vulgarity and sheer distaste to him build to one powerhouse performance from Whitaker. James McAvoy exudes Garrigan's cockiness and naivety, to a man simply saving his life. Gillian Anderson seems sorely underused as Sarah Merrit, with a character that isn't completely fleshed out.A few awkward moments here and there weigh The Last King of Scotland down, but when this gets going, there is no stopping it.",7,4,5,30 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the end has arrived
","The war is coming to an end. The separatists are running and the clone army is dwindling. The new ruler of the clone army, the robotic general grieves is on the run but is quickly found out and followed by Obi Wan. Anikin has news from Padme, she's pregnant with child; or two. Anikin is also being tempted by Chancellor Palpatine, who we find is the Sith Lord. He gets Anikin to join the dark side, and puts his giant plan into complete action; to destroy all the Jedi.This opens in a blaze of colour and action. Its an all out dog fight, with hundreds of ships everywhere, all in a blaze of fire. From this one scene the expectation is set high, it it falls so much after it. For the next hour or so you feel like you've been cut short. But when it hits that half way point, it finally gets that kick in the backside its been needing since episode one. With the last two installments, they have been lacking so much emotion and energy that made the first trilogy so wonderful to watch. During the first half of Revenge, it does fall with the Eps. 1 & 2, but then the final half starts to climb up to the level the original created. When Anikin turns and with the mass genocide of the Jedi's, you know George Lucas has finally come back into form.Most of the action scenes are quite good, with the opening scene being a real highlight. But it is the final fight between Obi Wan and Anikin everyone was waiting for; and it does pay off. The emotions run high when Anikin is burnt to a bloody crisp on the volcano. Another emotionally charged point is when Anikin kills the young kids. Though this has a lot of good elements, this is a very majorly flawed movie.The acting in all the three latest Star Wars have been so low. The acting seemed so ridged and stiff. They kinda felt like cartoon characters as they didn't show a lot of emotions. The effects is another down point. Not to say that they are great, they are mind blowing the special effects, they are flawlessly made, but they are everywhere. Basically every set was digitally created. It creates a much more warmer feeling when the sets are actually built, the special effects make all the sets seem so cold and flat.It doesn't quite reach the perfection of the originals, buts still a great watch. Its spine tingling to hear Darth Vader take the first breath through the mask.",7,2,6,1 November 2005

Constantly on his tail, Jack Valentine wants Yuri out of commission, yet fails from incriminating evidence.From the opening sequence the message of Lord of War hits you hard, making its statement clear and right in the cross hairs. Mixing satire with the political agenda makes the message even harder, as the story is based on actual events. Lord of War is one of the first films that exposes the underworld of gun trafficking, which is heavily dominated by films of the seedy world of drugs, so Lord of War is a breath of fresh air, yet Lord of War doesn't reach the grandiose mark that a lot of films have done for the drug world. Yuri is not a hypocritical man, for the lack of morals he has, his life is a balance of paradoxes from the friendships he has from all the government leaders. Stating that he does his job because he's just good at it, emotional connections are severed to Yuri, though reflects a cold truth on the people who run the trade. Being unsympathetic for the people who fall under the rain of bullets, it becomes harder to sympathise with him when any tragedy hits him.Narration is always a hard element to handle, as the narration either works to the films advantage or back-flips and doesn't work. Yuri's narration hinders and distances further from the emotional connection of the characters. Shining moments are the symbolism mixed with the statistics, the sound of cash registers from the expulsion of the bullet shell, placed with what may be any almost to perfectly picked sound track; granted it hits every moment perfectly.Suited perfectly for Nicholas Cage, he embodies Yuri, evoking that unsympathetic, cool hardness, rattling off gun specs without skipping a beat. Jared Leto turns a disappointing performance as Vitaly, bouncing on an emotionally erratic yo-yo. Ethan Hawke brings nothing special to Valentine, with his brief appearances so wooden. Bridget Moynahan brings one of the better performances, wonderfully showing the unquestioning naivety of Ava.While its not startling revelatory, Lord of War still surprises on the illegal gun trade, yet doesn't compare to the depth brought to films on drugs. Yet this does open the door for more films like this to make their appearance.",6,1,3,20 February 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," excellent war drama
","Jin-tae and Jin-seok are brothers. Jin-seok is set college and carries the hope are dreams of his family. Jin-tae works fixing shoes, creating income to help support his brother. They had their lives plan until all hell breaks lose; North Korea declares war on South Korea. Jin-seok is drafted but Jin-tae volunteers to protect. Tae seeks to find any loop hole he can find get his brother out of the army. But when they both enter into the world of war, their bond of brotherhood is stretch beyond its limits.At first you could be mistaken to think this is just another war movie, but this is so much more. Mixing in the drama of brotherhood raises this to higher levels. Though this still holds the universal themes of war movies. The effect on society, the physical effects of the soldiers and more importantly the mental and emotional effects any war can have. during the war the brothers change and they start to see other sides of each other, which ultimately they would rather not have seen. When one brother suffers from Stockholm syndrome, can the bonds of brotherhood survive any hurdle, or once broken is it unfix able.Just like 'Saving private Ryan', Brotherhood of War is not ashamed of throwing you deep within the confines of the trenched and the no-mans land. Director Je-gyu Kang throws the violence right at you during the action, and doesn't relent till its over. But whats more powerful is the emotional drama. The end is such a tear jerker. If you cant handle heavy drama i recommend you have tissues ready.If you love your war movies, this is a must see.",8,4,5,13 October 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," pure psychological thriller brilliance
","Agent Clarice Starling is a training FBI agent, hope to work in behavioral sciences with Jack Crawford. Crawford though sends Starling on an assignment, to psychologically exam the insanely intelligent criminal Hannibal Lecter. Crawford had another agenda, to see if Starling can press information out of Lecter to help with the current case of Buffalo Bill. Bill has already killed five girls, skinning off sections of their bodies. Lecter is intrigue by Starling and helps her with the investigation; they start to form a strange friendship.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best psychological thrillers. Thomas Harris's best selling book is faithfully transfered to the screen. It's one dark twisted disturbing ride. The mood is heighten by Demme's great direction, with such detail in all the sets and locations. Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully, during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile, then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell; just waiting for Starling to show, you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter, he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer, you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is; you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.The Silence of the Lambs is a must see, one of the best thrillers you'll ever see.",10,21,41,27 October 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," popcorn film at its best
","You know the type of people, who are so interactive with a action flick, that they mimic all the guns and explosions. Well if you did that with this installment of the resurrected Die Hard franchise, you would be hoarse by the end of the two hours. By no means the first film ever to have constant and relentless action thrown at the audience, but like most that do, proceedings turn boring and repetitive by the end. It's a glimmering light shown from Len Wiseman, that Die Hard 4.0 is an exemption and one of the most entertaining popcorn films in quiet sometime.Twelve years since we have since John McClane, Die Hard 4.0 doesn't play around with the formula, that has become a blue print for so many films from the invent of Die Hard. McClane once again is entangled in the plans of a well-groomed villain, where digital terrorism is our other foe. Based upon an article by John Carlin, the premise see's what happens when an entire country is hit with digital mayhem, and ultimately when that control over the digital world is ripped from its hands. The short answer here, Armageddon. The concepts and ideas presented by Carlin does the ultimate mind boggle on this 'What if' situation, as humanities dependency is so reliant on this digital age. Sreenplay by Mark Bomback, beefs up the action side and injects the Die Hard formula, along with McClanes wise-cracks and invisible subtitle 'They hurt my family, nows it's personal' eighties homage, resulting in our John McClane adventure.Again McClane is the one man army, winding up in the wrong place at the wrong time again on a routine suspect pick up. Willis shows he is McClane, while able to show up all those young action stars he still has the goods, even if he doesn't have the ripped body of yesterdays. Very self aware of itself, instead of an intriguing thriller with dark undertones, director Len Wiseman, of both Underworld films, takes Die Hard 4.0 to bombastic levels of constant action set pieces, but all in the good name of great entertainment. With each set piece nearly an allusive boxing match; John McClane verses a band of armed hit men, John McClane verses a Helicopter, John McClane verses Kung-Fu Chick, John McClane verses a Jet Fighter. Each one raises the bar of ill-credibility so high, on paper its insanity of the highest order. Wiseman likes his films sleek and slick, and to his credit executes each scene with such precision, edited perfectly, to draw out that 'Whoa' with such easement. Your eyes will binge on so much eye candy, as this defines destruction with nothing left unblown or shot out to the hilt. Rubble should have had a credit, with more screen time than most of the actors.Relentless in pace and ACTION, ACTION, ACTION to please action flick junkies, Die Hard 4.0 like the predecessors are guilty pleasures. If you were able to take one part from this film, if needed to place a bet on the victor between McClane verses a Jet Fighter, you know where to place your money.",7,1,3,9 August 2007
X2: X-Men United," one of the greatest comic book adaptations
","The struggle between humanity and the mutant race has grown stronger and reaching critical point. After an attack on the President by the mutant Nightcrawler, military scientist William Stryker uses this to take action into his own hands. Returning from Alciline Lake after finding no more clues to his past, Logan returns to Xavier's school of the gifted. Rogue and Bobby are currently dating; yet finding it challenging to be close to each other due to Rogue's power. Jean's powers are acting erratic, unintentionally affecting things around her. When Xavier locates Nightcrawler, Jean and Storm go after him, while Xavier and Scott visit Magneto. With Logan looking after the children, Stryker attacks the school. During this confrontation, Logan realises Stryker may hold keys to his locked past.In an explosive, opening sequence of Nightcrawler's attack in the White House, it's easy to see Bryan Singer has taken this installment to the next level. X-Men 2 does follow the pattern of most sequels; increase the action, mind blowing stunts and special effects, yet there is something different too X-Men 2 that makes it stand out. While the action has increased, there is still character development, while bringing new characters to the mix. Wolverine's past is uncovered more, the love triangle between Logan, Jean and Scott is explored deeper. Rogue's and Bobby's love is tested with their inability to be close. Bobby's life is fleshed out more, with his revelation to his parents that he is a mutant.X-Men 2 tapes back into the subtext set up in the first X-Men. Themes of acceptance, intolerance, fear of the unknown, are explored deeper, when they could have easily been dropped over the action. Missing from this installment are the quieter moments between characters; which made the first film so strong.Bryan Singers direction is on a all new level. Action sequences are done on such a high standard with great detail. The opening scene of Nightcrawler's on the President is mind blowing. Wolvernie's fight with Deathstrike is greatly orchestrated; moving a such a fast pace. The original cast return to reprise their roles. Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos make for a stellar cast and are perfectly suited to their roles. Adding to the list Brian Cox is perfect as Stryker. Alan Cumming makes for a great Nightcrawler.X-Men 2 is one of the greatest comic book adaptations. It has everything a fan wants; and more, with an ending that just leaves you salivating for the next installment.",9,0,0,15 May 2006
The Ringer," it's a hard subject to tackle...
","Steve Barker works in a stable office job, though lacks a lot of confidence, wanting to boost his career. When his boss tells Steve to fire Stavi the janitor, he hasn't the heart; giving Stavi a job of moving his lawn. Stavi accidentally cuts his fingers off with the lawnmower, but doesn't have the health care cover to fit the bill, ending in Steve's head. His Uncle also in financial debt with betting, comes to the idea of Steve entering the Special Olmypics. Unwillingly Steve enters and the con is on.When a film maker tries to tackle a touchy subject such as the Special Olympics, you can either call them brave or stupid. With the Farrelly brothers as producers, the mentality that you are in capable hands shows; as they have tackled touchy subject matter of late; conjoined twins and obesity. Screen Writer Ricky Blitt and Director Barry W. Blaustein tread the area lightly, keeping it safe and P.C. as possible; this is it's major flaw.The dark humour in The Ringer is touched upon lightly, not sending out the punches it needed. The subversive humour needed to bring it head out more often, as The Ringer lacks a lot of jokes, constantly pulling the same strings; if your going to take this subject on, go for broke. Though Barry W. Blaustein has done a great job, at no point does this feel condescending. The Ringer draws out its message genuinely about the handicapped; 'normal' people placing them in a world of can't and not treating them as equals.But the ultimate problem is that The Ringer is to predictable. Steve falling for Lynn, one of the volunteers. When Steve's cover is blow his room mates help him to win the competition. The Ringer drowns itself in to much sentimentality. The romance between Steve and Lynn is hammy and not really believable.Use to acting in stupid manners in Jackass, Johnny Knoxville actual looks uncomfortable, bringing a bland performance. Brian Cox over blows as Uncle Gary. The real stars are the people playing the special performers. They comprise of people with actual disabilities and actors, and they just steal the show every moment they're on.The Ringer could have been a lot more, but it was hard not to walk away with some guilty laughs.",6,0,0,28 April 2006
Final Destination," a guilty watch
","A group of high school students are flying to Paris for a school excursion. While waiting for take off, Alex has a vivid dream of the plane exploding mid air, just after take off. Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane, along with five other students; Clear, Carter, Billy, Terry and Tod, as too one of the teachers; Ms. Lewton. They don't believe Alex, thinking he's hysterical, yet when the plane explodes, they don't know what to believe.Final Destination has a great premise. As they left the plane, the seven 'survivors', cheated death in doing so. Though death is not done with them, picking them off one by one; there's no cheating death. Yet Final Destination isn't that great of a film over all. The directing is clumsy at times, the acting is nothing great, the dialog is nothing special either, yet these aren't the elements that make Final Destination a great watch. It's the elaborate deaths scenes that make this so interesting. Each one is either out of no where or meticulously drawn out for some exciting suspense.Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Kristen Cloke don't bring that memorable of performances. Ali Larter is quite good as Clear, she does the best acting of the lot.Final Destination isn't a brilliant thriller, yet is such a guilty pleasure to watch.",7,0,2,23 April 2006
Munich," another wonderful film by Spielberg
","At the 1972 Munich Olympics, eleven Israeli Athletes were taken hostage by a Palestinia terrorist group called Black September. The Palestinia group want prisoners of war released that are held by the Israelits. The whole situation grows horribly wrong, with all eleven hostages killed. Three surviving kidnappers were set free and taken out of Germany. The Israeli government sets up a small team of assassins, to target the people involved and constructed this attack; eleven in total. Heading the five member team is Avner, who's wife is currently pregnant. Avner, employed under Mossad head Ephraim, becomes a shadow; he doesn't work for anyone and doesn't exist. One by one Avner and his team track down the involved people across the European landscape.The incident of the Munich Olpymics is vividly recreated by Steven Spielberg, the 1970's is meticulously detailed against the rich backdrop of the European cities. Munich is a great, thrilling political drama on the terrorist attack, blending fact and fiction. Spielberg has captured the coldness that surrounds the situation, and the retaliation taken by the Israeli government. During the scenes of the assassinations, the tension is so taunt and of such a high caliber. Its unnerving that we are shown the detail and precision of the attacks; how they construct the bombs and contraptions, and the set up to place them. It really shows the commitment they are taking to complete their task. The attacks are more unnerving and realistic with the graphic violence.Holding Munich back from reaching a brilliant thriller is the length. It has a drawn out pace with the story. The tension doesn't keep an even pace, due to the pacing of the film. When there should have been rapid fire tense scene after one another with little breathing space, we're given to much breathing space, letting the tense atmosphere slip. Munich starts to fall towards the end, leaving the political tension for family drama. Yet there is much paranoia captured in Avner, trying to keep his family safe.While this could have been a one sided story, we are shown both sides, hearing both the Israelis and Palestinias. We hear their argument and the commitment they hold for their beliefs. While Avner is shown as a noble man, committing deplorable acts, while we can sympathise with him, we still aren't meant to accept what he's doing.In a career defining role, Eric Bana gives his best performance to date. He perfectly embodies Avner, showing the eternal conflict he has, yet the commitment for the task. Daniel Craig seems miss casted as Steve, though does a good performance. Geoffrey Rush shows another strong job in the minimal role of Ephraim. Completing the assassin team; Ciarn Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler all give gripping performances. Steven Speilbergs direction is wonderful. We are taken head first into the story, yet Spielberg's direction isn't intrusive, letting the story come out.Though it may be drawn out to much, Munich still is a gripping thriller, on the retaliation taken out on this tragic event.",8,1,1,25 January 2006
The Matrix," an sci-fi action classic
","Thomas Anderson; or Neo, is a computer hacker. Currently he is looking for a man called Morpheus. One night he is contacted by a woman called trinity, telling him everything he knew about his existence is about to change. Soon the man Neo was looking for finds him. He brings upon Neo a startling revelation about the existence of all humans. The artificial intelligence created by man have enslaved the human race; using us as a form of power source. To keep us alive they have built a computer generated reality call the matrix. There are rebels of the matrix, people who try to release as many people they can, to tell them the truth that they have been living in a dream world. Inside the matrix are deadly, super fast sentinels call agents, that stop at nothing to stop the rebels and their cause.The Matrix is a mind blowing, sci-fi action extravaganza that has become an instant classic. The Wachowski brothers have created a wonderfully detailed world that does have much to say about modern life and the dependence of technology. They have made a future that in a sense can be very close to us and holds a startling truth that in essence could happen. They have put a lot of philosophy into the story, giving it a lot of depth and detail so you can pick new information over many watches.The special effect are nothing short of amazing. They haven't lost any of their impact over the years. The fight scenes are the best fights in any movie to date. They're fast, high energy and have been influenced by many martial art films, but they do have been given that western feel; having that rigid style than being really gracefully. The slow motion and camera work they made just exploded the rules of fight sequences and created a revelation in cinema. Not long after nearly every action film was copying The Matrix, but they never came close to The Matrix. The lobby shoot out is just a visually amazing sight, with all the debris flying everywhere, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith is so intense and brutal. The green wash of the matrix adds a sense of alienation; being a non-reality. The blue and white colours of the real world add a haunted ghost feel of the dead earth.Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne all give great performances. All exerting strength in their character yet giving them emotional depth too, making them multi-dimensional, instead of flat 2-D characters that you can't link yourself to. Hugo Weaving gave a brilliant performance as the menacing Agent Smith. He suited the role perfectly, not over doing the tough persona. Joe Pantoliano also gave a great performance as Cypher.The Matrix has raised the standard of action films so high that it will be a long time before any other film can jump over it. A classic film that must been seen.",10,1,2,29 November 2005
300," amazing action, lousy drama
","The Battle of Thermopylae, might be one of the greatest battles in history. Three-hundred Spartans defending against the quarter million strong Persion army under the command of Xerxes. Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, fictionalises this point of history into a surrealistic manner, while increasing the Persion army stronghold to one million. Making a mark with the Dawn of the Dead remake, Zack Snyder adapts 300 in a Gladiator meets Sin City.Snyder is loyal to Miller's novel, staying true to the bronze soaked visuals and going as far as lining up blood splatters from the novel. Visually 300 triumphs effortlessly, with lush computer generated backdrops and an odd beauty within all the blood shedding. Visually engulfing 300 may be, a deep lack of drama and substance hinder 300 from Synder's aspirations. Men of the most extreme, the Spartans are the baddest of the bad, with 300 constantly wearing this badge of manhood on its sleeve, but makes the error of mistaking this badge as a shield. Grand standing and posturing with each man pelting out the loudest voice is all emotional deft when these are men of action, not ones to emote. Strangely scenes turn awkward the moment any one shows any emotional side. David Wenham's narration of Dilios recount, falters on every aspect, mainly on Wenham's lack of commanding voice and over emphasis to dramatise every moment; along with Synder trying to jam Epic! down your throat from point dot.For the lack of substance 300 holds, the battles sequences are among the greatest place on celluloid. Firing on all pistons, fueled by extreme levels of testosterone, adrenaline and fierce intensity, Synder's directional skills excel with awe inspiring onslaughts and choreography among the blood thirst, which in effect glosses over any short coming the drama creates. Characterisations are kept minimal, there's no time to flesh anyone out (there's enough flesh on display anyway), when there's people to kill, though with this lack of dimension to play on, Gerard Butler cuts to the forefront. Showing Leonidas as a man with ideals and convictions, ripping out the odd quip, while slaying man after man on the field. Butler makes the most of broadly drawn Leonidas, the rest of the cast falls short. David Wenham's shortness of presence and story telling escape him. Dominic West's Theron, playing behind the scenes with his own schemes overly exaggerates. Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes is all glam. As the only touch of femininity, Lena Headey rises above most as Queen Gorgo.Visually stunning and battle sequences of the highest caliber, 300 on the surface is capturing and belligerent, the drama is too shallow in the depth department.",6,4,8,5 April 2007
Fantastic Four," another comic book movie
","when they started to make the movie versions of comic books, i was all for it; but now over the idea. the first lot of comic book movies were done very well; spiderman, X-men, and lately Sin City, but all the others are so lacking in substance, which is the case for Fantastic Four.I wasn't a big fan of the book or series, though i think Doctor Doom is the best villain ever. Julian McMahon played him very good, but his acting was not as great as on Nip/Tuck.The rest of the cast, Gruffud, Alba, Evans and Chiklis were no where on the same level as McMahon. Gruffud seemed miss casts as Mr. Fantastic, over exaggerating all his arm movements and twitches. Alba played Sue OK, but didn't seem comfortable in some scenes. Evans was so obnoxious, that his comic relief wasn't funny. Chiklis was OK as the Thing, but couldn't believe the scenes where he was trying to come to grips with his looks.The only time this movie had an emotional kick to it was when they were emotionally fighting with another; with Doom trying to play them against another. But the amount of bad one liners, bad action sequences and hurried end covered the emotional core between all the characters.The special effects were another flaw of this movie too. The effects for the human torch didn't seem believable; it didn't look like fire. When the invisible girl disappeared, keeping her outline so you could still 'see' her wasn't a good idea. When Mr. Fantastic stretched it also didn't seem real. though the up side was how they made the thing with a suit. He actually seemed like a rock and looked like he was indestructible. Though the best was the make-up for Dr. Doom. That was just wonderful. The metallic hand had to be the best effect in the movie.Overall, this isn't bad, but its nothing spectacular. This is just a little bit of escapism that will entertain for two hours.",5,0,1,13 July 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," on second thought lets not watch the holy grail....tis a silly movie
","King Arthur is going across Britian to find knights to join his Knights of the Round Table. Soon Arthur and his Knights are told by God to search for the Holy Grail. Along the way they meet some strange and interesting people and creatures, and get into all sorts of problems.Monthy Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy classic. The guys from Monty Pythons are comic genesis, creating an all out, non stop laughing movie. All the characters in the Holy Grail are absolute classic, also the scenes their in. The Black Knight and his dismembering appendages, never giving up a fight despite any wound he incurs. The Frnech Guard taunting Arthur and his Knight; with a outrageous accent, saying they already have a Grail, to which Arthur and his Knights make a trogan horse; forgetting the all important point of being inside the horse. Sir Galahad stumbling upon the Castle Anthrax; full of sex deprived women. Sir Lancelot and his blood soaked rampage to save a trapped prince. The Knight who say Ni, Tim the Enchantor, the killer rabbit and so many more.The animation by Terry Gilliam that is spliced into the film works to great effect; giving it extra Monty Phython feel, the animation has that Gilliam aesthetic of surrealism. The acting is just wonderful. Yes that it is over acted, but it suits it perfectly. Its great how they played most of the characters themselves, showing a range of personalities and acting abilities. The film is basically a line of skits, but they have connected them really well and made them run at a constant flow, always keeping the laughs coming. Some of the running jokes through the film don't lose any punch or humor, which many running jokes in other films fall flat by the end. Monthy Python and the Holy Grail is a classic comedy that must be seen. Its great that its held up for so long and will for many more years.",10,0,1,11 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," brilliant sequel
","The rebels have had their brief victory over the Imperial Forces; destroying the Death Star. But the rebels are on the run, hiding on the remote planet Hoth. Though hidden for now, it doesn't last long. The Empire have found the rebels base and are going to wipe them out. When the rebels escape, Luke goes to find Yoda, to begin his training to become a Jedi. Han, Chewbacca, Leia and C3PO are having more trouble. They are being run down by the Imperial Force fleet; trouble is the Millennium Falcon is falling apart, making their escape all the harder. Finally escaping they head to the cloud city to take refuge with Han's old friend, Lando. But Lando is stuck in a bind. He is being used as a pawn by Darth Vader, to set a trap for Luke.This can easily be said to be one of only a few sequels that has surpassed the original. The Empire Strikes Back is darker, deeper plotting, much better dialog and incorporates more action without relying upon it. T.E.S.B. expand the story even further, creating some startling revelations. I still remember the first time i heard Vader's mind boggling truth to Luke. This also perfectly sets up for the third sequel, ending on such a note of anticipation.The acting is also better. Here all the actor have fitted comfortably into their characters. As the dialog is better, they seem a lot more comfortable; Lucas's writing in the first Star Wars at times seemed really basic and childish, but its more intellectual here.The special effects are just great. They make the action sequences so much better. The fight between the rebels and the Imperial Walkers is so amazing. The fight between Luke and Vader is so intense and emotionally charged; it stays with you that fight.A step forward in the Star Wars movies. One of the best sequels to any movie.",10,3,5,11 November 2005
Sin City," Ball Busting
","This is the film that i had been waiting for. Rarely has there ever been a film where i was knocked out of my seat from the ball busting attitude of a film. Right from the first second of film I felt i would leave a happy person. The heavy black and white cinematography, the intense colour work, the awesome acting from everyone, every bit of this is flawless in my eyes.Many have said this is sexiest against women, but the whole time the women were on I thought i wouldn't want to mess with them. This is really empowering for the women. As they said, the women are the law, and you wouldn't want to cross them; especially Miho.All the guys are tough and forceful. Marv going on a relentless massacre for a woman he loved is the best tragic love story i have every seen in film. But all the stories are tragic love stories in one way.A thought about the violence in Sin City. If this was in colour, the violence would have been so much more disturbing. Though this is a violent movie, it is very stylized; so the impact is dulled down that your not always registering the violence.In all, this is Robert Rodriguez's best work. This film will never date and be as strong in 20 to 50 years time.",10,0,1,20 July 2005
Happy Feet," majestic animation
","Emporer penguins have become a hot topic. Documentary March of the Penguins captured audiences with awe inducing beauty, (if not a very insightful or impressive documentary overall), and documentaries about these majestic animals have allured us on television. Long in the making, Happy Feet also places us in the habitats of the Emporer Penguins. Since Mumble hatched from his egg, he compulsively tap dances to his heart contents. Shunned by everyone, including his father Memphise, the Emporer Penguin sings to find their mate, yet Mumble is afflicted being unable to sing.Right from the get go, Happy Feet is like no other animated film. Director George Miller has created a computer animated film of grand cinematic proportions. The sheer beauty and majestic scale of the animations is overwhelming. Pixar has constantly raised the bar of computer animation higher and higher, Happy Feet firmly plants the bar higher and a triumph of Australian animation. The meticulous detail of every penguin and harsh snow covered South Pole are unbelievably captivating; it's amazing a white covered land can draw you in so much.The writing and story of Happy Feet, along with the animation, makes this film even more a stand out. George Miller along with Judy Morris, John Collee and Warren Coleman, have written a script that this tongue in cheek, heart warming and poignant. Along with the usual story arcs of acceptance, love, family and friendship, there is a hard hitting sub text of humanities impact on the environment. This is woven in subtly, from the declining food supply of the penguins and Mumbles determination to discovering why. This message though thuds at the very end; when humanities realises what they're doing is harmful, turning very didactic and losing some of it's impact and poignancy.Happy Feet also injects one of the most guilty pleasures of all cinema; the musical. From the opening Prince number and highly infectious tap dancing and singing, makes this one delightfully, guilty pleasure. The voice cast is spot on and perfectly casted. Elijah Wood captures that innocence in Mumble. Hugh Jackman brings a believable southern accent to Memphis and disappointment towards his son. Nicole Kidman mixes care free and strong willed in Norma Jean. Brittany Murphy matches Gloria perfectly. Robin Williams brings his over the top antics for both Ramón and Guru Lovelace, delivering the best laughs. While there is a strong American voice talent, complimenting the Australian animation along with Kidman and Jackman with the voice talent; Hugo Weaving, Magda Szubanski, Anthony LaPaglia and the late Steve Irwin.Superb animation, wonderful and poignant story and indulgent singing and tap dancing, Happy Feet is one exuberant film to behold.",8,0,0,25 December 2006
Contact," journey to the unknown
","Since she was a young girl, Ellie Arroway has been obsessed with space and its unknown inhabitants. She has been meet with trouble for receive grants into her research of life beyond our realm of the galaxy. When her grant is running out and all look hopeless, a message from space arrives. The message is a pulsating noise in mathematical form, carrying information. On the deciphering this, Ellie and her team discover that the information are blue prints, to build a machine. The machine itself is a transportation mechanism, which they believe will take them to the machines maker and proof of intelligent lifeforms.Contact is a wonderful exploration of other life forms and the ramifications to this discovery. The realms of science and religion cross paths here, and they both have a show down. There are many themes explored in Contact; the destruction or re-enforcement of the higher being - God, if there is other life are they benign or malevolent, the religious undertones of faith and the search for truth. While the religious and scientific aspect do collide, they are neither condoned nor called irrelevant. Both hold relevant questions, while they don't have answer, they can't be discredited.Contact is surrounded in that mysterious unknown sense; very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odessy. Both venture into the realm of intelligent life forms with unknown actions; are they here to help or bring our doom. While 2001 was more abstract and surreal, Contact hits hard with the science and religious side, yet still leaves room for interpretation; you are asked to make your decision.From the moment she appears on screen, Jodie Foster has that commanding presence. What makes this film believable is from Foster, you can see it in her eyes, delivering another strong performance. Matthew McConaughey brings one of his best performances as Palmer Joss, who can't relinquish his religious beliefs in search of higher beings. While the rest of the cast; Michael Chaban, James Woods, William Fichtner and Tom Skerritt don't give outstanding performances, Contact doesn't rely on them, as the story does circle around Ellie and Palmer, and Foster and McConaughey do hold the story strongly on their shoulders.Contact is a wonderful exploration into the heart of the unknown and the possibility of intelligent life forms, that space does hold tightly a secret.",9,2,5,16 January 2006
The Simpsons Movie," just off the golden years of the series
","If there was every more of a parent and teacher of a generation, it would have to be The Simpsons. The zeitgeist of topical and social commentary, The Simpsons were more than just the average run of the mill cartoon show. Though like all great things, they all must come to an end, maybe not the end of the show, but the time of their grasp upon that zeitgeist has been severed, and losing that sharp edge which made The Simpsons so special; slap stick, Homer antics now the norm. With writers from the golden years of the show on board for the belated release of The Simpsons Movie, redemption seems promising, striking back into that zeitgeist. Yet a more pressing question is what can the movie tackle, as just through every day living, it’s hard not to say, “Remember when {insert Simpson character} did {insert act}”. Over 400 episodes, everything has been said and done, as South Park pointed out, “Simpsons did it”. So it’s not surprising that environmental themes are the main point of focus, with global warming such a hot topic. Luckily, this environmental theme isn’t jammed down your throat, and good old shenanigans are back. The first half runs with rapid fire jokes and satire, it’s hard not to think, this is what The Simpsons were all about, with pure gold coming out of every scene with Homer and his adopted pig. Once Springfield is encased within the Dome, due to Homer dropping pig excrement in Springfield Lake and is labelled a biohazard by the Environmental Protection Authority, the pacing slightly drops, as some jokes miss than hit, yet the humour still sits on a level to call this the funniest film of the year. Maybe a draw back to the humour is the broad range the writers have aimed for, incorporating the maximum audience. Fans will still be appeased, as in jokes are placed throughout, the ambulance at Springfield Gorge a prime example, and genuine emotional drama and even pathos in Homer’s redemption. In an attempt to bring a big Simpsons adventure to the big screen, there is a lack of surprise, as times arise of haven’t we seen this in another episode, and this really is just a super extended episode, but it’s one of the best to come out of the Simpsons in a very long time.",8,2,7,27 July 2007
High Fidelity," one mans tragic love life
","Rob owns his a record store. There is hardly anyone in there; but he likes it that way. Rob has never been good at relationship. Whenever he hits a good spot, he slides right into a spiral and the relationship just falls apart. We are then taken through his top five worst relationship break up. Though he tries to move on; he cant get over these woman who hurt him so much; so he goes back to find out why the broke up with him so he can finally understand what is wrong with his life and why every relationship ends the same.This is a great black comedy about lost love, lust, redemption, forgiveness and a look into the male side of relationships. There is a lot of honesty to this movie, all the characters seem like real people. It was interesting when Rob always broke things down into a top five list; this is a very predominant feature of Rob, there's always a top five to everything. Though this does focus a lot on Rob's life, its great when we break off occasionally and we look into his two employees; Dick and Barry. They are such interesting characters, and such polar opposites of each other.John Cusack is great as Rob, he really suited the role. His narration; its more of a one on one conversation with the audiences, gives you real connection and insight with him, you can see whats going on in his head. Todd Louiso as Dick and Jack Black are great. Jack Black with held his hyper energy and gave a great ground performance, he really shines here.Iben Hjejle gave real beauty to Laura.What also makes this movie is the soundtrack. Every song is just perfectly picked and timed. The music does seem to organically come from the situations, instead of clashing.High Fidelity gives you a real high, you feel like hugging someone after this.",8,0,1,9 November 2005
V for Vendetta," provocative subject matter
","It's the year Twenty-twenty, and our world is vastly different. England is run over by a totalitarian government, lead by a fierce Adam Sutler using fear and violence to cower people to follow his lead. A corrupt media constantly runs antisemitic, anti gay and Muslim propaganda, to 'protect' their citizens. Evey works in the media that controls and edits the news. While walking outside after curfew, Evey is attacked by the Figermen, yet like a knight in shining armour, is saved by a mysterious vigilante called V. Evey becomes marked by the government as a co-conspirator of V, after V destroys the Old Bailey Building, on the fifth of November. Following Gay Fawkes's attempt to destroy the British Paraliment, in one year times plans to to fulfill Fawkes plan, and root the fifth of November forever in history.V for Vendetta is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V, is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and take a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy.V for Vendetta, while based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. While not have read the graphic novels, V for Vendetta seems to lack that depth of the political agenda it's tackling. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the fore front all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism.The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architec in Matrix Reloaded, the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. Vendetta takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman does a amazing performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.When the year Nineteen Eighty-Four approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year Twenty Twenty just around the corner, will V for Vendetta do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought.",7,3,6,29 March 2006
The Island," a mixed affair
","First off i must say this is Micheal Bays best picture. All of his other movies i have found quite disappointing, never really reaching the top of the pack; which i feel has always been because of the story line, as the action sequences always take over.At the beginning Micheal creates a very interesting world. The whole cloning concept and people living in a an environment where everything is controlled is quite interesting. But then everything that was set up in the beginning didn't matter any more after the first chase scene out of the complex. Though Micheal Bay does have an eye for action sequences; they were very well done.But i felt that the major flaw of the movie was that it took parts of other movies and spliced them together. The whole cloning for body parts was a spin on the sixth day. the car chase with the truck was a rehash of Bay's Bad Boys II chase of the car transporter. The hover-bike had star wars - return of the jedi all over it, the sound effect was even the same.though it does take a lot from other movies, this still actually stands by itself. the acting, though not great, is still solid and believable. Though is isn't great, it does keep you there till the very end.",6,0,0,2 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," mild comedy
","Born in the back a car going over 100 miles per hour, Ricky Bobby has been a speed freak, with a creedal of 'I wanna go fast', and 'If you ain't first, your last.' In a brief look at his childhood, Ricky wants speed and the love of his father. Jump to adulthood, Ricky Bobby works in the NASCAR pits. Soon Ricky is out of the pits and soon the number one driver of the circuit. Life friend Cal Naughton has always been loyal to Ricky, even to the expense of his career to boost Ricky's. With his ego running overdrive, Ricky hits a bump when French driver Jean Girrard, ruins Ricky's career and life.Written by Will Farrell and Adam McKay, with McKay also as director, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, is a flashy NASCAR, without the grunt or muscle. Done by the same team as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights follows the same suit and style of comedy as Anchorman, but something is missing. While not finding Anchorman a brilliant comedy, it has its charm; and the amazing Steve Carell. The comedy is flat, running off overly drawn out jokes.A prerequisite would be not to watch the trailer. All the good jokes were in there and knowing them before hand, left nothing good to laugh at. The chuckles are small and spread to far apart. There is fun to be had, spikes of humor come out of nowhere, but then drops back to flat-line.Will Farrell shows what he's good at, and he is good. Not as outlandish as Ron Burgundy, Farrell puts a nice balance between Ricky's hubris and hollowness, and actually looks realistic during Ricky's downfall stage. John C. Reilly is also good as Cal, who sticks through thick and thin. Sacha Baron Cohen seriously, seriously, hams it up as Jean. The accent is stretch far beyond caricature, but ultimately works.While there is some interesting sub text and playing on clichÃ©s on ignorant Americans, homosexuals and NASCAR scene, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, could do with a lot more kick to it.",5,0,1,23 September 2006
