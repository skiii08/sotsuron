It," Pretty good
","I didn't see this movie in a normal theater, so that might have an effect on my score. I saw It in a Dolby theater and It sounded amazing. With that said, here is my review that no one will see or care about.This movie is the opposite of most movies in the since that the kids were great and the adults acted like a paycheck was gonna be given no matter how bad they were, except for one. Bill Skarsgård.Skarsgård has said he wanted his own Pennywise and didn't want to emanate Tim Curry, while I don't think Skarsgård is Oscar worthy, he does a damn good job as Pennywise.All of the kids are good in their own right, but Jaeden Lieberher as Bill is fantastic. He never broke character, I thought his stutter was very realistic, and of all the kids I think he has the best chance of having a career. But non of this would work if the movie looked and sounded bad.It doesn't, like I saw this movie in a Dolby theater, so that might be why It sounded so damn good and loud, but cinematography is really good. I really am trying my best to not spoil this movie and I am coming off like I can't review a movie, but trust me when I say. If the adults were better, this would be an 8.4 out of 10. So do yourself a favor and go see it.",7,2,10,10 September 2017
