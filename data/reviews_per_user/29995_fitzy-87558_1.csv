Hereditary," What a pile of absolute garbage.
","Up there with the worst movies I have ever seen. Just truly abysmal.Long and drawn out for the first half. Nothing happens. Pointless. No suspense building.This film will give you nightmares guaranteed, but only for being so stupid to waste time and money on it.The audience were cringing and we could barely make eye contact on the way out. Was embarrassed.The ending is some kind of joke.I may need therapy to work this out of my mind.",1,108,219,18 June 2018
