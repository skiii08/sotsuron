The Blair Witch Project," don't forget your Dramamine
","OK, creative concept, but a slight movie all the same. And the hand-held camera work (often held in the trembling hand of someone running pell-mell through the woods...I mean, would you really keep filming??? but I won't quibble) is definitely quease-inducing for anyone with a tendency to motion sickness. In my case, the hype definitely hurt--the movie was creepy, but really scary? Nah. It also became repetitive--during the day, our heroes shrieked at each other for getting lost; after dark, they heard scary things; and when it got light they shrieked some more. Yes, the final shot is effective, but it didn't redeem the preceding 90 minut",Null,2,3,31 July 1999
