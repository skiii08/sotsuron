Alien 3," The second best movie of the series
","Alien 3 is a nice action movie and in my opinion is the second best movie from this series . It has a nice script and a good direction but I have to accept it is a little bit boring in the begining. After that, when the alien apears, it's cool, full of action and suspence. David Fincher did a good job making this movie. It is much better than Alien or Alien : Resurection but it does not compare with Aliens.",Null,0,4,20 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great efects
",Star Wars : Episode I have some great specil efects but it has a script that SuCkS. George Lucas direct well but he doesn't make good scripts that's for sure. The actors play pretty good. The coolest scene of the movie is the last fight; that is so well directed and they have so cool costumes that I think it should take a MTV prize but it didn't. This is a cool movie ! See it !,Null,0,1,21 July 2000
Wayne's World," Party on Garth ! Party on Wayne !
",Wayne's World ! Wayne's World ! Party time ! Excellent !This very funny movie that makes us laugh all the time is about party (betwen Wayne and Garth) and love (between Wayne and Casandra) ! I think the first is better than the second . If you want to laugh see Wayne's World !,Null,0,1,20 July 2000
As Good as It Gets," vErY cOoL, vErY oRiGiNaL
","Realy, this movie is one of the most original movies in the world and I think it should got more than two oscars ! Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt play so GOOD and make such a nice cuple together ! The movie has a good script . I think this is one of those movies that get close to the perfection. If you saw it, very good; if you didn't shame on you !",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Alien: Resurrection," A nice action movie lower than others
","Alien : Resurection(nice) is much better than the first Alien(sucks) but is lower than Aliens(supercool) and Alien3(good). Jean-Pierre Jeunet should be congratulate for making this movie because it's his first! Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder play pretty good and they are making a nice cuple. Anyway, this is a nice movie and you must see it !",5,0,0,20 July 2000
The Terminator," A cool scary action movie !
","I so The Terminator ! When I say that words I have a scary feeling. This cool movie made by master J. Cameron it's a scary action movie. Of course, you'll wonder why I say scary ? Because the movie is scary thanks to Arnold Schwarzenegger ! He looks like a killer in a horror movie, specialy when he take out his eye ! Anyway, this is such a good movie and I hope every people in the world will see it !",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," One of the best Tim Burton's movies
","I was so glad when I heared that Sleepy Hollow is made by Tim Burton because I was waiting for a long time to see a new movie of his. So I get to the cinema and I saw a fantastic movie with an exelent direction and an original good script with big actors (Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken) that play well. And now I'm waiting for another cool new movie by master Tim Burton !",Null,0,0,24 July 2000
American Beauty," EXELLENT
","THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD ! This is all that I can say ! Sam Mendes did an exellent, supercool drama. Kevin Spacey plays very very very good !!! Annette Bening plays exellent also just like the other actors. The movie's script is fantastic ! If you didn't see this movie see it and you'll discouver the beauty !",10,0,0,20 July 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Extra Super Duper COOOL !!!

This is fantastic !All that I can tell you is :  SEE THIS MOVIE !!!,8,0,0,21 July 2000
Face_Off," One of the best movies in '97
","I finaly saw this amazing movie ! I have to accept I didn't expect such an incredible action movie. This is the best John Woo's movie. Nicholas Cage and John Travolta play pretty good and make a nice cuple together. John Woo directed very good and cool this fantastic movie. The script is original, good, inteligent and interesting ! All this make FaceOff a good movie.",Null,1,2,24 July 2000

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," N I C E but not like the first !
","This sequel is just like the others. It's not as cool as the first. Steven Spielberg just coldn't make another movie like the first Jurassic Park. Anyway this is a cool movie with maybe too much action and too little suspence, with great actors that play well, with a nice script (but not so original) and, of course, with many scary dinosaurs.",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
The Insider," Complicate MoViE
",All I can say about The Insider is that it is a complicate movie. It isn't recomanded to under 14 people. And I am under 14 so I didn't understand some little parts. It has an exelent script with a good direction and very big actors that play well so I guess those things make The Insider a good MoViE !,Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Mission: Impossible," A nice action movie
",I expected a better movie because I've saw very much commercial on it. They make us think it will gonna be such a great movie with such big actors and actress but it wasn't. It didn't have so many big stars as they said. The script is not so good as I expected. It has a some action and suspense and a pretty good direction so I guess this make it a nice action movie.,7,0,0,17 July 2000
The Hurricane," Not as cool as I expected !
","I expected that this movie will take 2 or 3 Oscars but it didn't. I thought this movie will be much better but it wasn't . At least Denzel Washington save the movie from disaster by interpreting his role very very good ! I expected this movie would be better than it is , but it isn't !",Null,0,2,26 July 2000
Titanic," It shouldn't take 11 Oscars !
","Titanic i a good interesting movie with not such a good script but with a good direction. I saw it six times ! It get 11 Oscars by luck because there wasn't any good movies in '98. In my opinon it shouldn't take 11 Oscars. The actors didn't play so good . It is a good movie just because they invest so much in it and it is so long. If it wouldn't 'eat' so much many, Titanic would be a BAD movie !!",7,2,3,19 July 2000
Scream," The coolest movie from the series !
",I saw Scream after I saw Scream 2 & 3 and I think it is cooler and more original than the sequels ! I never saw any other slasher movie with two killers that cover one on each other. The movie has a good script !Wes Craven and Kevin Wiliamson did a very good job together and they have done a good horror movie !,Null,0,0,16 July 2000
Halloween," Cool ! But just in 1978
","This movie is pretty good . But if you see it now you will say that it sucks ! In '78 this movie was something incredible and fantastic. Now it is just an ordinary boring movie without action. The actors doesn't play very well and there are just two or three short fights without suspence and horror.  This movie was good then, in '78, and just then !",Null,1,2,26 July 2000
The Matrix," The best movie of '99
",In my opinion this amazing movie is the best action movie in '99 and maybe more. It has interesting good script and I think it should be nominalized at Oscar for the script. The ideea of this movie is amazing and original. I was so happy when I heared that it took four oscars ! Keanu Reeves play very good just like the other actors. I am so glad that they will make another Matrix. I hope it will take some other Oscars !,10,0,0,19 July 2000
Heat," de Niro + Pacino = HEAT
","Inteligent movie ! Is the first one with Robert de Niro and Al Pacino. This is a great movie because it has very many big stars like Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Tom Sizermore and many others. All this actors play very well and Michael Mann maked a good script and directed well this movie . I think it could enter in Top 10 in the world !",8,0,0,21 July 2000
Back to the Future," Let's go back in the future
","This movie is completely amazing and fantastic. It has so much cool stuff and action and suspence and drama and much more. It's that kind of movie that you don't want to end. The script is good and original and the direction is nice so it's a wonderful movie. It doesn't matter that it is old from '85, it's still good . It's an imortal movie he survive 15 years and he will live in the FUTURE !",Null,0,1,1 August 2000
Jurassic Park," The best dinosaur movie
","Jurassic Park is fantastic ! It has a great direction thanks to Steven Spilberg and a very good script thanks to Michael Crichton ! In my (and many others) opinion this is the BEST dinosaur movie. It has much action, suspense, a little bit of drama, scary parts, fantastic parts; and all this make from Jurassic Park a great movie !  Enjoy it !",9,1,1,21 July 2000
