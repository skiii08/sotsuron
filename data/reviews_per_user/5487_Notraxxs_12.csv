Blade Runner 2049," Sumptuous film-making at the wrong price point
","This movie gets it right with a few exceptions. I'm not here to talk about the few exceptions -- okay, the villain is pretty weak. You could teach a dozen different classes on the themes and imagery of this movie. But what were they thinking? A $150 million budget on a cerebral science fiction movie that continues the plot thread of a 35 yo cult classic? I would be hard-pressed to green-light this picture at half that budget. As an audience member, I made out, and I had to watch a half dozen trailers of stupid sh*t blowing up and people yelling things like 'there is no cure!' Sometimes I feel like we don't deserve movies like these. I'm glad it got made, don't get me wrong. But I think they just shot themselves in the foot.",9,6,16,8 October 2017
Requiem for a Dream," This movie tore me apart.
","I thought I had a realistic point of view in movies like Traffic or Trainspotting.  Requiem makes those movies look like Disney films in retrospect.  This is by far the most difficult movie I've watched.  No matter how hard, I tried I couldn't pull my eyes away.  I kept looking down at the dvd timer, waiting for the thing to click over to 102 minutes. Please let the suffering stop!! The direction, the writing, and the acting are all incredible.  (Who thought Marlon Wayans could act??)  I could drone on about the camera movements and the use of colors and images, but do you really care?  Go watch the movie if you haven't seen it.  And if you have seen it, I feel your pain.",Null,0,0,4 September 2001
Memento," Unique, emotionless film
","Memento hangs on the shelf somewhere between The Usual Suspects and Being John Malkovich.  The pacing, the timing, and the feel of the movie is unlike anything I've seen before.  Memento is a one way trip into a void of memories you wont soon forget.  But when it's all done and the credits are rolling, I couldn't help but wonder 'Whats the point?'",6,3,7,31 May 2001
Underworld," Action? Were we watching the same movie?
","In the beginning I thought I was watching Lord Of The Rings.  In the end I thought I was watching Terminator 2.  In between I was waiting for something to happen.  I'm not going to bash the unoriginality of this movies because 1)I already kinda did, and 2)It would probably be overkill by now.  I just read some of these reviews and I wonder if we watched the same movie. Everytime I thought there was going to be action, there was a cut away.  Oh boy!  Werewolf vs. Vampire in subway, nope sorry, cutting to Kate looking perplexed.  Oh awesome!  A dude with whips is taking on a werewolf! Nope, sorry, cut away when the werewolf approaches.  I can understand the limited budget this thing was made on, and the fact that they probably dumped all of the money into cinematography and costume design, but don't market it as something it's not.  Action? romance? Underworld contains not these things.",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
Elizabeth," The female version of 'The Godfather'
","Great Movie.  Strong central character starts out hesitant/ innocent, and slowly over the course of the movie becomes 'The Godfather' of England.Complete with the ceremonial termination of all enemies and the complete emotional shutout of all who were close and dear to the main character.",8,0,2,24 October 1999
Scary Movie 2," Mindless fun
",Is there a plot?  Not really.  Do we care?  Not really.  Scary Movie 2 strings the audience along from one gag after another.  There are some big laughs in this film but sometimes it's tedious getting to them.  See this late at night with a full theatre and you're going to have a good time. It's just as raunchy as the first one and just as tasteless.  That's why the first one was so popular.  It's a mouth full of laughs (just ask Tori Spelling).,6,3,6,4 July 2001
The Patriot," Less passionate Braveheart set in America.
","The Patriot took just as much liberty in historical accuracy, or lack there of, as Braveheart.  A lot of the emotions seemed forced, and the movie didn't have the beautiful art direction nor great script that Braveheart had.  This probably would have been considered a good film, but the comparison to its counterpart (Braveheart) is inevitable and makes the film less appealing.",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
Meet Joe Black," Doesn't Really Work
","The pace of this movie is deliberately slow.  The shots take there time. The actors settle in for the long haul.  The problem is awkward glances and intimate moments(long ones at that) where very little dialogue is exchanged doesn't really work for this movie.  Hopkins is excellent as usual, but the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders.  It rests on the chemistry between Joe Black and Susan Perrish.  I didn't feel that chemistry. I thought Claire Forlani bit off more than she could chew.  Oh and the whole scene in the hospital and the 'business scam' seem thrown in, like the writers knew they didn't have enough for a movie.  They were right.",Null,1,2,30 April 2001
Empire Records," Rough going
","I guess this is the kind of film you see when you are a teenager and think: 'Wow, this is really in touch with my generation'. Boy did I miss that boat. Sitting in a room, in a hostel, in Budapest, I watched this movie and then experienced one of the worst nights of sleep I've ever had (2 and a half hours to be exact). Americans came barging into the room at 2 in the morning and proceeded to make out in each other's beds for the next 5 hours. When I left at 6am the following morning two thoughts were racing(actually more like plodding) through my head: 'I hate American teenagers and I hate this movie.' I can't list anything redeeming about this movie, and frankly I'm wasting my time trying to care enough to write a paragraph about this amateurfest. It was the perfect movie for my hellnight in Budapest.",2,1,3,13 November 2005
The Mummy Returns," Didn't I see this movie a couple years ago?
","Campy, cheesy, and preposturous.  Wow, sounds like the first one!  The kid wasn't bad, the story was incoherent, and Brendan and Rachel have wonderful chemistry.  If you were a fan of the first one, turn your brain down to an even lower setting and go see this one.  The first summer blockbuster of 2001.",7,0,0,4 May 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," A classic that is under-appreciated.
","This movie is definitely on my best of the decade list.  It borrows heavily from a couple movies and makes a fresh, dramatic approach to story telling. Excellent directing, writing, and acting.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are awesome in this film.  This is film-making at its best.  I own the VHS and DVD versions of this film, and I highly recommend this film to everyone.",Null,0,0,8 March 2000
Gladiator," Braveheart meets the 13th warrior!
","If you've seen Braveheart, then chances are you'll think this film is eerily similar.  I wouldn't rate Gladiator up there with Braveheart, that's why I say it's a mix.  The 13th warrior had plenty of action, but it lacked a central theme and a strong character.  Gladiator has these faults to a lesser degree, and it has the same muddy look to it.  It is a good film...just not a great one.  So, if you liked the 13th warrior then you'll like this film, but if you think 13th warrior was a little shallow and convoluted, then chances are you'll come out of this movie with similar thoughts.",7,0,0,6 May 2000
