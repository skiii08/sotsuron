Hereditary," A true phenomenon
","Absolutely fantastic horror film that shines among the flood of mediocre possession stories of recent years. Beautifully shot, well acted (Toni Collette performance especially) with great soundtrack and brilliant ending sequence.
Easy 9 out if 10 from me, Hereditary restored my faith in horror genre.",10,1,3,9 February 2020
Apocalypse Now," Timeless masterpiece in every way
","Apocalypse Now is definitely one of the best movies ever made and one of the best adaptations of Conrad's Heart of Darkness.
I lost count of how many times I endure this surreal ride to the end of the River with captain Willard to listen monologues from Kurtz.
Is he a God, is he a Madman, or just a lost soul?
Accompanied by incredible soundtrack this timeless masterpiece of cinema will stay with you forever.",10,1,1,6 March 2020
A Quiet Place," For me it was unwatchable
","I could not take the premise of this movie seriously, the entire plot raises so many basic questions from start to finish I could not focus for one minute.
No idea why this is rated so high. The entire movie is just silly and suspension of disbelief is just not enough to justify it.
Cant believe why it was received so well that they are actually making a second movie.",1,1,3,17 February 2020
Avatar," Call Me Joe wolf ripoff
","Visually absolutely stunning, breathtaking and technically perfect.
As far as story goes is nothing more than a ripoff of 1957 'Call Me Joe' science fiction novel by Poul Anderson with added elements from Pocahontas and Dancing with the Wolves. Cameron added nothing new to above stories unfortunately, making the entire spectacle mindbogglingly unoriginal.
Undoubtedly an achievement in CGI film making but nothing more.",3,0,0,1 March 2020
Eyes Wide Shut," In my eyes Stanley's worst film
","I watched almost every single movie from great S.K. except this one. For years, I was hearing about it, I saw it quoted multiple times in pop culture.Finally, I was able to watched it and after two and a half hours of screen time I said to myself - That's it? Really?I don't know where all the praise is coming from, a masterpiece - really? Yes, its far from being bad but its also nothing special. Take Kubrick name from it and it would be forgotten. If I didn't know I would never suspect it could be directed by him.
There wasn't even any of Kubrick's iconic cinematography in it.Everything was just... average. At least now I know one movie by Kubrick that I don't like.",5,2,5,11 March 2020
Signs," Lets invade acid planet... naked!
","Lets make it clear - if you try to apply logic to this movie, you wont have a good time.
Aliens in Signs reacts to water like humans to acid. Yet they don't wear any protection, roam around in wet cornfields and grass... just just, don't think about it. Aliens are just plot device.
Rest of the movie is just very enjoyable ride, all the cas including children performs very well, the cinematography is great and Mel Gibson restores his faith at the end.
One of the better M.N. movies in my opinion.",7,0,1,23 March 2020
The Purge," One of the most stupid ones
","You want to tell me those masked kids could do literally ANYTHING during the 'Purge' time yet they decided to camp outside the Ethan Hawke house doing nothing?
Yeah, great story.
This movie premise and script is insulting and stupid.",1,0,1,24 March 2020
