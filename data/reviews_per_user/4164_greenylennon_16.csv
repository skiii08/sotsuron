Whip It," In the name of Girl Power
","It is funny to realize how unfair it is that such a gentle, yet unlucky, movie like this has been a failure, while craps like Saw 3D choke up theaters for more than three days. Sweet Bliss, tortoiseshell glasses and clothes only 'Ghost World''s Enid would wear, lives in a small Texas town, studies at the local high school and works as a waitress in a garish diner together with Pash, her wise and chubby best friend (Alia Shawkat, a freckled face perfect for this slightly unrewarding role). Bliss's mother is a former beauty queen, and therefore carries her reluctant daughter to incredibly poor pageants; but, respect to many movie characters of mothers ready for anything, she's a caring woman, who has probably suffered and who wishes all the best for her children. It's easy to notice that 'Whip It' is a movie ruled by women, because Bliss, in the attempt to turn her life upside down, tells a lie about her age and enters in an Austin roller derby team. It was only to be expected that Bliss/Babe Ruthless turns out to be born to score points on the skates, finds love in the super-hipster Oliver and friendship in her shabby team mates, but, since we're given an equal quantity of laughters and tears, her choices compel Bliss to neglect Pash and to tell her family too much lies. Plot is more than predictable and follows the structure of sport fairy tales like 'Ice Princess', but first-time director Drew Barrymore covers everything with a delicate, feminine, graceful spirit, and builds up a delightful leading lady, whose coming of age can be easily enjoyed. Kudos to a perfect Page, that, even in a less flamboyant role than Juno, forgets the sassy lines and plays a shy girl who gets to know herself and knocks down all her insecurities, in the name of Girl Power. Barrymore makes a movie that recalls the sport movies from the Seventies and the girl power from the Nineties, mixed up in a very faithful portrait of the suburbs and of the provincial way of thinking. The atmosphere turns melancholic in the last quarter, when Bliss must pick up the pieces and fix things with her parents, with Pash, with Oliver, with her favorite team mate Maggie Mayhem. The technical aspects are the weak points. Editing is rough and cinematography tends to zoom abruptly, but Barrymore can still improve a lot. Go girls!",8,2,6,21 June 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," it's a wonder
","Wonderful film. Images are magnificent, and they become more poetic with the dreaming music of the Howl and Sophie's flying sequence. I just can't understand how Wallace & Gromit  The curse of the were-rabbit won the Oscar. Of course, this film is all the same inferior than Tim Burton's Corpse bride. The story is about a young hatter, Sophie, who casually meets Howl, a wizard. But a baleful witch misunderstands the sort of their relationship and transforms the poor girl into an old woman. So, Sophie becomes the governess of the Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is a great, not only in in the extent of Japanese animes, but he is a master of the world animation: for example, you must see the sequence of Howl and Sophie's flight. Miyazaki includes all of his favourite themes: the metamorphosis, the flight, a girl lead. Congratulations to the score by Joe Hisaishi.",9,0,2,23 September 2006
Marie Antoinette," Pure grace
","Five months passed from my first (and only) showing of 'Marie Antoinette'. Five months didn't help me to forget this film. It has been maltreated and misunderstood by the critics, ignored by all the main awards (just some award to the costumes and to the art direction), but it doesn't mean it's a bad film. I'm a 15 years old teenage girl, and I can understand really well the young Austriac princess arrived to give happiness to France, held captive by an unsatisfactory, unconsummated (for seven years) marriage and by a golden royal palace, Versailles, full of fun and gossips, victim of an unlucky destiny. Thanks to the brilliant and underrated interpretation of Kirsten Dunst, I lived over again the anxiety, the frustration, the hope, the unbridled fun, the resignation, the dreamed and denied love for an handsome Swedishman. I appreciated Sofia Coppola's great sensitiveness not showing the guillotine: it's enough to see a destroyed Versailles room to realize the end of a world. And then, how can't you love the raging and effervescent soundtrack?",9,2,4,13 May 2007
Juno," Juno in translation
","The comedy who triumphed at Rome Film Festival finally got to Italy, accompanied by Fox's great box office expectations, although I'm nearly totally sure 'Juno' will flop here: for example, in my local theater there were only twelve people or maybe less. I don't care about it, because I enjoyed every little scene. The dialogue's translation tried to maintain the original liveliness, and even if they could result less hilarious than in English, I think a good job has been done: in fact, it mustn't be a very easy process. Ellen Page deserved completely the Oscar nomination: her simplicity, her passion, her sweetness and her irony trasude from every line, bringing a new light to the screen. Instead, Jennifer Garner really surprised me: she showed noteworthy acting skills that comic-book movies never require, and she made Vanessa's character natural and nicer. I cared for Vanessa as much as I cared for Juno. The movie doesn't take a clear position about unplanned pregnancies, but I felt as if Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman wanted to say that those are personal choices that mustn't be questioned, that's why I thank them. They gave me emotions I'll never forget.",10,3,7,7 April 2008
Spider-Man 3," Good Spidey
","I was worried about this third chapter. After and exciting initiator (with an unforgettable kiss) and a magnificent second installment, the chance to see a total crap and a drain on one's resources was really plausible. And, on the contrary, it isn't so: there are many flaws, but the film is very agreeable. The figures of Eddie Brock, funny swine, and of Gwen Stacy, a bit silly goose and rival of the mythic Mary Jane, are only touched (but they'd deserve a considerable investigation), whereas Flint Marko/Sandman is rather unlikely. Peter Parker's dark side is not so dark, and the risk to have an headache after the screening is quite high. But sometimes it's therapeutic dreaming in the dark of a movie theater with a popcorn bowl by the hands: cinema is also this.",7,1,2,13 May 2007
Corpse Bride," lovely, beautiful... watch it!
","You can only love this film. It's all perfect: the characters, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the dubbing. My mum also, who doesn't like Tim Burton, loved this film very much. Victor (dubbed by Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean  Dead man's chest) and Victoria (dubbed by Emily Watson, Separate lies) are an engaged couple. Victor can't remember the wedding wording, and, trying it in a wood, he puts the wedding ring in a branch emerging from the ground. But the branch is a corpse bride's finger, so Victor finds himself married to a dead girl. The Corpse bride is dubbed by Helena Bonham Carter, who does a great job. Each frame emits sweet romance and dark romanticism, but it's never sugary and mawkish. It's Tim Burton to cube, you can perceive the same atmosphere as Edward scissorhands. The faithful Danny Elfman signs the splendid soundtrack and the funny songs. My favourite sequence is when Victor and the Corpse Bride play the piano, but also when Mr. Bonejangles and his skeletal jazz band sing to Victor the story of Corpse bride's sad end. The characters of the parents and the Archbishop Galswell (dubbed by Christopher Lee) are really funny. It's magnificent the comparison between the Alive ones' world and Dead ones' world. Dead ones live in a colourful and happy downstairs; upstairs, alive ones live among conventions and dullness. It's really unfair Tim Burton's Corpse bride didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature: it was worth, in every way.",10,0,1,23 September 2006
Fargo," Foolishness fair
","The first thing you're struck by in this film is the incredible foolishness of the characters. Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy) is a perfect idiot, devoted to the money, loser and mediocre. Steve Buscemi's character is practically brainless, but we touch the acme with Peter Stormare's character. I've never seen a more boorish person: he never talks, but on the other hand his gun is always in action, and he's particularly cruel with his victims. Luckily there's Marge, the firm and REALLY funny pregnant policewoman played by the wonderful Frances McDormand: she deserved every prize she won and was nominated for. A perfect indie movie: maybe you'll not remember it for his production design, but the emotions you felt during the screening will be unforgettable.",9,0,0,24 April 2007
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","Although 'Mamma Mia!' is full with many imperfections, it brings so much happiness that you get out from the cinema desiring to dance and sing the tunes you've just listened during the film, and I think this is a very positive aspect in these trying times. Abba's songs are crystalline and joyous, and they still maintain their potential also in this film, in which, let's admit it, not everybody can sing (Pierce Brosnan wasn't born to sing, and even Meryl Streep hasn't an unforgettable voice, but the newcomer Amanda Seyfried is quite OK according to me). All in all, the best things in this film are: the character of Tanya (Christine Baranski is so funny!), the 'Dancing Queen' scene with that fantastic choreography, and the paradise island setting of this story.",7,2,3,13 December 2008
Twilight," Such a disappointment
","I really wanted to love Twilight. I mean, I'm a fan of the series but I admit that they aren't the best in contemporary literature, you can spend a couple of carefree hours reading them but they are nothing more, so I thought: usually when a book isn't a masterpiece, the movie is better. Man I was wrong, so wrong this time. How can you have a decent action flick when it is announced in January-February, filmed during the spring, post-produced for some months and then released in November? You can't: special effects are rustled up, they aren't acceptable anymore when you have seen wonders like Lord of the Rings or one of the Harry Potters. They seem to come out from 90's, I suppose. And then, the actors: Kristen Stewart is monotonous and shows no expressions or feelings, her Bella almost can't keep her eyes open; Robert Pattinson is gorgeous but can't exactly act; I only liked the castings of Jessica (wonderful Anna Kendrick), Esme and Rosalie. Ashley Green is pretty as Alice, but she isn't given much screen time. Last but not least, the best part in the book is the building up of Edward and Bella's romance: here it's totally cut, they pass  in 10 minutes  from angst and indifference to great love. I think it's because Bella's introduction in Forks is too long. Dialogues are awful, too. Please, if you must continue the saga, choose a new director and a new screenplayer, otherwise Summit is going to lose some of its audience.",3,25,42,25 November 2008
Across the Universe," Love comment for a film
","I'm exaggerating when I say: This is the most amazing film I've ever seen. 'Moulin Rouge' just fades next to 'Across the universe'. I mean, 'Across the universe' has a better soundtrack, more natural and respectful, and how could it be bad with the Beatles' music? All the songs are sung with such a passion by a group of actors that includes almost only fresh faces: and each one has a beautiful voice and stunning artistic skills, especially Jim Sturgess (Jude, so gorgeous) and Dana Fuchs (Sadie, so Joplinesque). Director Julie Taymor crafts tastefully absolutely beautiful scenes that are eye-candy and ear-candy, and never shows dangerous fallings into the cheesy and the kitch. And cinematography, costumes, sets, all top notch. Do you know where the injustice is this time? The movie is splendid, original, almost revolutionary, but the Academy ignores it. That's the sad story of any true masterpiece.",10,0,1,20 August 2008
Stardust," Stardust
","Stardust is really, really magical. More than the whole Harry Potter series, because you can feel the weariness and the desire to hit the box-office more than they can in Harry Potter movies, while in Stardust all comes from the heart and all is heartfelt. And the viewers feel that: the movie theatre was nearly empty (apart from me and my friends, and some lustful couples), but near the end we all burst into an applause.I think the best actor-actress here has been Michelle Pfeiffer. Villain without redemption, she portrays perfectly the bitchy witch Lamia, and probably she's even prettier than Claire Danes and Sienna Miller, although Mrs. Pfeiffer is nearly 50-something. Charlie Cox won't be a great movie star, but a good actor; Robert De Niro is funny, funny, funny, funny (my friend Federica and me couldn't stop laughing); Claire Danes is a bit false, but works as the falling star Yvaine; Sienna Miller appears for few scenes, and it's better this way: I can't stand her! Costumes, sets, cinematography, all first-rate, not like the computer graphics; to make up for it, we have what an American film fantasy can't offer: good actors, valid screenplay, imaginative direction.I hope they won't do a sequel or a prequel so Stardust won't be spoiled, but Neil Gaiman didn't write a second book and we can heave a sigh of relief.",8,3,5,16 October 2007
The Elephant Man," The touching story of a freak
","The elephant man is only the second film by David Lynch, but you can already breathe perfume of masterpiece. The Elephant Man (real name John Merrick) is played by John Hurt (1984), who uses his voice only: it's really unfair he didn't get the Oscar for this performance. The story of this man hideously deformed is touching and makes you think: who's the real monster, him or us? Can he be considered like a monster, he so delicate and appreciative? Or we are the real monster, we that use his hideous malformation to get money, or we that can't understand he's an human being? It's all more shocking because it's cinematographed (by Freddie Francis) in a violent black and white, full of shadows and twilights. Maybe, it remembers the shadow part of everybody. The cast is completed with Anthony Hopkins (who plays the doctor who saves and studies the Elephant Man), John Gielgud (the hospital manager), Anne Bancroft (the actress who grows attached of the Elephant Man) and Freddie Jones (the circus manager who beats and takes advantage of the Elephant Man). It's a shame for the Academy The elephant man didn't triumph at the Oscars. A real, real shame.",10,0,0,23 September 2006
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Two precious hours of my life wasted forever
","After the awful first installment, I hoped the change of director and the richer budget would help this saga to have a respectable film version. God, I was wrong.New Moon is a big disappointment. It feels rushed when the audience should understand what's going on, and very slow and boring when the movie needed a cut-down. But the sad thing is that it's funny, utterly funny, when it should be serious: people laughed badly at some Alice and Edward's lines, and I couldn't stand Bella and Edward scenes together: they are sloppy and ridiculous, acted hideously by Stewart and Pattinson, who never change expression and say a word per minute. I even didn't like Ashley Greene this time, and the Volturis and other Cullens appear too little, and that's a shame.The best actor this time is Taylor Lautner: his smile enlightens the screen and he can be very promising, if he picks interesting roles.Chris Weitz does what he can, but he has to cope with a bad screenplay so he isn't given lot to improve the film: well, the action improves but the whole Victoria subplot is overlooked and this will be no good for Eclipse development, because the third chapter is entirely focused on Victoria's chase.All in all, stay home and save money",2,11,19,22 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter lost somewhere his magic
","What a disappointment! What an huge disappointment! I want my money back! Where did the true Harry Potter series go? I remembered films where you could perceive magic always and everywhere, you could feel an heart beating behind all that computer graphic, you could daydream watching the gripping adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. This time it's a complete failure. The story hasn't heart, hasn't point, hasn't characters you can relate and grow attached to. Why does Harry kiss Cho Chang? I couldn't feel any sentiment between them. Why did they push Ron and Hermione away? Ron and Hermione were Harry's moral support in every situation, they were the friends everybody wants to have. Now they're merely two flat figures without any personality: where did Ron's liveliness go? Where did Hermione the friendly swot go? Maybe they lost somewhere between the special effects. The pacing went too fast, luckily I had read the book, otherwise I wouldn't understand anything. The only things I liked were Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. They're perfectly cast and show remarkable acting skills: about Staunton and Bonham Carter that's natural because they're very good actresses, but about Lynch wow, she doesn't play Luna Lovegood, she is Luna Lovegood! Don't waste your time with HP5, go see something else.",2,1,4,14 July 2007
Alice in Wonderland," Alice? Yes, passed conditionally
","I had been waiting for this film since his first announcement in 2008, so it was natural that I expected a lot from Tim Burton and the remaining crew, after the wonderful Sweeney Todd and the insuperable Big Fish, which for me is the best Tim Burton work so far. Failing to mention that I was very disappointed in finding out my running-wild myopia doesn't allow me to see 3D films (I still have trouble with my sight, and I came back from cinema one hour ago), I think the visuals are a delight, surely worth of the definition 'Wonderland': tortuous trees, garish flowers, Cheshire Cat and Blue Caterpillar better than Disney's, disproportionate queens and fantastic architectures, the crew couldn't do a better work, not to mention the costumes, the cinematography and the casting - although I didn't like the soundtrack and the score. Mia Wasikowska is a good breakthrough for the film, Anne Hathaway had a role that had a high risk of over-acting and ridiculousness, which she pulled off quite well, and Burton-darlings Depp and Bonham Carter were perfect as usual. But, but... there's something I didn't quite like. I often had the impression this was a film on commission, not generated by the filmmaker's own creativity and desire to produce a new work, and that's why 'Alice' lacked a lot of the poetry present in so many Burton films, the mostly loved factor, I think, of his production. I couldn't feel any true inspiration here, and it was a kind of letdown, because, if only it featured a tiny bit of inspiration, it could be a masterpiece remembered in years. I'm afraid 'Alice' will remain only a minor movie in Tim Burton's filmography, and it will be mainly quoted for its outer beauty. I'm sorry I'm giving a Tim Burton's film a 7, but I think this is the rightest vote, considering the reasons I previously tried to analyze.",7,0,4,6 March 2010
WALL·E," I Love Wall-E
","I don't have a lot to say here, because I simply adored this movie. Wall-E is better than a thousand live action movies put together; it has been a long time since I haven't taken part so much, as a viewer, to what I was watching. Wall-E doesn't speak but his eyes and his 'EEEVAA-h' can express much more than an human actor, according to me.I was fighting to not cry in front of all the cinema; this movie hit me, because it touches a subject, the environment, that I often forget, and that I should consider more important.Of course, music and animation are perfect (Pixar guarantees); I particularly liked the corto before the movie's start, 'Presto', so try to get on time to the cinema!",10,1,3,21 October 2008
