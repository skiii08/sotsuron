Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fabulous Movie, best STAR WARS ever
","I would just like to say that before this movie came out, I hated STAR WARS. I had never seen any of the Trilogy and basically to me, it looked pretty stupid. My friends dragged me to the movie and I must say I LOVED IT!! I am now obsessed with The Phantom Menace.And I cannot wait for Episodes 2 & 3 to come out.Megan",10,5,7,14 June 1999
