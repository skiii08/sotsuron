The Blair Witch Project," Over-rated home video
","Billed by many critics as one of the scariest movies, The Blair Witch Project falls well short of expectations. Certain aspects of the film, especially the ending, had an eerieness to it. But the bulk of the film is simply not scary, unless you are really affected by stones, twigs, and other things that can happen to you while hiking and camping.The film is also plagued by the three main characters whining and arguing about directions during the daytime. If they had been more likeable characters, I probably would have cared more about what happened to them. The movie also falls into the stereotypical horror movie traps -- going into an abandoned house in the middle of the night to investigate strange sounds and splitting up.Yes, I know the story about how the movie was filmed, and it's great that they can do so much acting impromptu, but the end product does not work very well. Too many awkward and intentionally artsy camera angles create a nauseating movie experience.",4,1,4,22 July 1999
