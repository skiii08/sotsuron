Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is a home run
","Thought it was a very good movie. Sometimes when you get to part 3 things start to get stale. Not so here. A great villain and an even better story line. Can't wait to see what Marvel has in store for us next. My son and I have not missed one. We almost missed this one, didn't get to see the 3-d version, but we made it and the theater was still packed. So many ways you can go. Looking for the cameo was fun as always. I missed it but my boy did not. We checked and he was right. I agreed not to write a spoiler. I don't think saying Stan Lee made a cameo is a spoiler as he always does. Can't wait to see where Tony Stark goes from here.",8,0,1,18 May 2013
