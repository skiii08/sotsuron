Hereditary," NOT scary or intense, just boring, creepy & laughable
","2 hours of my life gone to waste! And I love Toni, I mean what a cast! but this movie is crap.",1,34,70,12 June 2018
Parasite," Not as good as people said
","After the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking 'was this scene necessary, What's the point?' right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me.",2,6,18,16 February 2020
