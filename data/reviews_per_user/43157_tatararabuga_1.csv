Lucky Number Slevin," i liked it because...
","i like it,because- 1. Josh Hartnett spends quite some time in a thin, low-hung towel.and when he does dress up,he looks good,even with a red nose. 2.it has a nice, fairly complicated plot. 3.it has hit men,romance, bit of comedy,and my favorite keyword on the IMDb list- man to man relationship.last but not the least,the ending wasn't bad for me. the only thing that bothered me was the weired tone of set-designing.clearly they did it with intention-maybe to make the story more believable.but it looked kind of tacky.all in all,not a bad movie for a light watching.p.s.a short Lucy Liu with a tall Josh Hartnett makes quite a cute looking pair.",7,0,1,25 November 2007
