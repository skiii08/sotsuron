The Expendables 2," More of a video game
","Thats right it was like a video game, all action heroes fighting and using punch lines, this is a feast for action lovers.The graphics are not that great. There is not much of a story just action.Sylvester Stallone and van dam-me fight scene is classy. Good one liners and amazing acting by the old fellas makes it delightful. It is disappointing to see Jet Li for a short time but that's fine. Chuck Norris makes a good entrance as Mr Booker, that's when humor starts or rather there is intended humor.IT IS DUMB HOW only the heroes get it right and not the villains. There were certain part, which were quite lame. Decent work by Simon west,nice attempt could have been better.Good one liners, action, watch it if you like the cast and yes it is better than the first.",7,0,0,24 November 2012
