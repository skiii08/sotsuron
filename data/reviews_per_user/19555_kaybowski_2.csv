The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," brutal...until the last half
","i gotta say, im on the fence here. i wanted to like the overall movie much more than i really did. the first half of the movie was soooo bad. awkward camera pauses on bella and edward...terrible acting...cheesy lines. like another reviewer, i face-palmed my forehead a few times in disbelief. i could barely get through it.the second half of the film was MUCH better - the last 30 minutes being pretty dang good! had my heart racing and i actually felt something while sitting there instead of pure agony. i don't understand why the twilight franchise cant seem to nail down one director and go with it. this film actually felt like it was filmed by two separate directors who didn't know how to work together at all. i was blown away. either way, i probably will end up seeing it again..wishing i could fast forward to the end of the movie. dang. its too bad they cant make one really good movie out of all 4 books. each one has serious issues. i don't know why i like these movies at all but its the girl in me i guess....in the end, go see it! you know you want to even if it is painful in parts!",5,8,18,18 November 2011
Whiplash," Best Movie in Years
","Honestly - I've been thinking that the age of great movies was over. I'd still venture that it is very likely still true. TV has really entered its golden age and I can hardly be bothered to actually go to a movie theater and pay full price to see a show any more. If I am going to watch a movie, I'll wait till is available for rent and then I won't feel so bad that I've wasted my money if it turns out to be bad.Guess what - Whiplash has restored my faith in the motion picture! This movie is beyond exemplary. I cannot understand how it didn't capture Best Picture at every single awards show this season. Miles Teller and JK Simmons are absolutely incredible in this film and create the most intense and electric movie experience I've encountered in a very long time. The very last scene had my heart pounding and I could hardly breathe. The performances, direction, editing...everything was stellar. I had to watch it twice, back to back, it was that good.Do yourself a favor - ignore the naysayers that are too preoccupied with the bullying. They won't ever get this film, so don't pay them any mind. Watch this and I assure you that you won't regret it.",10,3,7,28 February 2015
