The New World," Want to catch up on your sleep? See this movie!
","I hated many things about this movie.1. Its length. They could have fit it into a half-hour. It was 2.5 hours of John and Pocahontas prancing around being happy! 2. The voice overs. OHMYGOD!!! I HATED THE VOICEOVERS!!! THEY HAD NO POINT AND WERE REALLY ANNOYING!!! 3. The plot. Wait. There was a plot?!? 4. The commercials. They showed it as an action movie. ITS NOT!!! 5. The Romance. The stupidest romance I've ever seen. They don't kiss, they don't hold hands, they just run around smiling @ each other! All in all, a movie that is very easy to sleep through! Lets see...the acting sucked, the editing was terrible (cutting between different times, cutting from picture, to black, to picture), and I often got really confused about whether the natives hated the settlers or loved them, (considering in changed every couple of minutes). Do I need to say more?",1,2,9,23 February 2006
Citizen Kane," Beautifully directed, amazingly acted and spectacularly lighted! An amazing(ly boring) story!
","I do not care if it was beautifully directed, amazingly acted and spectacularly lighted! All this stuff is important in a film, but every film still needs a plot! OK, so Citizen Kane did have a plot but I'm talking about an interesting plot! I hate to say this, but I DID NOT CARE WHAT ROSEBUD WAS!!! I was bored from basically the first 30 seconds! SPOILER: And at the end: Oh wow. It's his sled. Don't tell me I don't get it, because I do. He's saying that the only time he was happy was when he was a kid. But...I just...don't care.I do admit this movie was not terrible. It had some beautiful parts that showed Orson Wells can use a camera, but you still need to have an interesting plot to have a good movie. I'm not saying you need action to have a good movie, but you do need stuff to happen! The entire movie was just them going to random people asking them what rosebud meant.**1/2",6,0,2,25 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Slow to start, then gets better. A bit confusing.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does not really follow the first story that much. It has the same characters, but is not really a continuation. You could watch it without watching the first one.In starts with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly)having their wedding interrupted by the small setback of them getting arrested. The charges: helping Jack Sparrow get away. They are sentenced to death. But the man in charge offers Will one chance. If he can get Jack Sparrow's compass for him, in exchange for a navy pardon, they can both go free.Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is being haunted by a slave of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), who we later learn is Will's father.Through a series of events, (which I won't go into too much detail about) a four-way war starts for the possession of Davy Jones's chest. Of course every chest has it's key, and they also need that.The plot is a bit confusing, with a lot of twists and turns. Very funny at a lot of parts, and well directed. All the acting was good, and the special effects were really good, from ships falling apart, to the tentacles of a kraken grabbing a ship.It started out kind of slow, and I was going to give it a 7, but then it got much better. It's hard to say which is better, the first or the second, because they both had they're good parts. It ends with a huge cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more: Jack Sparrow dies, and they need to bring him back, with the help of none other then: Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) the evil ship's captain from the first movie, who supposedly died. I can't wait for the sequel! Go see this movie!",8,0,1,8 July 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," Starts out Slow, Then becomes Fast. An amazing story, but needs some work.
","The World's Fastest Indian started out slow. I didn't feel it really got interesting until he actually to the racing area. A number of questions rose up. One of my key ones was 'Why is everybody being so nice to him?' As much as I hate to say it, people arn't that nice. In America, people don't go to that much trouble for someone else. I did not like very much of the acting, and I thought the plot moved slowly. Very slowly. Much of it was not important at all and very boring. Now for the good stuff. I loved the racing scene. My heart was pounding as he started going faster and faster. Even though I knew he was going to make it I still wondered how he could possibly do it. I liked the acting of the racer, playing such a dedicated man. That was probably my favorite part. I also liked the part where he's being sold the flower and she steals his $10. All in all, it an amazing story, but needs some work.",6,1,9,24 February 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Not as bad as they say...
","I liked it. The ending dragged, and the scene at the end in the garden was kind of forced, but it was good. They changed the ending, but I liked it better. Sir Ian McKellan, Tom Hanks, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, and Alfred Molina were all good actors. (Everybody else did not act well, but thats all right. My main complaint is that the ending didn't end. They should have taken out the whole questioning religion scene in the garden at the end, which was probably put in so people didn't get mad. But that's my only big complaint. Many people have been saying that it is not as good as the book, but it helped me understand the story more.",7,0,1,28 May 2006
Rosemary's Baby," What a creepy movie!
","I don't care how 'scary' and 'exiting' and 'heart-pounding' movies are today: This is by far the scariest! Rosemary's baby is about a couple that buys a house with a mysterious past. After becoming pregnant, Rosemary (Mia Farrow) begins to suspect that everybody in the building, including her husband (John Cassavetes), is a Satan-worshiping, anti-Christian witch. Is she imagining it, or is it real? And if it is, will she be able to save her baby? The movie does start out slow, and doesn't really pick up until she becomes pregnant. Also, some of it is boring, and not all is very scary. But the parts that are: *shiver*! Roman Polanski is a good director of horror. I did not think much of the ending was good, but my favorite line is when Minnie Castavet(Ruth Gordon) remarks: 'He chose you, honey! From all the women in the world to be the mother of his only living son!' Obviously playing on the Jesus story, Minnie says this in her strong, New York accent, making the situation almost comical.All in all, a very creepy movie!",8,1,1,17 June 2006
Munich," Wow!!!
","The Godfather used to be my favorite film. Well, that is no longer true, now that I have seen Munich, Steven Spielberg's newest film.In 1972, 11 Israeli athletes about to compete in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany were taken hostage. When Israel tried to retaliate, all 11 were killed. This is the true story of what happened next. 5 men were given one order; to kill all 11 people who were involved in the Munich massacre.Going back to The Godfather, Munich was lighted very much the same. Was it an accident or was Spielberg trying to say that the people doing the executions were just as bad as the mafia? Anyway, the direction was beautiful and some parts made my heart pound, it was so intense.This was the only movie that has ever made me want to cry. It is just so powerful, especially because it is so true. It creates many moral questions that you and the characters will have to ask yourself. Is is right to follow violence with violence. Is what Avner (Eric Bana) and his crew are doing morally right. Well, you'll have to figure it out yourself. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!Final Verdict: 5/5 stars",9,8,14,26 February 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Saw the premiere: A moving masterpiece
","I saw the premiere for this movie the day before it came out, and I have to say, I was happy I did.In The Pursuit of Happiness {sic}, Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a husband and father failing at bringing in enough money. The movie chronicles his rise from failure on the poverty line, to--simply through grit and determination--becoming the owner of a large multi-million dollar corporation.Before this movie, I had never seen Will Smith in anything but a comedy. Apparently, he can do other things. The acting was the best part of the movie. Also, Jaden Smith is a rising young star. We will be seeing him in the future.The directing was also pretty good as well. For a rather beginning filmmaker, Muccino managed to fit the theme well, contrasting the rich life and the poor life of LA.So, it got boring in parts, and the ending tried to wrap everything up too quickly, but it was a good, sometimes funny, mostly heartbreaking movie. A great one to watch!",7,8,15,14 December 2006
Cinderella Man," A Heartpounding Movie with only a few drags.
","Cinderella Man opens with the main character, Jim Braddock (Russel Crowe) trouncing somebody in a boxing match. After the fight, he is mobbed by supporters and makes a lot of money from it. The scene ends with his manager Joe Gould, (Paul Giammati) saying hes gonna go far.Cut to three years later, at the start of the great depression. Braddock is not going far. He has lost fight after fight, and the boxing commission has revoked his license. The rest of the movie is his climb back to the top and becomes the champion.In my opinion, a really good movie makes your heart pound. This movie is one of the few that I have seen that does it repeatedly. The final fight with Max Baer, (Craig Bierko) is one of the most intense scenes in a movie I have ever seen. My heart took 10 minutes to calm down after it. Also, the acting was very good especially Russel Crowe. The cinematography and directing were also very good.Now, for the bad: The only thing I have to say is that the plot often dragged. Some of the scenes before he gets good at boxing were the sole reason that I did not rate this movie a 10. Now, like all 13 year old boys, I like action in movies. However, this does not mean that I need it constantly, like some do. But I think that many of the non-boxing scenes could have been omitted or shortened. But I can not think of anything else that was bad.What a good movie!",8,1,1,8 May 2006
