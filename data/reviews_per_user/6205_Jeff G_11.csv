The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant! Everything the remake of 'The Haunting' isn't!
","This is a film that demands attention.  It is a brilliant new approach to a tired genre that has issued forth from its withered loins such tiresome instances of schlock as the remake of 'The Haunting' (the 1963 original was *amazing*, but the 1999 version was a joke) and 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'.This film isn't perfect, and I only gave it an eight, but if I were to rate it on sheer inventiveness and outright chutzpah, I would give it a *twelve* on a scale from one to ten.  While the movie doesn't exactly deliver on all the promises it makes, it delivers on quite a good number of them, yielding a raw, new, harrowing film ... so different from our usual movie-going experiences that it practically starts a whole new genre!If I had to compare it to other films (and this is hard) I'd have to say that it most resembles 'The Evil Dead' in its inventiveness and brutal paranoia, and 'Seven' in its gritty 'this is real life' feel.Also worth mentioning is the clever 'is it real' mythology that the marketing guys have built around this movie.  Go to http://www.blairwitch.com to see 'actual interviews' with family members and a chronology of the Blair Witch.  Astonishing!I whole-heartedly recommend this film, flaws and all.  Hell, I wish I had made it myself!  :)",8,1,1,31 July 1999
Antz," But when does it get *good*?
","Yeah, sure it's clever.  The animation is terrific.  But it's so formulaic and dry, you can go to the restroom, buy some popcorn, chat up the lady at the concessions stand, and then come back *and you haven't MISSED anything*.I'll be the first to admit that this movie has the moments, and the animation is really breathtaking at times, but when are today's film-makers going to remember that it's PLOT, DIRECTING, and ACTING (or in this case voice-acting) that make a movie and not special effects?The animation in this movie was computer-generated.  It seemed like the screenplay was too.",4,9,20,5 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Galatic Ishtar (but not as entertaining)
","This movie was inexcusably wooden.  With the caliber of talent and money that went into this film, it should have been superlative.  Instead, it was diminutive.It's been said that if you had an infinite number of monkeys working infinitely long on an infinite number of typewriters, eventually one of them would type out the works of William Shakespeare.The special effects were nice, but frankly, so what?  Special effects serve only to further the plot, and if the correct plot to effects ratio were maintained, the only special effects you would have needed would be plastic model spacecrafts suspendeded from fishing wire.Yes, it's that good.",3,0,1,28 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Not bad, but woefully overrated.
","This is 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead' for people who don't know Shakespeare.  This is not Stoppard in peak form, but rather Stoppard needing to make a quick buck.  It's clever, true, and fun to watch, but ultimately predictable and ponderous, and nowhere near as good as 'A Simple Plan' or 'Life is Beautiful', two films that *definitely* deserved the Best Picture more than this film.Paltrow's a talented actress, but her Academy Award for this particular film is a joke.  Sheeze, show a little skin and look constipated (apparently, this is what passes for a look of emotional anguish in this film), and your career is guaranteed.  Her performance in Seven was a thousand times better, and as was as underrated as her performance in 'Shakespeare in Love' was OVERrated.Still, worth a watching.  It's not bad -- quite witty in places -- and Dench absolutely steals the show.But still, do yourself a favor.  See 'A Simple Plan' or 'Life is Beautiful' first.  Heck, for that matter, see 'The Matrix' before you see this.",6,1,2,19 April 1999
Pitch Black," 'Aliens', but with an indy flavor
","Very cleverly created, 'Pitch Black' combines the general premise of 'Aliens' (shipwrecked on a hostile planet at the mercy of hordes of ravenous monsters) but with the willingness to break the rules and stereotypes found in mainstream movies.The film is artfully done, though sometimes the camera work can get muddled. (I suspect that this is partly deliberate to obscure flaws in the special effects or fight choreography.)  The coloration is brilliant (often literally), and the score adequate.  The sound effects leave something to be desired.  (Every time I heard the creatures, I felt that the heroes were due to have a school of whales decent upon them ...)Still, this had the raw, quirky edge to it found in some of the lesser-known works of Australia and New Zealand, like 'The Quiet Earth' and 'The Last Wave'.  It's quite scary for most of the film, and while it's not flawless, it deserves quite a lot of credit for what it's accomplished.Highly recommended!",8,0,0,20 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Great, but doesn't live up to Spielberg's potential
","Had anybody else made this movie, I would call it a flawless achievement.  But Spielberg is capable of better.  It's a great movie, but he could have made it even greater if he had just pushed himself a little harder.",9,0,0,14 August 1998
Pi," Smart ... but not all THAT smart.
","I do admit it's a more intelligent film than the usual schlock, but from the advertising you're led to believe that this is a brilliant, insightful combination of religion, magic, and mathematics.  However, the connection is never really made, only hinted at, and the film is rather like a very yummy appetizer ... without a main course.",6,1,2,25 August 2000
There's Something About Mary," Simply unpleasant to watch
","I know I'm a freak.  Everybody else loved this movie, but I detested it.I simply found it unpleasant to watch.  I'm not opposed to physical comedy -- I thought 'The Naked Gun' was hysterical.  I'm not even opposed to comedy in bad taste -- I thought 'Eating Raul' was terrific.No, this film just had few redeeming characteristics.All the characters in this film, with the exception of Mary herself, are hateful, deceitful, pathetic monsters.  I don't care about them other than mildly hoping they'll get what they want so that at least the movie will END.  But no, sixteen hours later, they're still flailing about.  At least it *felt* like sixteen hours.  It might have been more.This is just an unpleasant film.  It's gross and aesthetically vile.  How long can one person sit and watch enormous zits and sperm in a woman's hair and fishhooks getting caught in a man's mouth?  Is this what passes for humor these days?Apparently so, because everybody but me thought it was hysterical.I have two ways of rating a film.  One is 'the watch-meter', which is simply this:  how many times did I look at my watch during the movie?  In this case, I lost count.The other is a simple yes or no question:  given the choice between sitting in this theater and watching this movie for two hours, or sitting in this theater and staring at a blank movie screen for two hours, which would I choose?In this case, 'Something About Mary' won out ... but *just barely*.  I cautiously recommend seeing this movie over staring at a blank screen for two hours.  Ask me tomorrow, and I might not give the same recommendation.In summary: yuck.",2,7,14,5 October 1998
The Green Mile," Not bad, but a little too desperate to please
","The Green Mile was fortunate to have such an outstanding cast, because the material wasn't top grade.  It wasn't bad, mind you, but it was the typical wow, gee whiz, aren't we going to be a movie that will win Best Picture schmaltz that all the good directors occasionally release in a moment of Oscar avarice and weakness.The story was definitely engaging, but it was also trite and overly convenient.  Events seemed forced so as to allow for future events.  At times it felt like effect was driving cause and not the other way around.Still, the cast is without exception, *phenomenal*.  They take a mediocre script and even at times directing, and really turn it up a notch.The result: an above average film that's slightly pretentious, but does ultimately deliver much of what it promises.  Definitely worth the trip! :)",7,0,0,27 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Deft and creepy, exceedingly well-acted and directed
","What a renaissance we're having.  In the wake of such blockbuster duds as 'The Phantom Menace' and the oh-so-dreadful remake of 'The Haunting' we find such soft-but-powerful films coming our way as 'A Simple Plan', 'The Blair Witch Project', and 'Life is Beautiful'.  It's encouraging, because it tells us that in the midst of this banal 'bigger is better' mentality, there are still some studios, some writers, so actors, and some directors who know better.This is a result of such a collaboration.  Its power resides not in spectral special effects and big explosions in the middle of city streets (sending cars flying into the air, no less), but instead on the requisite basics so often neglected these days:  a solid script, talented actors, a gripping score, and deft directing.  This film has all of these.I could write endlessly on this film, but I can sum it up as follows:  this is an intelligent, moving, exciting, and chilling film.Or to put it another way:  this is not The Phantom Menace.Highly recommended.",10,0,0,8 August 1999
The Matrix," Very ingenious, but not without flaws
","Even with all the hype about this film, it actually managed to live up to most of its promise.  This is a very fast-paced, inventive, and visually stunning film.  Every shot is breathtaking and aesthetically brilliant.  The costumes, makeup, sets, and casting is top-notch.There are flaws, however.  The movie seems to be constantly just falling short of its promises.  Every sequence is amazing, yet you're left with the feeling that perhaps it could have been even better still.  The action has been touted as even better than John Woo, yet I found the sequences somewhat derivative of the great Hong Kong director.Finally, the ending was a cop out.  It was *almost* satisfying, but the film decided to get cute.  It's like watching an amazing Olympic race in which one runner is so fast that he quickly outdistances all the other runners ... and then, mere inches from the finish line he shows his contempt by not crossing it.  'I won this race,' he says arrogantly, 'and everybody knows it, so why bother crossing the finish line?'Well, that's what this movie was like.  It didn't have to bring everything to a nice tidy ending, true, but it could have done so so easily that it's obnoxious and pretentious that it didn't.However, even with these flaws, this is a major work.  It's inventive and ingenious and a work of art.  Even where it rips off old ideas (such as by Phillip K. Dick and William Gibson), it at least has the integrity to come up with its own variations.",9,0,0,2 April 1999
