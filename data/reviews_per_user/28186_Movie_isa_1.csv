Hereditary," Kinda disappointing
","I didn't have a chance to catch this in theater and I've been putting it off since because I wanted to give it my full attention. I've heard so many positive reviews and I thought it looked great from the first trailer but all I got was disappointment.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I definitely don't feel like I wasted those 2+ hours. The acting was great, the story was engaging enough and it definitely tugged on my heartstrings at moments but it was so predictable.
First act was a good build-up. It got me engaged and interested. Second act was the best part of the entire movie and it made me think maybe this could become my new favorite movie. I also got the feeling that this might be that kinda horror that just sticks with me and gets me paranoid for a week afterwards(which I love) but then as the second act moved to a close and the third came in, I got bored. It became predictable. Some of the effects were great but it didn't hit the way it should've because I'd already called it. I found myself counting down to the 'jump scares' (that weren't jump scares in the classic sense so kudos for that but still just as predictable) and just waiting for the end, which was very anticlimactic.
It's a solid movie but it definitely won't stick with me in any way, shape or form and that's a shame. A real shame.",6,1,1,2 November 2019
