The Blair Witch Project," If you go down to the woods today...........................
","This is one scary movie. It's not a monster or a slasher picture but more of a psychological scare the pants off of you type of horror.Co-directors Myrick and Sanchez have created terror through everone's fear of the unknown. It has the look and feel of an amateur documentary film and having unknown actors play all of the parts only increases the feeling of authenticity. You are so drawn into the main characters situation that you will believe that this is an actual event that took place.The film is masterfully crafted. In the early part the main characters are joking around and having fun as they interview the town folk about the legendary Blair witch. Then as they go into the woods, deeper and deeper, they begin to hear things go bump in the night, become lost and slowly begin to unravel. The last few scenes of the picture are as frightening and unpredictable as any I have seen.Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, playing themselves, are convincing as the three amateur film students. The fact that they seem to be the characters they are playing and are largely unknown actors only heightens the horror.The jerky motion of the camera gives an authentic feel to an amateur documentary and reportedly left many viewers, including this one, with a feeling of nausea at the film's end.The Blair Witch Project clearly demonstrates that the modestly budgeted independent film is alive and well. We'll now probably have to endure many big studio clones of this one that are sure to pop up in the next year.Don't miss this one, it's an original and a one of a kind.",Null,0,1,31 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century?
","This latest episode of the Star Wars saga is a special effects feast. It seems that George Lucas has turned his Industrial Light & Magic division loose. What they came up with are digital effects, the like of which we have not seen before. No need to pay supporting players or extras here, they'll just create them digitally.The special effects, to be sure, are dazzling but did they go overboard? There are so many digitally created characters that the human cast is almost lost. Take the Jar-Jar Binks character as an example of the overkill. Firstly he comes off as a cartoon-like character, as sort of cross between Daffy Duck and a duck-billed platypus, and is totally unecessary. He looks like Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century.R2D2 and C3PO could have just as easily handled the comic relief chores as they had in the previous films. For some reason, Lucas chose to keep them in the background. We could have done without the giant horsefly character, whose name escapes me, as well. It was nice to see old friends Yoda and Jabba the Hut again but they merely put in cameo appearances. The droid army looks like an army of mechanical ants.The Pod Race sequence seems to pay homage to the chariot race sequence in Ben-Hur. There are many similarities.Of the human actors, and there are few, Liam Neeson stands out as the Jedi Master. It's hard to imagine Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan growing into Alec Guinness. In an effort to appeal to the younger crowd, Lucas has cast Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. It's a pity that actors of the calibre of Terence Stamp and Samuel L. Jackson were given so little to do.George Lucas directs this episode and it reminds one of the first Stars Wars in both its settings and characterizations. It is hoped that he will return to the more simplistic and less creature oriented themes of the earlier films, when he makes the next episode.As a post script, it has always interested me that both Lucas and Steven Spielberg have often looked to the old B&W serials of the 30s and 40s for inspiration. Why don't one or both of them make a new serial and see how it flies (no pun intended).",7,0,0,14 April 2000
Casablanca," You must remember this...
","A great cinematic masterpiece, Casablanca is full of intrigue, romance and unforgettable characters.Bogey's Rick is a mysterious man with a past. One is kept guessing as to what his next move might be. Undoubtedly one of his greatest performances.Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa was never lovelier and Paul Henried as the freedom Fighter, Victor Lazlo is dashing and a little bit over-understanding where his wife is concerned.Claude Rains as Renaud almost steals the picture. Renault and Rick play a cat and mouse game with each other throughout the picture.Conrad Veidt is suitably evil as Major Strasser, the German commandant. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are given little to do in lesser roles. One wishes that their parts could have been larger. And not to forget Dooley Wilson as Sam who sings the now famous song 'As Time Goes By'.Expertly directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca remains one of the greatest films of all time and for those seeing it for the first time, it's the start of a beautiful friendship.",10,0,0,13 September 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A good movie...not a great movie
","I was a little disappointed when I finally got to see this movie. As Best Picture of 1998, I expected better. Make no mistake, Shakespeare in Love is a good movie, but not as good as people would have you believe.When you strip away the Elizabethan costumes and sets (which are excellent, by the way), all you have left is a typical Hollywood 'roll in the hay' romance. Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actress) and Judi Dench (Best Supporting Actress) deservedly won Oscars for their performances. I found Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare to be over the top and totally miscast.Perhaps I am not a romantic, but I am still at a loss as to how this picture won the best picture Oscar over much better films, in my opinion, such as 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Affliction'",7,1,2,27 March 2000
The Mummy," Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy?
","I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting to see a remake of the 1932 (Karloff) and 1959 (Christopher Lee) versions, but instead got Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy. Director Sommers doesn't seem to know if he is making a horror, adventure or comedy film.The special effects to be sure, are state of the art, however, the producers seem to have been going for quantity rather than quality in effects. The mummy character is evil to be sure, but is way over the top. He just didn't scare me. The other 'liberated' mummys are too plentiful and cartoon-like to be believable. The plague of insects looks ridiculous and obviously computer-generated.The hero, heroine and other assorted players don't seem to take the situation too seriously. With both guns a-blazing and a devil-may-care attitude, they look like refugees from the old Saturday matinee serials. And what was the point of the heroine knocking over library bookshelves in the context of the story. And the hero's escape from the gallows? The list goes on and on.Harrison Ford did the Indiana Jones thing much better. Karloff did the mummy character better in black & white and in 72 minutes in 1932. The Lee 1959 version was also superior and scarier.I want my mummy back.",5,0,0,2 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," One of the Greatest War Movies of All Time
","Together with 'Schindler's List (1993) and 'Platoon' (1986), 'Saving Private Ryan' ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like 'Platoon' it gives the viewer an 'in the trenches' experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom.",10,8,13,20 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," Hilarious !
","Overall, I found this film to be simply hilarious. It's a nineties version (the 'gross out' scene notwithstanding) of the old screwball comedies of bygone years.Don't miss the end credits.A couple of criticisms:It is a bit of a stretch to imagine the Cameron Diaz character as a well to do orthopedic surgeon. What is she - all of 22?I thought the scenes where laughs were gotten at the expense of the Warren Jensen (W. Earl Brown) character, while on crutches, were in poor taste. This was before we knew the real truth about the character.",8,0,0,17 April 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A Cinematic Masterpiece in any Language!
","Life is Beautiful is really two movies in one. The first half, which takes place in pre-WWII Italy, involves the comical wooing and winning by Guido (Roberto Benigni) of his wife Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The second half takes place during WWII (about 5 years later) during the persecution of the Jews by the Germans.In pre-war Italy life is beautiful as Guido becomes a waiter in his uncle's hotel and keeps running into (literally) a charming school teacher named Dora. He finally wins their heart and they marry. Benigni could have made a charming movie ending it here. But cut to a few years later, it is now WWII and they have a 5 year old son. Guido and his family, being Jewish, are soon rounded up by the Germans and sent to a concentration camp. There, the picture takes on a more serious tone as Guido tries to protect his son, with humour and imagination, from the horrors of the camp.Writer, director, actor Benigni has created a cinematic masterpiece - in any language. He is able to perfectly blend humour, pathos and tragedy in telling his story. His characters are believable and synpathetic. It was also nice to see Horst Buchholtz (as a German doctor) again after so many years.This movie, in my humble opinion, should have been given the Best Picture Oscar over the inferior Shakespeare in Love. It's so good that if you watch it in Italian with sub-titles, you won't even notice the sub-titles, you'll become so engrossed with the story. A bona fide tear jerker.",10,1,2,11 May 2000
Stalingrad," This movie ranks with the greatest war movies of all time.
","This film is one of the best kept secrets in my part of the world. I recently acquired a video copy of the German sub-titled version and was just simply blown away. It is one of the most realistically presented World War II movies that one could hope to see. It conveys the real horrors of the Stalingrad campaign from the German soldiers point of view. Not being personally familiar with the actors in the film made it for me, all the more interesting. There are no heroes in this film, only ordinary people placed in a hopeless situation. It was so engrossing, that I forgot that I was watching a movie with sub-titles. I highly recommend it.",10,2,3,6 March 1999
The Matrix," Virtual reality to the extreme...
","The Matrix is virtual reality taken to the extreme. It was one of the most successful movies of 1999 and one can see why. Its full of state of the art special effects, expertly choreographed fights and dashing heroes, a beautiful heroine and evil villains.I had a little trouble with the story, however. We are supposed to believe that the world as we know it is a computerized matrix and that nothing is real. Laurence Fishburne and his gang of 'rebels' are supposed to be fighting the evil 'agents' through some form of virtual reality transfers from their 'ship' back and forth to the 'real world'. And we are supposed to accept Keannu Reeves,the hero, as the 'second coming'? Give me a break.Reeves is OK as the super hero and Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the leader of the rebel forces. I also liked Carrie-Anne Moss as the heroine and wish more had developed between her and the Reeves character.I know that I'm in a minority, but special effects aside, I just thought that The Matrix was a little to far-fetched to be believable.",Null,0,0,13 November 1999
The Thin Red Line," Gritty and Realistic WWII Drama
","The Thin Red Line is a gritty and realistic WWII drama that is among the best WWII movies ever made. It's about a battle for an unknown hill protecting a Japanese airfield on a remote Pacific island.Director Terrence Malick divides his film into three parts. The first deals with the hours preceding the battle and shows how the individuals are dealing with the rising tension. The second, the battle itself, contains some of the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed. The final part deals with the aftermath of the battle and its effects on the survivors.Nick Nolte, in one of his best performances, heads a large cast as the commanding officer of the company of infantry who sends wave after wave of soldiers into a seemingly suicidal battle. Elias Koteas also stands out as the beleaguered captain forced to carry out Nolte's orders. 'After 15 years, it's my first war' Nolte tells him.Sean Penn, billed over the title, does not dominate the film as he usually does, but instead effectively underplays his role as one of the platoon sergeants. Several recognizable stars appear in featured roles and cameos. Among them, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, John Savage, George Clooney and John Travolta.Although almost three hours in length, believe me you will not notice the time. Not to be missed.",8,0,0,13 November 1999
