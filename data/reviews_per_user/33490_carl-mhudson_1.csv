The Expendables 2," Action Nostalgia....
","Well...if your anywhere near my age(40) and grew up loving the action movies of the 80s, your in for a real treat with some pure unadulterated nostalgic fun. When you see Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stallone line up and fire machine guns together against a common enemy...you know you have reached the Mecca of all Action Movies and its time to smile profusely! Who cares about the plot the lack of character development(we all know them, so that would be a waste of time) - I know I never did in the 80s. There is plenty of one liners and humour and all of them making a point of not taking them selves to seriously. Each character has there moment of displaying there kind of fighting style(which can be more than said for the Avengers). All in all, better than the first one and looking forward to the next instalment(hopefully including Clint Eastwood, the mother of all action heros).",9,3,5,27 September 2012
