50 First Dates," never lose it!brilliant and fantastic loving story performed by Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore
","I didn't touch on the Peter Segal's film before,neither is his hot movie fan,I watched the film by accident.We generally accepted that it's quite difficult to make a romance and love film successfully.Comparably,the subject and content of 50 first dates is a little bit novel than the others,personally speaking.Anyway,though it may not actually happen on ourselves and reality,neither being the guy,Henry Roth(Adam Sandler),I just admire Henry's character towards the love.You may get a wee confused on the title 50 first dates,and so do I.Hints Given,just imagine how you feel when your lover wakes up next morning and even can't recognize who you are.Yes,that's gonna be horrible or scared?What's your feeling?Definitely,a little bit puzzled,this is about a girl,Lucy(Drew Barrymore),after she suffered a car accident,something wrong happen on the unlucky girl,her memory could only last for a day.Since that,every day is like the day before the accident,which is also his father's birthday.She doing the same thing once a day,get the identical breakfast,always driving her car through the regular lines,painting the room,cooking the cake,celebrating her father's birthday.Until Henry met her,attracted by her in an impulse at the first sight.But he was shocked when Lucy said 'who are you' next day just the day before their acquaintance,from this moment,he decides on doing all he could to help Lucy recover and even want get married with her.He got ideas to make Lucy love him everyday,which touching Lucy as well as Lucy's father and his son.I'm stunned to see how stubborn Henry's emotion on Lucy.Their skillful and amazing performance is the point when you watch it.The director tend to show us how meaningful,grand loving story between them.Henry possibly give his career up to care Lucy.Will it really happen in the real life?Hard to imagine.We are expecting the common feelings a romantic love story may happen on ourselves.The story ended with an expecting episode they got married and sailed with their boat around world,Lucy eventually remember to view the recording each morning which could bring her memory.Love is an eternal topic throughout the world,you may get touched after seeing the film,which provides a beautiful subject,how you can miss it!By the way,the songs in this film are also brilliant,totally matched the film,wonderful combination!!----personal ratio(8/10)",8,0,0,11 January 2005
There's Something About Mary," A Funny love story
","Personally speaking,the movie is purely for entertainment after supper,added with a lot of funny episodes as well as some interesting stuffs.Howerver,perhaps all the gut is around a beautiful woman Mary(Cameron Diaz),who is pursued simultaneously by several guys,really freak you out in the meanwhile,especially Ted Stroehmann(Ben Stiller), the final winner of this loving competition,once was Mary's high school classmate,but since the funny accident happened before the graduation party,they lost contact for dozens of years,and then,following some interesting story happened on Mary.By and large,the subject appears to catch and suit the audience's appetite.A funny love story.rating(6/10)",6,0,1,21 January 2005

Night Shyamalan tries to tell us?Are they hostile?Maybe our planet will be attacked some day.People are worry about this.On the contrary,M. Night Shyamalan show us the other side.The Extraterrestrial eventually save the boy's life,that's amazing.Obviously,M. Night Shyamalan tempts to change the people's mind on the extraterrestrial,that's the point.There are some other movies like X-Files or Taken touching on the extraterrestrial.All those movies are trying to unveil the mystery,the movies are very fantastic and brilliant.I really like to see,but the topic remains controversial.Do those unknown life exist?Hostility or Amity? That's what we gonna explore!",7,0,1,23 December 2004
Live Free or Die Hard," Woo...Lets check it out this time!!
","3rd.Dec,I just finished Die Hard 4.0,Len Wiseman gives us an exceptional movie this time,especially the movie effect throughout the whole period.Not like the subject of the former ones,this time it is about a network high-tech anti-terrorist action.John McClane(Willis) remains a tough hero till the end.The move particularly attracts me a lot is the blockbusters,really professional and fabulous,the dialogue between the truck and a battle plane hits me impressively,it's not hard to image the cost expense,but it worth,at least there's a longtime we have been expecting,a big film.Die hard 5.0 I believe is not far from us...",7,0,3,2 December 2007
The Sixth Sense," One of the greatest masterpiece on Top 250,AggressivelyEncouraged
","The only regret for me is that the movie recently be appreciated,a little be later than I expected, this movie is no doubt one of the greatest masterpiece of M. Night Shyamalan.If somebody tells you that the sixth sense is a horror movie,he is definitely wrong about the subject the director want to show us.I like the tactic of this one a wee same with the Alejandro Amen√°bar's The Others or Opern Your Eyes which is also my favourite. M. Night Shyamalan is so special and focusing on every little piece and you are supposed to connect it step by step throughout the movie to find the director's destination.Don't get confused,when you grab the thought of the little boy Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment),you are getting closer to the core of the movie.Additonally,the twist end is classic and be the moment you will find why this movie has been rolled into the Top 250,it's generally accepted by most our audience friends.The doctor(Willis) eventually waked up and knows where he belongs to and it's also time for leaving resulting from the inter-belief of Cole,who is always haunted by the ghost in his world.Cole is the only hope for these ghosts to appease themselves, M. Night Shyamalan reveals the two aspect of human character simultaneously,the ugliness and the beauty with the help of the successful figure of Cole.The clues in the movie are invaluable,with which you may totally understand the whole subject of this movie,the mind of M. Night Shyamalan whose conception is of a little bit audacity and breakthrough.It may not be the best film in dozens of years,however,it does hit a lot of people both mentally and physically,encourage people's normal life!! RATING(9/10)",9,0,1,30 January 2005
