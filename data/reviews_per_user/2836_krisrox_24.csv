Black Swan," 'Scream' if you're feeling pretentious
","Like 'Requiem for a Dream', also by Darren Aronofsky, 'Black Swan' is superficial entertainment masquerading as profound psychological analysis. It's stylish, it has the kind of 'scary' effects that belong in a teen slasher movie, it is often gross, and it doesn't go anywhere. Which would be okay, if this were an actual teen slasher movie. But it isn't. The Black Swan is humorless and pretentious, and to make matters worse, it's intellectually dishonest. Only a very cynical director would use symptoms of auto-mutilation, anorexia and schizophrenia haphazardly as 'devices' to freak out an audience. (Not to mention the mandatory lesbian sex scene!) Portman, an actress I've always considered to be somewhat of a quality assurance, delivers her worst role here, looking flat and freaked out for 100 minutes. High-stakes ballet is a stressful environment, but every great performer loses that stress on stage. Not the Portman character. She gets the main role without any hint she can handle it. Or was it all supposed to be one big hallucination? I guess I should draw my own conclusions: I'm not a fan of Aronofsky. I predict future generations will forget the hype and will consider this movie one of the weaker 'landmark' movies of the '10s.",4,10,16,16 April 2011
Scarface," It's lonely at the top
","'Scarface' has aged really well. It was deemed trashy cult twenty years ago; now, it is undoubtedly one of the landmarks of the 80s, a monster tale about outsider ambition vs. loser fatalism that handsomely beats 'Wall Street' at its own game.Stylish and super-charged throughout, what takes 'Scarface' to the next level is the uncanny way the movie embodies its message. In true DePalma-style the direction is way too lavish; Moroder's soundtrack borderline kitschy; Pacino's Montana so inhumanly goal-oriented we know he's really headed nowhere; and Stone's otherwise pointed script full of drawn-out scenes about seemingly nothing, effectively underlining the emptiness of his characters. (A technique that wasn't lost on Tarantino.)Yet this is not, as some have stated, a vulgar flick about vulgarity. There's a deeper layer here... Montana never smiles; he enjoys neither his violence nor his opulence; and even after his loved ones die, he doesn't gain insight. The inevitable grand finale still exceeds expectations, with DePalma & Pacino burning Rome to the ground with the grandiosity Montana deserves.Epic in every aspect, 'Scarface' is a must-see if only because you'll feel strongly about it.",9,0,1,29 November 2008
The Secret in Their Eyes," Masterclass
","Wow, what a director. Instead of upping the pace, he lets scenes breathe and develop, leading to unexpected details that make the characters so much more lovable. He lets the leads shine, he doesn't overdose on the violin quartets, his camera angles genuinely surprise, he manages to run a tight art direction without making it a 'design movie'. Usually, a great script makes or breaks a movie for me. This script was good, but not brilliant. Campanella just goes to work. The past 20 years, filmmakers have slowly increased the pace and editing. Pace excites us and has the additional advantage of hiding weak parts in the script by bombarding the audience with sheer visceral impact. Now, I always prefer a superficially exciting movie over a dreadful, semi-profound sleeper. But nothing is better than this: a movie that finds its own pace and just pulls the audience along, with their full consent.",9,2,4,18 September 2010
Ocean's Twelve," Supremely annoying
","This movie annoyed me to no end. A middling script is one thing, a middling script with a fancy director and 10 A-List actors is truly something else.At times, I felt like I was watching a private hobby project, an inside joke movie, a pet farce Soderbergh put together as a gift for a friend getting married. I'm pretty sure none of the stars REALLY cared - after all, none of them had to carry the movie! It was like an NBA All-Star game without anything on the line. They probably did enjoy their European vacation, their relaxing getaway from the responsibilities of having to be The Man. (Or The Woman, in the case of Julia R.)And Soderbergh... He is at the point in his career where he can direct in his sleep, and it shows. I used to think of him as a genius, now I think of him as a caricature of himself. Dud.",2,1,3,12 November 2011
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick made several great movies; FMJ isn't among them
","Bringing an intellectual's approach to the ultimate visceral subject - the Vietnam War - Kubrick fails to imbue Full Metal Jacket with authenticity. Belying its ambition, parts of the movie feel cheap and TV-like: the story is very episodic, the no-name actors try valiantly but lack pizazz, and the sets are so obviously not in Asia it's a bit painful to see. (In fact, the entire movie was shot in the UK, making use of (among other things) fake palm trees neatly planted in every scene. It's a bit amateurish, especially compared to the Vietnam masterpieces of Coppola and Stone.)You should still see it - it's Kubrick, for heaven's sake, and he does deliver compelling cinema in the final 30 minutes.",6,0,1,27 December 2014
Incendies," Nasty surprises
","'Incendies' is a movie I really wanted to like. It's refreshing on several levels, featuring pleasantly strange locales (Quebec and Lebanon). It has a good sense of pace, and covers hitherto unseen moments in modern history with a good eye for detail.Still, I was tempted to give this movie the lowest score possible. Primarily for butchering its own story towards the end, going for the type of plot that only amateur screenwriters fall for: exciting on paper but hopelessly shallow in practice. (Go see it for yourself - it's so contrived it completely undermines the realistic feel the director has fought so hard to establish.) Furthermore, I'm sick of movies that create 'drama' by graphically depicting violence against children. We get that mid-80s Lebanon was a hell hole, Denis. Refrain from using the sledgehammer unless your story absolutely needs it; it will make your movie more intelligent, too.",6,7,17,12 February 2012
Burn After Reading," The Coens deserved a break after the epic 'No Country'. They took one.
","Allstar cast. Allstar directors. Must-see film? No. And it's not even an interesting failure. What we have is a collection of forty-somethings being content to coast on their reputations, desperately looking for a fresh face to infuse some life in the proceedings. 'Burn after Reading' wants to be a farce, but forgets to be funny. It pretends to tell us something about the world we live in, but does so shallowly. And on top of that, it seems to present a negative world view for the sake of it, which is borderline unethical coming from people as talented as this.Now, if you're a Clooney/Malkovich/McDormand/Pitt/Coen-fan and must see this movie, I won't stop you. There are some enjoyable moments, and you'll occasionally laugh. I guess Pitt IS funny as sports instructor, and Malkovich is always good when he's just being John Malkovich. But in the end, 'Burn After Reading' is a hollow exercise in black comedy that never bites, never connects, and wastes millions of acting talent on a throwaway script that could have used a LOT of seasoning.",3,16,35,11 November 2008
American Psycho," Superb adaptation of modern classic
","I've read 'American Psycho' by Bret Easton Ellis three times, and consider it a modern classic. It's both a brilliant satire and a psychological thriller with David Lynchian ambiguous elements thrown in, and as such, it seemed destined to be butchered by Hollywood: satire and ambiguity don't sell, while the superficial elements that the book so hilariously portrays - gore and luxury - do.Lucky for us, the adaptation was passed around by the big players, dropped a few times and finally scooped up by the semi-obscure Canadian director Mary Herron. Left with a relatively small budget, she decided to build her movie around Christian Bale, who - believe it or not - was also very much a struggling B- or C-lister in 1999.In my opinion, it couldn't have worked out better. Free from the pressures of a big budget, Herron expertly translates the essence of the novel to the big screen without resorting to unwarranted commercial stylings. She allows the movie to define a genre of its own: 'American Psycho' is equal parts black comedy, 80s homage, slasher movie, and thriller, brought to us by its very unreliable narrator, the infamous Patrick Bateman.Which brings me to Christian Bale. I am by no means a member of the Christian Bale fan club, but his work here is fantastic and I cannot imagine another actor nailing Bateman this perfectly. No hyperbole needed: this is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time, with one of my 5 favorite lead actor performances of all time.",10,0,0,16 February 2013
The White Ribbon," Impressive, oppressive
","Northern European literature is rife with family tales and coming-of-age stories told against the backdrop of Lutheran austerity. During its heyday - he 1970s and 1980s - Dutch and German filmmakers translated several of these novels to the silver screen, with reasonable results. But here comes Michael Haneke, an Austrian(!) director with the superb, original 'Das Weiße Band' to belatedly capture Calvinist cinema's crown.Shot in stark black and white, 'Das Weiße Band' transports us to a German village in the 1910s, where people work hard, pray hard and go nowhere, literally. If you squint, there's a touch of Twin Peaks here: Haneke's efficient script wastes no time introducing us to a variety of villagers, all of them struggling in one way or the other. Instantly, ominous things start to happen. Right from the opening credits, the atmosphere is captivating and believable. My grandparents grew up in the 1910s, and Haneke's sets look completely like their family photographs.Without giving away too much of the plot: this movie is very pretty, but contains some painful images. It is restrained and formal, but emotionally draining. It is not recommended for viewers who can't stand to see children get hurt. At the same time, it features some great, lighthearted scenes illustrating the social customs a century ago. The scenes with the schoolteacher and his fiancée are particularly priceless.Highly recommended.",9,2,5,2 January 2015
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Infectious fun
","Most comedies are nothing but joke sequences. 'For a comedy to work, it needs to make you laugh,' a successful director once explained. But this movie here, despite its horrible title, is much more than that. It is a genuine feel-good movie, thanks to a radiant cast that just seems to have had a great time working together. The characters are all infectiously funny but totally believable - I actually wanted to MEET these people, a very rare occurrence indeed.The matter-of-fact treatment of sex probably makes the movie unbearable for certain people, but nevertheless: Strongly recommended for anybody who has a sense of humor about life & love - whether you're 14, 44 or 70.",8,0,1,25 October 2005
The Usual Suspects," Great concept, overly contrived result
","The statistics don't lie - people seem to love this film. I guess they like to be tricked. As for me, I was intrigued the first time around, but the second time (a healthy six years later) I was thoroughly disappointed. Now that this whodunit-thing was out of the way, I discovered the amazing flatness of the characters, existing solely to make the payoff work. The idiotic twists the screenwriter invented to make it look even more complex. Wow. Duh. It reminded me of my advanced math classes: why go through all this stuff when I don't understand how it applies to real life?Don't get me wrong, I still gave it a 7 - because the concept is good, some of the acting was good, and as an experience it works the first time around. But don't try to analyze it - the triviality of it all will drive you nuts.",8,2,3,19 June 2003
Gone Girl," Mesmerizing like a Hitchcock
","I've always loved movies that are morally ambiguous - they lead you to places Hollywood usually avoids like the plague. In 'Gone Girl', director Fincher and writer Gillian Flynn boldly go there - deep into Hitchcock territory. 'Gone Girl' a throwback dark mystery in which a flawed alpha male butts heads with an icy, manipulative blonde... In other words, it's Fincher's 'Basic Instinct', which was Verhoeven's 'Vertigo'.Like the aforementioned films, you should read as little as possible about plot or storyline, and just go see it. At the least, you'll have an opinion about it. Even if it's not a perfect film - Fincher's style gets a little too exacting at times, obscuring deeper layers - it's my top movie of 2014 so far, boldly dark and always unpredictable. The entire cast excels. It's not often 149 minutes fly by.Oh, and a fearless prediction: Rosamund Pike will win an Academy Award.",9,1,11,4 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino is getting predictable
","I'm not the type to hand out a 1-rating to bring a movie's average down, but Django seems to receive more accolades than it should. From Reservoir Dogs on, I've seen every single Tarantino release in the theaters. This is the first time my friends had to carry me out - literally sleeping.Django starts off well enough, with a great opening salvo that locks down the Oscar for Cristopher Waltz in about 15 minutes. But after an hour, the script starts to drag, and the snappy one-liners disappear. By the time DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson enter, the movie is effectively on life support. Neither can save it, with the plot spelled out and the pace gone. The death knell comes from Waltz, who has to relinquish his lead role to the good - but not great - Jamie Foxx. Foxx is promptly sent into a revenge-by-the-numbers routine we've seen several times from Tarantino.Which is where I fell asleep. In the end, Django gets bonus points for its clever tackle of a tricky subject, and for a first hour that ranks among the most entertaining I've seen this year. But it's not in the league of Inglourious Basterds, which isn't in the league of Jackie Brown, which isn't in the league of Pulp Fiction.",7,2,6,3 March 2013
Drive," Fascinating
","This is a flawed if fascinating movie with 'future cult classic' written all over it.To begin with, it doesn't look like anything else, only then it does. 'Drive' shows flashes of prime David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive), spaghetti Sergio Leone (Fistful of Dollars), Hong Kong ultra-violence and 1971 Kowalski, lacquered with the gloss of a sleek car commercial. I'm not sure if director Refn really designed it that way, I'm not sure it works, but it is interesting, to say the least.In such a high-concept environment, the actors seem almost secondary. You'd be hard pressed to call Ryan Gosling the star of this movie; he hardly stars. The script is astonishingly weak. If anybody should win an Oscar, it's sound designer Cliff Martinez.About the score... A lot of reviewers cite its '80s retro' sound. I'm not sure if they were thrown off by the opening credits (which are very 80s), but the music has the analogue synth sound which is a hallmark of the 70s. This sound made a comeback in the late 90s with Air and Boards of Canada, but was notably absent in the 80s.",7,1,4,6 November 2011
Schindler's List," Not entirely convinced
","Impressive job by Spielberg, but still a little too melodramatic for this (European) viewer. Sweeping, understated scenes alternate with Hollywood's patented pulling of the heart strings, which feels wholly unnecessary given the fact that the subject is so obviously tragic.Don't get me wrong, this is a must-see, if only for several key scenes that will be stay with you forever - the haunting images of Auschwitz and the cleaning of the ghetto had me transfixed and visualized the plight of the Polish Jews more than anything I've ever seen or read about the subject. Here, the decision to film and black & white proved a stroke of genius.In the end, I found myself agreeing more with Polanski's take on the Holocaust (The Pianist). More economically told, more powerful.",7,0,3,27 April 2010
The Imitation Game," Not sure how to rate this - Turing probably could
","Going in - as an AI major, nonetheless - I was pleasantly surprised somebody actually dug up significant money to make a film about such a niche subject. Having actually seen it, I'm a bit torn. The good news: 'The Imitation Game' is a well-meaning biopic about a great, complex man most people haven't heard about but absolutely should. It's highly recommended if you have a passing interest in either computers or WW II.The bad news: the film has been considerably dumbed down to make it suitable for mass consumption, leading to far-fetched dramatic setups, nonsensical science, forced dialog and a simplistic rendering of pretty much all of its characters. Knightley and Goode have little to work with, and Cumberbatch fails to fully tap into his inner nerd: Turing's social awkwardness is never real, and neither are his autistic mannerisms. You'd probably be best served to skip 'The Imitation Game' if you know a lot about computer science or related fields, as it will leave you either underwhelmed or slightly insulted.",6,8,15,9 January 2015
8 Mile," Obviously flawed, but authentic - and some classic moments, too.
","Although '8 Mile' has obvious flaws - a total lack of story, for one - I enjoyed it a lot. First and foremost, it is decidedly un-Hollywood in its authenticity; Curtis Hanson never forces the action and has managed to capture real hiphop on tape - even up to selecting all the classic songs from 1994-1995. If it wasn't for the presence of Kim Basinger (way to classy to portray a trailer park mom) and Eminem (whose acting didn't add much for me), the movie could've easily passed as a good documentary.Still, Eminem's presence and rhymes make the film work, and make the final twenty minutes classic. Even if you don't like rap music, you should see the movie for the final battle alone.",7,1,1,21 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A big disappointment
","They told me this film was all style, no substance. Well, they were right about the substance - this film is devoid of plot, humor, character and dialogue, which I can't comprehend, because I figured that stuff was Tarantino's forte. Then again, Kill Bill's redeeming quality supposedly is its style... Well, the movie sure puts a lot of styles on display, if that's the point. Tarantino borrows from various 70s flicks and drops references every five minutes. But it all amounts to a very uneven, tiresome movie, that feels three times as long as it is. The abundant violence, to me, was completely pointless, unlike 'Reservoir Dogs' for instance, where the story & characters legitimize it. I have tons of respect for Tarantino, but in this movie he simply forgets his audience. I honestly can't remember when I left the theatre so disappointed.",3,1,2,23 November 2003
3 Idiots," A Bollywood for everybody
","Dear hypocrites: If 'Amelie' and 'Forrest Gump' can be mainstays of the top 250, so can '3 Idiots' - a movie that similarly gets away with a lot of silliness because it's truly endearing and has an unbeatable joie de vivre. It also features a genuinely uplifting message that only hardboiled cynics will fail to appreciate.Yes, it's probably 45 minutes too long, but on the flip side: the songs are fun, the directing is dynamic, and Aamir Khan pulls out his best Indian Tom Hanks performance. Also, unless you're xenophobic, it's fascinating to see love, dreams and life from an Indian perspective.If you want to see one Bollywood movie before you die, make it this one. It will make you feel better.",7,4,7,29 February 2016
Whiplash," 100 minutes of torture
","There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness. Don't take your kids to see this.",1,92,190,7 February 2015
Blow," What went wrong with the makeup?
","As far as 'Blow' (the movie) goes: pretty standard drug dealer stuff. Not especially violent, not a brilliant story, just some big names in the cast. But definitely see this movie for THE ATROCIOUS MAKEUP! Towards the end, as the characters age, Johnny Depp is meant to look like a 50-something... But instead he looks like a guy wearing a lot of makeup. Very funny, Ed Wood-style.",4,0,1,4 February 2003
Heat," Long, long, long
","'Heat' was recommended to me for its supposedly original and fascinating storyline. However, just having spent 3 hours of my life watching the DVD, I'm somewhat surprised to report that story & characters are by far the weakest link in the movie. Like other reviewers have reported, the film is overly long, mainly because Michael Mann tries to cram way too much subplots in, none of which work since the characters are all tragically generic, the women especially. Also - and I always hate it when scripts do this - much is made of the supposed cleverness and intelligence of the Pacino and De Niro characters. So why do they make one stupid decision after the other? Aaah, that's probably what their mutual attraction is all about, punctuated by a terribly boring coffee scene and culminating in a hysterical manly handshake before the credits roll.Anyway, see this movie for the great sound, hardcore action and, probably, if you like Pacino and De Niro.",6,1,7,1 September 2005
The Martian," The Martian: a Spielbergian take on space
","Greetings from the galaxy, where we get yet another semi-realistic, big-budget space exploration movie from an A-list director - following the very good and very successful Interstellar (2014) and Gravity (2013). So - how does The Martian fit in? There is a bit of overlap, but overall, Ridley Scott has succeeded in adding a completely different perspective.Where Gravity and Interstellar felt like big leaps forward in movie-making, The Martian does not. It is the least ambitious of the three, lacking a deep philosophical undercurrent or breakthrough visual effects that made the other two so compelling. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however. The Martian features - by far - the most well-developed cast, acting performances and characters, and comes with an unexpected, almost Spielbergian sense of pace and storytelling. The movie and its leads are upbeat, resourceful and have a lightness that prevails in the most trying of times. It is, far more than the others, a people movie, and a popcorn movie at that. It's up to you if you like that, and can stretch your suspension of disbelief accordingly.Without giving away any plot details - let's say that, in the end, like its two blockbuster predecessors, The Martian is about survival in the face of overwhelming odds. But while Interstellar focuses on the abyss faced by an entire race, and Gravity on the depths faced by one person, The Martian shows us the joy of survival through old-fashioned team spirit. In that sense, it is a very American movie.",8,2,3,5 January 2016
The Godfather," The Godfather - universally acclaimed mobster soap opera
","There's no sense fighting the general consensus about this uber-classic. I refuse to use words like 'overrated' and you probably don't care that I don't care for mob movies, because I consider thugs in expensive suits no more heroic than thugs without expensive suits.Having said that, I was amazed with Pacino (stunning performance) and particularly Coppola, who was such an amazingly slick and accomplished director at such a young age. His use of light and music is superb. His framing makes the atmosphere intimate and believable. This movie is laced with iconic scenes, has great pacing and is blessed with great production values throughout. Wow.The bad: Brando is a joke (as he often is). Also, I didn't think the storytelling was particularly tight; you could find more holes in the plot than in Sonny C's body. Again, I find it hard to root for any racketeering don, and I'm bewildered by the world's continued fascination with mafia types. But a very good movie it is.",7,0,1,20 October 2011
