Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Star Wars legacy aside, it's a darn good flick
","It's hard to criticize a movie with such emotional and cultural baggage; 'The Phantom Menace,' no matter how good or bad, has instantaneously become a classic due solely to its heredity.  However, I feel strongly that this movie would stand on its own as visually stunning and generally entertaining, with or without the 'Star Wars' legacy to back it up.'The Phantom Menace' takes place thirty years before the original 'Star Wars: A New Hope.'  It begins the six part story of Anakin Skywalker, who will become Darth Vader by the time the saga ends with the original Star Wars trilogy.  In 'The Phantom Menace,' we watch Queen Amidala's (Natalie Portman) peaceful planet of Naboo come under attack by the Trade Federation. The two Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) come to her aid.  As they escape Naboo their ship is damaged, and they are forced to land on Tatooine.  There they meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy with a knack for everything mechanical and an unusually strong natural connection with the Force.From Tatooine, 'The Phantom Menace' takes you on a ride through an exquisitely constructed universe of lightsabers, droids, aliens, and starships.  The visual effects are like nothing you have ever seen before, and the sound is absolutely unbelievable.  While some of the character dialog seems forced and occasionally annoying, the basic storyline and general feeling of the movie makes up for anything lacking in the acting or directing.'The Phantom Menace' has something for everyone to enjoy.  Die-hard Star Wars fans will soak it up, and kids will rant about it for months.  And take my word for it, 'The Phantom Menace' gets better and better every time you see it.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
