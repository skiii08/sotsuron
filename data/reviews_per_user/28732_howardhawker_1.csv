The Equalizer," Brilliant action baddie gets what they deserve movie
",I was reminded of the Edward Woodward show and felt very diffident in case this was a take off.......Well I need not have worried!This is a well paced movie with a mysterious ' Ordinary Bloke' played by the wonderful Denzil Washington who has extraordinary skills when it counts!The film never pauses but is not runaway.....it maintains tension and whilst the denouement is never really in doubt ones arrival at it had me cheering wildly ! It was a miserable grey afternoon but this film made up for it in bucket loads!Highly Recommended,9,1,4,24 March 2015
