Walk the Line," Absolutely Stunning!
","I had been waiting for a year and finally got to see this yesterday. I have been a fan of Johnny Cash since I was a child. We even took our young daughter with us who enjoyed the film as much as we! The performances by Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were top notch...they both really exuded the characters of Johnny and June. The singing was remarkable. Their chemistry was intense. I hope to see these two work together again in another movie someday. Supporting cast also did a splendid job. Every aspect about this film was really great: screenplay, music, cinematography, direction. I highly recommend this beautiful intelligent biographical film about one of the greatest American musical artists in our history.",10,0,1,19 December 2005
The Doors," A Jim Morrison fan wants more of the real Jim shown
","The film was both good and bad.  The acting by Val Kilmer was excellent, and he did exhibit Jim Morrison's persona quite well.However, I have been a Doors and Jim Morrison fan for 20 years and was disappointed in the film overall.  Stone should have covered some of the early years of Jim's life to allow viewer's more insight to his personality and character.  Fortunately, I have read about him and also all of his published poetry.  It's true, he was caustic and fascinated with death and the 'other side.'  However, Jim Morrison was highly creative and intelligent, an artist who as so many others, spread some energy and thrills to our world for a short time and then he was gone.",Null,1,1,29 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," well worth a trip
","This is a completely entertaining, interesting, and funny film. The beginning sets your mood for dry humor mixed with the life observations of puppets and humans relationships.  The puppet theme is all over the place and works.  The trips into J.M.'s mind/body are hilarious and bizarre.  If you enjoy dry humor and imaginative storylines with great performances, see this film.",8,0,1,26 June 2000
