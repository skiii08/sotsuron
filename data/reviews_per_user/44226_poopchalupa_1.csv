Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wow wow wee wow!
","Hands down the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. Every minute of this movie is a laugh. Granted it is unbelievably offensive, however, it really is commentary on modern American culture. At times I found myself absolutely horrified. Not by Borat, but by the actions/ reactions of the college students, rodeo wranglers, confederate socialites, and everyday American citizens that he encounters on his journey. I don't want to drop ant spoilers, but prepare to laugh non-stop as you join Borat from one uncomfortable minute to the next. I find it hard to believe that some of the action is not scripted, but a majority of the film feels absolutely real to life. High five!",10,3,15,7 November 2006
