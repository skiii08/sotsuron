The Blair Witch Project," Just one word: TRASH
","When I first saw this pile of crap in the cinema I realised it's wasn't a real story at all but pure fiction, and I came out of the theatre feeling I had been cheated. 
Three well-fed, full grown-up healthy Americans get lost in a forest known to be the home of a witch, then they go hysterical the moment night comes up and they can't get out of there because they lost their bearings?... They are living in the 20th century, not in the Middle Ages! And also because they are investigating the ancient legend they start panicking and screaming at each other and breaking down? What are they made of? What a bunch of sissies.
The characters are so irritating -I hate that girl, I could strangle her- and look so lousy, scruffy, smelly, just like a bunch of homeless lice-ridden dope-smoking addicts... I didn't feel sorry for them at all. I actually enjoyed their suffering, honest. I wonder when was the last time those pigs took a shower before going out into the forest.",Null,2,6,17 February 2018
The Shining," A shiny hallucination
","I absolutely love this film. It doesn't recur to gore excesses and the usual horror clichés (the old and isolated grand house that can only be haunted, lights going off and objects moving about by themselves, dark corners and dusty basements and attics...)but we have here a very clean and extremely well lighted place where it seems impossible that anything wrong can happen. But then, the most effective horror can be drawn from normal and totally pleasant-looking environments, which makes it more terrifying. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of visual compositions (his career began as a photographer), and among all of his films this one remains to me as his most beautiful. It is full of carefully composed and paced tracking shots where the hotel decor plays an essential part in the visual symmetry and composition: ample spaces where the characters look vulnerable, endless corridors and huge function rooms where one can almost get lost.The hotel is a gigantic maze that reflects the hedge maze outside, and the Torrance family are trapped in it. The Stephen King novel is very good, but a bit boring and overlong, since it develops sub-stories about characters that are not relevant to this story, and tells the past of the Torrances in several flashbacks. Kubrick goes straight to business after half an hour,lets out anything that does not interest us here and changes the plot significantly and gives the story a completely different ending. Because of that, many fans of the novel didn't like the film when it first came out (it disappointed me too, when I fist saw it on television after reading the novel) and Stephen King himself hated it and fell out with Kubrick for what he considered it was a distorted and self-indulgent manipulation of his story. But new viewings of the film have helped me to discover its real quality and visual beauty and the way in which the horror is not actually shown explicitly but implied in our imagination through the characters' behaviour and the chilling score. The Torrances don't get slain one after the other every time someone goes off wandering by themselves like it always happen in the usual slash movie. Here the horror lies in the increasing hallucinations of Jack, the visions of Danny and the gradual mental breakdown of Wendy caused by Jack's bullying. The most chilling moments are the close-up of a dishevelled and stubble Jack staring blankly into space as his mind is cracking, and Wendy going through his manuscript only to find out that he has been writing one same sentence through hundreds of pages. That is a brilliant way of showing how a man is going insane before he actually starts using violence. The only gore concession in the film is Halloran's axe murder, which may seem gratuitous since he was expected to take Wendy and Danny back to civilisation, leaving Jack to die alone in the hotel. But his failed mission has a purpose too, because his snow-cat is actually used at the end by the woman and the child to escape from that evil place. But then, since the hotel doesn't get destroyed like it happens in the book, the ending is open for another family of caretakers to come in next winter and the Overlook's evil circle to start again. Chilling.",Null,0,1,9 February 2003
Where Eagles Dare," High-octane action and explosions galore
","It took me three viewings to understand the film's double-twisted plot, and yet every time I watch it again I feel I am still missing something. The arranged capture of the fake general and the suicidal mission to rescue him are a total absurdity and a waste of time, resources and human lives, since the traitors could have been easily unmasked in England through torture or the use of drugs. But then, the entire story at the bottom of the mission is only a Mcguffin! Its only function within the film is to set the main plot in motion and get the characters into action! Yes, all right, Clint carries an inexhaustible amount of dynamite in his backpack, he wipes out an entire Wehrmacht division all by himself, he and the girl empty dozens of magazines upon the pursuing Germans without themselves buying a single German bullet in return, and keeping the soaking clothes on after jumping into the freezing river won't get them a triple pneumonia because they have plenty of blankets and gallons of brandy to warm them up. So, let us not take it too seriously, because that would only spoil the enjoyment of this otherwise marvellously entertaining war thriller. So sit back, relax and enjoy the fast-paced action and the fireworks. Because they don't make 'em like this anymore.",7,3,5,7 February 2014
Eyes Wide Shut," Why there was so much raving about this movie? It's pathetic!
","The only positive comment I have to make regarding this film is the cinematography. Kubrick was basically a photographer, and you can see that in every film he directed: angles, tracking shots, composition, symmetry, editing... He, Hitchcock, Welles, Murnau and Dreyer are the greatest visual masters of all time. But what was Kubrick thinking of when he made this piece of rubbish?!!... How could he say this was his 'greatest work ever'? What happened to the man who made beautiful masterly films like 'The Killing' 'Paths of Glory', 'Dr. Strangelove', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Barry Lyndon and 'The Shining'? He must have been going senile when he made this pretentious piece of crap and called it his ultimate masterpiece! Was it necessary to make a two-and-a-half hour movie to tell a dull story that could be compressed in ninety minutes or even less? What a waste of celluloid!And couldn't he have possibly found a better leading actor?!! Dear god, Cruise is a dull moron who can't act at all but flashes his smile and touches his hair every minute and looks this way and the other while he says 'you know, hum, yeah, honestly baby' all the time. A total bimbo-boy. A totally much overrated movie that if it had been made in a low budget by a second-rate director it would have been slashed both by the critics and the public. And the director, crucified. It's a total shame that Kubrick's brilliant career had to end up in such a worthless way.",3,2,8,1 June 2012
Titanic," Titanic: the parody
","This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what 'Airplane' is to the 'Airport' saga and 'Blazing Saddles' is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of 'But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!' He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling 'I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will' And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line 'I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!' The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",3,7,13,11 June 2016
It's a Wonderful Life," It could only happen in America
","Where can I start? Jimmy Stewart,who was a great serious actor in the Anthony Mann Westerns and the Hitchcock thrillers, here is nothing else than an idiot. And then, who can really see him as a high school boy when he was almost forty years old when he made this movie? Please!! And then when he is bankrupted by Lionel Barrymore and about to do away with himself, an angel comes to stop him and to show him how much the world owes to him ('A Chistmas Carol' updated, how nice!) and all of a sudden the whole town flows into his house to pay his debts and save the day. How nice of them too! Of course that could only happen in America, the earthly paradise where everybody loves their neighbour and life is beautiful. And they all lived happy ever after. One of the worst much-loved classics of all time.",1,67,144,1 June 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Absolutely infamous.
","Bram Stoker must be turning in his grave, and if I were one of his descendants I would have sued Coppola for using the writer's name in the the title. This monumental piece of trash has almost nothing to do with the novel but looks like a long feature MTV video for teenagers. Terrible, atrocious and awful. The art direction and make-up designers should have been fired on the spot: the armours are made of plastic and Gary Oldman's make-up as an old man is a ridiculous hybrid between the Phantom of the Opera, the Mummy and the Fly. They possibly couldn't have done worse than this, and they won an Oscar for it!!! The acting is so bad that even the always reliable Anthony Hopkins gives here one of his worst performances ever. The whole thing is so awful and such an insult to the spectator's intelligence that I can not go on without starting to use foul language...",1,8,14,28 June 2012
Ben-Hur," The epic that topped them all
","I am not going to write an essay on this film, because everything that could have been said about it has already been said. I first saw it when I was sixteen, and loved it. I must have seen it thirty times ever since, and I never get tired of it. The film certainly has many goofs. The chariot race is full of continuity mistakes between shots and the contenders certainly take a lot more than the nine turns they were supposed to take around the circus. But it is absolutely great and exciting, and still unmatched today as a piece of live action. It took weeks to shoot and one of the stunt-men smashed a $100,000 camera when his chariot skidded out of control. In the naval battle you can tell the scale models used in the long shots. But who cares? In the crowd scenes with extreme long shots, both at the Victory parade and later at the circus, you can tell they are matte shots. But they look so beautiful that you almost believe they are real things. Nowadays CGI always sticks out like a sore thumb -that aerial shot of the circus in 'Gladiator' is just awful! Messala is one of the greatest villains of all time because of Stephen Boyd's brilliant performance. A usually underrated actor, here he steals every scene from Chuck Heston. Also, he has one of the greatest death scenes ever. Miklos Rozsa created the mother of all epic scores, still unmatched today. Two years in preproduction and ten months of actual shooting, thousands of extras, a real-scale replica of a Roman circus, accurate replicas of Roman chariots, and eighty pure-bred especially trained horses. Final cost: fifteen million dollars. The most expensive film ever made to that date. A remake would be totally ruined by today's trendy styles of camera-work, music, acting, sound effects and visual texture. And CGI, and PC issues. Fourteen years ago, 'Gladiator' was awful. Today, it would be even worse.",10,1,3,30 March 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Awful.
","Don't waste your time watching this. The script is full of India-seen-from-a-western-POW-clichÃ©s, the camerawork is murderous, and the child actors are a total pain in the a***. I gave up after just 40 minutes, couldn't take any more of it.
Back in the mid-90s a very well known and respected Spanish film critic, Carlos Pumares, once said: Cinema has only 25 years of life left.
And he was right. 
The illustrious members of the Academy who awarded this piece of trash with EIGHT Oscars either are PC crusaders looking for a few medals or a bunch of morons who spend all day sitting on their brains.",1,0,1,2 July 2018
