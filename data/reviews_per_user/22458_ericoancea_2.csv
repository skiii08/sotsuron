It," Poor horror movie by itself, horrendous as an adaptation
","This is a review made by someone who read the book and I can say that it is a huge disappointment even if, if you've read the book, you know right from the start they couldn't have ever made it to match the book in its entirety.The movie seems to be made by someone who heard the book plot from his friend while binge drinking. The monster behaves by different rules, which make it a lot weaker than it originally was. There is no explanation given to the audience why people were violent and ignorant. The vision-inducing ritual is replaced by research done off-screen. Apart from Georgie (the trigger) and a bully, no other kid is killed on-screen. The Losers' assault on the monster's lair is not fueled by their desire to stop it from feeding again, but by a damsel in distress. To top it all off, the monster's final form is not actually a giant spider, but remains just the clown.Now, onto the movie's issues taken after forgetting there ever was a book. It's a cheap horror, full to the brim with jump scares. The characters all behave stupidly and go wandering all alone in dark sewers away from the group, even though they know they're hunting a child-eating monster. The monster gets way too much screen time and looks goofy, not scary. This is the type of horror that's so bad, its tropes are some of the most parodied.'IT' is the only movie where I felt the need to just walk out of the theater midway. It's a poor horror and, on top of that, an embarrassing adaptation. Total cash grab piggybacking on the book's fame, do not recommend.",3,5,10,14 September 2017
Creed II," Creed 2 tarnishes Rocky, provides unpalatable main character, misses opportunity
","The movie begins with Creed, a loud-mouthed thug, beating a generic adversary and claiming the heavyweight championship. On the other side of the world, in Ukraine (later Russia, who cares, it's all the same, right?) Ivan Drago silently (as not to invoke too much humanity) trains his son while living in abject poverty conditions, his son also working carrying bricks for a living. Then we cut back to Creed just being super rich and pampered and successful, he's not even carrying his own luggage. Then Drago shows up in America, ready to challenge Creed (because of the stupid and laughable reason being that his wife left him because he lost to Rocky), and Creed reacts just like a back alley thug, with 'dey iced my pops' and when Rocky tries to put some sense into him, telling him that his fight with Drago was not worth it because he had brain damage afterwards, Creed lashes out on Rocky and goes on to get beat by Drago's son, who of course plays dirty and cheats apart from being stronger and better, only to not learn anything, never give out a valid reason why Creed fights (his story is not Rocky's at all, Rocky was fighting for dignity), quick training montage somewhere dirty as to reflect how he's humbling down, and then beat Drago's son anyway. By the end of the movie I felt so sorry for Drago's son, even after they tried so hard to portray him as an amoral brute. This was supposed to be the fight that avenges his father and it played out superficially, the adversary was cardboard and that was bad, Apollo Creed had personality, that's why they are still using him goddammit, it's a movie that tries to portray that working hard will bring results but actually portrays the opposite, pampered rich loud-mouth thug beats poor Russian fighter that carries bricks for a living, and misses a huge opportunity to delve deeper into the struggles of parents that have children with disabilities.",1,76,138,3 December 2018
