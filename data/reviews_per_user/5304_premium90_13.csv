Men in Black 3," This is good and back to it's roots! spoiler alert
","Just need to put this out. I watched the 2D version and not the 3D version. Based on the information that this film is converted to 3D. Anyway, Will Smith and reprising his role as J. Not bad eh? Tommy Lee Jones is only in this film for a bit but Josh Brolin plays an amazing Tommy Lee Jones - Agent K. You would think at first that Tommy Lee Jones used his voice through out the film. But no... this is top class acting.The film is centred on aliens. Obviously. Rescue the planet again. Generally speaking, all 3 films were based on this.I would say kids should love this film. I gave it a 7 based on the fact I watched Prometheus recently. I gave that an 8. So no way this film is better than that.Anyway, enjoy. I laughed a lot throughout the film and did not get bored.Just word of warning. My partner thought it was boring and fell a sleep half way through the film. So I guess, the film is like mar-mite. You like it or just don't like it.For me? I loved it. Made me chuckle throughout.",7,1,4,5 June 2012
Skyfall," Poor. I might be the only person here to be honest....
","What can I say? I really am disappointed in this movie. Is it because the movie was very slow and dull. Really dull. Some parts of the movie was good, especially the action scenes but overall the movie was slow....... really slow....If you liked 'quantum of solace', you will extremely disappointed of this movie.First thing first. Why is this movie so boring? So, so, boring.Daniel Craig is betrayed by M. She tells 'Moneypenny' to shoot. Bond becomes a drunk. He comes back with a revenge. Dull revenge. So on and so on.Boring..........Only thing I would say, is this a prequel? I hope not. Please do not start rebooting all the bond movies! Please don't!!! They are classics. So please don't!",5,5,17,28 October 2012
Terminator Salvation," This is a good movie! Not as bad as people think!
","First thing first! I do not understand why certain critics have slated this movie and giving it a poor review. One thing people must know that this is a terminator movie and the fourth instalment. Terminator was a classic. Terminator 2 was great! Terminator 3 was OK and was really watchable. And...........terminator salvation continues the general theme.No point in myself telling you the full story. This film is definitely for the cinema and the near future - bluray.This movie is rather about Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Kyle Reese. To be honest, John Connor (Christian Bale) plays a small part, although the whole script was re-written.The question is about, who is Marcus Wright? No point telling you as this is the main intriguing part of the movie. It makes sense after the movie. The story connects all three pre-terminator films perfectly. Good job the whole ending was re-written as if you search the net about the alternative ending - you will be really angry! Anyway, not going to talk and talk as you will be able to get the drift of the story if you search google! This movie is a good action movie with stunning sound and CGI. Even Arnie looks like Arnie! Woo hoo. No way a terminator movie can be without Mr Arnie! Anyway.....great movie! Came home with a buzz after the flicks and will definitely purchase this on bluray in the future. I love the terminator franchise (excluding the TV series) and this does not disappoint! Must see. Let hope the next movie includes Arnie again! Even if he reach 70 years old etc. LOL.MCG does not disappoint..... Terminator here we come!MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE!!!!!!!!",8,2,5,6 June 2009
The Adventures of Tintin," Absolutely terrible. Nearly fell asleep.
","I'm not going to mention too much about this film due to being so disappointed with this film. Like many, I grew up reading the comic books as a child and then later in my teenage years the cartoon. What can you say about this film. Positive points is that the graphics are far superior than ever before. It really looks real life and the expression of each character is brilliant. Straight away you know that it is tin tin, pardon the orange tinge to his hair. I am very sure he was kind of blonde right? Anyway.... we decided to watch the 3D version. Oh yeah. 3D....... Back to it. Positive points only is the fantastic graphical presentation throughout the film. I can not fault it one bit.Now, the bad thing. The whole film. I nearly fell asleep. Roughly at 30 minutes, I had to move around to keep myself awake! Oh no. I had another 1hr 10 minutes of this film to go through. I am not being funny! 1hr 10 minutes. My head was telling me, another 30 minutes the film will pick up. Yes..... actually no.1hr 40 minutes later, I felt I was robbed of my life. I'm not joking. I thought it was the worse film this year. I am not kidding.Now for the 3D. 3D... another gimmick and another big con. I'm sorry but if this film was not considered to be 3d, leave it as it is. Why oh why! The trailer looked 3d but this film surely not so. If I was you and you are desperate to watch the film, stick the digital 2d version.All in all, the one point is for the amazing attempt of the graphical presentation of the film. Pity about the film. I will not be watching the sequel.",1,33,68,19 November 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible back on track+++++++++
","I'm not going to make a big statement about this film as it was actually very enjoyable. I would recommend that people watch this in the cinema as we did just now.I was rather disappointed with the last 2 mission impossible and this film is back on track as the best. The film has a feel of the '007' franchise with a twist.With the amount of designation and the bad guy to chase. This is old fashion action film which is back on track of the franchise.Ethan Hunt is back and doing crazy stunts like never before. The funny Simon Pegg is brilliant in the film. It is difficult to go straight into describing the film without giving out too much. The action scenes are great but one thing I would say is that the film keeps up the tempo! Not one scene is boring. The film keeps going and going without stopping about some boring love scene or a like.This film is definitely the best Christmas 2012 film of the day. I was surprised how unpacked the cinema was. Maybe because it is boxing day, people are spent up or just going out for the night out. Maybe next time, these blockbuster films should actually come out a week or two earlier to attract the audience.Anyway, watch the film. Brilliant. If you don't watch in the cinema (you are crazy - don't forget IMAX), definitely get the blu-ray version when it eventually comes out.Good film. Back on track.",9,2,6,26 December 2011
2012," Based on watching this on bluray - HD. Worth the watch.
","If you seen other disaster movies you may want to watch this. I think it was worth the watch.The directors and producers were rather smart in not picking a major cast. The idea was to make all characters believable and each having a major part in the film.It is a disaster movie and don't want to go into further.The cgi in this film are really good in HD. Really believable and worth the watch at home.The film is definitely not brilliant but worth the watch.Be warned,the film is rather long.",7,2,4,3 April 2010
Clash of the Titans," Not so great! And not 3D!
","With the hype or hype of Sam Worthington and others in the film. I jumped at the chance to see this film and pre-booked online 3 days in advance. 3D - yeah, I thought. Was I wrong.I would like to add one statement. If the film was not filmed in 3d, please do not use useless computer algorithms to make it 3d! Please don't! I would have been happy watching this film in standard 2d.Anyway,the cgi does not look good in 3d. Looks below standard and rather grainy in the cinema. After watching it for 30 minutes, I felt ripped off. I took off the 3d glasses several times to check if it was 3d. You could watch the film without the glasses and only differences is that it is brighter.Back to the story. If you watched the previous two 'Clash of the titans' films - you understand this film is rather OK. You really can't mess up.Anyway, don't want to add spoilers now. Film is Clash of the Titans. Greek gods and alike. Interesting but not so interesting.I believe this film will be great on bluray. If you want to watch this film - watch it in standard 2d. Don't waste your money on the extra bit.Standard film and not so great.",5,5,10,3 April 2010
Taken," Just simply brilliant
",I don't want to spoil this film at all. Just rent it or buy it. Just simply excellent!!! Brilliant. Liam Neeson at his best. This is so fast paced and does not stop at all until the end credits.Just read the rest of the user comments.Liam Neeson is trying to save his daughter! This film scares you a bit. Daughter goes on holiday to Paris with a friend and something bad happens. Liam goes and rescues her... Don't want to say anything else. Simply brilliant. The film brings you right in and you are cheering him on for getting a step closer! Liam Neeson is like a Jack Bauer! 24? Like Series 1? Make sense? Get it................one of the best films ever! Definitely a movie for your collection.Simply brilliant film.Excellent..Amazing...And I don't have shares in the movie.Amazing...Brilliant!,9,1,5,4 April 2009
Alice in Wonderland," No more films made in 2d and converted to 3d - please....
","Everyone knows the story of 'alice in wonderland'. If you have not read the book, go and buy it or borrow it.I am person on few words but this is a new adventure of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.Overall the story is worth the watch. Especially for the little Britain guy! Worth the watch.This film is not 3d. Only certain parts are enhanced. Please oh please. The film industry has found a way to produce films in 2d and then convert them later into 3d. This does not work! Waste of time.If you have watch Avatar or even 3d final destination - you will know the difference.Overall- the film was average. The 3d was poor.",5,2,5,3 April 2010
Prometheus," Prequel or not a prequel? Really good film (spoiler ish).
","SOME SPOILERS IN THIS.It is difficult not to be really love this film. Waiting for over 1 year for this release was bad enough but when it was released, you just had to watch it.This film was filmed in 3d and the only choice for me was to watch it in true 3d hd in odeon. I watched it in real3d and was really surprised how good the 3d effects were. Ridley Scott made sure it was not overwhelming and not too much 3d. I would say a fine balance. I would need to say to the real die hard 3d filmers, this film is not too dark for 3d. Ridley Scott made sure this was just about right. As there are not much mention about the 3d, I would say roughly 30% of the film was in 3d. The tunnel part early in the film was amazing. You felt that you were in the tunnel itself.Enough about the 3d and more about the film.Although the film is mentioned that it is not a direct prequel of alien and more a new film. I would say for the die hard alien fan, that there is enough to answer most of the questions about the alien in the cockpit. Plenty of nice little clues about the alien!I don't want to go too much about the film as it would ruin it. I believe the advertisements of the film was kept to a minimum, in order for everyone to understand the film from start to end. Thank you for not ruining the film due to advertisements.I got to say that visual effects are very much superior and very very good.I myself, would say this film is a direct prequel to alien. No matter what they did to the film, it was much better than thought.8 out of 10 for me.Although there was a classic ending to the film, I would like Ridley Scott to make sure that he takes a clever decision on if they want to continue this film via a sequel or not. All I can say, if he did leave this film like it is, it will definitely be good as it is.Anyway, everyone enjoy.",8,7,13,2 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," This film is goooooooooood! Watch it.
","I believe most people understand the concept of the x-men by now. If you have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows them away completely.I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring. This prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It follows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can't believe the cleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.This is a definite watchable film.Anyway, without boring people - please watch it! It is on the same wavelength of batman alike. Very nice and good film at it's best!",8,7,10,18 June 2011
Godzilla," what a terrible film!
","I'm won't go into detail at all about this film because it was awful. The only good thing about this film was, 'Bryan Cranston'. (1) Acting in this film is really wooden except for Bryan Cranston. (2) About 10% of the film is in 3d but not really that great. Just to tell you this will is a post-conversion and I watched this film in real3d. (3) Don't expect the film to be exciting at all. (4) I ended nodding off to sleep in the last hour every few minutes. The film was seriously rubbish!You have all been warned. The film is about Godzilla and some terrible acting.Can I have a refund please? 1 start was for Bryan Cranston acting.",1,21,45,18 May 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Disappointing... not as 3d as you think. 1 is the best. 3 not so good.
","The vote of 6 out of 10 reflects the fact the hype did not live to my expectations. Just to say, I watched the film in a IMAX 3D cinema. The sound effects were brilliant.Back on track. The film starts off and tries to connect the first man on the moon with the autobots. If you have seen the trailers and the title, it kind of gives it away.Anyway, with out destroying the plot and giving away too much as I bet you will still see it.The film itself? Overall there is more script in the film. Shia, John Turturro and surprise, surprise - Ken Jeong makes a decent appearance in the film. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley acting is absolute appalling. I'm sorry, but although you are absolutely pretty - they should have give you a none speaking part.The film really does not have a nice story to it. They should had made sure the script was much better.Visuals? Excellent. It still lives to the hype. A lot of bang for the buck.Biggest disappointment? 3D! Out of the whole movie, the nearly end scene in which the building fall apart - are the main 3d scenes. None of it jumped out at all. Very disappointing.What else? The only reason I could give it a 6 out of 10 is due to the effects. Story line stinks but I can still see this franchise make a lot of money.Please, please, please.... if you do make another Transformers movie. Please go back to transformers 1 and understand the story and not effects is the most important thing of the movie.",6,2,6,2 July 2011
