The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Fairly average adaptation
","This movie will appeal to die hard fans of the series. It is a reasonable adaption of the first part of the book. The graphical presentation is impressive. You do get a sense for the environment and breathtaking locations. However the acting is weak all-round. None of key moments are portrayed with any sense of conviction and this leads to an average presentation. The story telling is also a weak point, since film fails to convey the inner turmoil experienced by the main protagonists.Considering the target audience, I think this movie will perform reasonably well at the box-office in anticipation of the finale'.",5,1,6,2 December 2011
Interstellar," Visually appealing but a little bit too long
","I like movies set in space and involving some element of time travel. Interstellar was interesting to watch but the plot took a long time to unfold. I liked the way certain of the scientific elements of the story was explained to the viewer. However the writing was a little weak and certain plot elements implausible, which made the whole viewing experience a little confusing because is it an action movie or science fiction? The acting was generally above average and the cinematography impressive. I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey especially as he applies himself well in most of his character portrayals. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain do well portraying the daughter swap central to the theme of the film. The movie also brings about many questions that the viewer may ask, should I go or should I stay? Overall, enjoyable but maybe some better editing would have improved the whole experience.",6,1,1,27 September 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Weak story but enjoyable
","X-Men:Apocalypse suffers from a weak story and limited character development. I guess that is a symptom of introducing a powerful villain that exists only within the movie running time. Compared with other offerings in the X-Men franchise this is probably sitting in the middle. The imagery and costume design is on par with many of the current superhero movie offerings. Story-wise the Netflix Marvel series develop their antagonists so much better and the viewer gains a better understanding of where they come from. Here not so much, characters that were in X-Men First Class and X-Men Days of Future Past such as Mystique, Magneto, Beast and Professor X have developed well and you have a sense of their battle for acceptance. The introduction of Storm, Jean Grey , Cyclops, Nightcrawler as characters to extend the series have been excellently casted. Overall the last couple of Marvel Cinematic Universe movie offerings have been mediocre, they have to change the formula otherwise interest is going to dwindle. (6/10)",6,0,3,27 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Average follow-up with unoriginal plot
","The Force Awakens is a customized version of a New Hope. A person who has seen both movies will easily be able identify the similarities. It is not a complete dud but it could have been much better.The success of the original trilogy has made it difficult to create something new and something better. JJ has failed to create something original and in the process has also destroyed what has come before. It is not the first time JJ has destroyed planets without considering the consequences.The Force Awakens is visually appealing but the story is unimaginative. The movie lacks a strong antagonist and relies too much on sentimentality. Hopefully, VIII will be better.",6,11,15,31 March 2016
Life," Feeble attempt at a sci-fi thriller
","Life falls into the same category of films like Species(1995). Where the theme of the film is mans curiosity to explore for signs of life leading to the potential extinction of life as we know it. Start with a controlled experiment where you underestimate the strength or intelligence of the subject. The subject escapes and you have your plot.So what is wrong with 'Life'. It is a very weak on the sci-fi side. It is almost as if the writers did not spend any time theorising about possible situations that may occur. That is the effort that goes into designing a system or protocol for investigating something that may have catastrophic effects on the human race. Once, you get that wrong, then it is very hard for any sci-fi fan to take you seriously.Two movies with Mars as part of the story, The Space Between Us(2017) and The Martian (2015) are good examples of putting proper thought into a story. The stories are interwoven with the writers postulations of what may happen.'Life' at no point was scary or thought provoking.There are much better films on offer.",5,0,1,4 September 2017
Donnie Darko," Donie Darko and the Tangent Universe
","This is a difficult movie to watch and understand. There are several dark themes under exploration. The narrative tends to lean towards science fiction with an element of horror. Each significant character is carefully introduced to fit into story. The story is actually a thesis presented to postulate a notion of time travel, 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' stating that time is usually a stable construct but every now and then the fourth dimension gets corrupted. When this happens it creates a tangent universe which is highly unstable and will only last a few weeks before it collapses in upon itself. There is a danger that when the tangent universe collapses it could cause a black hole capable of destroying the primary universe as well.",8,0,2,6 December 2016
