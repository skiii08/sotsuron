The Avengers," Nearly Perfect Superhero Movie
","How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series.",10,1,1,14 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Marvel formula exhausted
","When I was watching this one, it felt a bit of similar with the failed Green Lantern flick. It's the worst movie of recent Marvel Universe. There is no real plot, mediocre acting and just felt like a money grab. I get it that they wanted to introduce a female superhero, but they really should have taken points from DC wonder woman. Wouldn't' watch it ever again. Waste of time.",5,5,9,12 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," The best Eurovision that I have ever seen
","This movie was a complete surprise. Netflix does not make really good movies. For some reason they are always lack something extra (take all of Adam Sandler movies of late) or straight awful like'Coffee and Kareem'. This time it's different. It's actually surprisingly emotional and simply awesome movie, with an amazing cast. This is one of the best I've seen from Will Ferrell in a long time, probably since Anchorman 2.
This movie is a creation of Ferrell, as he's the one who co-wrote, produced and starred in it, so the credit goes to him. The funny part is, that it felt that he was a bit of mismatch looks-wise, for simply amazing Rachel McAdams.
The music is perfect reflection of Eurovision. It lifts the spirit and makes you smile.
I would hope the'd make a followup to this one with a Rocky1 - Rocky 2 style, where the Iceland would win. I never really rooted for anyone at Eurovision, but the next time I'll be rooting for Iceland.",8,13,15,2 July 2020
Juno," unintresting
","OK, granted I am far from being a teenager, and definitely this movie is not for me but to receive such high grade at this site??? I guess I'm an old school - I believe that any movie suppose to be a show, and trigger up certain emotions. At the grade of 8.4 it really should appeal to everyone, well it didn't. If it's suppose to be life like,than the whole idea of a 'nerd' boy getting a hot girl when she realizes her 'wicked' confused ways does not belong in it. The plain truth is that successful people attract another successful people, and at teenage years it's much harsher then later on in life when you compromise, so I really didn't really buy that part. In my personal opinion that excellent casting is the thing that saves this movie. Ellen Page is excellent in it, though i do feel that she's overacting a bit with her part. I feel that she is much too confident for a teenager. I did feel that chemistry between Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner was good - there was unfulfilled tension and everything - that was the high point in 'life likeness' of the movie. The story is old and a modern interpretation of it doesn't really saves it. Really didn't get what is so special in it. In any case, I think that this movie is good for people with teenage kids, and maybe for teenagers but as for all the rest it's quite boring.",5,12,29,27 January 2008
Megamind," Too cheesy
","I realize that not every cartoon movie can be of the same quality as 'How to train your dragon' or 'Wall-e', but come on. They recruited such high profile actors as Will Ferrel and Brad Pitt for the voices, so animation and jokes must be accordingly funny as well as touching elements of the plot. Besides first part of the movie - the idea of super villain beating super hero, looks nice, but afterwards it looks down the hill. Animation is mediocre at very best. It can't be compared to previously mentioned cartoons neither by quality of animation nor by the level of interest of it's characters (beside megamind himself). On the plus side, it's a nice cartoon to take the kids to.",6,2,6,8 January 2011
The Town," Good enough...but something is missing.
","This movie is definitely not bad. One might say even good, yet there were few things that were missing (or overdone in some way) that prevented this movie to reach the 'departed' movie status. It's a crime drama. Story is simple yet it works every time. There is a lot of shooting, personal drama, love feelings and even a bit of sports. In general this is what every movie needs to be good. Now for the things that were missing or overdone. Ben Affleck. There were way too much of Ben Affleck on screen. Frankly despite the fact he's not bad at all, but he's not a grade A movie star who can carry a movie to the top. I found his overacted monologues a bit irritating. Story is a bit too simple - Obvious secondary ('bad') character death at the end, and a shot of redemption for the main one. It felt as this movie is too 'politically-movie' correct, as all the ingredients are there, but they are not cooked properly. This one is worth to watch never the less.",7,0,4,4 December 2010
Shutter Island," good despite the ending
","Well, I saw that movie. It was good. It was entertaining and captivating. One might say it was perfect... well everything except the ending. The guy decides to commit homicide because he can't live with himself. Weak. It was clearly missing the edge, and not the common one - when they are conducting those mind experiments and the psychic patient actually discovers it, but the original one, which I can't think about right now. DeCaprio, an actor which I don't really like played good, though I think that someone else might have been better for this part - someone like Collin Farrel. In any case still it's another master piece from Scorcese. I'd advice to anyone to goo see this movie.",8,0,2,1 April 2010
Pacific Rim," All dig giant robots
","I really loved Charlie in Green street hooligans. His charisma influenced the attention on the screen every time he was on. IMHO better than wood, but this one... he wasn't good. He can't play relentless hero. It's just not him. This movie has some great effects and decent back story, but he can't (at least for now), play the main roles similar to these ones. Loved Charlie Day and Ron Perlman (but I like them in every movie), though they seem too out of place. If this movie was shot in 'Batman' style, it would have been much better. Never the less, it still worth to watch. At least once. Del toro can create spectacular scenes, but at least in this case, not a good actors choice.",7,7,11,4 October 2013
Forrest Gump," Amazing touching masterpiece
","I watched this movie many times over and only now, 26 years after the initial release, I decided to write a review on this amazing and touching take on Classic American history. There is no reason to go into its plot, it's well known to all. After watching some of the atrocities that being produced these days, I really would like to remind movie directors, that they really should take notes from masterpieces like this one. That's how you make a movie for ages.",10,0,0,6 May 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Everyone can wear the mask...
",That was a pleasant and unexpected surprise. Original take of spiderman with interesting plot. Emotional cameo of Stan Lee (special thanks for this one). Emphasize on diversity and how everybody can be a hero. The message was clear and very motivational. I did not like the multiverse animation it felt a bit cheap. Also it felt that they seriously mismanaged aunt May and her bat/spider cave. Other than that it's a good cartoon for all ages. Highly advised.,8,2,5,20 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Cinematic achievement
","'If you build it, he will come'. Those words from the 'Field of Dreams', came to mind after I finished watching it's last night. Without a doubt, a perfect ending for an era for a team of a beloved superheroes. Those three phases of building up to this moment in my mind, actually can be counted as one huge incredible project building up for this moment. Despite its ups and downs, this entire project can be considered as a great work of cinematic art, which gave us many hours of interest, speculations and pure enjoyment. Even the worst movies of the universe so far, which are captain Marvel and Thor 2, fall into their place as a bit unpolished pieces of the puzzle. The movie itself wasn't perfect story wise, there are some story loopholes, but it worked perfectly on many many levels. The only thing that bothered me, was out of character, pure 'strong woman power' moment in the last battle, which is so popular in the movies these days, as this moment actually goes against the spirit of the movie, which basically all light against all darkness at the end. Despite this minor glitch, I gave it a pure 10/10 as a work of cinematic art, which concluded over a decade of hard work. Shame, Stan Lee is not alive to see his vision come to live on screen. He would love that.",10,0,2,26 April 2019
Clash of the Titans," Hollow yet entertaining
","Just finished watching this movie, with a bit of mixed feelings. First of all, movie on it's own is not that bad as people describe it to be. True there is no resemblance to original myths. Also true that this movie is exact reap off the original 1981 movie. Despite all that, effects are great - really enjoyed them.The paste is fast and action scenes are decent. Kraken scene is the best. I felt what was really missing from it is the heart and the acting (besides Liam Neeson, solid as usual). It felt like director tried to simplify already simple story, which in turn made it look extremely hollow. Sam Worthington couldn't do what he did in Avatar and terminator - look charismatic hero. in fact at times he looks quite degenerate - but i think it's the producer's fault for cutting all the 'unnecessary' scenes. The story of soldiers and hunters are not told at all. In any case, I saw it and it was OK, but if you look for something more spectacular, go see Avatar again.",6,0,0,21 July 2010
Inception," Good...not great. What is all the fuss???
","I just returned from screening with my friend, and I just didn't understand what is all the fuss about? Seriously this movie is good. Maybe even on the verge of greatness, but I think to put it on the same page as Shawshenk redemption, or Godfather just doesn't seem right. There were so many posts about how good the movie is, so I decided to write it's weak spots. First of all idea: Idea of different realities/dimensions was exploited in Sci-Fi for years. This interpretation of dream within a dream looks decent but not original. I preferred interpretation of Matrix series. In addition to this time in a dream not always goes slower - sometimes it's much faster. Story: missing few key elements. First of all it's focuses on story of just one man. Stories of other characters are unclear. Also unclear their motives to go few levels deep into dreams. There could have been much better scientific grounds for another reality. Ending is predictable in a way. It was clear to me from the middle of the movie that it had to have a catch, that it's not really a final reality. That what it turned out to be... Actors: Once again, I will take the risk of sounding heretic to few readers, but I believe that DiCaprio did not belong in this role! It's a role of Kianu Reeves, or Johnny Depp type of actor, but not childish like Leo. I believe that he is smart enough to choose correct roles for him, so coo-dos for him. The rest are OK (once again not great)In conclusion, don't get me wrong, I liked it. I gave it 8/10. But it wasn't truly great. Call me crazy, but I think that Nolan's best work so far was batman begins, wen he took worn out franchise, and created masterpiece series of it.",8,1,4,3 August 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Neither here nor there
","I am a comics fan. Particularly DC comics universe. When Nolan released his take on Batman, I was thrilled. It was an amazing adaptation of the dark knight, which in turn featured on of the very best villains ever produced on screen. And of cause I'm talking about the Joker. Now this one was far from it. Granted, the director tried to go to different direction than highly appealing and successful Avengers universe, yet it seems he was torn between the comic book darker look and Nolan' dark knight. Let's start with the plot, it full of so many holes and highly dumb decisions by its main heroes and villain, that even people that are far from the comic world, left confused at the very least. To name a few, why did Batman stopped when he heard the name Martha? ( and on this matter why did superman called his mother, Martha when he was about to die?) why did Luthor revealed himself to the superman who could easily have taken him out in advance and stop the destruction before the monster was made? Wonder woman looking for some old photograph (there are so meany look alike in the internet? Why didn't anyone other than some private divers inspected the huge alien spaceship? I mean the government first act to take it under control? And many many more.Casting. In my opinion Luthor and Wonder Woman were horribly miscast. Lex looks like a beta version of Nolan' Joker (Sorry but Aisenberg can't pull it off anyhow), but in any case it's far from the iconic villain we learned to expect. Gadot simply can't pull off the beauty, grace and strength of Diana Prince. Absolutely. Afflek's Batman and Irons as Alfred, lack too many of qualities we learned to expect from the duo, therefore it was kind of boring to watch.Oh, and I should mention that no one managed to show the character depth. It was really lacking in this department. It's hard to care for anyone in the movie.CGI. It's good, as it was expected. And on the contrary to amazing Avengers fight scenes, this one went great lengths to show more of a supernatural fights. In conclusion in my opinion the director should have taken notes from Nolan' Batman iconic trilogy or The Justice League cartoon Series. A true Gem on its own. Hoping that suicide squad will improve the beloved universe.",6,0,2,13 May 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Holy S...
","That was something unexpected. Waititi is a true and genuine talent of a Tarantino proportions. But where Tarantino mainly stays within his universe and acting, it feels that Waititi is much more diverse, while he can tackle almost any genre. It's not for everyone, yet he manages to make you experience actual deep emotions towards the characters and get the best out of actors. I saw many movies with Scarlet Johanson, but it was the first time ever, that I felt real appreciation towards her as an actress. She got the Oscar nod for the best supporting actress, but after seeing this one, in my opinion, she should have won. Young actors are very young, but they gave an excellent performances. It was a real shock moment once you see some of the sadder parts of the movie. Presentation is everything and this one is a rare movie that makes you sad and happy simultaneously, and that's where Waititi's talent shines. It's not an epic 10/10 blockbuster of an Avengers endgame proportions, but it's unexpected and brilliant. It's rare for me to re-watch those types of movies, yet I would like to return to that same universe and I definitely would like to see the follow up of the story if he ever decides to shoot it.",8,5,9,11 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," On a path of destruction
","Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that 'star-wars feel'. Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' 'the cool'. Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series.",6,12,16,24 March 2016
Deadpool," Awesome.
","A true spirit of dead pool. Simply awesome! This superhero flick is a perfect example of how to make an introduction into fictional universe filled with super heroes. It's funny, charming and perfect. Raynolds had truly redeemed himself from the green lantern fiasco. He's an upgraded version of his Wilder days, and that's what we like. He captured the spirit of the hero to the perfection. I took two points off, due to lack of proper antagonist representation (IMHO), same Indian taxi driver\Wilder sidekick joke, stereotypical teen and righteous Collosus, and few more glitches. But overall, this movie is a true fun. Also I'm having a bit trouble to see how dead pool will fit into marvel universe, as the style is different. Never the less, this one is a gem. I want to see it again, and I really want to see Raynolds return to this role. It's his best so far.",8,5,14,24 March 2016
Warcraft," They had to start somewhere
","Who doesn't love Blizzard? It always seemed, everything they touched turned to pure gold. With huge success of Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft franchises, it always seemed they could not do no wrong. In this case, despite the movie being very decent in its genre, comparing to the current golden age of 'comic book\fantasy\sci-fi' cinematography, it certainly does not stand out, as per usual Blizzard standards. The good. The world of Azeroth finally came to life outside of computer screen. The orcs are gorgeous and deep. Despite the excellent game-like action sequences, the movie focuses a bit on a back story (especially the orcs) which I enjoyed very much, as it feels a bit different than usual, all-action choreographed sequence 'Avengers' style. It felt like computer game came to life, and that's what we like anyhow. Especially from the Orc side of battles. On top of that the motives of few noble ors, are explained and shown to the perfection. I am a series fan, so it was easy for me to connect the dots in the story. Simply Incredible CGI.The bad. As could be expected, the human acting would fail vs the green screen. First of all, young is not always better! The actors look way too young for their parts. Nearly all of them. Their choreographed fighting scenes doesn't hold a candle to orcs', and the feeling is that The story seems bleak , but as I said in the title, they had to start somewhere. I must mention the apprentice. Clearly wrong casting choice. The studios figured out the potential in 'geek' theme movies, so they are cashing in. The true hope that it'll continue, and we'll see real epic movies from that universe in the future. 7/10.",7,4,7,10 June 2016
