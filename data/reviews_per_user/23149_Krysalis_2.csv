The Ring," Camera tricks and spooky music weren't necessary in the original.
","Alright, so you went to see The Ring in theaters and left praising it for its deep, ingenious plot...but little did you know it was actually a REMAKE of a brilliant Japanese film called Ringu.  If you enjoyed The Ring, please give the original a chance. It is much more subtle, and, in my opinion, infinitly more spine-tingling than the American remake. Sure the remake has its moments...it could have been a much worse film...but Hideo Nakata's Ringu, originally released in 1998 (the same year as the sequel, Ringu 2, was released) still retains an expressive power over Verbinski's version, mostly because there is no sacrifice to the American gods of specific plot narrative. If you liked this Ring, do yourself a favor and see the real one!",Null,0,1,2 March 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Cinematic Travesty...
","How terribly disappointing. I should have expected that, after Terminator 2, that there was no way to better the series. But I couldn't help but be optimistic, so when I heard about T3's impending release, I was ridiculously excited. What a mistake. The only thing T3 has going for it is its adept special effects, but these are USELESS when the script is abysmal. Terminator 1 was a brilliant action movie, followed by Terminator 2, one of the few sequels in history to surpass its predecessor in quality. And now, eleven years later we receive a tepid, boring and laughable sequel to an action masterpiece. If you valued the first two movies, avoid this one like the plague. Unless of course you prefer your movies as boring and lifeless as a neutered cow.",2,0,1,2 July 2003
