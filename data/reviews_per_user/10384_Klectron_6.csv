The Blair Witch Project," Original, scary, perfect!
","This is no film for people who like bloody movies with lots of gore. I don't know if I dare to say this is a movie for people who liked 'The Shining'.One thing's for sure: Hollywood finally produced characters in a horror movie. Real characters. They were gone for a long time, but here they are, and the actors do a perfect job. The whole movie is shot from a hand-held camera view in either color or black & white, and yep, that's shaky. But it makes this movie so much more believable! The story: 3 student film makers go out into the woods to find ancient burial grounds. But there is a legend in town. A terrifying legend. The further they go, the more they get lost. The three start to get nervous and scared, because strange things happen at night and at day. Then, one of them disappears.You don't see any gore, thank god. The movie gets inside your head, makes you think about what's happening out there, what could possibly caused all those strange things. And this, combined with perfect acting, a great setting, the beautiful camerawork and a great story, makes for a true horror movie. I was scared, not by sudden YOUCH-thrills or gore, but by pure terror. And that is what real horror is all about.You owe it to yourself to see this movie if you like absolute horror.",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ehhh....ehh...
","This is not going to be a review! This is going to be a preview based on the comments I've read at IMDB. Since I haven't seen the movie yet, I can't give a review...Here's my current 'preview'1 Jar Jar Binks sucks bigtime. I'll prepare for the worst! 2 The fx were great, but not superb. 3 The acting wasn't really good. 4 The story...ehh..what story? It lacked story, the characters were ok. 5 The lines are stupid. (Most of them)So...looking at this preview, I'd give Episode 1 a 6. This'll probably change when I get a chance to see the movie...",Null,0,1,25 September 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The ultimate adventure movie
","That's what this is. Harrison Ford is perfect, NOBODY could have replaced him. The music is unbelievably good. The camerawork, the acting, the action, the effects, beating up nazi's...Indiana Jones is truly the greatest adventure movie ever made, and, by the way, the computer game Fate of Atlantis starring Indiana Jones is also the best adventure game ever made.I am REALLY looking forward to the next Indy movie, which is rumoured to be based on the Fate of Atlantis!",10,0,0,16 August 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Something has survived from Jurassic Park, but it ain't the plot!
","What is wrong with this movie? Well, not much actually. The special effects are, ofcourse, great. The acting is good in general, and even though I can't stand kids in movies (especially when they can't act and say stupid lines), the Goldblum kiddo wasn't REALLY bad. No, the only thing that is wrong with this movie is the story. Site B? What the hell? Suddenly there's ANOTHER island? No, I don't buy that. Ofcourse, dinosaurs have also trashed things up on the second island, due to the storm in part 1, but why didn't we get to hear about the 2nd island in the first movie?Why did they put in a second island anyway? the dino-team could also just go back to number one, right? (With the same storyline). The kid wasn't THAT bad. But there was no need for her to be part of this movie! And her lines aren't the best....Then there's good versus evil. Oh NO!!! WHY!!??!! Why is there another team involved? Now the movie becomes a standard 'who's gonna be there first?' flick! I wish Spielberg would have paid more, MUCH more attention to a dazzling story instead of superb effects...Lost World: 7/10 (3 points missed due to the story....Spielberg, you can do better!!!) Jurassic Park 3 is coming. I can only hope it's gonna have a better story...",Null,0,1,29 September 1999
Titanic," Titanic is real
","The only reason this movie did extremely well at the box office was because of all those girls watching it about 12 times. Why? Because of Leo. Personally I've got nothing against him, and his acting is fine, really. Nothing spectacular, but adequate. Kate Winslet was better though. Acting in general was good.The special effects are superb. It is one of those rare movies in which you don't think: 'Hey, that computer animation is good!' because you don't get the feeling that it is actually a computer animation. The titanic is real.Since the story was a bit too simple (ship hits iceberg, ship sinks) there had to be some kind of lovestory. Titanic and romance, the perfect combination! Of course, it is still deceptively simple. Girl is about to marry guy she doesn't like, falls in love with good looking boy, boy falls in love with girl, other guy goes mad, ship hits iceberg, ship sinks, end of story. But somehow Cameron succeeds in making it look like an extremely complicated story.In the end this movie provides a great atmosphere, good acting, superb effects and a simple but effective storyline. If you haven't seen it yet you really should go out and rent it!",Null,1,2,16 August 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," this movie has a superb ending
","It's just plain fantastic. One of the best Monty Python movies ever made. And, unlike some people say, this movie has a superb ending. It is just so unexpected that it will leave you wondering if that was indeed the end of the movie. It is the best ending of a comedy I have ever seen in my entire (though somewhat short) life! Watch this movie!!!",Null,0,0,14 August 1999
