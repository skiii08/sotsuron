The New World," Excellent film-making, but boring topic...
","This movie was really well made. There is the beautiful nature, beautiful the look of the movie is in its whole way. The camera is awesome too. The acting by the way is acceptable too, ...for all Farell-haters ; ) The director describes step-by-step the all known Pocahontas-story. And thats the point, I don't like. The story is very limited. From the first minute, you know what will happen. Thats the same problem, on my opinion, that King Kong had. Great film-making, but a boring, all known story. Nevertheless the director brings the plot very sensitive in little steps to the audience and the characters are developed in details. There Tallick uses an explaining voice in the background, which tells us what the main-characters think and how they feel. Especially in that point - and in many more ways - the 'New World' reminds me so much to 'The thin red line', which is also so beautifully shot, but the better movie because of its content.After all, I would say, you cant say that Tallick did something wrong. But the story itself lacks of content.I would give it a 6-7. I hope, I made not too many mistakes in writing this...i'm German ; )",7,0,2,23 March 2006
Spider-Man 3," Spiderman 2 > 1 > 3...
","today i saw spider-man 3, and i was really disappointed. i liked the first, and i loved the second spidey...and perhaps i excepted too much. in my cinema we had a break at the half, and we discussed a little...everybody was saying 'is that all'...'when does the film getting tempo?'. i mean the whole first half of the film, u see it, but never there's such a feeling as i had in the second spidey, where it really kept me feeling with the characters. in the second half the film gets a little faster, but raimi failed, when he tries to put again many themes - love, action, opponents etc - together. the film has not the flow, the second has and i never said 'whoa!!'...the opponents-characters are not as good worked out as octopus was, and maybe in the end 4! 'heros' + love-story + social environment + action was simply too much. in the end, it was a nice film, but not more. in Germany we say something like 'too many cooks destroy the meal'... definitely the weakest part of spider-man!!",6,2,4,3 May 2007
