The Blair Witch Project," Do you like scary documentaries?
","Uhh...hmmm what is the word for this movie? Oh, yeah I remember: WOW! Okay, okay, so spooky noises in the woods are not really scary in general, but what was kinda freaky 'bout this movie is how it seemed to capture reality and how a couple of people would really react to all this stuff happening. Personally, if I heard all those noises in the middle of some redneck woods (Especially the laughing/screaming children) I would sh*ttin' bricks. It shows the stages of denial, insanity, acceptance, fear, hatred, blame, and many others not necessarily in that order as these three emotionally different characters bumble through the woods trying to get a grip on reality. Until I noticed that this film was in fact written and directed by some guy, I thought this was the real deal. I had never heard of it before, until the day that I saw it, so I really had no clue what it was about. But anyway, if you wanna see a movie that scares you indirectly rather than throw the hatchet right in your face, go see this movie!",Null,1,1,17 July 1999
