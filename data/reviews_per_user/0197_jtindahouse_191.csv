Ford v Ferrari," Overly long and has no legitimate protagonist
","The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.The film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.The biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic.",4,5,14,31 January 2020
Insidious: Chapter 2," Some good frights and doesn't stray too far from what made the first good
",James Wan is getting an impressive resume behind him and fast becoming one of my favourite directors. As far as I'm concerned he's yet to make a bad movie and a couple ('Saw' and 'The Conjuring') are masterpieces of the horror genre. Sadly I don't think either 'Insidious' movie has quite reached that level but that's not to say they're not very good horror movies. I will be very interested to see how he handles the jump across to the action genre with his upcoming 'Fast and Furious 7' and hope he returns to horror soon after because he's damn good at it.'Insidious: Chapter 2' doesn't change much up from the original. It continues the story from pretty much exactly where the first one left off. The opening scene is captivating and brilliantly interlaced with the rest of the film as we learn more and more about what is going on. The scares are plentiful and rarely fail to deliver - some excessively. Since the success of 'Paranormal Activity' a lot of filmmakers seem to be taking a stab at the ghost/demon based films. The most effective so far have been 'Paranormal Activity' itself and as previously mentioned 'The Conjuring' but the two Insididious movies would have to be a close third. The ending of this one leaves an opening for another sequel which I understand is already confirmed and I say bring it on.,8,0,0,19 August 2014
Blade Runner 2049," Too long and consequently loses its impact
","I have to start this review by admitting two things: 1) I wasn't a big fan of the original 'Blade Runner' and 2) I very rarely enjoy films based around AI (Artificial Intelligence). I find that they too often ask you to care about a robot and I simply find that very difficult to do. After watching the original recently I gave the sequel a chance hoping it would be a very different film since it was made 35 years later. And while it is different in a lot of ways (and undoubtedly a better made film in my opinion) it still suffered from similar flaws.First of all the film is far too long. Nearing 3 hours is just ridiculous considering very little actually happens in terms of story development. Compare it to a film like 'The Dark Knight' and the incredibly complex story arcs that it possessed and it still managed to come in at 2 and a half hours. For a film to be this long the pacing has to be immaculate and while it wasn't terrible in 'Blade Runner 2049' it certainly couldn't justify the runtime it had.I was a big fan of the cast. Harrison Ford was the stand-out. He was captivating to watch in every scene he had. I knew he wasn't a happy man on the original's set, but this time around he put his heart and soul into his performance and it showed. Jared Leto was also a nice cast addition, however he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough for my liking.There are some really great moments interspersed in this film and with a little more of those the film could have been something truly special. The scene with the two girls combined into one (that sounds weird, but you'll know what I mean once you've seen the film) and the final shot of the film were both masterfully done and very special moments that don't deserve to be forgotten. Who knows though, maybe they'll make another cut of this film one day and turn it into something great.",5,3,6,2 December 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Surpasses The Original!!!
",This movie was a more story telling movie than the original which was basically just an action movie made to entertain from scene 1. While this movie wade to be as exciting as the original it was definitely made to be a better movie which it was. I mean a movie doesn't have to be people cutting each other to pieces to be an exciting movie which is exactly what this movie portrayed. Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) was very good in her role as was Michael Madsen (Budd). David Carradine (Bill) was alright but didn't really live up to the expectations of The Brilliant 'Bill'. Samuel L. Jackson did a wicked cameo which I think gave the movie a bit of a kick for that chapter. But of course as you would expect if you haven't seen this Uma Thurman is the best actor and does every thing very well. I personally think Quentin Tarantino will be very happy with himself and the two movies.,9,0,1,30 September 2004
Captain Phillips," Powerful storytelling
","'Captain Phillips' is an interesting little film. It's based on the true story of the real life Captain Phillips who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. The film portrays Phillips as a hero, but this has since come under dispute by people involved with the real life incident. Regardless of whether these claims are accurate or not Phillips story makes for a damn fine film.It must be noted that director Paul Greengrass never goes over the top in portraying Phillips as hero. He's nothing remotely similar to the likes of Bruce Willis in 'Die Hard' or Clint Eastwood in 'Dirty Harry'. He's simply a man who finds himself in a terrible situation and acts accordingly and well. Even if the odd detail is touched up here or there to fit the film better I really don't see the issue. Any minor controversy really isn't warranted.The acting is superb. Barkhad Abdi has received an Academy Award nomination for his performance and it's well deserved. The fact that this was his first ever acting performance is astonishing. He brought a realism to the role that I suspect many actors who had decades of experience under their belt would struggle to achieve. His story is quite truly inspiring. Tom Hanks on the other hand has been robbed of a nomination in my opinion. He was brilliant throughout, but in the final 20 minutes he delivers some of the highest quality of acting imaginable. His final scene is mesmerising. I feel if a scene or two earlier in the movie had been tweaked a touch, to give him more of a chance to shine, he would likely be there with a nomination next month as well.It's a fascinating story, told in excellent style by Greengrass that deserves to be seen. It deserves its nomination for Best Picture but probably doesn't quite have the guns (pun intended) to take home the award. Hanks is usually pretty reliable when it comes to signing himself on to quality films and this is no exception.",8,0,1,7 February 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," A brilliant mystery that will keep you guessing until the end
","The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a 'found footage' film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.I love nothing more than a well created mystery where the audience are left in the same confused state as the character/s and are filling in the pieces of the puzzle as the same pace that they are. This is one of those films. I see it was originally titled 'The Cellar' before it was reworked into a 'Cloverfield' sequel and I can very well imagine it working all on its own as a stand-alone thriller. John Goodman is the star of the show. He truly can be a brilliant actor when he sets his mind to a character. He plays the role perfectly never giving away any more than he needs to and adds to the mystery surrounding everything perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also impressed me in the lead role. She's likable and bad ass depending on the scene and plays both equally well.I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. I think it helps when you go in with no real expectations (as I can imagine a lot of audience members doing for this type of film) and then just out of nowhere you find yourself enjoying the hell out of it. As previously stated I won't give anything away, which leaves my hands tied a touch in discussing one of the key aspects of the film. All that's really left to say in that case is see this film!",9,110,214,9 March 2016
The Equalizer," One of the best vigilante movies I've seen
","How could anyone not like a vigilante movie? It's surprising to me Hollywood doesn't make more of them considering they always seem to be well liked and successful. Plus the formula is simple enough to create. Then you simply find the right actor and boom! Box office success. The first vigilante movie that comes to mind for most people I'd imagine would be 'Die Hard'. Then for the younger generation I'd imagine it to be 'Taken' (and possibly a few of the older generation because it was pretty good. And now I'm telling you once enough people have seen 'The Equalizer' it'll be right up there amongst the other big guns because it is very very good.The most important ingredient of all to the vigilante genre has to be the star. Bruce Willis was perfect in his role, Liam Neeson was even better in his role and now here we have Denzel Washington, one of the coolest actors in Hollywood. For an old man (he's 60) he absolutely nailed it. First of all you'd never guess he was 60, I believe he worked out very hard for the role. Secondly it's his demeanor throughout that defines the character. He's so in control, so calm and collected that never once do we feel he could be in the slightest bit of danger from these ragtag Russian gangsters.And unfortunately therein lies probably the only downfall in 'The Equalizer'. Perhaps he's simply too in the control the entire time. It makes for a lot of fun no doubt about it, but somewhere in those 2 hours and 10 minutes you have to have your hero in a precarious position where it seems all is lost only for him to miraculously escape. There's a scene where you could argue that was the case but I don't think it was enough. That's the only criticism though I could find in this very fine film.",9,2,6,24 December 2014
War Dogs," Exceeded my expectations
","I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'War Dogs'. I had put off seeing it for a while. The trailers hadn't really done a lot for me. I'm a huge Jonah Hill fan, but Miles Teller I could take or leave. Todd Phillips in the director's chair is almost always a sign of quality though, so I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I finally got around to it tonight and now I regret waiting so long. What a great movie. Firstly, it finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. If anything it probably leans more towards the dramatic side of things, however there are plenty of laughs, mostly thanks to Hill's terrific comedic timing. Secondly, what I had feared might be a bit of a bland story actually works very well. It's simple enough to appreciate and never strain your brain over, yet complex enough to be fascinating due to it being based on a true story. It reminded me a lot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', simply minus all the sexuality that film contained. I can see the argument being put forward that none of the characters were likable, but it's not a film that's ever trying to make them likable either. The film doesn't need us to root for them, it simply wants to take us on their journey. Other than that I can't see a lot of areas that you could poke holes in this film. It's well-directed, well-acted, well-written and just an all around fun time to be had.",8,0,0,5 January 2017
Source Code," A lot rides on a film's ending
","Source Code is a very interesting little film. It follows in the footsteps of films like Deja Vu, Inception and Looper (although Looper was of course released afterwards). And one of the things these films have in common is that they raise a lot of questions and discussion after you've seen them. So I came to the IMDb message board for Source Code expecting nothing different. However what I found there, in comparison to the other three films, was different. The whole movie wasn't so much being discussed, but simply the ending. And the general question that kept coming up, which I admit had occurred to me also at the time, was 'does the ending make any sense at all?' Now Source Code is a mystery thriller, which is a lot of fun to try and work out, so I'm not going to spoil the ending for you. I'll simply talk about the implications it had. Firstly, it must be said that an ending that gets people talking at all is an accomplishment. After all, isn't that what every filmmaker strives for? Christopher Nolan ended Inception brilliantly by leaving a huge gaping question for the audience, rather than giving a definitive answer. Although he did leave clues throughout the story for us to go back and work out the answer for ourselves. Here, director Duncan Jones takes a different approach. He gives us a clear and absolute ending, but the clear ending he gives raises more questions than answers (an achievement in itself). Personally I didn't like it and thought (along with a few others I've talked to) that it should have ended at a particular point a few minutes earlier. I think you'll know which point I mean when you watch it.The ending aside, Source Code is a pretty entertaining, well produced and well acted film. Right from the start we are hooked into the mystery the main character finds himself in. We both find out information at the same pace and it makes for fun watching. There's a whodunnit aspect in there, which never takes center stage, but makes for a nice little addition to the story. Jake Gyllenhaal carries the film pretty well and Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga provide good support throughout. Definitely worth a watch this one and I'll let you make up your own mind regarding the ending.",7,0,0,24 January 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Weak characters are all that let it down
","'Deepwater Horizon' has a very patient first half. It takes a lot of time to familiarise its audience with the characters and also the basics of the oil rig, in particular the things that are going to be important later on. Then all hell breaks loose. Once the action begins, it never stops. The only problem with all of this is that despite all the time taken at the start to attempt to make us, I never cared enough about the characters. Now this is all based on a true story that is very fresh in all our memories. And admittedly being a true story does bring things closer to the heart and brings out more emotion in the audience naturally. I still don't think the actors and writers did a good enough job though of dragging us in and making us care. 2015's 'Everest', one of the finest 'disaster' movies I've ever seen, was also based on a true story, but would have worked equally well had it not been, because the characters were so strong. That's really the only thing letting 'Deepwater Horizon' down.The scenes involving the actual disaster are extremely well directed. There are some impressive visuals and never a dull moment. Just how terrifying being a part of the event in real life is well illustrated and really brings home just how awful this was. There's really not a lot else to say about this film. It's tidily made and an enjoyable watch, but I don't think it will stick in my mind like 'Everest' managed to.",7,1,2,9 October 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," The worst one yet
","Having really enjoyed (at least as far as this series goes) the third entry in the 'Resident Evil' set of films, I was quite disappointed to see them take a step backwards in this one. 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is my least favourite entry in the series to date. Interesting, my two least favourites, the original and this one, were both directed by series writer/producer Paul W.S. Anderson. The second and third entries, which he lent out to other directors, were far superior in my opinion. This is a disappointing fact, because I have two films to go in the series and he has directed both of them.The reasons I didn't enjoy this one as much were as follows. Firstly, this one is much slower than the other films in the series. At almost the halfway point in the run time the story is still being set up and characters are simply standing around introducing them self and discussing what to do. There are little hints of action here and there in the first half, but they are hardly anything worth mentioning. Secondly, it felt like this focused a lot more on style than actual substance. The opening scene is a prime example. Very very little actually happens in it, yet the whole thing is filmed in slow motion and with stylish camera angles to make us think this is a great scene. Also, it would have to be said that this series is starting to feel a little stale after four entries. You find yourself asking what exactly am I getting in this edition that I haven't already seen or experienced. I would love to see Anderson think a little outside the box for the next two entries. Try something different to mix it up a bit. Otherwise I feel this series really can't justify six entries.",5,1,3,25 January 2017
It," An enjoyable and well made horror film (you read that right)
","I went into 'It' with the potential to absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it. The horror genre has been on life-support in my opinion for a long time. So even the mention of expected quality behind a horror film is greeted with skepticism. However the trailers looked promising and an 'R' rating was incredibly pleasing to see. So what was the actual result? Certainly more positives than negatives.The film starts with a scene which sets the tone for the entire film. I had actually seen the majority of this scene in a 'Presented by Stephen King' prior to another film I had seen in the cinema. The scene cut off before the end though and I have been wondering ever since exactly how it was going to play out. I finally got to find out this morning and I was very pleased. This scene works perfectly to infuse the audience with the notion that 'It' is indeed a genuine threat to each and every character.The things I liked most about the film: * The look of 'Pennywise' - he was genuinely intimidating, mysterious and captivating to watch.* The set designs - rarely do I notice things like this on the first viewing of a film, however on this occasion it was impossible not to. They were impressive.* The cast of children - in particular Finn Wolfhard showed class beyond his years in being the funny guy of the film.* The pacing - while this has a very long run time for a horror movie, it never really feels like it. To say it is non-stop action is probably going a step too far, but it's not far off it. 'Pennywise' was in the film a lot more than I expected which helped with this.The things I didn't like as much: * At times it feels like it is trying a little too hard - for the most part there is a level of subtlety in most scenes, however just on occasion they get a little too in your face with the scare they are trying to give you.* Also (and I'm sure there was a reason for this) I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a single likable adult in the film. In fact every single adult in the film is outwardly unlikable. This wouldn't have been done by mistake, but it is still a very depressing and unrealistic aspect of the film.Altogether though 'It' is a very good horror film. There's definitely the usual substance of a Stephen King film, while still managing to fit in more than enough scares and suspense to keep any type of audience members happy. If you're as disillusioned by the horror genre as I am then make sure you see 'It'. It might just give you an air of hope like it has done for me.",7,5,15,6 September 2017
Hereditary," Almost works better as a drama than a horror
","'Hereditary' is sort of like two films in one. Half of the time it is being what I expected it to be, which is a horror movie. The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode. The film is over 2 hours in length which is extremely long by modern horror movie standards. The reason I believe for this is that it's trying to fit so much in and achieve so much in such a little time. It's a very ambitious film it would have to be said.The entire cast were terrific, but Toni Collette absolutely blew me away. The emotional depth she is able to achieve never ceases to amaze me and she is captivating to watch in any scene she's in. I feel like she is one of the most under-appreciated actresses working today. As mentioned though, everyone is terrific and this is one of the best acted horror movies you are likely to find.I sat in the cinema for a couple of minutes are the credits rolled just trying to work out how I actually felt about the film. I know I liked it, but I also know I didn't love it as much as I had hoped to going in. It certainly surprised me that I was more invested in the real-life drama side of things, and that the horror was almost like an unwanted distraction at times. The horror is almost always about atmosphere and visuals rather than any kind of jump-scare which I always like. What I didn't like though was how casually it jumped from seeming normality to outright suspension of belief. I feel like this could have been bridged a little better. Early on there's a lot of subtlety, then in one scene all of that is thrown out the window at once. I suppose at least the audience knows where they stand from that point onwards. 'Hereditary' is a film made with impeccable quality, of that there is no questioning. In fact it's made so well that I would suggest what story you picked to tell almost wouldn't matter because writer/director Ari Aster clearly has the skills to make it work. I can see opinions being very divided on the film (I even had a couple walk out of the cinema at one point in my showing), but I think the majority will like it on some level and for that reason I would recommend giving it a look.",7,284,495,7 June 2018
John Wick," More style than substance but still a lot of fun
","It feels like a very long time that Keanu Reeves has been out of the game for. The last film of his I believe I saw before 'John Wick' was 'The Matrix Revolutions' way back in 2003. He's had films in between now and then of course but I suppose none of them have really caught my fancy or been highly praised enough to warrant a view. Then out of nowhere, along comes 'John Wick' that everyone is raving about and saying Reeves is back. I was delighted. In fact I'm disappointed with myself that I've taken this long to see it. Nevertheless it was worth the wait.The film isn't really what I expected. First of all the kill count was astronomically higher than I ever would have expected. Secondly the style caught me quite off guard. Hit-man characters are always cool, there's no way around that, but Wick was another level on from that. The scene with the policeman showing up at the door and being entirely comfortable with the fact that there was a dead body lying on the floor over WIck's shoulder was absolutely perfect and set the tone for the rest of the film brilliantly. This was no ordinary assassin (if there is such a thing). Reeves performance was good. The role was suited to him in the sense that he didn't have a tremendous amount of dialogue and he could get by with the odd one-liner here and there to carry things through. Say what you want about the man's acting abilities, but he portrays cool like few others can. I read that this is intended to carry on into a trilogy, so it will be interesting to see where they go from here. I think a lot of what made this so enjoyable for so many people was probably the same feeling I got of witnessing something you hadn't expected. Obviously that effect will not be available to them in the sequels and I feel like they will struggle to up the body count, so what exactly it is they'll do to keep it fresh I'm not sure. However they choose to go about it though I'll be happy to see another outing from Wick.",8,1,3,9 June 2015
Rocketman," Surprisingly dark
","There was never any way that 'Rocketman' was going to avoid being compared to 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Which is a little unfortunate because 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a masterpiece. 'Rocketman' is an excellent film, however it couldn't live up to what that film managed to achieve. They're similar films, although rather different in a number of ways too. 'Rocketman' has a lot of spontaneous singing with back-up dancers appearing out of nowhere, making it feel more like a musical. I didn't mind that to be honest. It was what it was and didn't pretend to be anything differently.This is also a much darker film than the other one was. Both deal with a couple of very depressed artists in their prime, but this film really rams it home. There are a tremendous amount of unlikeable characters in this film. Apart from Elton himself, there is really only one likeable one that I can think of. It's almost a relief when he is on screen because otherwise the film is just too bleak.I was thoroughly impressed by Taron Egerton's performance. He maybe didn't 'become' Elton to the extent that Rami Malek became Freddie Mercury, however his singing was excellent and his acting in the emotional scenes was of a very high standard. Elton John fans will have a particularly good time with this film, but even if you're not his biggest fan I think there is enough here to keep you satisfied and interested.",7,4,7,13 June 2019
A Star Is Born," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","I can't remember the last time I expected to dislike a movie and ended up loving it to this extent. I actually had no intention of seeing 'A Star Is Born' but got invited along to it and decided to give it a chance. In exchange I was treated to 136 of the most enjoyable minutes of my life. I actually thought to myself at one point in the movie that I would be happy if this movie never ended. It was just so perfect in every way. The music sounded great, it was heart-warming, heart-breaking, inspirational and relatable in every aspect.There was so much to love about this film, but the thing that was simply the best for me was the love story between the main two characters 'Jack' and 'Ally'. I can't remember the last time I saw chemistry this good between two actors (you may have to go as far back as 'Titanic'). I didn't even recognise Lady Gaga until about the halfway part in the film when her character takes a visual transformation. Even now, knowing that it was her, I still have to ask myself was that really Gaga the entire movie? She is completely different to how I've always seen her. I can't remember a transformation this big since Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. Her acting also blew me away. She was truly incredible. Her singing was always going to be great, but it was her emotional range that blew me away. She even out-acted Bradley Cooper overall in my opinion, and that is no mean feat because he was also absolutely incredible. She unquestionably deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.Cooper has outdone himself with 'A Star Is Born'. He wrote, directed and starred in the film and did all three to an incredibly high standard. His character broke my heart. You could see in his eyes how much he loved this woman, and yet he was facing so many demons that it wasn't allowing him to be truly happy. The story arc of his character is a work of art. He is also much deserving of an Oscar win for Best Actor.If you haven't worked it out by now I absolutely loved this movie. There isn't a single fault I could come up with. If this film doesn't have you glued to the screen and drag emotion out of you then you are made of stone and film is simply not for you. I would be very surprised if this film didn't take home the Best Picture award at the Oscars. It would be an extremely worthy winner.",10,7,14,9 November 2018
Gravity," A beautiful film about our beautiful universe
","'Gravity' is a visually stunning movie. It reminds us just how much beauty there really is out there. From the opening shot, right up until the closing one, we are taken on a journey of stunning visuals both from space and here on Earth. But there's also more to this movie than just that. We are taken on a spectacular story of survival told absolutely wonderfully by director Alfonso Cuarón, who is up for a well earned Oscar nomination, both for his film and his directing.Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are the only two actors really of significance throughout the entirety of the film (there is also one other astronaut who doesn't last long and a few radio voices including that of Ed Harris). Both are nothing short of brilliant in their roles. Clooney plays a character perfectly suited to him. He's a charming, funny and on to it astronaut. He's calm, cool and collected - just the kind of guy you want around in a crisis. This was a brilliant character to have because at the half way point when he drifts away to certain death and we are left alone with Bullock's character, our sense of agoraphobia (fear of wide open spaces) is doubled. We've had that comfort zone and now suddenly it's gone. We are always feeling the same emotions as Bullock's character due in part to the wonderful way the film is shot by Cuarón, but also due to the wonderful performance given by Bullock, who has received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her role. She is simply riveting to watch. We feel her pain over the lose of her child and we are always rooting for her to survive. When she's short on oxygen, we are short on oxygen. When she can't manage to grab onto something to stop herself drifting away, we can't either. It's terrific stuff.'Gravity' is such a unique film. There isn't a huge amount of dialogue and not even really that much action, and yet it's compulsive viewing. It's the only film really challenging '12 Years a Slave' for the Best Picture win at the Oscars. I personally think it's the better of the two films and will be watching closely to see if it can get up. It really is a must see.",9,4,6,16 February 2014
Lone Survivor," Great film with a dreadful opening scene that lets it down
","When a film begins with how it ends there has to be a damn good reason for it to have done so. The best way to use it is like 'The Hangover' did, where it implies something, sets up the story and also sets up the mystery. 'The Hangover' used it perfectly, 'Lone Survivor' used it very poorly and it is one of the few faults I could find with this movie. The reason it was a problem? Because it takes away the suspense from a number of scenes that would occur later on. If someone could explain to me a valid reason they chose to put it there I would happily listen. Until then though I think it was major mistake.That negative aside though, this is pretty fantastic film. It holds nothing back. For a 'True Story' it is particularly brutal and some of the imagery is quite shocking to watch. It was filmed immensely well and did a great job of putting you in the character's predicament. The best thing the film has going for it is that almost every character feels vulnerable. It feels like anything could happen at any time (and it often does). It is unrelenting in that sense. There is a lot to like here and this is certainly a must-see if you haven't already.",8,1,3,6 May 2018
Wind River," A captivating masterpiece
","I'll start this review by admitting I wasn't the biggest fan of 'Sicario' or 'Hell or High Water'. I appreciated them for what they were and admired the quality with which they were made, but I certainly didn't fall in love with them like the general public seemed to. So my anticipation for 'Wind River' wasn't exactly sky high, but I saw that it had a very high rating on IMDb which left me mildly excited. Then for the first 10-15 minutes of the film I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It seemed very similar to 'Hell or High Water' in the sense that the production of the film was terrific, yet the actual substance of the story seemed lacking. However I was very wrong. After about the 15 minute mark the film kicks into gear and from that point on it one of the most captivating film experiences I can remember.The dialogue in the film is exquisite. There are countless lines spoken that you actually have to stop for a second and appreciate how profound they are. Also the structuring of the story is quite brilliant. The transitions of the stages of the story are effortlessly simple in their explanation (whilst being effortlessly complex in nature) and make it so very easy for the audience to follow along and appreciate the things that truly matter.Of all the impeccable elements this film possesses though I have to say it may just be the performance of the cast that are the highlight. The whole cast are superb, however Jeremy Renner is next level (and Elizabeth Olsen isn't far behind him). I've always been a fan of Renner, but I would have to say this is his finest performance to date. He is enthralling to watch and creates a character for the ages. Olsen also thoroughly impressed me. She had a very different type of role, yet she still managed to absolutely nail it. She is a very underrated actress.'Wind River' is nothing short of a masterpiece and if you have even the slightest hesitation towards seeing it for whatever reason, please ignore that feeling and go see it. You won't be sorry you did.",10,4,13,6 September 2017
Darkest Hour," Proof that a good enough character can almost entirely carry a film
","Of all the Best Picture nominees for the 2018 Oscar ceremony 'Darkest Hour' was the one I expected to least enjoy going in. Now, I haven't seen them all yet so I can't comment on how close that was to being true, but what I can comment on is the fact I enjoyed it much more than anticipated. The film holds very little in the way of interesting concepts to me, yet it was able to catch me off guard by just how fascinating this Winston Churchill bloke really was. I can't see the film having any chance of winning Best Picture. It is simply too generic and character based to pull off that feat. The nomination itself is about right for the credit it deserves. One award I can see it winning though is Gary Oldman for Best Actor in a Lead Role. He was simply fantastic. He became Churchill. I'm a big Oldman fan and I often had to remind myself it was him in there, based on both the look and character traits he managed to pull off. I would call him all but a lock to win the award.The film is really just there to characterise Churchill. As a film itself it doesn't really have much to offer (the reason I can't see it winning Best Picture). It is basically a very well executed vehicle for Oldman to ride in. That being said punchy dialogue and terrific performances pave these cracks and the end result is a pretty watchable two hours of film.",7,0,3,26 February 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A real let down
","Usually I wouldn't give a moments thought to watching a 'Star Wars' spin-off movie, but I had heard great things about 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' and that, coupled with the death of Carrie Fisher, was enough to get me along to pay my $20 to see it. In hindsight, I probably wish I hadn't bothered. As a kid I loved 'Star Wars'. I watched all the films and had all the toys and costumes. It fascinated me. Then I went off it altogether (mostly because I went off sci-fi as a genre completely) for the next 20 years, until recently I saw 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and it had more of an impact on me than I expected it to. I started thinking about it again and running through all the story arcs and characters. I wouldn't say it had me hooked again, but it certainly had me interested. Now, I fear 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' may have done enough to quash that interest again.It just didn't do anything for me. I kept hoping a character I knew and was familiar with would pop up, but it just took so long to happen, and even then the cameos were brief and fairly forgettable. The characters didn't have much going for them at all. Felicity Jones in the lead role completely lost me. In contrast to Daisy Ridley who blew me away in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', Jones did nothing more than bore me. They were quite different characters in a number of ways, but at the heart of things they were meant to be someone you could root for. One achieved this, the other did not.The humour in this film also did not work. A lot of jokes were attempted, mostly by the character of 'K-2SO', but almost all of them fell flat. This was quite the opposite to 'The Force Awakens' where a large majority of the jokes were landing. The character of 'K-2SO' was clearly based, at least in part, on 'Sheldon' from 'The Big Bang Theory', however it seemed they didn't quite know exactly how to right for that kind of character. The idea was a decent one, the execution just wasn't there.I think the thing that's making a lot of 'Star Wars' fans enjoy this is the nostalgia factor. Getting to see 'Darth Vadar' again, all the intertwining stories relating to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' and a rather timely and sad cameo right near the end are making people think they like this more than they actually do. It's a harmless film, but it certainly has no place in the IMDb Top 250 movies list.",5,6,12,30 December 2016
Passengers," Good, but doesn't take enough risks
","I have to say I liked 'Passengers'. I wasn't too sure what to expect going in. I like the two leads enough (I don't love Chris Pratt but I can tolerate him and appreciate his charm at times), but I wasn't sure how much this was going to be about them, or how much it was going to be about a sci-fi story that just happened to feature them. I think they got the balance about right. There's actually a real character study in the story. There are some (one in particular) very complex decisions that the characters have to deal with and sort through and the ramifications of those are fascinating to watch. While at the same time I really enjoyed the sci-fi side of things. The concept was an interesting one and the complications that arose made for interesting viewing. There's some terrifically balanced writing featured in this film.My only problem with the film is that it didn't dare to be great. There was an ending which I actually expected to happen, that would have made this movie great in my opinion. If Chris Pratt's character 'Jim' had in fact died and then Jennifer Lawrence's character 'Aurora' had been faced with the same decision he had been faced with earlier in the film, I think this film could have gone down as something very special. The fact that I suspected this ending might be the case during the film, and was still willing to accept it as great if it did turn out that way, shows just how strong of a piece of writing it would have been. Unfortunatey though it was not be. And while this film is well made and a fun watch I fear it will fall into the forgettable category for not having the guts to do something more than a cliché Hollywood ending.",7,2,4,12 January 2017
Argo," Affleck continues his good form
","The television show 'Family Guy' once made a joke inferring Matt Damon did all the work towards 'Good Will Hunting' and Ben Affleck did none of it. With Argo, Affleck proves (if he hadn't already with the likes of 'The Town' and 'Gone Baby Gone') that he's actually very switched on indeed as to what makes for a good film. He has received seven very well deserved Academy Award nominations for Argo, and only time will tell how many of those it wins, but at this stage it is odds on to win Best Picture.Argo is set in revolutionary Iran, 1980. It follows a secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of Iran led by Affleck's character Tony Mendez. It is based on a true story. Affleck gets the feel of the 80s and the location just right. The story flows exceptionally well and has the audience captivated throughout. The final 20 minutes or so are incredibly tense and brilliantly filmed. The editing is as sharp as you could ever hope for.The amazing story always takes precedence and the actors are allowed to thrive amongst that. Affleck is commensurable with his usual performances and his laid back style fits in well here. But the star for me was Oscar nominated Alan Arkin. The man has an unbelievable amount of charm about him. It doesn't matter whether the joke he's telling is hysterical or a complete dud, he'll make it work. But he's not limited to telling jokes. You want him on your side, that much is for sure. Bryan Cranston is Hollywood's go to man at the moment. He can do no wrong, and Argo is no exception. Long may it continue because the man is an acting phenomenon and an Oscar nomination can't be far away for him. The rest of the cast support brilliantly and their Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards was as deserved as you'll ever see.Hollywood and The Academy love a film about a film, as seen last year with both 'Hugo' and 'The Artist'. And while Argo doesn't do this anywhere near the extent those two films did, I still think it'll be enough to win the Best Picture award. Naming the film 'Argo' (the title of film within a film in the movie) is rubbing this in everyone's faces a little for my liking, because it doesn't actually have that much to do with the story, but this is forgivable because it could be said this was a centerpiece for the events in the story. Don't get me wrong, it'll win it for a lot more reasons than this (most are mentioned above), but this will be the clincher. Argo is what I would call a solid film. It tells its story in a very neat and polished way, which is a good thing. Affleck can feel robbed of a Best Director nomination in my opinion, but I'm sure he'll be satisfied with the success it has had throughout award season.",8,1,3,13 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp Perfect!!!
","Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.",10,4,7,9 September 2004
Green Room," So much to like here
","As a rule I try to know as little about a film before watching it as possible. The genre and synopsis are typically all I like to know (with rare exceptions where I'm so pumped for a film I can't help reading every detail months in advance). So going into 'Green Room' I knew very little about what to expect. What I had imagined in my mind, and what it actually was like, were two very different things. The film caught me off guard. Not just how good it was, but the impressive style director Jeremy Saulnier managed to achieve.I hadn't seen either of Saulnier's previous two films (although I see they are both rated very well and intend to check them out) so I was clueless to just what a talent he is. The film does a tremendous job of creating a low-budget, creepy feeling, horror vibe, using almost unknown actors and a simple (but very effective) plot. There is no better way to do horror than this. There's nothing scary about watching big stars with CGI in every scene and a cliché plot line. Watching unknowns in realistic, yet exaggerated, situations on the other hand can be very unsettling.There's a lot of gore ('Saw' would be proud) and violence a plenty. The story never stalls and there's some really great dialogue in the mix. The thing that proved to me though that Saulnier has a massive future in the film making business is the final scene with the dog. It's rare to see something so moving and beautiful in any modern film, but to find it in a horror movie is just stunning to me. A wonderful movie that is so much more than just your average horror movie.",9,6,14,3 July 2016
The Babadook," An incredibly well made film that is a lot more than what it first seems
","'The Babadook' really isn't that scary, which is usually the number one requisite for a horror movie, but this is a rare case of that not really mattering because there is so much other brilliance to the film. It starts out like any other horror movie and I thought to myself here we go again, but by the halfway point I was beginning to realise this was something quite unique and fascinating. The acting was fantastic and there was clearly more going on that what immediately met the eye. A couple of months back I was reading which actresses were expected to be given Oscar nominations and someone mentioned that Essie Davis in 'The Babadook' was the best performance of the year and that they were disappointed she had no chance of being nominated. I thought to myself how bizarre it was to hear of an actress in a horror movie being given such critical acclaim. The genre just typically doesn't allow for such a thing. Now I understand however. Her performance is incredible. Every aspect of her acting was impeccable right throughout the film. No matter the mood of the scene, she nailed it. Another very fine Australian performance from 2014 to go with Sarah Snook in 'Predestination'.It's a great film. Seeing it is only half the fun though, because reading all the theories and small details that may have been missed is a real pleasure. I can't remember a horror movie that seems to have created this much debate and discussion in..... well, possibly ever. The annoying son was an absolutely marvelous creation of a character because it really did put us in the position and understanding point of view of the mother throughout. Had director Jennifer Kent been able to accomplish more frights (the scenes were there to do it) I think this had the potential to go down as an all-time classic. Unfortunately though some people subscribe to the theory that if they pay for a horror movie, they want to be scared. Those particular people also generally don't care too much about underlying messages or metaphors either. A shame because if everyone took the time to appreciate this for what it really is I think they would find some real joy.",9,18,39,11 March 2015
Us," Peele proves 'Get Out' was no fluke
","My initial rating for 'Us' after seeing it was a 9/10. Then I started doing some reading about it and watching explanation videos on Youtube. It reached a point where I simply could not deny this film a perfect 10/10 rating. This level of genius is unparalleled (so to speak). I simply could not believe how many little details Jordan Peele had thought of and included in the film. On the surface this might seem like a simple little horror movie with a twist. It's never that simple with Peele though. Everything is a metaphor and a brilliant one at that.Peele's style is also incredibly unique and fresh. The way he shoots certain scenes, the camera angles, the character looks, the set designs, the choice of music (particularly brilliant and important in this film) to name a few. In only his second film he has distinguished himself from every other filmmaker. Quite amazing when you think about it like that.Even if you aren't interested in all that jazz and just want to watch this as a straight up horror film and not think too much about it, you're still going to have a great time. This film is genuinely creepy for the majority of the runtime. I think that would be a shame though. I would highly recommend after you're finished with this film exploring as many fan theories and opinions as you possibly can. It leads to hours of fascinating entertainment and makes you appreciate the film on a whole other level. 'Us' is a masterpiece not to be missed.",10,7,23,28 March 2019
The Danish Girl," Redmayne and Vikander deliver incredible performances
","There's no denying 'The Danish Girl' is carried by the two lead actors. It's on OK script dealing with an interesting subject but these two, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander, delivering the performances they did certainly helped the watch-ability factor. The subject of transgender people isn't always an easy one to understand or deal with and I suspect people who didn't like the film likely fall into the category of finding it an uncomfortable watch. The main reason it's uncomfortable is because Redmayne is so damn good. The man can act, there's simply no denying that.Getting one Oscar worthy performance in a film is an accomplishment, two though is astonishing. Both Redmayne and Vikander have been nominated for Academy Awards, Redmayne in a Lead Role, Vikander in a Supporting Role (the latter's category being quite contentious considering she had more screen time than Redmayne did). The scary fact is that they're both good enough to win too, or at least they would be if a certain man called Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in the running. DiCaprio has the award locked up sadly, but I truly believe Redmayne was better in his actual acting performance. DiCaprio is getting the award for the sacrifices he made for his role and the commitment it took. However, if you took two average movie viewers and gave them no background about either actor and asked them which performance they found better, I think a very high percentage would pick Redmayne. He won last year with an incredible performance and deserved to do so again this year in my opinion.Vikander on the other hand I suspect will win, and deservedly so. This was the first film I had ever seen her in and she blew me away. Her presence on screen was immense and her performance showed all the layers of a truly great actress. The only thing marring her nomination is whether she should be in the Supporting Actress category or not. I would have to agree she probably should not have been. I kept thinking to myself she must somehow exit this film halfway through in order for it to classify as 'Supporting'. However she did not and while I hate to take away from an undoubtedly great performance, it is hard for others in the category to compete when they are getting much less screen time.The film wasn't nominated for Best Picture despite being right up the alley for that type of nod. The story isn't entirely fact based and is more a work of fiction based on true characters, which may have hurt it. It also, as previously mentioned, isn't the easiest subject for everyone to stomach. All things aside though I'd have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than a few other films that did get a Best Picture nod. No one's complaining too much that it's not there it seems, but make no mistake, it's a fine film.",8,1,2,19 February 2016
The Girl Next Door," Gives you a real shock!!!
",Right up until the moment it turns quite serious this just seems like your average romantic comedy. But all of sudden without any real warning it becomes serious and throws you right back. I think it was quite a clever technique used by the director because it certainly stopped me from drifting away as I tend to do in movies like this. The rest of the movie is quite good delivering a good moral and a nice little twist at the end. The acting was above par on the whole and the movie moved around constantly not allowing itself to drift which most romantic comedies tend to do.So overall worth checking out but don't expect to be left breathless after wards (maybe if anything from Elisha Cuthbert).,8,6,9,12 January 2006
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Ferrell's career continues to slide
","Age has really caught up to Will Ferrell unfortunately - and I'm not in any way talking about his looks. I'm talking about his acting ability and his ability to be funny. The man was almost indisputably the funniest person working in Hollywood a decade ago. These days he can go an entire film without getting a single laugh out of me. It feels like he plays it incredibly safe these days, preferring to lean on PG-13 movies and safe scripts. I understand it's a very difficult time to be a comedian with the world being so easy to offend right now, but I really wish people like him would just ignore that noise and get back to making the fabulous movies that he was in the 2000s.Looking past the comedy, the movie didn't work for me as a narrative either. It was extremely clunky. There were many many scenes that could've (and should've) been left on the cutting room floor. Ferrell wrote this himself, and he's actually written some very fine scripts over the years, but this was not one of them. It felt like a kids movie, aimed at adults.Everything that was great about 'Pitch Perfect' in terms of combining heart, humour and fun was missing here. The music was actually okay and probably the strongest part of 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga'. There were some catchy singles along the way that were a pleasure to have replace the clunky dialogue. Rachel McAdams actually went a long way towards saving the film too. She gives her best in every scene, despite her clearly knowing some of the things she was being asked to do were ridiculous and not going to come across well onscreen. It isn't enough to save this mess though. I can't recommend this one.",5,4,8,4 July 2020
Knives Out," Wickedly smart, with characters and performances to match
","There are so many things I love about 'Knives Out', but possibly the one I love most is that it proves if your story is strong enough then you don't need gratuitous action sequences to pad the run time and keep the audience entertained. 'Knives Out' has one brief car chase that doesn't have a lot put into it (even the characters reference what a terrible car chase it is) and that's it. The rest of the movie is just the story unfolding. And yet it is so gripping that it is one of the best paced films of 2019.The cast in this movie is incredible. It is all-star and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. I have to give special mention to Daniel Craig though. I haven't often liked Craig's performances outside of the 'Bond' series, but here he is truly fantastic. The accent he chose to go with took a little adjusting to, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine his character without it. He was a pleasure to watch on screen.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Every detail is laid out masterfully. It's a movie you could watch 100 times and you'd still be picking up on new things. Add to that the dialogue, the characters, the foreshadowing and the humour it manages to extract and you have yourself one incredibly fine film.",10,7,18,4 December 2019
The Irishman," Well made but overly long and lacking memorability
","I can't remember the last time I watched a movie as long as 'The Irishman'. They just don't make films of this length any more. Mostly that is because audiences don't have the time or patience for it, but I think it is also because it can take away from the film. I feel that once you start approaching the three hour mark (and in this case going well over it) you start to lose some of your power. There is less impact and punch in the product you are providing. Shaving an hour off 'The Irishman' and just leaving in the necessary bits could have made this a whole lot more enjoyable of an experience.The film uses de-aging technology on its actors, and though it is very well done, it is also quite distracting and I found it took me out of the movie a lot of the time. As good as it was, it was still noticeably creepy how people looked at times. There was a woman early on who I thought was straight out of a horror movie the way it made her look. Also there was a scene where De Niro is kicking a man outside a grocery shop and it was about as poorly filmed as you will ever see in a modern film. You could visibly see the kicks missing by a mile. How this wasn't picked up on I'll never know.The film is extremely well made from start to finish, but I don't feel it has the same memorable moments that the likes of 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' had. Those were films with moments that you could never forget. I didn't feel that way about 'The Irishman'. It was good to watch once, but I suspect it will be entirely gone from my memory by tomorrow.",7,3,8,11 December 2019
Point Break," Very little going for it
","I once told someone that I hadn't seen the original 'Point Break' film, and they acted with utter shock and disbelief that a film-buff like myself would not have seen that film. It appears that the original has quite a passionate fan-base. I decided to skip the original and just go straight to the remake. It would appear that may have been a bad idea. This was a pretty dreadful effort at making a film. The problems were abundant. The acting is bad, the story is bland and completely lacking in creativity, and the dialogue is poor and often feels like it has been written by a teenager (at best). It also spends too much time simply trying to look impressive, with long drawn out 'action' sequences of people surfing or free-diving. The only problem with these sequences is that nothing of any importance is actually happening during them. We might as well be watching clips of random people doing the same things on Youtube. I get the strong impression that this film is very far from the quality of the original, because there's no way the original could have achieved a cult following if it was as bad as this film.I actually really wanted to like 'Point Break'. It started out alright in the first ten minutes or so, while the story was being set up, and I thought to myself wouldn't it be a nice surprise if the critics were completely off base with this one and it turns out to be a diamond in the rough. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Soon after, the whole thing fell apart and never recovered. It's a shame too, because it sounds like a lot of effort went into making the film. It took nearly a year and they traveled all over the world in an extensive shoot. If you're going to go to that kind of effort, you're going to want a script that justifies it. That wasn't the case here.",4,1,1,12 December 2016
Creed," A wonderful experience
","I love a movie that inspires you to do something, anything great in life. That amazing feeling when you're still sitting there watching the movie and yet it's making you, in that moment, want to go out and achieve your own greatness. 'Creed' is one of those movies. Admittedly I'm not the biggest fan of the 'Rocky' series. I saw the original perhaps when I was too young to appreciate it, and consequently never saw any of the sequels until this one came along. People often rave about the inspiration this series is capable of giving you though and I fully believe it. I've heard clips of some of the speeches and seen particular scenes and the whole thing is just perfect for anyone needing that extra piece of motivation to get out there and achieve their own dreams.Sylvester Stallone has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards and rightly so. This is only his second nomination for an Oscar for acting, the first being for the same character way back in 1997 in the original 'Rocky'. On that occasion he lost to Peter Finch for his performance in 'Network'. On this occasion however, I suspect he will take home the award. He couldn't have asked for a better script to work with (ironically this is the first film in the 'Rocky' series that he has not written himself). All the story lines and dialogue are set up perfectly for him and he delivers an impassioned performance that only he could have. He gets a rough time now and then for his acting performances, so it's nice to see him get some well deserved accolades as well.'Creed' was not nominated for Best Picture but I wholeheartedly believe it should have been. With the extended number of nominees in the modern ceremony it's almost criminal to not have it there. It's well acted, wonderfully written, emotional, inspiring and compelling. What more could you ask for? Nonetheless people that see it are enjoying the hell out of it and that says a lot too. I'm led to believe there are more sequels to come and to that I say bring them on. I won't be missing any more films in this series.",9,1,4,17 February 2016
Troy," Spreads the Excitement out Well!!!
","This is the second best history movie ever made (behind Titanic of course). The story line was exceptional and the scenery was amazing. This was a movie that got away with being long by keeping up enough interest throughout the movie by not thrashing it in some parts and leaving a blank in other (in other words it spread the excitement out instead of squashing it all into some scenes and leaving parts o the movie boring). Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were very well cast. Especially Brad Pitt who was brilliant. This movie is absolutely perfect for anyone who has an interest in history because it's not all about getting every fact of what happened exactly right, it's just trying to tell an interesting story. Marvelous.",9,1,3,9 September 2004
Spotlight," A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture
","Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the 'X-Factor' going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that 'in between' state, which may have hurt him.There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset.",7,67,117,31 January 2016
500 Days of Summer," A film that will stick with you long after the credits roll
","After finishing '(500) Days of Summer' I thought to myself what an incredible film it was and decided on rating it a 9/10. Then as the night went on the film just wouldn't leave my mind. Little thoughts and moments kept creeping back into my mind for further analysis. After a few hours of this I realised I had no choice but to boost it to a 10/10. Any film that can stick with you this powerfully is a pretty unique and special thing.The film has narration (some of the best narration of I've ever heard in a film) and one of the first things said is a warning to the audience that this isn't a love story. At that point I realised this film was going to be something special. It wasn't going to play to the Hollywood formulas that we have all become so accustomed to. In fact it's one of the more unique films I can ever remember seeing. And what makes it so unique is that it isn't afraid to be raw and powerful and let you personally feel the pain the characters feel.There's so much to love about this film. The soundtrack is amazing, the humour is genuinely hilarious, the chemistry between the two leads, the brilliant story structure that lets you compare the good times to the bad and the unique scene ideas like Reality vs Expectation that can be analysed time and time again. If you are like me and never saw this when it first came out please take the time now to do so. It is so very worth it.",10,0,4,16 September 2019
Deadpool 2," Now THIS is how superhero movies should be made
","I'm the first to admit I am not a big fan of superhero movies. They take themselves way too seriously, are all the same and are way too easy to write (because whatever power a hero needs to get the job done, he always conveniently has - something that is wonderfully made fun of in 'Deadpool 2'). The only superhero movies I have ever really enjoyed were 'Batman' when Christopher Nolan was making his trilogy. But now even 'Batman' films have become terrible sadly. That's why 'Deadpool' is such an incredibly refreshing character. Not only does he not take himself seriously, he knows how stupid all the others are for doing just that and makes fun of them accordingly.This movie is flat out hilarious. It's one of those films where you aren't finished laughing at one joke before the next one is being thrown at you. It's actually exhausting (in a good way). I lost count of all the great quotes in this film. I kept thinking to myself that I need to remember them, but eventually there were just too many to do that. The writing on this movie is phenomenal.If 'Deadpool' were a serious character I would be very frustrated by the fact that he basically can't die or be hurt (what would be the point right?). But because of the way the film sets itself up, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. In fact it just leaves more time for hilarity. The soundtrack on this movie is also amazing. 'Deadpool' is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and if you're like me and don't like superhero movies usually, give this one a try. I suspect you'll be pleasantly surprised.",9,3,3,22 September 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Waititi's style works perfectly to fix the usually bland marvel universe
","I'm certainly not big into marvel movies, but this one I had to see considering it was directed by New Zealander Taika Waititi. I'm a big fan of Waititi (as a film director at least, he could use a little work as a human being on occasion). I like the style he brings to his films. He combines heart and warm-feeling with hilarious comedy in a seamless manner. I think it was a brilliant decision to bring him into the marvel universe because if there's one thing these films have all been to date it's dry and uninteresting. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is anything but.The film moves at a break-neck pace. The action begins immediately and it never lets up. At times it feels more like a comedy film than any other genre. Every character (barring perhaps Cate Blanchett's) provides endless humour that is all perfectly written and delivered. The funniest character of all 'Korg' was actually played by Waititi himself.Even though I understood almost none of the storyline references (I still couldn't actually tell you what Ragnarok was by the end of the film I'm embarrassed to say) I still managed to have a great time and enjoyed this film even more than I expected to. If Waititi directs any more marvel films I'll be there on opening night happily.",8,2,5,27 November 2018
Resident Evil: Extinction," The best one yet
","During the first two 'Resident Evil' films I had a tough time working out exactly why I wasn't enjoying them as much as I could be. It took this third chapter 'Resident Evil: Extinction' to clarify for me exactly what the problem was. The first two did not feel like movies. They felt like a video game - only without the fun of actually playing it. Like watching a friend play while you just sit there I suppose. No fun at all. Now, in this third addition to the series, they've worked out that they're actually making a FILM series here, and the finished product is all the better for it.This one plays out more like a horror film for the most part, compared to the originals which I would classify more as actions. There is still plenty of action in this one, but the overall theme does seem to be to give the audience both a fright and an excess of blood and gore. The zombies in this one were a lot better done than in the first two films as well. Finally they were genuinely menacing and had a cool look about them too.There's a tremendous amount that this film got right. It learnt from the mistakes of the previous films and it made corrections where necessary. Who said sequels can't be better than originals? 'Resident Evil: Extinction' proves that this is certainly not the case.",7,0,1,24 January 2017
The Prestige," Simply magic!!!
","Could it have been better? No. Not in my opinion. This film will take you on a magical journey through the behind-the-scenes of magic. Throughout that journey it is secretly building up to something that will make you shiver, make your jaw drop, but most of all make you absolutely love this movie. There's no stage where you find yourself wondering can I continue to sit through this, even at 130 minutes. Every scene, every line, every last word is acted out perfectly. I'm not sure whether it was the brilliant acting or simply the gripping, intriguing storyline itself which made this film so enjoyable throughout and not just when the twist is eventually revealed. Possibly it was both.But needless to say from my point of view this is an obvious must-see. Some people complain that movies with twist endings are often boring for 95% of the movie, and possibly they're right. But that's what makes it so good that these types of movies are taking a step in the right direction and will hopefully only get better as time goes on. If indeed they do then there are going to be some future movies to look forward to - because this one is a cracker!",10,2,4,7 January 2007
Ready Player One," The Da Vinci Code using pop-culture
","I love pop-culture references. One of my favourite television shows 'Family Guy' is riddled with them and I love each and every one. I didn't have a lot of buzz or excitement going into 'Ready Player One' (I wasn't even intending to see it in theatres but found myself with an opportunity to do so and decided to take it). I'm not a massive sci-fi fan and the nearly 2 and half hour run time had put me off. I have to say though I ended up having a pretty bloody good time.I would describe the film as a futuristic 'The Da Vinci Code' only using pop-culture instead of ancient history for the clues. Sound fun? Yeah, it does to me too when I put it like that. The film is certainly at its strongest when it's trying to be a puzzle, and at its weakest when its trying to be an action movie. That was the only real downside of the movie for me was that the third quarter fell into a bit of a trap of forgetting to be fun and became a little tedious. It's a great looking film though from start to finish. There are some really fun scenes too, where if you've seen the film in question you'll likely have the time of your life. It's a pretty damn fun ride for the most part and a film I can see most people thoroughly enjoying.",8,0,2,3 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Not Tarantino's best overall but the second half is incredible
","I had heard mixed reviews from people I knew going into 'The Hateful Eight', some saying they were let down, others saying it was Tarantino's best yet, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Then, at about the one hour mark I realised I wasn't enjoying myself as much as I usually am in one of his films. Something just wasn't right. I'm always very patient with dialogue in his movies, because even if it has nothing to do with the story at hand, it's still usually a pleasure to listen to. However I wasn't finding that on this occasion. It didn't feel like a Tarantino film. I was aware that he had, at one stage, decided to pull out of making it due to the script being leaked, and I wondered whether in fact this had been an attempt to not make a film based on what was a weak script. Then the second half kicked in and things got a whole lot better.The first half, in comparison to the second half, of this film are chalk and cheese. As soon as Samuel L. Jackson's character begins a certain speech, about a certain thing he did, things ignite and never cease. Sadly a lot of damage has been done to the reputation of the film in that first hour and a half or so, but things just become so damn entertaining after that that you're almost willing to completely forgive. When Tarantino is in form there is no filmmaker in the world that can match him. He has an ability to do things that if any other filmmaker in the world tried they'd seem ridiculous. However when he does them, they seem unbelievably stylish and effective. He also always gets the best out of his actors.Jennifer Jason Leigh has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance here and rightly so. Of the main characters she's the only female in a very violent and ego-driven lot, and yet she completely holds her own. To be honest I was barely familiar with her as an actress at all before this, but now if I see her name in something I will take note. I don't think she quite has a shot at winning the award but her nomination is undoubtedly thoroughly deserved.Nearing three hours in runtime is really testing the patience of a lot of film goers in the modern day. There are filmmakers who can pull it off without you even noticing this is the case, and Tarantino is one of them, but 'The Hateful Eight' is not. There is not enough happening in the first half to keep the audience's attention and while the pay off is unquestionably brilliant, Tarantino is good enough to make the set-up equally entertaining. He failed to do that here. That really is the only criticism though of an otherwise incredibly fine film. As always I can't wait to see what the man does next.",9,1,5,14 February 2016
Molly's Game," Only thing letting it down is some sloppy poker writing
","I'm quite the poker enthusiast myself so 'Molly's Game' was always going to be up my alley. It's very rare that I don't enjoy a movie based around the game ('Rounders' in particular is up there with my favourite films). That being said I can still judge the films critically (maybe even more so than usual) and find flaws where they lie. 'Molly's Game' isn't perfect but it's pretty damn good. Firstly, the cast is in incredible form. Jessica Chastain gives one of her best performances to date. She plays the role perfectly and was entirely believable as the head of a poker ring. Not one member of the cast lets the production down though and that's why almost every scene is this movie is phenomenally strong.The writing is also superb, for the most part. The film did have a very similar feel to 'The Social Network' about it. The dialogue is always powerful, entertaining and thought-provoking (and somehow all at the same time). There was also a great rhythm found. The story covers three timelines and intersects each one of them wonderfully.The only thing letting the film down is the writing of the actual poker itself. It's very clear in certain scenes that Aaron Sorkin wasn't exactly sure of the game and its intricacies. Things like suddenly taking a rake halfway through a giant hand (there would be outrage), a player folding the nuts (the best hand possible in poker - which no player ever, regardless of how bad they are, would fold in Hold-em) and a raise by $200,000 when the bet was $300,000 (no game in the world would allow this), are just sloppy and really bring the film down. I read that Sorkin even went to the extent of having professional poker players as the extras because he wanted everything to be as authentic as possible. If you're willing to go to that extent then surely you get an expert to check over the writing of the poker scenes? Otherwise though, this is a very hard film to fault and one I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Note: I would recommend reading up a little about the story and who the particular characters being referred to in the film are before you watch it. It adds a lot of enjoyment when you know.",8,3,6,22 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Not Best Picture worthy at all
","Every year I make a point of watching each of the Best Picture nominees for the Academy Awards before the ceremony airs. And every year I'm astonished at some of the films that are considered to be the 'best' of the previous year. 'BlacKkKlansman' is a prime example of this. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a good film? Sure. But is it a great film and one of the eight best released in 2018? Not in this lifetime. Sadly I understand a lot of politics come into the Oscars and I think that is a large part of what is at play here. This is a heavily politically driven film that tugs at the heart-strings of just the right type of people that dominate Hollywood and the Academy. For that reason it gets a nomination. Not because it is a great film.Adam Driver has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards as well. This was also a baffling one to me. His performance is good and highly watchable, but he never blew me away by any stretch of the imagination. I kept waiting for him to be given one big scene he could really shine through and knock the audiences socks off with, but it never came. A really bizarre nomination from the Academy I would find it extremely surprising if he got the win for this reason.The film was actually very similar to the 2016 film 'Imperium' starring Daniel Radcliffe. Obviously it didn't have the twist of a black man being behind the infiltration, but a lot of the actual person to person undercover scenes were very similar in nature. I think I enjoyed that film more though because it was more interested in telling you a story, instead of ramming a view down your throat. I also thought the real-life footage shown at the end of 'BlacKkKlansman' was cheap and out of place. A very tacky decision by Spike Lee to throw that in there. I miss the days from the 90s when if a film was nominated for Best Picture you could be assured it was a truly brilliant film. This film doesn't even compare to those.",6,123,217,18 February 2019
Final Destination 2," Creativity Outstanding!!!
","The originality and creativity of this film are just outstanding! When I walked out of the theatre I had that tingly feeling you get when you know you've just seen something special. The ideas of how the people died were just amazing. My personal favourite would have to be the one where they've just had the car crash and that girl is sitting in the front seat of the car waiting for the fire man to get the door off so she can get out. From the crash there had been a big, sharp, metal poll sticking through the back of her seat which had just missed her head so she's thinking she's real lucky. But then when the fire man gets the door the air bag comes up and when they pull it down you just see the poll sticking through her head. That would have to be one of the most original scenes ever made!",10,0,1,6 September 2004
Black Mass," Not as crisp as Scorsese could have managed but still entertaining
","'Black Mass' is a fascinating story that falls into the trap of having too much to say and not enough time to say it. The original cut was apparently close to 3 hours but was cut down for pacing reasons. Some films can get away with this, others struggle to. This is the latter. The story feels rushed and clunky. There isn't that patience that the likes of Martin Scorsese bring to the table. There isn't that classic scene ('How am I funny?') that people will remember and reenact for years to come. There isn't even always an explanation as to why a character has disappeared from the story. Having made this point though - that really is the only problem with an otherwise very fine film.The acting is terrific across the board. Johnny Depp is obviously the stand-out in the lead role. He's as captivating on screen as always and I suspect he will receive an Oscar nomination when January roles around. The only thing that will hold him back from winning it is a lack of punchy dialogue. Every scene he is in is brilliant but feels too similar to the last one. The rest of the cast are faultless and make every scene very enjoyable.It's a brutal film with no holding back on the violence whatsoever. Director Scott Cooper, in only his third film at the helm, does an adequate job but I can't help but wonder what someone with the class of Scorsese could have done with this script. It's a solid movie there's no doubt about it, but it won't go down in the history books as a classic which is a shame because the story had the potential to do just that.",6,1,1,15 October 2015
Suicide Squad," A hot mess
","For the last 12 months it has been almost impossible to dodge the juggernaut of a film that is 'Suicide Squad'. It really has been everywhere. The trailers appeared to pretty much give away the entire film, and I was hoping that I was wrong and it still had a few tricks up its sleeve, however this was not the case. If you've seen the trailers you almost know the entire basic story line. This was very disappointing. Also, almost every clever one-liner (barring a few exceptions from 'Harley Quinn') was included in the trailers. Bring back the good old days of 'The Dark Knight' where the trailers were unbelievably epic, and yet gave away almost nothing of the plot. The movie itself it also a bit of a mess. There are so many characters, yet none of them are that strong. Quantity over quality never works, especially when it comes to movie characters. A breakdown of a few of the characters:Harley Quinn - undoubtedly the star of the show. Margot Robbie really impressed me in this role. She was far and away the best written character and a terrific performance made her an absolute winner. She alone pretty much carries the film and keeps some quality about it.The Joker - one of the greatest characters of all time, almost completely wasted. Did the writers understand absolutely nothing about what makes The Joker great? He's not supposed to be telling jokes, but he is certainly meant to make you laugh. Jared Leto does his best, but this part of the movie was a complete miss. Never once did he make me laugh, and never once did I find him overly menacing. A horrendously mishandled chess piece that goes a large way towards why this film is so bad. Heath Ledger must be turning in his grave.Deadshot - yuck. What an awful waste, of an already one-dimensional and useless character. His power is that he is an accurate shooter? Are you kidding me? Could there be anything more boring? Then add in that Will Smith is still trying to come across as the hero/good guy the entire movie and you have another horrible element to this film. I was really hoping Smith was going to take a leaf out of Dicaprio's book when he did 'Django Unchained'. Sadly, it's nothing like that and is simply annoying.These are the only characters really worth mentioning. The rest are purely there as filler. The DC universe is in real trouble at the moment, after the abomination that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', and the reason is simple: they aren't hiring the right people to make these films. What made 'The Dark Knight' so unbelievably powerful and successful? Christopher Nolan was at the helm. Now not every film maker is capable of the standard Nolan can produce, but what irks me is that nobody is seemingly even trying to imitate what he achieved. These films are so far from what he was producing that it's ridiculous. 'Suicide Squad' has almost no story. That's unfathomable in this day and age. DC has a lot of films coming up in the near future, and unless they get a film maker on board capable of turning the tables around, they're all going to be equally as dreadful as this. It's now or never for change, but I fear they have no intention of changing.",4,68,133,4 August 2016
Life of Pi," Quite the discussion raiser
","Just before I left to see Life of Pi my cat had found a mouse in the garage. It got me to thinking about the food chain and the frailty of life. But it also got me to thinking about why we value one life so differently from the next. Something as simple as the size of an animal can determine how much we care for that animal. No one gives it a second thought if they find a mouse dead in the street, but if they come across a giraffe or an elephant, (which probably have a fifth of the character) in the same state, it'll bother them to no end. It was an amazing coincidence for me then, when the movie had an element of these themes about it too. It took it even further making us question one's faith and even questioning the legitimacy of what we've just seen.Life of Pi is told from the point of view of the main character Pi Patel, many years after he was the survivor of a sunken ship and spent 227 days at sea accompanied by a ferocious tiger. The story has a lot of similarities with Cast Away, the most obvious probably being the sole relationship of an unexpected companion. In Cast Away it was a volleyball, here it is a tiger. While it is a necessary plot device to have these 'characters' in the story, it is also fascinating to see just how close and reliant the main character becomes on them. Something that I imagine would actually genuinely be the case if you were in that situation.The cinematography is astonishing throughout and seeing it in 3D (even though I'm not the biggest fan of the format) was just the icing on the cake. This is a tough film to review because it leaves itself very open to interpretation. The message boards are flooded with questions and every answer to them is unique and of a slightly different opinion. Ang Lee has done well in keeping this a talked about and debated piece of cinema. I have my own opinions on most of the questions too, but to throw them out there now would be wrong. It could lead you to come to a conclusion you wouldn't otherwise have come to and it would also ruin a bit of what is fun about the ending. Go in with an open mind, form your own opinions and then take the time to read some other people's ones too. Life of Pi can be as much fun after the film as it is during.",7,4,8,18 February 2013
Lost in Translation," A beautiful film that respects its audience more than most
","I like reviewing older movies because I feel more comfortable doing spoiler reviews for them, and with 'Lost in Translation' that gives me a lot more freedom to talk about the things I need to. Prior to watching this I really felt like I could fall anywhere on the spectrum with this one. I had heard a lot of people over the years say it was boring and unwatchable, while others said it was a masterpiece. Having a very slow and eventless film is a risk, because if the charisma of the characters doesn't come off then you have nothing to fall back on. Luckily for 'Lost in Translation' it worked perfectly. The result is an incredibly unique and beautiful film.I saw someone make quite an insightful observation about the film that I really liked, and so I will borrow it, that Tokyo is almost like a third main character in the film. I've seen a lot of films set in foreign cities, but in this one the fact that they are in Tokyo plays into things big time. It adds immensely to the lonely vibe that the film so expertly creates. It's such an immensely foreign culture that it really feels like it is these two against the world.The thing I love most about the film though is that it can mean different things to different people. The spoiler I wanted to talk about was that in the two lead character's final interaction Bill Murray's character whispers something unheard by the audience into Scarlett Johansson's ear. I love the respect this scene pays to the audience, but I also love that it implies what was said should be different to everyone depending on their view of the film. This isn't a conventional love story, and some could even go as far as to say it isn't a love story at all. Where you fall on the spectrum should determine what you think was said. That instantly became one of my favourite scenes I've ever seen in a film.The people who find this film boring, or uninspired I don't think are missing the point - I simply think they can't relate to it. I believe this is a film for anyone who has ever been lonely, or travelled abroad and felt aggressively homesick, or been in a bad relationship. If you don't get it that is probably a good thing and you should feel blessed in a way. But equally if you can understand the beauty of this film then that is a unique gift all of its own. I loved this film and if you haven't already seen it, I would highly recommend doing so.",9,2,2,2 June 2020
Interstellar," Not Nolan's best work but still light-years above the average
","I can't help but miss the early days of Christopher Nolan's work with the likes of 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' where his movies were purely mind-blowing, incredibly original masterpieces based purely around story. His Batman trilogy was astonishingly brilliant in it's own way and 'Inception' combined an amazing story with stunning visuals. With 'Interstellar' though I feel he's gone too far towards relying on the visuals and not enough story driving it along.Don't get me wrong, there's a story there, but it doesn't feel original enough by Nolan's standards. The 'space mission to save Earth' thing has been done and whilst admittedly Nolan puts his own twist on it, it still can't be saved from feeling like we've seen it all before (some parts even as recently as Alfonso Cuarón's 'Gravity' just last year).I wouldn't say the near 3 hour run time flies by, but Nolan paces his films so well that he can still get away with a much longer run time than others. 20 minutes probably could've been shaved off this one though to be honest.It's Matthew McConaughey's show from start to finish and we all know he can carry a film. He's as charming as ever and really shows his emotional range at times too. He just seemingly can't make a bad film at the moment. Anne Hatheway on the other hand was a real let down for me. After being absolutely brilliant in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises' as Catwoman I hoped she would equally blow me away in this one. It wasn't to be though. I felt she was flat and almost complacent in the role. The rest of the cast are strong in their performances without anyone stealing the show.It's tough to hold films like this against Nolan. He's got the budget these days and God knows he's earned it. Whether we'll ever see films like 'Memento' from him again remains to be seen. But what I really hope is that he doesn't fall back and become reliant on the big budget carrying his films. I really do trust he's better than that. What project he signs onto next will be very interesting indeed.",8,0,5,13 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," How can one film be so perfect in so many ways?
","Last year I had the unfortunate duty of giving the eventual Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards a negative review. 'Moonlight' was not a movie that sat well with me. Now this is a very early call on my part but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm writing the review for the 2018 winner as we speak, and I can assure you it's not going to be a negative review this time around. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the finest film I have watched in a long time. How a film that can break your heart so effortlessly can also manage to be so damn funny and charming at the same time is simply beyond me. It shouldn't be possible. However writer/director Martin McDonagh proves that it can indeed be done.Frances McDormand in the lead role is astonishingly good. There are many cries at the moment that there aren't enough movies with females in the lead role. Well showing them that the best film in 2017 has one is a good place to base your argument from. She is so good that you can feel her broken heart and soul almost as if it is your own. Sam Rockwell is also nothing short of superb. He remains one for the best actors working today and I only wish he would take on more work. Finally Woody Harrelson is fantastic in the film. He seems to be so endlessly charming in every film he appears in these days. Was that always the case? Regardless, he is a brilliant edition to this film.Be prepared going into this movie is all I will say. It will take you on an abolsute rollercoaster of emotions. There are times where a hilarious line is delivered and you might actually stop and question yourself, 'Am I allowed to laugh in a film this dark?' I know the Oscar nominations aren't even out yet, but I am extremely hopeful that this is the final film read out on ceremony night. Great films deserve great recognition.",10,11,21,30 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Plays it safe and is consequently very forgettable
","I feel like if a film is 140 minutes long then it needs to have a lot of depth and layers to it. 'The Dark Knight' for example had about 5 or 6 story lines that all could have justified their own movie. 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' felt like it had one story line that it just expanded out and bloated to the run time it got. I expect more from a 'Star Wars' movie. I feel like I should almost be overwhelmed by the end and need to see it again (and possibly again) to fully appreciate it. That was not the case here.The films looks great. There is one location that features at the beginning and end of the movie that really looked especially terrific and perfectly sets the mood for the scenes that take place there. There are also some decent action sequences sprinkled in here and there, but they do feel too few and far between. The humour in the film rarely lands. It always feels very forced and just isn't particularly funny.My biggest gripe with the film though would be how safe it decides to play it. I understand this is a Disney film and so it has be pretty formulaic, but come on at least through us a bone or two. There is no element of this story that I will remember a week from now. Nothing that blew me away or made me give it a second thought. I got chills when 'Star Wars' flashed up on the screen at the beginning of the movie and that was literally the highlight of my entire viewing experience. This isn't a bad film, it's just an extremely bland and uninspired one.",6,11,34,19 December 2019
American Sniper," Much of the same but still very classy
","Jack Reacher once said 'it's never the same with a sniper out there'. I imagine that to be a very true statement. 'American Sniper' is the true story of Chris Kyle a Navy SEAL sniper who went on four tours of duty to Iraq and set records for the amount of people he killed during his career. Now, instantly you can imagine the amount of political debate that is going to take place over a film like this. Do you portray him as an out and out hero? Do you portray him as a hero, but also put a negative spin on his actions? Tough decisions for the filmmakers to make right out of the gate. Did they do a great job with them? I'm not entirely sure.Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead role for this film. The Academy loves an actor who transforms oneself for a role and that's exactly what Cooper did putting on an enormous amount of weight. He also had to learn a Texan accent which I felt he absolutely nailed. The thing that's going to stop him winning is probably more the film than anything. It just never gave him that one scene to blow us away with. Still he was incredibly consistent throughout the film and being nominated three years in a row is no mean feat.The film's biggest downfall is that the first four-fifths of it feel like we are just going through the same experience over and over. Not a lot is really being added to the story along the way. We understand what is going on and it just feels a bit like it's being rammed down our throats. Clint Eastwood has proved himself to be a fine director in the past. I noticed in the trivia section an interesting comment relating to Chris Kyle's real life father telling both Eastwood and Cooper (who also produced the film) that he would 'unleash Hell' if his son's memory was disrespected in the film. I can't help but wonder whether that had any effect over certain scenes they might have liked to include along the way. There's no dodging the fact that people with certain political agendas are not going to like this film.That being said it has been nominated for Best Picture and while it has next to no chance of actually taking home the award that's still an impressive accomplishment. It seems the Academy likes to put at least one war movie in the the category each year ever since the success of 'The Hurt Locker'. The movie has only been out a few days and already it seems to be stirring up a lot of debate, as was probably to be expected. I know I plan to go and read up about the real life events and do some fact checking against the movie to see what was included and what wasn't. All that aside though it's a pretty good watch for the most part.",7,4,19,18 January 2015
Lion," A powerful and emotional experience
","Foreign films can sometimes be a trying experience. They can be hard to relate to and appreciate, often through no fault of their own. So when you come across a foreign film that features none of these problems, you know it is something special and must be excellently made. 'Lion' is certainly one of those films. It has deservedly been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and while I don't expect it to compete for the actual win, its still good to see a film like this get the recognition it has earned.Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman have also both been nominated for Academy Awards in supporting roles. Both were very strong in their roles, without perhaps ever blowing me away. It sounds like Patel fully immersed himself in the role, and the only thing holding him back was probably a couple of very strong scenes that he could show his true acting talents off in. He was strong in every scene he was in, but nothing that was overly memorable. Kidman probably falls into the same category. Consistently strong, but never gets a chance to completely show off the vast talents we all know she has.The film is very different from what I was expecting going in, however I would have to say that that turned out to be a good thing. The way it went about telling the story actually worked very well. There is a lot of emotion behind the story and the characters, and the fact that this is based on a true story is nothing short of heart-breaking. There's also some terrific pacing throughout and it all results in a fantastic final product. A film not to be missed.",9,0,1,1 February 2017
Gone Baby Gone," A book adaption done perfectly
","I wish more films were made like this these days. This was Ben Affleck's cinematic directorial debut and you could tell he put his heart and soul into it. It helped that he had a great base material to work with, but converting a good book into a good movie is still never an easy feat. Affleck nailed it.The acting he gets out of his cast is phenomenal. There is not a weak performance anywhere in this movie, and the main cast are incredible. I'm surprised there weren't more Oscar nominations forthcoming for them.This is a very twisty movie that always keeps the audience guessing and unsure of what is coming next. The ending is fabulous too. Over ten years later and it is still being debated to this day. 'Gone Baby Gone' is a brilliant film not to be missed.",9,1,1,2 September 2019
The Lost City of Z," Needed more screen time in the jungle
","For some reason at the moment I'm right into movies set in the jungle of exotic countries. I'm not sure the reason, perhaps I'm craving an exotic adventure for myself. Whatever it is though it's got me watching every one of them I can find. I had been meaning to get around to 'The Lost City of Z' but the runtime of two hours 20 minutes had me a little bit sceptical. The pacing of a film with that length needs to impeccable otherwise it can drag on and become a real chore. I finally got around to seeing it though and what I discovered wasn't a bad film, but it certainly wasn't as enjoyable as I'd hoped for.I'd hoped for a film much more like 'Jungle' starring Daniel Radcliffe where they enter the jungle, the action begins and then never lets up. Instead I found it a very frustrating and choppy film. Every time the action was just starting to begin they'd suddenly cut back to civilisation with them out of the jungle and the boring set up nonsense would start again. The film is undoubtedly at its strongest when it is set in the jungle.It sounds like there was a hell of a lot of adversity during the shoot. I commend the cast and crew for committing to actually film in the jungle. It sounds like it was bloody awful at times. There's some very strong dialogue throughout the movie that helps pave over a lot of the cracks. There are unquestionably better jungle set movies out there that I would recommend checking out before this one.",6,0,0,21 March 2018
American Hustle," Focus too much on characters, not enough on story
","The Academy must be full of some very strange people. Every year they seem to love the mediocrity Hollywood spews out and completely ignore some of the brilliance that presents itself. I hear the process is all very political and I quite believe it. I did not enjoy 'American Hustle' much at all and yet there it is with 10 Oscar nominations and probably third in the running to win Best Picture.I read something very interesting in the trivia section: According to Christian Bale much of the movie was improvised. So, during the shooting of the film he noted to David O. Russell, 'You realize that this is going to change the plot greatly down track.' To which the director replied, 'Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it.' I think the above is why I didn't like the movie. Russell completely sacrifices the flow and entertainment of the story just so that his actors could have a playground to present their characters on. The best directors don't need to make this sacrifice. It must be said though that with back to back films of his getting nominations in all four acting categories at the Academy Awards more and more actors and actresses will be lining up to work with him.Of the four that were nominated I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the best. She just doesn't know how to give a bad performance that girl and it's impressive. In 'American Hustle' she was probably playing a character suited to a slightly older actress, and yet that only occurs to you as an afterthought because she plays it so damn well. Christian Bale and Amy Adams were excellent, and slightly lower down the chain for me was Bradley Cooper. His felt the least Oscar-worthy of the four for me.Con man movies can be so much fun like 'Ocean's Eleven' but Russell has just managed to suck all the life out of this one. You can't do a movie like this without some kind of twist (the good ones have more than one), and there is a minor one in 'American Hustle', but it feels so phoned in and predictable that you can truly see how little effort was put into the story on this one. Very disappointing.While watching this you can't help but compare it to 'The Wolf of Wall Street' (or the other way around depending on which you saw first). They have a lot of similarities and have obviously been released around the same time and are contesting for the a lot of the same awards. But one of them is infinitely superior to the other. One has a run time of 180 minutes but feels like it barely lasts an hour, while the other runs 138 minutes but drags on and on and on. Martin Scorsese has shown David O. Russell up big time this year.",4,9,16,24 January 2014
Fargo," Not entertaining!!!
","It's pretty clear to me that you have to know a lot of the ins and outs of movies to enjoy a Coen brothers movie. But unfortunately if you don't your left bored and bemused. Now I can appreciate this movie has some top-notch acting. Not many will deny that, but there are a lot of movies out there with fine acting. So it needs something else which apparently this movie has, but as someone who just purely wants to be entertained and left thinking 'wow', I was let down. Nothing shocked me, the ending didn't give me goosebumps etc. There were scenes (such as the one where the female cop talks to her old Asian friend from school) that I can't for the life of me work out why they needed to be there.So if you've been to film school or just simply have good knowledge of how a movie should be then by all means check this out and enjoy, but otherwise I recommend you stay away.",7,2,4,2 July 2006
Nightcrawler," Captivating viewing
","At times 'Nightcrawler' is like watching a 'Best of Cops' episode. Two hours of non-stop action filled with brilliant characters and fascinating dialogue. Dan Gilroy wrote an excellent script and then finished it up with an equally impressive directing performance. But the real star, thanks largely in part to Gilroy's character creation, is Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role of Louis Bloom. From the moment we lay eyes on him we are hooked in and he never lets us go. Definitely his finest performance to date and I suspect an Oscar nomination could well be on the cards.There twists and turns left right and centre and never a dull moment. Everything feels original (how refreshing is that), yet I wouldn't be shocked to learn that 2012's 'End Of Watch' (also starring Gyllenhaal) had some influence on this because some scenes come across very similar. Both are very fine films. There's a nice touch at the end where we are treated to a shot of the Hollywood sign amidst an ending that's anything but 'Hollywood'.",9,1,2,13 December 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Clever, funny and fun
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into 'Popstar: Never Stop Stopping'. When it comes to Andy Samberg I find his music very funny, but his comedy styling and acting are not so much to my taste. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself having a very good time with this film. Right from the start it was genuinely funny and the music was catchy and hilarious in only the style that 'The Lonely Island' can achieve.There are an enormous amount of celebrity cameos, all of which are cleverly done and seem like the person really bought into it. The story, while a playoff of Justin Bieber obviously, is actually really investing and well structured.When it comes to comedy I find it's almost always a case of simply asking yourself, how funny was it? In the case of 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' though it feels like there were more layers to it than that. You can appreciate the music, the story and the send up of Bieber. I don't think this did overly well at the box office (was it marketed very well? I never heard about it until well after it was released) which is a shame. I would recommend giving this one a look.",7,1,2,17 September 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," A theatre experience like no other
","When I first heard about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being released as a movie, despite loving Queen, I had no intention of going to see. However I got invited to see it and agreed to do so. I then watched the trailer and did a little research into it and started to get the feeling I was going to have a truly great time with this film. Sure enough I got into the cinemas and ten minutes in knew that I was in for a very special couple of hours. What an incredible ride this film was. It felt like having a front row seat to the life and performances of Freddie Mercury. I find it is often the films you are reluctant to see that turn out to be the best ones.Rami Malek in the lead role absolutely captivated me. From the look, to the voice, to the little things like the way he held himself. It was all perfect. I can't remember the last time I watched a performance without a thought regarding the Oscars going in, and by the end knew that that person was going to be in running.The film takes some creative liberties and changes things around here and there to make things work. I was okay with that though. They needed to get everything into the film and did that adequately. The pacing of the film is great, the music was used perfectly and there's no real lull in the story at any point. This was one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've ever had. A must-see film.",10,4,8,2 November 2018
Bird Box," A well-made, creative and tense little film
","It's rare that a simple Netflix film blows up as much as 'Bird Box' has. It is everywhere at the moment. Everyone is talking about it, memes are everywhere on social media and the consensus seems to be that it's a pretty good film. And I would agree with that. It is a pretty good film. Not earth-shattering or game-changing or possibly even that memorable. Just a very solid, well-made, extremely watchable and enjoyable little film.The film is told in two timelines. There is the here and now where Sandra Bullock's character is trying to lead two children down a river to safety, and a flashback timeline showing the origins of the event that has taken place. Obviously, without me even having to point it out, the flashback scenes are by far the most interesting part of the story for the majority of the film. There's an amazing cast on show, every character is unique and fascinating in their own way and even though the majority of it takes place in a single house, it is never boring for one moment.Films like 'A Quiet Place' and 'Bird Box' being huge successes in 2018 leads me to believe we will see more of this type of horror in the future. It's creative, reasonably original and fun to watch, so I say bring it on. 'Bird Box' is an excellent film, however I would advise you not to buy in too much to the hype beforehand and make your own judgements on the film. Enjoy.",8,2,6,2 January 2019
Baby Driver," Stylish, charming and fun but not naturally so
","I've always liked Edgar Wright's films without loving them. They're always stylish and fun but also lacking something for my liking. 'Baby Driver' is no different. No one could argue just how stylish this film is. It oozes charisma and charm just from this alone. Then there's the tremendous cast and the spectacular performances Wright gets out of them. Kevin Spacey, in what may turn out to have been one of his final roles, was his usual superb self. Ansel Elgort has even been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. Jamie Foxx is also one of my favourite actors working today. The charm that man possesses is almost second to none.What held me back from loving this film though (and most of Wright's films I suspect) is that they sometimes feel like they're trying too hard. I often compare them to Quentin Tarantino's films. Both make quite different films but have a similar method at the same time. In Tarantino's films the style and charm he manages to achieve seem so natural and like there was no other way that scene could have gone down. With Wright's films it feels the opposite. It feels like they achieve it, but far from naturally. I also had trouble buying the love story in this film. I think a little more effort could have been put into making sure the audience understood why he loved this woman so much. Definitely a fun watch, make no mistake about that. Even bordering on a must-see film, but it's still far from perfect.",7,2,3,13 January 2018
Justice League," We may never get a good Batman movie again unfortunately
","I always knew going into 'Justice League' that I was going to have problems with it. Why? Because the concept itself is flawed. The basic premise is that almost none of these characters (other than Batman of course) are strong enough to justify their own movie, however all put into one movie they should be fine. Only that doesn't really stand to reason. All that means is that we are getting less screen time for the characters that actually deserve it.'Justice League' has a ridiculously weak villain. 'Steppenwolf' couldn't be more boring or one-dimensional. The villain needs to be the strongest part in a film like this otherwise everything just feels completely pointless. Like what are they really fighting against? Nothing feels menacing or genuinely threatening. None of the main heroes had to sacrifice anything in order to conquer evil. Compare that to 'The Dark Knight' where the Joker literally pushed Batman to the edge in every way. Batman lost everything in order to save the day. What an incredible film that was. Compare that to 'Justice League' and you'll realise just how bad this film really was.The only real bright spot I could see was the character of 'Barry Allen'. He kept me laughing and nailed it with almost every one-liner he had. Having said that I didn't come to this film looking for a laugh. So while it was a nice bonus, it really doesn't help the quality of the film very much. The one-liners by the other characters were particularly weak I thought. Some very lazy efforts by the writing staff. Sadly, I fear the days of good Batman films like 'The Dark Knight' trilogy may be done and gone. They seem to have gone in an entirely new direction with the characters and that is very disappointing to see, because it is the wrong direction plain and simple.",4,1,2,25 December 2017
The Village," Great Directing, Great Acting, Brilliant Movie!!!
","The fact that Sigourney Weaver had nightmares for two weeks after she read the script of this movie shocked me because it simply wasn't that kind of movie. It wasn't made to leave you having nightmares or lying in bed awake for the next two weeks. The bits that were meant two be scary were there just to give you an instant shock. What this movie was obviously trying to achieve was leaving you thinking about that little parts and whether or not they added up to the storyline. The storyline itself was stunning and original. M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent, brilliant and original writer and director and the fact that he has cameos in all his movies is another original thing that he does which I think is very clever. He's not at all a bad actor either. The best part about him being in the movie is that he can do it exactly how he wants which no actor could do. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was perfect and the trivia that the role was written for him was something I could believe. Sigourney Weaver nothing special from her, didn't stand out. Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent in her blind woman's role although it was quite hard to catch on to the fact she was blind at the start. William Hurt was without a doubt the second best performance in this film by a mile but the stand out for me was Adrien Brody playing the retard. After seeing this performance I can't wait to see him in his next big role movie King Kong. All in all an outstanding movie that is well worth it's money and much much more.",8,0,0,20 September 2004
The Revenant," Beautiful but not for everyone
","Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed last year's Best Picture winner 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' has returned with his next film 'The Revenant'. The films couldn't be further apart in nature. I remember saying when I reviewed the former film that it wasn't going to be for everyone, and despite the films being worlds apart, this fact remains the same. 'The Revenant' is a beautiful film to look at, but it's a tough film to sit through. There's a pretty amazing true story being told here, but it's being told in such a slow, drawn out way that it lost a lot of impact for me. The buzz around town is that the time may finally have come for Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for his performance in 'The Revenant'. Personally I would be disappointed if this turns out to be the case. Don't get me wrong he delivers a very fine performance here. But of all the charismatic, layered performances he's given over the years, this was not his best work. People will justify it saying the filming conditions were immensely tough and that he put in the hard yards for the role, however the I believe any actor given this role could have come up with a very similar performance. There was nothing DiCaprio did here that no one else in the business could have pulled off. That hasn't been the case in other roles he's nailed.Be prepared going in to 'The Revenant'. Be prepared to be very patient. It's a long film with not a lot happening for the most part of it. The flaw for me was how much time was given to each aspect of the story. The survival aspect takes up 95% of the time, which granted was a great way to show just how harrowing of an experience it would truly have been and the determination it would have taken, and the 'revenge' aspect is just rushed in at the end almost as an afterthought. For mine the ratio needed to be closer to 80-20% for the sake of an audience who are demanding a more satisfactory ending.",6,8,19,23 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," Dry but Spielberg puts his stamp on it
","It's so nice to watch a director who's completely in charge of whatever it is he's making. Even if the end product isn't perfect or to your liking, you can still appreciate that you are watching a master of his craft at work. Steven Spielberg will always be one of those directors. It helps he always works with an incredible team and has amazing actors at his disposal to direct, but the fact remains his name alone is always a stamp of quality. 'Bridge of Spies' isn't perfect, I have very little interest in the Cold War, the story itself within the war did very little for me, and yet it was an absolute pleasure to watch. A sure sign of class. The film has been nominated for Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. I think the nomination surprised some as it wasn't Spielberg's finest work, and it was missing some of the 'neccessaties' when it comes to getting a nod, like a compelling love story (you could say there was one but you'd be stretched to do so). Films that are considered lucky to get a nomination are never any shot of actually winning the award, as they are just supposed to consider themselves lucky to be there in the first place. So sadly you won't be seeing 'Bridge of Spies' take home the award. A well deserved nomination nonetheless.Also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is Mark Rylance. Rylance blew me away. He has an amazing ability to appear as though he's not trying in the least bit, and yet at the same time completely steal a scene - even from the likes of Tom Hanks. The Coen Brothers, along with Matt Charman, wrote some terrific and Oscar worthy dialogue for him to deliver admittedly, but it was no doubt him that brought those words to life. Everyone is going to have a tough time knocking Sylvester Stallone off his perch for the award this year but if anyone can do it I believe it's Rylance.The only thing really holding it back from being great is that it's a touch dry. I never felt any emotion towards any character throughout the entire film. That, along with the fact that there is very little humour anywhere in the mix, can make it a tough watch at times. The quality though makes it worth the price of admission. Nothing is done half-heartedly, the sets are astonishing, even set on the actual bridge the events happened on. Hanks is his usual charismatic self and Rylance is in masterful form in every scene he's in. It's probably not one Spielberg will be most remembered for when we look back in 50 years, but I'm certain he'll still be proud to have it on his résumé.",7,1,3,11 February 2016
Split," A masterful showing with a final scene that will make your jaw drop
","In a Hollywood completely lacking in originality and creativity, M. Night Shyamalan remains a shining light. Say what you like about some of his films, but the man continues to put out original, thoughtful and sometimes brilliant material. There's no questioning he's gone through something of a rough spell after the incredible start he had to his career. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakble', 'Signs' and 'The Village' are all some of my favourite films to this day. Films like 'Lady in the Water', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' on the polar opposite end of the scale are completely unbearable to watch and deserve no praise at all. It has been a bizarre career to date containing the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows. 2015's 'The Visit' however was a hint that he may be righting himself again and now 'Split' has absolutely confirmed it. Shyamalan is back baby!I was completely hooked by 'Split' from the moment I first saw the trailer. What a brilliant concept that lends itself to so many possibilities and so much potential. James McAvoy in the lead role must not have been able to believe his luck when he was offered the part. A character with 24 different personalities - an actor's dream. I thought he was quite brilliant in the role too. He completely sold me on every personality he performed and brought a tremendous level of intensity to the role. The only problem with the film I could possible perceive is a slight lack in advancement of the story. Things can feel a little stationary at times with an almost two hour run time. Other than that though this is near perfect film making. All of Shyamalan's class as a film maker is on show. The opening scene is brilliant, the flashbacks are masterful and the final scene of the film will leave you shivering (if you're anything like me). The brilliance of that final scene is unlike anything I've seen in a very long time. Shyamalan is back and that is brilliant news for film lovers around the world.",9,8,24,2 February 2017
American Psycho," Not what the title suggests!!!
","I understand that instead of the Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th or Halloween type insaneness, the movies gone out to try and be clever. But maybe, just maybe it was a bit too clever. The title leads you to think you're in for a real gore-fest type massacre when really it's nothing like that at all. You have to stay on the ball and thinking throughout and that's not really what those kind of people like to be do. So I can see it losing a few fans there. Secondly for the people who do like to combine intelligence with gore, it may have taken the intelligence thing it has going a bit far, thus confusing people. No doubt there will be those people in the middle who it was just right for and that's great. But the question that must be asked is, is there a high enough percentage of those people? Personally, I was unsatisfied at the end. But it's the type of movie that if you took 5 people who'd just seen the movie, sat them down and asked them what they thought, they'd probably all give you a different opinion. Christian Bale truly is great in it, so no matter what I'd recommend giving it a go.",7,0,3,12 January 2007
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Not IMDb Top 250 material
","Call me old-fashioned or out of touch, but I guess I just want more out of my IMDb Top 250 (Top 65 in this case) movies. Listen, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a very well made and clever film, but come on. I kept thinking this movie must have an amazing twist coming up that turns an ordinary film into a work of genius (like 'The Usual Suspects'). It didn't. I felt a little ripped off.The movie looks great, has a great soundtrack and a clever concept. It's an immaculately put together package. But it never wowed me in way that I felt like I was seeing something amazing for the first time. Nicolas Cage was a great addition to the movie. He was probably my favourite of the voice actors. Otherwise I found the voice work pretty uninspired.I would have liked it to be funnier. It often tries for humour, but comes up short more often than not. I was looking for something more like 'The Lego Batman Movie' where you hadn't finished laughing at one joke before they were throwing another one at you. Listen this movie is fine, perhaps even well above average, but don't be fooled into thinking it is some kind of masterpiece.",7,0,3,22 November 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," We can all gain a little something from this one
","Every comedy has to have an element of drama, but not every drama has to have comedy. So combining the two, while leaning in the slightest bit towards the drama side of things is not easy to do. In 2011 it was 'The Help' and in 2012 it was 'Silver Linings Playbook' that did it best. On both occasions, a delicate balance was found and it makes for a rewarding watch. Here we have a fascinating love story, mixed with a family dealing with possible mental illness. Great, positive characters thrown into this situation allow us to feel what they are going through emotionally while still having a laugh throughout. And it is genuinely, laugh out loud funny at times.The story follows Pat who, after an 8 month stint in a mental institution, comes home to live with his parents. He is intent on reconciling with his wife, but things become complicated when he meets an interesting young girl by the name of Tiffany. Silver Linings Playbook has the rare distinction of having an actor nominated in all four acting categories at the Academy Awards. Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence and Jacki Weaver are the well deserved recipients of those nominations. Cooper was exceptional in the lead role. The evolution of his character, combined with his perfect balance of comedic timing and dramatic effect, make his nomination well deserved, although I feel he'll be hard pressed to take the award home. De Niro is equally excellent. It's great to see him in a role like this, where his true acting potential can shine through. Too often these days it feels like he's appearing in comedies. Lawrence is the best of the lot. She is simply captivating in her role as Tiffany. Her screen presence is immense, even overpowering De Niro in a particular scene they share. Put her in Goodfellas and she would've fit right in. Personally, I feel Emmanuelle Riva deserves to win Best Actress for 'Amour', but Lawrence has a great chance of snatching it herself and it would be well deserved if she does, nonetheless. Finally Weaver, not given a great amount of screen time, she thrives in the little she has. She has the ability to put the audience in hysterics with a simple awkward glance. Not a chance of winning but a nicely deserved nomination for sure.Silver Lining's Playbook reminded me a little of another film, and that film was 'Yes Man'. Both films have a similar underlying message and that is be positive and positive things will happen to you. It's a great message and one that we could all learn a lot from. I remember after watching 'Yes Man' going out and giving the concept of saying 'yes' to everything asked of me a go (not quite to the extent in the film, but enough), and I found myself doing some really amazing things with my time. Things I wouldn't usually find myself doing and it felt great. Over time I suppose that concept has slipped from my mind but Silver Linings Playbook brought it all back again because it's a positive, heartwarming story not to be missed. Watch the movie, feel the emotions the characters feel, listen to what they say, act how they act, be impulsive now and then and that $10 you pay to see Silver Linings Playbook might just be the best money you ever spend.",8,0,1,14 February 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," This is where Cruise belongs
","Tom Cruise currently has two movie series of which he is the star. There's the 'Mission: Impossible' series and there's the 'Jack Reacher' series. In the 'Jack Reacher' series he's about the only thing holding the whole show back. He's completely unsuited to the role and has destroyed a terrific character created by Lee Child in the books. However, in 'Mission: Impossible' it's quite the opposite. He's perfect for the lead role of 'Ethan Hunt' and plays him excellently. The suave, cocky, arrogant and intelligent character he's perfect for. The tough, large, physical, blunt and hulking one, not so much.'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is another fine addition to the series. Much like the 'James Bond' series, I find you have to keep your brain switched on the entire movie, otherwise you're likely to become completely lost to the plot and just what exactly they're trying to achieve in each scene. I did find this one was well explained throughout and therefore easier just to sit back and enjoy the action, which is a major plus. I liked the villain enough (nothing to stand-out, but he did the trick) and the support cast did their thing around Cruise adequately. Ultimately though, it was his show and did what he usually does in this series and carried things. There's still plenty of life left in this series I feel.",7,0,1,28 November 2016
Dunkirk," A great movie with some minor imperfections holding it back
","Every great director has to make a war film at some point. It's like a rite of passage to go down in the books as truly great. And finally it was Christopher Nolan's turn with 'Dunkirk'. I'll admit to being a little disappointed when it was announced this would be his next film, because it isn't playing to his biggest strengths. He's at his best when he's making a complex action thriller that is smarter than any other film out there, and requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate it. A war film is really just that, a war film. They're all different, but at the heart of them they're all pretty much the same (maybe with the exception of Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' which does stand out as genuinely unique). So I was disappointed by his choice of next film (we only get one from him every two years as it is), but was I disappointed with the end result? I'd have to say yes.Now don't get me wrong, 'Dunkirk' is an extremely fine film, but it pretty much proved my initial assumption 100% correct. It felt like anyone could have made this film. It's often been said that Nolan's one weakness is directing action, well there's a hell of a lot of action in this film. Maybe not action sequences as such, but still action. And while none of it came across that badly, nothing particularly stood out in that respect either. Also with the story being based around truth, his usual brilliance as a story-teller was somewhat hampered. He couldn't deliver twists and turns and moments of share brilliance that will leave your jaw gaping like usual. Those were the only real let-down aspects for me.As for the good stuff, man can he create some great characters. My personal favourite on this occasion was 'Mr. Dawson' played by Mark Rylance. Firstly, an exquisite casting choice. Secondly, just a trademark Nolan character. Brilliant in every way. Someone you instantly like, care for and have to know their fate. Also in typical Nolan fashion the pacing is incredible. The film never stops for a second. The 106 minute run time (admittedly short by Nolan's standards) absolutely flies by.When I review a Nolan film I hold it up to the highest standard, and so any negatives are simply because I know he is capable of perfection (he has achieved it in the past in my opinion with 'The Dark Knight'). Make no mistake, 'Dunkirk' is an exceptional film. But it is not as good of a product as this man is capable of delivering.",8,0,7,19 July 2017
The Intouchables," Another great French film
","My goodness the French are great at making films. They have this way of keeping everything so simple, and yet being endlessly complex and powerful at the same time. 'The Intouchables' is no exception. I've been meaning to see this film for a long time but just never got around to it. Finally it was playing on my flight to Bali the other day and I decided now was the time. I'm very glad I took the time to see it because it is a very fine film.The chemistry between the two leads (and to a lesser extent the rest of the cast as well who also did an excellent job) is what makes this film so special. Unfortunately the fact that the real life version of Driss wasn't black is a little distasteful. I think it is disrespectful to the real life person. If it were the other way around there would be hell to pay. This is one of the very few negatives I can aim at this film.The story is funny, charming, heart-breaking and joyous all at once. It is a great watch. I see that the American's have made a remake with Bryan Cranston (great casting) and Kevin Hart (not great casting - but hey, prove me wrong Kevin). I'm sceptical about seeing it but curiosity may get the better of me. 99 times out 100 though I would suggest people are better off just watching the original even if they're not a fan of subtitles.",8,1,2,8 September 2019
Dallas Buyers Club," Gripping story performed wonderfully by McConaughey and Leto
","'Dallas Buyers Club' tells the true story of Ron Woodroof and his efforts to get alternative medication to AIDS patients in America. He's an interesting character. His motives are never straightforward. Sometimes he seems like nothing more than an extortionist, and yet at other times he shows he has a heart. We are taken on the fascinating story of this man, performed brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey.McConaughey seems to cop a bit of a rough time in social media and television shows like 'Family Guy'. But he really seems to have hit his stride in the last two years. Every performance he turns out is memorable. He appears in two of the Best Picture nominees at the Oscars for 2013 (this and 'The Wolf of Wall Street') and is quite likely to take home Best Actor for 'Dallas Buyers Club' (ironically the only person challenging him for that award is Leo Dicaprio in 'The Wolf of Wall Street'). And deservedly so. It wasn't just his body transformation that was amazing (he lost 21kg) but his acting as well. A powerful performance.Jared Leto was the other stand out. I knew nothing about his role coming into the film, so I was quite taken aback when we were introduced to him. He also lost a lot of weight for his role. But more than that he was a scene stealer and nailed the character perfectly. The disappointment for me was Jennifer Garner. She had very little screen presence and turned in a pretty forgettable performance.'Dallas Buyers Club' doesn't tug at your emotional strings as much as I feel it could've and for that I applaud it. It isn't simply trying to make you fall in love with a character only then to take them away. It takes the high road and focuses on the story and what this passionate man did in an undesirable situation. A great watch.",8,2,2,1 March 2014
Saw III," Now I can die!!!
","This movie is simply pure pleasure from start to finish. Watching it all and trying to work it all out before the twist is finally delivered is exhilarating and then when it finally is delivered it will leave you breathless. Basically in my books it's the perfect movie - not a moment of dullness and then a twist. I was in heaven and I can imagine a lot of other people feeling the exact same way throughout the 2 hours. There was a scene at the start when even I felt a bit queasy, but after that there weren't too many really disturbing scenes (for Saw's standards anyway). This one definitely contains the best acting out of the trilogy and is quite possibly the best overall as well.Not for everyone, that much is for sure (my sister next to me all most passed out at the start), but if you think you're one who can handle the jandal, you won't be disappointed at all.",10,1,4,17 January 2007
The Conjuring 2," Can't live up to the powerful original
","Usually when you go to see a horror sequel it's the villain/monster that you're being treated to another viewing of. 'The Conjuring 2' is a rare exception where it is the protagonists who are the constant. Sadly, this equals less guarantee of quality, because it's unlikely that they are what made the first one great. 'The Conjuring' was a brilliant horror film. The intensity, story and thrills were all of the highest quality and the result was one of the finest horror films ever made. So the sequel had a lot to live up to. Could it do it? Not quite.The first thing you'll notice is an extended run time. 133 minutes is long for a horror movie. A lot of time is spent setting the mood, with a very patient build up taking place. For me this could have been cut back a bit, as it was a little slow at times and one or two scenes felt unnecessary. James Wan is a fantastic director who usually paces a film exquisitely, so I suspect this had more do with the script than anything else.The main thing it lacks that the original achieved so well though, is a genuine concern for the characters in the film. The spooky, middle of nowhere, atmosphere created in the original is nowhere to found here, and that takes away a lot of intensity from the film. The characters of 'Ed' and 'Lorraine' also feel too in charge this time around, and are portrayed more as heroes than regular people. This also goes a long way to destroying the level of discomfort the audience should be experiencing. There are some good frights here and there and some genuinely creepy visuals, but it all feels short of the high expectations the original created. And that sums it up in a lot of ways, it's not a bad film, it just can't live up to what we had all hoped for.",6,5,18,9 June 2016
Jackie," Uninspired nonsense
","The problem with 'Jackie' is that there is absolutely no hook. There's no aspect to the story that is worthy of being told. The JFK assassination is a fascinating event in the history of America, but that is not really what this film is about. This is simply about a grieving woman. There are millions of woman around the world grieving, but this movie deems one of them more important than the rest. Is it justified? Well, the movie certainly didn't lead me to believe so.Natalie Portman has been nominated for Best Actress in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards. She is the only good thing about this film. She nailed her portrayal and plays all the emotional scenes very well. Had the film been stronger I think she could have been a genuine chance of winning the award. I think she was stronger in her performance than Emma Stone, however the film itself will be seen as significantly weaker, and that will hurt her chances.The only people I can see getting any enjoyment out of this film are people who have a personal interest in the Kennedy family and the events surrounding that terrible time. For anyone else you will find yourself treated to 100 minutes of uninteresting dribble. If that sounds like you, go ahead and enjoy yourself.",3,4,6,11 February 2017
Tropic Thunder," Uniqueness pays off
","Tropic Thunder is quite a shock to the system because of its originality and consequently can be quite difficult to get your head around. On occasions I was unaware of weather lines were meant to be funny or not despite the fact that they very much were. The film keeps a sense of class throughout and never divulges into the silly side of things. Stiller does an excellently job as director and actor of keeping things as realistic as possible whilst still being extremely entertaining.The actors are put into a position where the best thing for the movie is that they be competing with one and other for the best performance. Critics and fans seem to feel it was Robert Downey Jr. who came out on top and I agree he was fantastic. But my choice would have to be Jack Black. He got the most laughs out of me and had me wanting more after wards. People weren't wrong about Tom Cruise's performance either, he was superb.Tropic Thunder gets the balance between action and comedy perfect and therefore appeals to a wider audience. It's obvious everyone involved is at the top of their game and you really can't go wrong when in this position. Without a doubt one to be checked out.",8,1,2,24 February 2009
Yesterday," A love story first and foremost
","Music based films are all the rage at the moment. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' did astoundingly well both with audiences and award ceremonies, 'Rocketman' seems to be a hit and now we have 'Yesterday'. 'Yesterday' is a little bit different in the sense that it is a fictional story which utilises the music of an extremely popular band from the 60s rather than just straight up telling their story. In fact this is one of the best ideas for a movie I can remember. The whole world forgets about The Beatles except for one person. The possibilities that lends itself to are endless.I didn't actually realise until after seeing the movie that there was only a select few (20 I believe) songs that they had rights to. That possibly explains a little why the film often feels more about the love story at its centre than the music itself. The love story was actually very well written (both characters were extremely likeable) but I did often think I would like to be hearing a little more music. Too often songs were cut short or were chopped around a joke relating to interrupting the song.The biggest flaw in this movie for me was the humour. Far too often jokes fell flat. The character of 'Rocky' was clearly designed as the comic relief, and the character was perfect, but the jokes written for him were not up to standard. It felt like they were trying far too hard. An obvious joke is never as funny as a subtle one. Ed Sheeran's involvement with the film was a master stroke though. They didn't over-use him and when he was on screen it was fascinating to watch. I had a good time with 'Yesterday' no doubt about it. I can't help wondering though if things were done a little differently whether this could have been a masterpiece.",7,0,2,28 June 2019
Resident Evil," The zombies let it down
","I was never really into video games growing up, and I'm still not today. So a series like 'Resident Evil' just completely passed over my radar. With the 'Final Chapter' coming out shortly though I decided to go back and review the series to see what I think of it. Going back 14 years when it comes to a CGI heavy film can be a dodgy thing to do. Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference compared to the quality being produced today, but it's certainly not distractingly bad. I quite like films that are set in a confined space with the characters having to either work their way to the centre, or find a way out. This is one of those films and most aspects of it are done fairly well. The one element (that happened to be probably the biggest of them all sadly) that didn't work was the zombies. Zombies are simply not scary, not visually impressive and not entertaining. They're still better than vampires, but they are not a strong thing to have as a heavy component of your film. Having never played the game I can't confirm how close this is in terms of being true to it. I suspect though that it's pretty close. A lot of scenes feel like they're straight from a game and you can even imagine yourself having to pass the level that the characters are currently on. Milla Jovovich plays the lead role well, but I hope in the sequels she evolves a lot. At times in this one she felt like just another member of the squad, and certainly not the main character. People to this day say are still waiting for a great video game adaption to come out. 'Resident Evil' is a solid film, but it's certainly far from being great.",6,1,1,6 January 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories
","Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.",4,37,57,6 May 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Clever Idea for a Movie!!!
","Excellent idea. Who ever wrote/came up with the story line should keep doing it because he must be pretty good. This movie is as good in entertainment as they come. When watching it you felt as if the movie was always moving it wasn't just floating around one area for ten minutes then changing scenes for another ten minutes. Ashton Kutcher was outstanding and surprisingly mature in the role of Evan. Apart from the obvious thing about time travel I couldn't find many plot holes either. It all seemed pretty clear cut even if you did have to think about it for an hour afterwards. Not necesserially for Ashton Kutcher fans because this is nothing like his other roles, but it does show he has great versatility.",10,1,3,10 September 2004
The Favourite," Engaging, well paced and well acted
","When I looked at the list of the Best Picture nominees at the Academy Awards this year I immediately spotted 'The Favourite' as the one I was least looking forward to seeing. I'm not a big fan of period pieces and neither the cast nor film-maker garnered much interest from me. As it turns out I was wrong to single this one out. It is a middling film on the list. Certainly not the best, however certainly not the worst either. I was surprised at how engaged I found myself with the story. The pacing too, while not lightning quick, did just enough to always keep me focused and looking forward to what was coming next.Three actresses from this film have been nominated for acting awards. Olivia Colman for Actress in Leading Role and Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone for Actresses in a Supporting Role (despite them both probably having equal or even more screen time than Colman?). Colman was pretty darn good I'd have to admit. She plays utterly miserable very well I'd have to say (that may be all I've ever seen her play come to think of it). It's hard to see her getting the nod though as she was never given one big scene to blow everyone away. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category so with performances as strong as Stone's and Weisz' I would usually have said they had a great chance of winning. Unfortunately for them the category is slightly stronger than usual this year though and so I can't see them getting the nod either.As for Best Picture, again I see it coming up short. While the film is good for what it is, it isn't going to be to everyone's liking. All a film can do is succeed at what it sets out to, however that isn't always enough to win an Oscar unfortunately. I loved that the film had an R rating. It added so many layers to the characters and made for a much more fun viewing experience. All in all 'The Favourite' is a well made film that you may just find yourself having a great time with.",7,4,7,24 February 2019
Foxcatcher," Dreadful and uninspiring
","It seems to me that director Bennett Miller got it all wrong with this one. There's an interesting story to be told here but instead he focuses far too much time on unimportant and frankly boring aspects of the story. I have read that the real John Du Pont was capable of far more outlandish behaviour than simply the murder he committed and yet, because I suspect Miller wanted the murder to come out of the blue and be a complete surprise, we see almost none of this. The audience is made to miss out so that the director can have his 'shocking' twist come to light. Furthermore, all of this is based on a true story so anyone who took a couple of minutes to look into what the film was about before going in is going to know what to expect anyway. And yet he has been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards (without the film even being nominated for Best Picture I might add). Lord help me.Both Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo have also been nominated for Academy Awards for acting in a Lead Role and Supporting Role respectively. Neither did a lot to earn their nomination either I must say. I suspect Carell has simply achieved his based on his 'transformation' that we all know the Academy love so much. No one could deny he looked and acted very differently to the comedic genius we all usually are treated to, but does that make the performance great? His face stole scenes but his acting certainly didn't. I would be very surprised to hear his name read out as the winner, in fact let's write it off completely - it won't happen.Ruffalo was better than Carell in that he really had no visual aids, but simply acted his socks off. The poorly written script really didn't give him a lot to work with but he did his absolute best with what he was given. His chances of winning are probably dented more so by the film itself than anything. If J.K. Simmons wasn't such an absolute lock though I think he may have been in with a chance.The film had real potential, but sadly the director and screenwriters were so intent on making sure this wasn't an entertaining thriller (that may have hurt its search for awards you see) that they managed to kill the watchability factor almost altogether. For a movie absolutely drowned in dialogue, none of it is in the least bit inspiring or memorable. Every character seems about as depressed as a human can possibly be in every single scene from start to finish. No scenes, apart from the murder scene and perhaps the mirror smashing scene, have any oomph or kick to them at all. All this equals a very tedious watch with minimal payoff. Very disappointing.",4,3,12,17 February 2015
28 Days Later...," Alright!!!
",Alright movie. Neither here nor there really. I would have to say though that it kept the excitement throughout the movie very well. I thought the acting was pretty good and they used my horror movie philosophy and didn't bring in any big stars. I thought that Jim could've been a bit more shocked when he had just got out of hospital at the start. It seemed as if he knew what was going on or something. The directing of the movie seemed poor from my point of view. At times it was hard to tell what was happening from the camera angles. Another thing that had me thinking was that when the infected people caught on fire they were fine and could still chase the uninfected but when they were shot a few times they went down. Also the ending was butchered. They could have done so much with that kind of a story for a twist at the end.,7,1,2,7 September 2004
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," They nailed it
","I think it says a lot about modern society that when I watch a film like 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' I am almost 100% on the ape's side. There is a character in this movie called 'Dodge' played by Tom Felton who may across a little unrealistic and overplayed to some. However let me assure you that there are more people like him in this world than it bears thinking about. At times we can be a truly despicable race that I am utterly ashamed of. This is touched on lightly in the film, but perhaps not heavily enough.This is a quite incredible movie. It took me a long time to get around to seeing it because I wasn't a particularly big fan of the original 'Planet of the Apes' movie, nor the remake. They didn't do much for me. This was a very different type of film. I tend to love origin stories. The way the character of 'Caesar' is handled in this film is incredible. I love that we see every stage of his development, and no matter what stage he is at or what he is doing at that time, we are on his side.The animation in the film is nothing short of brilliant either. I can't speak highly enough about the class it was handled with. The story works, and it leaves you wanting more (if I had seen this when it initially came out I would've been upset I had to wait 3 years to see the sequel). If you haven't seen this movie yet like I hadn't I recommend you get around to doing so.",8,2,3,6 May 2018
Legend," A missed opportunity
","The prospect of Tom Hardy playing one character in a movie is enticing, so the thought of him playing two had me licking my lips. Sadly the result isn't what it could have been. In the past I've found the films Brian Helgeland has directed to be misfires that ultimately had a lot of squandered potential. 'Legend' is no exception. Hardy is as great as he ever is, but the rest of the film is really lacking. You never know if you're supposed to be laughing or intimidated by the violence. Even the violence is often comical itself. While Hardy is great in both the roles he plays (espcially that of 'Ronald Kray') the script and directing really hold him back. Great roles demand great opening scenes where the character completely establishes itself and we are made aware of what we are in for the rest of the film. 'Legend' however is completely void of that scene. Also the narration by Emily Browning's character 'Frances Shea' does not work because nothing she says is the least bit interesting. I think they were trying to take a leaf out of Martin Scorcese's 'Casino' but it failed miserably.The film isn't completely awful, it simply isn't what it could have been, which is disappointing. There are some clever scenes here and there and the odd well timed bit of humour (mostly down to Hardy's delivery) but all this can't save it from being a pretty forgettable 131 minutes. I went in hoping for a brilliant cross between 'Goodfellas' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. What I got was closer to a very violent episode of 'EastEnders'. Very frustrating.",6,0,2,30 October 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," It's good, but it's not Top 10 on IMDb Top 250 good
","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and 'die' (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.",6,10,25,2 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Style can only carry a film so far
","I really didn't expect to dislike 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood'. It's a Tarantino movie so it is still well above the average film, at least in terms of quality of production. But to say it was a disappointment would be an understatement. All the great things that are apparent in every Tarantino movie were missing, at least for the first 2 hours of the film. The problems stemmed from the fact that this was a character study, rather than being plot driven. Tarantino is usually so good at combining the two together, so for him to completely ignore one of those elements is a real shame.The film is almost 3 hours long and it simply doesn't have the pacing to justify that. I lost count of the scenes where, after they'd finished, I thought to myself how easy it would have been to leave that on the cutting room floor. So many scenes were setting things up for later in the movie, which is fine and has to be done, but none of them had any creativity to keep them interesting. We simply had to listen to long boring conversations.Finally after a couple of hours a very intense and well-crafted scene involving Brad Pitt's character at a ranch happens. It's arguably the best scene in the film and all I could think was, where has this been? There is no doubt that Pitt and Leo DiCaprio carry this film big time. Without their acting talents this film would have been unbearable. Pitt especially was the best thing this movie had going for it. The film does its best to redeem itself in the final half hour or so, by then the damage was already done. This is my least favourite Tarantino film to date I'm sad to say.",6,20,33,16 August 2019
Gone Girl," Stays a touch too faithful to the book
","Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of the novel 'Gone Girl'. It's one of the best I've read in years and renewed my faith that it was still possible to write a clever, surprising and original thriller. Obviously having enjoyed the book so much I was glad to find out it was being adapted into a film. If at that point I had been asked the question, 'what's one thing you'd like to see changed from the book to the movie?' I would have said the ending.Now it's not that I didn't like the book's ending, it was simply a case of not being able to imagine that ending being satisfactory in the film version of the story. Doing some reading a few months out from the films release I was ecstatic to read in the trivia section on IMDb this: 'Gillian Flynn, author of the novel the film is based upon, wrote the screenplay with a different ending to keep readers interested in the film version, and viewers from getting spoiled.' I got straight to thinking what should be the ending and to my surprise I had a tough time coming up with anything at all, let alone something deserving of ending this wonderful story. Sadly Gillian Flynn must have found the same thing as me (and what I read in the trivia section must gotten lost in translation), because I was very disappointed to find out tonight that the ending really hadn't been changed at all.The ending aside however, this is a wonderfully made film. David Fincher always creates such perfect, seamless films that are a pleasure to watch and this one is no exception. I wouldn't say it's quite as dark as some of his previous work or as the trailers might have you believe, but there is one scene in particular that seemed to have a lot of the female audience members squirming in their seats. Those who have read the book will probably be able to guess which one it is.The acting is nothing short of superb. I would not be at all surprised if both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike receive Academy Award nominations for their performances. Affleck probably has the easier of the two roles but still manages to find that perfect balance between being an utterly unlikeable dirt bag and being the guy you're still rooting for things to work out well for in the end. I wasn't completely sold on Pike's performance until the final third of the film when she really kicked things up a gear and became mesmerising. It was the role of a life time and she nailed it.Overall 'Gone Girl' is a brilliant film but I can't help feeling that's mostly just because the book itself was so good. It just seems to me you're not getting a different enough experience between reading the book and watching the film. Other than that the only other thing I could fault it on would be the run time. Shaving 10-20 minutes off it may have helped appeal to a few more people. Those two points aside though it's a great ride and a title we'll hear mentioned a lot during award season.",8,3,13,2 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino as stylish and captivating as ever
","Quentin Tarantino, the man likes to push boundaries. Django Unchained is not an easy watch. Foul characters are many, taboo speech is thrust upon us constantly and violence is abundant. But all the while, it's just so damn stylish. Tarantino is in complete control throughout. He knows exactly what he's about in every scene and makes sure you always know you're witnessing one of his films from minute one through to minute 165 (yes, even during the credits he's still up to his old tricks).The story, set in 1858 (two years prior to the Civil War), follows a German bounty hunter who frees a slave named Django, and the journey the two take to free his enslaved wife. The brutality of the times is never hidden, or even danced around. We're shown it as it was and you have to admire that. The 'N' word is thrown around a multitude of times. At first it's reasonably shocking to hear the comfort with which the characters throw it about, however by the end you're pretty accustomed to it. It's just the way it was. There's an element of heartbreak for the audience seeing the way these people were treated, probably the clinching factor that got it a well deserved Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.The acting is nothing short of brilliant from all involved (even Tarantino himself). Christoph Waltz steals the show for me, reminiscent of Inglorious Basterds. He's such an unlikely hero, but he's just so likable that you can't help but love him (or if he's playing a Nazi, admire the hell out of his performance). Jamie Foxx was truly excellent, as was Leo DiCaprio, but the real surprise for me was Samuel L. Jackson. I don't know how Tarantino does it but he gets the best out of that man every time. If only he had directed Snakes on a Plane.Django Unchained is a must see movie. It doesn't matter if you're worried about whether you'll be able to handle the violence or the tough themes, you have to put those worries to one side, grit your teeth and get to your local theater. It might not be easy to sit through, but boy is it rewarding at the end.",9,0,2,5 February 2013
Get Out," In a world of terrible horror movies, this is near perfection
","I often wish some of the biggest names in Hollywood film making would dabble in the horror genre a little more often. Most have at least one horror credit to their name, often from early on in their careers when they were trying to establish them self. One name I dream of seeing a horror movie from is Christopher Nolan. That would be undoubtedly amazing. 'Get Out' is written and directed by Jordan Peele, who despite this being his debut film, is already synonymous with quality based on his comedic work to date. Still though, the fact that he has made one of the best and most original horror films of the last 30 years is nothing short of astonishing.It would take me a long time to explain everything that makes 'Get Out' so great, but that's what I'm here to do, so I'll give it a go. Let's begin with the characters. It's no secret that horror movie characters have long since been a major flaw in nearly every film the genre possesses. They are often bland, idiotic, completely lacking in personality and have terrible interactions with one and other. This is the main area I imagine true film makers could improve on things. Peele proves this to be true, by creating some absolutely brilliant characters that I frankly want to see more of even now. Each character is completely unique and the dialogue they speak has been masterfully thought out and put together. Even if this wasn't a horror movie I could've happily just watched these characters interacting for 100 minutes. There are far worse ways one could spend their time.Secondly, the film is so damn smart. There's a very strong mystery element in the mix, and the way it is revealed to the audience layer by layer is quite incredible in hindsight. Constantly throughout the movie we are let in on certain things which will blow you way, and every time that is just the tip of the iceberg. The clues given to the audience throughout are so crafty and exceptionally conceived that I truly have trouble believing this is the work of first time film maker.I wouldn't describe the film as overly scary, but it does have you caring very much about the fate of the characters, whether positively or negatively. In a world where most horror movies are better than sleeping pills at putting me to sleep, I can honestly say I was glued to the screen for the entire run time and genuinely cared about what was happening on the screen.Finally, (not finally, but I better not ramble on too long) the casting in this movie is the icing on the cake. There is not a weak actor in sight, in fact on the contrary every performance is tremendous. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Allison Williams was the strongest of the lot. The way she portrayed her character's arc, and the some of the visuals she managed to portray will haunt me for a long time. 'Get Out' is unquestionably the best film of 2017 so far.",10,6,17,23 April 2017
Insidious," Whannell changes it up a bit with good results
","Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Leigh Whannell and James Wan teaming up. Both Saw and Dead Silence were tremendously entertaining films with great atmosphere and stories. I knew I had to check out Insidious but I was skeptical because I feared they might have delved too far into the supernatural side of things. In fact they have for my liking but that's OK because they've put an original spin on it, as they're talented at doing, and that pulls it through.The acting was solid enough. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson carry the story through without ever making you think 'wow!' Lin Shaye could've been better cast in my opinion. Her delivery in some of the explanation scenes wasn't eerie enough for my liking. And the characters of Specs (played by Whannell) and Tucker were too lighthearted for my liking and took away from the creepy atmosphere the film was working so hard to create.Insidious for me was a cross between The Exorcist and The Cabin in the Woods. It reminded me of The Cabin in the Woods because it created a story which seemed to allow for any creature of any type and appearance to pretty much jump out of anywhere at anytime. Lots of fun to make a film with that being the case I'd imagine. And the similarities between this and The Exorcist need no explanation.One flaw for me was that I never really felt the characters were in enough danger. The 'rules', if you'd call them that, laid out allow too much comfort for the characters. Things were constantly jumping out, but it never felt like once they'd jumped out they were actually going to do anything overly menacing.A good film for those who like to get the heart racing a bit. If you liked Saw and Dead Silence expect things a little bit different, but still up to the same quality and standard. I read in the trivia section Leigh Whannell made a conscious effort to avoid clichés and he did this well. Everything here is pretty original and you certainly won't find yourself groaning at any 'never saw that coming' moments. Also, as these film-makers have treated us to in the past, you'll get a nice little surprise at the end. Enjoy.",8,0,1,26 December 2012
The Theory of Everything," Redmayne is stunning in a masterful film
","I'm 7/8 of the way through the Best Picture nominees for this year (I still have 'Boyhood' to go) and something that has been distinctly missing, despite there being some great films, is the ability to bring out emotion in the audience. Every film has been clever or funny or informative, but 'The Theory of Everything' is all of the above and more. The love story in the centre of it all is the truly captivating part brought to light by two exquisite leading performances and a flawlessly written script.Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have been nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Redmayne has undoubtedly delivered the best performance of the year. He is absolutely mesmerising in every scene, to the point where you occasionally have to remind yourself you're not watching actual footage of the real Stephen Hawking. His only real competition for the award is coming from Michael Keaton in 'Boyhood'. Keaton was good there's no doubt about it, but his is more a case of 'what a great story it would be if he won', whereas Redmayne deserves the award for simply acting his butt off.Jones is also very good in her performance. She's an integral part of making the love story believable and one you want to root for, while always understanding just how hard it would be. I had never actually seen Jones act in a film before this one. Her nomination is richly deserving and while I'm afraid she'll struggle to upset Julianne Moore and actually win the award, she will be given the chance again in the future I'm almost certain, based on the performance I just watched.A lot of the hate this film is receiving seems to be from people who aren't too fond of atheism. It's incredibly disappointing that these people can't simply put their views aside and judge a film for what it is. The other criticism I have seen brought up once or twice is that the film is too formulaic or 'Oscar bait'. I don't understand this at all. I would absolutely 100% of the time prefer a film that was moving and beautiful whilst being told in a conventional way, than a film that makes every effort to be as different from the pack as possible but never actually affects its audience or makes any valid points. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a prime example of the latter for me.'The Theory of Everything' is the exact reason I take the time to watch all of the Oscar nominees every year. I always stumble across a film that I would never have taken he time to watch otherwise and end up absolutely loving it. I really wasn't excited going into the theatre at all, expecting this to be one of the nominees I would least enjoy, so I was thrilled to be blown away by it. The acting is mind-blowing, the script is perfectly written and the direction is sound. What more could you ask for?",10,0,0,19 February 2015
P.S. I Love You," Grittier than the fairytale I was expecting
","With the announcement that a sequel was coming for 'P.S. I Love You' I thought I'd better finally get around to seeing the original so that I was ready for it. Just reading the imdb synopsis for this movie makes me sad. There aren't many more somber concepts for a movie than this one. Interestingly I didn't find the actual film anywhere near as sad as I expected to.It's hard to put my finger on exactly why that was the case. I found some of the characters a little hard to get on-board with. Lisa Kudrow's character for example could be downright nasty. I feel the film went more for realistic characters who are flawed, than your usual whimsical characters that typically possess films. I actually respect that they did that even if it was to the detriment of the film.I think I was expecting more of a fairytale for adults type film, and instead I got a more gritty, pragmatic style. I'm okay with that, however if I had to choose I'd probably prefer the fairytale. I'm rarely as ambivalent towards a film as I am towards 'P.S. I Love You'. For me it was a touching story, that I'm glad I saw, however it is unlikely that it will stick around in my mind.",6,0,0,7 April 2020
Room," A near perfect film
","'Room' is an immensely powerful film. It has the ability to make its audience care from minute one right until the dying seconds. There isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the film has a wonderful message.Director Lenny Abrahamson, who has deservedly been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his work in 'Room', has done an unbelievable job of balancing all these aspects of the film. He was helped a lot too by his two leads giving near flawless performances. Tremblay gives one of the best performances by a child-actor I can remember in a long time. Sadly the category of Best Actor is simply too strong for a child to be nominated in it this year, but make no mistake, anyone who sees this will be blown away by his performance. He's definitely one to be watched out for in the future. Brie Larson has received a nomination in the Best Actress category and deservedly so. The girl can act. She's been around a long time now but has really found her niche in the last couple of years seemingly. Here, she perfectly puts you in the shoes of the character and makes you feel every emotion and every shred of desperation as realistically as if you were actually in that situation. Based on what I've seen here, I'd call her a shoo-in to win the Oscar.There's not a lot else to say about this work of perfection, other than make sure you see it. The title could be considered a little bland and I hope it doesn't put anyone off giving it a chance because the product itself is anything but. Perfect direction, a beautifully written script and superb performances, all equal one of the best films of the year. I don't think it has quite enough momentum behind it to win the Best Picture award in what is a very strong category this year, but the fact it's been recognised with a nomination, and thus more people will get to see it, is a bonus if nothing else. A flawless film.",10,2,7,14 January 2016
A Quiet Place," 90 minutes of extreme suspense
","The opening scene in 'A Quiet Place' is one of the best I can remember in recent memory. It is perfectly crafted in every way. It would actually make a terrific little 5 minute short film all on its own. What it does so perfectly is that it sets the tone for the entire movie. The situation is made clear to the audience and then the reason for that situation is presented in brutal and compelling fashion. I was actually left with goosebumps as the title appeared on the screen. Luckily that was only the beginning of good things from what is a terrific horror movie.There's a whole bunch of early M Night. Shyamalan being channeled in this movie. In fact if you'd told me he'd written and directed it I would have had no doubt you were telling the truth. The suspense most of all. You are literally on edge from minute one and until the credits roll. Not many films can achieve that. In fact not many films can achieve any suspense these days so that just shows how impressive it is to have it there for an entire run time.The jump-scares in the movie are terrific for two reasons. First of all, they are almost all to do with the story and are genuinely things you should be jumping from. This isn't always the case, but near enough. Secondly, because of the concept of the whole movie needing to be quiet, when a sound rips across the screen it gives you much more a jolt than usual. It's something you really have to experience to know what I mean, but trust me when I say it works.I loved almost everything about this movie. It was masterfully shot (especially for such an inexperienced director), the creatures looked great and I genuinely cared about each and every character. I love films like this that work because they are proof that there is still hope for the horror genre yet.",9,35,72,5 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Possibly this year's 'Moonlight'
","Unfortunately when I say possibly this year's 'Moonlight' (last year's Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards) I don't necessarily mean it as a good thing. When I reviewed that film I described it as a 'film about nothing'. While I wouldn't go as far as to say the same about 'Call Me by Your Name', there are similarities in that sense. What is actually separating this from other love stories out there? Is it the homosexual element? Is it two straight actors playing homosexuals convincingly well (ala 'Brokeback Mountain' - another highly over-rated film in my opinion)? Are the movie-going public simply fascinated by this concept? I'm not sure, and while I'm certainly not calling 'Call Me by Your Name' a bad film, I don't think it was Best Picture nomination worthy.I kept expecting more from the film. Around the 65 minute mark I actually had to get my phone out and check what the movie was supposed to be about, because nothing had happened as yet. The synopsis was vague to say the least and I hoped it was just holding back information for fear of spoilers. It wasn't. The film really is as simple and straight-forward as the plot line suggests. So what are we, the audience, supposed to grasp onto here? Well, put simply, we have to buy into the love story 100%. And to be honest I'm not sure I did. I've seen a lot of great love stories told in films over the years, and this one wouldn't rank in the top 100 I'm pretty sure.If you break the film up into three parts, before the couple get together, during the time they've got together and then after they've gotten together, then I think the structuring needed to be different. Too long is spent on the first phase, not quite enough on the second phase and then far from enough on the final phase. The final phase was the chance to really drive things home and draw some emotion out of the audience. Even during the short time we get in that final 1/3 we get two tremendous scenes. One with a speech from the father and then the very final scene of the film. More of that and you would've had yourself a truly great film.The actors do do a tremendous job and fully immerse themselves in their respective roles. The potential was certainly there for this to be something great, but it was just lacking in creativity on the writer's part. The story plays out far too straight-forward. A missed opportunity.",6,4,9,26 February 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The final quarter kills a good film (once again)
","Here's how every 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequel seems to go: it starts off fun, light-hearted and clever, then as things go along it becomes more and more convoluted until it reaches the point where it becomes so self-loving and obsessed with it's own cleverness that it is nothing short of unwatchable. Unfortunately 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is no different, however it is better than some of the previous installments.Unless you somehow have managed to care enough to follow the mythology that the stories follow, then you (like me) are here for Johnny Depp playing 'Jack Sparrow'. You're happy for there to be a story and for other characters to have their time in the spotlight, but at the end of the day you've paid your $20 to see Depp. That's why the last quarter of these films is always so disappointing, because his character almost always becomes nothing more than a chess piece in the extravagant action sequences.The first 3/4 of the film, where Depp is allowed to do what he does best, are admittedly very good. Almost all of his jokes land and the film keeps a good pace avoiding being bogged down by storytelling. Javier Bardem is the other bright light in this film. His performance is genuinely scary at times. These films are incredibly frustrating because they truly could be great, but instead always end up sinking into mediocrity.",5,18,41,24 May 2017
Ex Machina," Just needed some better pacing
","The general rule in Hollywood is that the more CGI you have in your film the less thought-provoking it is going to be (or is intended to be at least). 'Ex Machina' seems to be the exception. It won Best Achievement in Visual Effects at the Academy Awards this year, and when you look back at the list of past winners of that award, it's a clear sign of quality. I usually find I love thought-provoking films, particularly ones with an added element of mystery to them. So I'm not entirely sure why 'Ex Machina' fell a bit flat for me. I kept wanting things to up the ante, but the film seemed comfortable staying on the one level for the most part. A character would mention that another characters was not what they seemed and it appeared things were about to kick off, only for the film to almost ignore this piece of dialogue and return to its lifeless existence.I certainly didn't hate the film, it just wasn't all it could have been. It contains a very strong ending where things do all come to a head. We get some answers, and other things are left ambiguous. The ending is undoubtedly strong and adds a lot of quality to the overall product. The acting is strong throughout and the visual effects are unquestionably of a very high standard. It's a film that requires some patience, and if you have that you will be rewarded in the end.",6,1,2,24 October 2016
Wimbledon," Good Fun For a Lazy Night!!!
","Wimbledon is an enjoyable romantic comedy but certainly will not be remembered forever or even a year after it was made. It was clever and well done (and Kirsten Dunst was perfectly cast) but it just didn't have that touch to it that the classic comedies have. The only scene that might have had some people (probably who have had a very happy life to date) was the one where the managers cellphone begins ringing just as someone is about to do a very important serve. What did make it enjoyable however was something else which most comedies do lack, and that is the ability to be throwing jocks in throughout the movie even when times are serious. Wimbledon should be seen by comedy lovers but don't buy the DVD before watching it.",7,1,1,7 April 2005
Hidden Figures," Well made but flawed at its core
","Every year around this time we get at least one film that focuses on race. The reason it usually comes out at this time of year is that the Academy Awards eat it up and it receives multiple nominations. The same thing happens with the holocaust as a subject almost every year without fail. I have no problem with this. If that's what people like in their films then c'est la vie. The problem only occurs when the film starts entirely falling back on the race factor. When the entire purpose becomes showing how evil the white man is, and how special black people are simply because they are black. I read a quote from the real-life Katherine Johnson saying she couldn't understand why anyone would want to make a film about her life. In a way she makes a very valid point. Making a film about this lady is in its own way a little bit racist. It's saying this story is film-worthy simply because she was black. This will probably pass over most audience member's heads, but anyone who stops and thinks about it will realise this is actually quite insulting.As far as being watchable goes the film is actually very good. The two hour run time flies by and there are some very well laid out scenes that impressively get across the message the film is trying to sell. There is also some very fine acting, particularly from Taraji P. Henson. In one scene in particular, around the midway point, she completely blew away. I think this film would have worked as a story on its own, even putting aside the race factor. The fact that its in there does add another level to the film, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary. Overall though, it's a well made film that if not thought about too deeply, can be quite enjoyable to watch.",6,7,15,21 January 2017
1917," Unique and breathtaking
","Is Sam Mendes capable of making a bad film? It seems not because he is yet to do so, and if '1917' is any indication he seems to be getting better as his career goes along. This was one of the most unique films I have ever watched. Filmed to look like one shot, despite the film being nearly two hours long. Just think about that for a moment. The amount of problems and difficulties it must've caused, and yet they fought through the adversity and got it done. The final product is one of the best films of 2019.The one shot isn't just a gimmick either. It adds immensely to the film. It makes everything feel so much more realistic and almost like you're actually a part of the movie. Without even realising it, cuts in films subliminally take you out of the movie. Here that problem doesn't exist. If it wasn't so beautifully made you could be watching a video someone took on an Iphone. There was a point where the characters were in the back of a truck on rough roads and I actually got an overwhelming feeling that I myself needed to put a seat belt on. That might sound silly, but that's an indication of how amazingly well executed this film was.Then to top it off the story is incredibly powerful. It makes no bones about the fact that the war was extremely grim for everyone involved. The film was sad, powerful and tense, often all at once. Finally some superb acting from the entire cast was the icing on the cake. I can't say enough good things about this film, and I would be very happy to see it win Best Picture at the Academy Awards in February.",9,0,2,10 January 2020
Lincoln," A classy showing by director and star
","Biography films almost always struggle with finding the balance between showing off their portrayals of historical figures and focusing on the actual story being told. Lincoln gets it about perfect. We are treated to both a riveting performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, and the rest of the cast for that matter, whilst stealing absolutely no focus from the amazing tale about the end of the Civil war and how Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.Daniel Day-Lewis is known as being a modern-day master of acting. He doesn't appear in many films, but when he does it's a real treat. He immerses himself in his characters and the audience reaps the rewards. He was so convincing as Lincoln I often had to remind myself I was watching a movie and not a real-footage documentary. Tommy Lee Jones' unflinching performance was also a real treat and the pair of the them should nab themselves an Academy Award for their performances over the weekend, with Christoph Waltz being the only possible exception to take home Best Supporting Actor. Sally Field is also nominated for an award but I have to say she didn't blow me away, even though I hear her performance was a fairly accurate depiction of Mrs Lincoln. I just feel she didn't nail her emotional scenes and really make me feel for her over the lose of her son.After a slightly slow start the two and half hour film does tend to race by. Director Steven Spielberg's beautiful film-making style shines through and the story is told at a wonderful pace, with magnificent performances. There will always be those that nit-pick over a few historical inaccuracies, but I can't see even them bringing this film down at all. It will probably just lose out to Argo in the Best Picture category this weekend, but if it were down to just these two I'd have to narrowly give my vote to Lincoln.",8,0,1,21 February 2013
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Does just enough to stay afloat
","I said in my review of the original 'Resident Evil' that I hope the character of 'Alice' evolves and really stamps herself as the undisputed lead character of the series. That was probably the strongest thing 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' actually had going for it. The character really came alive. In the previous film I mentioned she often felt like just another member of the crew. In this one though there can be no doubt that she is in charge. There's just enough going on in this film to keep it watchable. Near the start all the zombies came out again and I feared this was going to be a one trick pony with the character simply avoiding them for the entire run time. Luckily though in the second half of the movie a number of other things popped into the story to keep it fresh and interesting enough to be sustainable.There are some very good action sequences in this film, but there are also some rather dull and unimaginative ones too. The consistency of quality just wasn't quite there. Also the characters, other than 'Alice' , really weren't that memorable this time around around. Most were either boring or simply annoying. For a sequel though 'Resident Evil: Apocalpyse' certainly holds its own and doesn't let the franchise down in any way.",6,1,1,10 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," They got it absolutely spot on with this one
","The 'Star Wars' series has always been a funny one for me. I find them passable entertainment when I watch them and then barely think about them again until the next one comes along. Most people it seems like to obsess over them for days, weeks, months, and even years after they come out. And that's great when you care about a film series enough to do that. That's certainly not me though. I had heard a lot of mixed reactions about 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' before going in to watch it. I had heard people say it was their favourite 'Star Wars' film, and people say it was their least favourite 'Star Wars' film. It was very clear that it was incredibly polarising. So finally I got around to seeing it, and I was genuinely curious on which side of the ledger I would fall. I can confirm that I absolutely loved it and it was the best 'Star Wars' film I have seen to date.What a fun ride! Firstly, this is the longest 'Star Wars' film to date, and yet it feels like the shortest. The pacing is exquisite. Secondly, this is how these films need to be done. Simplify the story and allow for your characters to have more fun and express them self more. So many film series want to be so smart and convoluted and prove what geniuses their film makers are, and consequently end up becoming tedious messes ('Pirates of the Caribbean' is a prime example). This film finds a near perfect balance between story evolution and simplicity, resulting in bonafide fun. No film is ever going to please every one though of course and obviously this film hasn't managed to do so. I still think that this is the right direction to go in though. The people who are already fans will always come back for more, and new fans are more likely to come along with this type of film being produced. Really big fan of this entry in the series and I would highly recommend it to any one potentially on the fence after hearing mixed reviews.",9,4,15,5 February 2018
Evil Dead," Actually really chilling stuff
","Let me start by saying I haven't seen the original film this was based on 'The Evil Dead', but if it's even half as good as this one I'll have to check it out. 'Evil Dead' (2013) blew me away.Importantly, we aren't treated to a bunch of horny, unrealistic teenagers who we are sick of after 10 minutes and thus don't really care as to whether they die or not. The characters are real and down to earth and this added a lot to the quality of the film.The scares are genuine. There's a little bit of 'The Exorcist' channeled throughout. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get things kicked off, but once they do it never relents for a moment. There's really no humour at any point and this works well. It pulls no punches and delivers frights even when they're expected - and yet they are still completely effective. Horror movies spend too much time these days trying to lure you into a false sense of security with fake build-ups time after time after time. 'Evil Dead' doesn't mess around with that kind of nonsense.I was thoroughly impressed with this one. The acting is good, the direction is excellent and the overall quality of the movie is nothing short of superb. You will be left feeling very uncomfortable throughout. If this is going to be the quality level of all remakes I've got no problem with them being made at all.",9,1,3,13 January 2014
The Imitation Game," A fine example of how to tell a true story
","When you are watching a film that is based on a true story which you know nothing about it's a very different experience to watching one you know a lot about. I personally knew almost nothing about the work of Alan Turing and the effect he had on the second World War and from that stand-point I found it to be a fantastic film. I've been told by a reliable source (and also read a lot on IMDb message board threads) that a lot of facts/events in the film were falsified or altered for artistic purposes. While this is a bit of shame I think people need to keep in mind the difference between a movie and a documentary. As long as nothing major or character defining is changed I see no harm in changes that simply make the film more entertaining and enjoyable. This was the number one problem I had with fellow Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards this year 'Selma'. Give me this over that any day.Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in 'The Imitation Game'. From what I'm told he absolutely perfected the character of Turing. Turing looks like he would have been a fun character to portray. He certainly seems to have been an unusual man. The saying, 'There's a fine line between genius and insanity' comes immediately to mind when speaking of him. A very fine performance but I can't see him taking the award home sadly, it was a very strong category this year.Speaking of strong categories, Best Supporting Actress was quite the opposite. Patricia Arquette is almost certain to take the award home for 'Boyhood' without almost any competition at all. Every other performance in the category has been about as bland as you could imagine and Keira Knightly in 'The Imitation Game' is no exception. That's not to say she's bad or anything of the sort. She's just simply nothing memorable or even a stand-out in the film. I kept thinking she must have an amazing final scene coming up that's going to blow me away, but no, it just never came.I suspect the only thing holding this back from taking a real crack at winning Best Picture is the small controversy marring it over 'historical inaccuracies'. Those aside it really is a well put together and moving film that gives a great insight into the genius that Turing was. What happened to him and his treatment by the courts was nothing short of a travesty. I absolutely loved Cumberbatch's quote regarding Turing's recent Royal Pardon, 'The only person who should be pardoning anybody is him (Turing).' Sums the whole thing up perfectly. A very fine film, about a very fine man.",9,2,7,16 February 2015
8 Mile," Excellent Rap Battles!!!
",Very good movie. Everyone's acting was superb and the story was excellent. The rap battles were really well done and no one could have told that they were lip sinked (which they were). The last rap battle he did was his best. The lines were just outstanding. Eminem's performance was out of this world. Not one scene in the movie shouldn't have been there. If they were going to make a sequel to it I think that would be a very good idea (if they could find a story line to base it around. It's a movie that you can tell has had a lot of time and effort put into it. Overall this would have to be one of the best movies ever made about a person's life. I really hope they find a story line for the sequel.,9,0,1,7 September 2004
Saw II," The best in the series - and that's saying something
","There are some films that you never forget seeing for the first time, and 'Saw 2' is one of those for me. Having already been blown away by the brilliant original, to have a sequel that was not only equally as good, but likely better, was incredible. Everything that was so good about 'Saw', the intelligence of the story, the brutality and the themes and messages, were all not only apparent in the sequel, they were amplified. The 'twist' was astonishing and made perfect sense. It made everything that had happened up until that point nothing short of mesmerising. There is no question that this is one of my favourite films of all time.At the time of watching the original 'Saw' it obviously seemed incredibly brutal in its nature. It wasn't until 'Saw 2' came out that we realised just how much leeway they still had to work with. Some of the traps in this film can make even the most hardened veterans of the genre squeamish (I know because I am one). The creativity involved never ceases to amaze me either. Some of the traps like the one where you reach through with your wrists only to be caught there are barely given even screen time, and yet other movies would kill to think up something so devilish and original.The best part about the film though does have to be the story. It's so much fun. The premise works on so many levels. Also if you ever actually stop and think about the message 'Jigsaw' is trying to get across, to appreciate life and live every moment as if it was your last, it's a truly enlightened one. I think this message actually gets lost to a lot of viewers because there is simply so much else going on in these films. This is a film I will never forget for its ingenuity and genius. If you've never had the pleasure of the seeing it, please do yourself a huge favour and do so. A masterpiece.",10,0,2,16 July 2017
Jurassic World," Great to look at but otherwise not much
","The action in 'Jurassic World' is great. I mean how could it not be? As if dinosaurs by themselves aren't exciting enough, here we have genetically mutated, hybrid dinosaurs that are better and more powerful than ever before. So why does the film feel so flat? The reason is because the fate of almost every character can be predicted from the second we meet them - and the ones that are safest get the most screen time. There was absolutely no way any of the four main characters Owen, Claire, Zach or Gray were ever going to die in this film so every action scene with them in danger just comes across mundane and pointless. Now you could probably say this about a lot of movies where certain characters feel safe, but having four of them is just too much. Contrastly there were characters that were just a ticking time bomb and sure enough were gobbled up by the end. The whole thing was even more predictable than usual.The movie is visually stunning. The dinosaurs are incredibly well animated and the action scenes are well directed. Sadly this is really all it has going for it though. An enormous amount of the jokes fell flat. A full theatre and obvious jokes didn't even raise a murmur anywhere in the room. I think this was more down to poor delivery by the actors than the writing itself. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are passable in their performances but it must be said that everyone else was pretty forgettable and even bad in their role. Nick Robinson was particularly average - just having been chased through the jungle by a dinosaur and he can't even change the flat tone of this voice for one line. Not much to see here. Watch the original 'Jurassic Park' again instead. At least that one had some originality to it.",5,3,8,19 June 2015
Prisoners," A powerful and enthralling experience
","This is the kind of film I love. A dark mystery/thriller with compelling characters and twists. It seemed these films were abundant in the 90s, but hard to come across today. 'Prisoners' is one of the best thrillers I've seen in recent times. The story is absorbing right from the get go. It locks the audience in and never lets them go for the next 150 minutes. It undoubtedly helps when your two stars are in exceptional form, both delivering some of the best performances of their careers. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career has really come to life in the last four years or so. Here, he gives a performance perfectly suited to the film. He never drops a scene and plays off every actor he's on screen with perfectly. Topping that though is Hugh Jackman. The man showed his unbelievable acting chops back in 2006 with his performance in 'The Prestige'. Here though he quite possibly tops that. He brings life to an incredibly complex and conflicted character. If a lesser actor had taken on this role the entire film could have fallen completely flat and had no power whatsoever. He can't have been far off an Oscar nomination.When a two and a half hour film flies by and you can't believe it is over already, you know it is high in quality. Not only that, but there are many discussion points that are fascinating to talk about and debate after the film is over. I love nothing more than a debate about a film topic where no one is ever 'right' because there is no official answer, yet people make great points that make you entirely reconsider your original opinion. This is one of those films that lends itself to that. I was initially a little put off by the length of the run time, but I implore you not to be. It's very close to being a modern masterpiece.",10,0,0,20 October 2016
Into the Wild," Worth it for Holbrook's cameo alone
","There are two types of people in the world. Those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and admire 'Chris' for living out his dream, and those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and see his actions as reckless, selfish and pointless. I fell more into the latter camp. I understand the burning desire some people have to do similar things to this, however as much as you may hate your family it is pretty cruel to intentionally put them in such a position. This is a good movie but I think it is based around flawed logic.I'd been meaning to see this film for nearly 13 years now. I always wondered how they had managed to spread the story of a man going into the Alaskan wilderness by himself into a two and a half hour movie. What I hadn't realised is that very little of the film is actually spent in Alaska. It is more about his journey to get there. Along the way he meets countless people who influence him in one way or another. This was probably my favourite part of the film. Seeing each little interaction and how it affected him. The final one with 'Ron' (played excellently by the Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook) was by far my favourite aspect of the film.The things that kept me from flat out loving this movie were probably the runtime being about 30 minutes too long, a feeling of the story drifting on occasion and also a lack of drama or tension for extended periods of the runtime. Whether you see this as an inspirational film, or simply an interesting adventure that a man once took, I think everyone will be able to get something out of this film.",7,0,0,14 April 2020
Blood Diamond," Hard-hitting and powerful
","Blood Diamond starts off with some brutal imagery and never lets up. It combines quantity and quality to get its point across. It wants to put across a strong message to the viewer and then intertwine a story around that. It does all this very well.The film takes itself very seriously and there is no times for laughs. I can recall chuckling once at a line during the entire film and that was amidst something else pretty shocking happening. We never think to ourselves that we should be due a laugh soon, because the films tone is set early and set clearly.The story itself is all linked together extremely well and all the elements combine brilliantly. At first I thought Jennifer Connelly's character had just been added to give the film a female element and perhaps to add some conflict. But in actuality her character is made vital to the end product, due again to the great writing.A very good film, as we've come to bank on when Leonardo Dicaprios name is on the billing. Be prepared, mind you, because at times this film is anything but easy watching. And in a lot of ways that's what's so good about it.",8,0,0,26 December 2009
Midsommar," A horror masterpiece
","I only finished 'Midsommar' 15 minutes ago and I'm already obsessed with it. What an incredible film. It's 2 and a half hours long and still the ending snuck up on me. I thought to myself it can't be over already. That's how much I enjoyed this movie. I was entranced by it. I was hanging on every line, every action, every facial expression trying to pick up clues and work out where this was going. What a blast this was to watch.Ari Aster is one of the best filmmakers working at the moment. His films are somehow arty and yet entertaining at the same time. That's not easy to pull off. The creativity he uses in almost every scene of his movies never ceases to blow me away, and I'm not someone who usually notices things like that. He's not afraid to experiment with risky ideas either, and why should he be considering he pulls it off almost every single time. Also the little details that he includes along the way to foreshadow things are incredible. He's possibly the best foreshadower working today.I almost never rewatch films but I think I will have to check out the director's cut for this one. Considering some of the incredibly gruesome stuff they left in (including one of the toughest scenes I've ever had to watch) I can't even imagine what they cut out. That should be a real treat. Also the entire cast were phenomenal but I have to give special credit to Florence Pugh. She blew me away in every scene she was in. I can't recommend 'Midsommar' highly enough. Please see this film.",10,10,17,8 October 2019
Taken," Where the Bond series would love to be
","Taken is a truly refreshing and rewarding experience to view. It's back to the basics. A ruthless, believable (to an extent at least) hero kicking bad guy ass. No gadgets, no one liners, just doing what needs to be done in fine style. Seeing a man fight to get his daughter back is so much more rewarding than watching someone try to save the world, or something to that effect, because a) it's believable and b) because we can relate to it, perhaps not directly, but certainly to a larger extent than the world being in danger.Liam Neeson is in outstanding form carrying the movie from start to finish. His slick tone, mixed with well performed stunts, result in the creation of a simply magnificent character. I have no doubt Daniel Craig will be watching this performance a few times through before beginning work on the next Bond flick.The movie is of course not without flaws. It would of been nice to see one of the villains challenge Neeson's character fractionally more rather than just standing there like a lifeless dummy while Neeson did as he pleased with them. Also the escape when he gets caught seemed far too straight forward and basic to be in the least bit satisfying. There must have been a more stylish way to handle the escape than simply having him pull the pipe from the ceiling.Nevertheless Taken certainly has a lot more things going for it than against it and this is why it is proving to be such a popular film. I'm disappointed it took me this long to see it and I'll say if you haven't caught it yet and are perhaps on the fence as to whether to watch it, have no second thoughts about seeing it. You won't be let down. And let us just hope no sequel is ever made. This is without doubt a film that will be best left as is with nothing added to it.",9,0,1,30 October 2009
Selma," Weighed down by its clunky first half
","There's been a lot of discussion over whether or not director Ava DuVernay should have been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Personally I would have to take the seemingly unpopular opinion that she was the one thing holding this film back. Admittedly the end of the film was very well done and even quite moving, but up until that point the whole thing just felt so clunky and unnatural. I see that she is quite inexperienced in the director's chair, and I feel that there was potential there, so hopefully she can iron out the odd flaw in her technique and become a really good director in the future.David Oyelowo is the other one stirring up some debate over his lack of a nomination. I do feel he was quite hard done by, giving a quite terrific performance. The voice and accent he used were absolutely perfect and a pleasure to listen to throughout. The rest of the cast was also excellent. I was very interested to see how Oprah Winfrey went in her role and I'd have to say she held her own very well.The movie itself is good, but never enters in the realms of being great. As previously mentioned the ending is perfectly executed and will leave a good taste in a lot of people's mouths and even help them to forget some of the earlier indiscretions the film commits. Sometimes historically accurate films get bogged down by needing to be 100% in line with what actually happened. This is simply an unfortunate part of the genre which can't be avoided. Does it deserve its nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards? Just.",6,2,3,5 February 2015
La La Land," Pretentious nonsense
","I'll call it right now. 'La La Land' will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and for no other reason than the fact that the Academy loves a film about the industry. If there's a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list, put your money on it to win. Does it deserve the award? No, there were many superior films released in 2016.Hollywood seems to be obsessed with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a couple. This is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time. Comparing the chemistry for example to Gosling and Rachel McAdams in 'The Notebook', they are worlds apart. Stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes, but she can't pull off the likable tag very well.I really enjoyed Damien Chazelle's previous film 'Whiplash'. In a lot of ways they are very similar films, but in the more important ways they are worlds apart. The biggest difference is the modesty that 'Whiplash' achieved. It had great characters, yet it acted like it didn't know it. 'La La Land' has very average, even poor occasionally, characters yet acts like they're God's gift to cinema.I was really disappointed coming out of 'La La Land'. Even though I knew it wasn't my type of film ideally, I was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations. On the contrary though, it managed to fall below my expectations. My advice would be don't be fooled by the reviews and probable Oscar nominations. There's nothing to see here.",4,18,35,7 January 2017
Saw," One of the greatest horror films ever made
","For my 500th review I have decided to begin my 'Saw' series of reviews leading up to the October release of the eighth installment 'Jigsaw'. Back around 2004 the 'situational horror/thriller' genre was quite a big thing, however it seemed no one could quite nail it. They even tried making a main stream one in 'Collateral' which admittedly was a pretty good film. Other than that though it seemed no one could seem to quite get it right. Then along came James Wan and Leigh Whannell with a little project they called 'Saw' and the rest is history.So what made 'Saw' so great? Firstly, was how clever it was. Other similar films always felt like they were trying to be clever, but could never quite pull it off. 'Saw' had a genuine motive and a genuinely intriguing premise. It was incredibly simple and incredibly intricate all at the same time. Secondly, was the originality. Never before had we really seen anything like this. The situations these characters were being put in were not only thought-provoking and captivating to watch, they also were unlike anything we had seen.It was a low-budget production obviously so it's far from a perfectly put together package. The acting for one thing is quite shocking in a few moments. It wasn't until the sequels where the budget obviously increased that they became very fine and well oiled machines. Nonetheless though 'Saw' is one of the best horror films ever made and is proof that storytelling will always be where the true strength of any film lies.",10,1,3,8 July 2017
Sinister," As far as horror goes this is almost as good as they come
","What a massive difference having an effective looking ghost/ghoul/monster, whatever you want to call it, can make. 'Sinister' has one of, if not the single most, effective ones I've ever seen in a horror film. It is creepy to no end and it will effect you, I guarantee that. Then add in the fact that it's a very finely made film and you have horror at its absolute clinical best.They used to say in reference to Michael Jordan, 'Greatness is knowing exactly what someone's going to do, and still not being able to stop it.' There were times in 'Sinister' where I knew a scare was coming, I even knew what the scare was going to be, and still it made me jump out of my skin, and I don't jump easily. Horror will always be a touch predictable, there are not enough tricks left in the book for it not to be. So for a film to have the ability to scare you despite you knowing what's coming is a very handy quality to have, and a sign of excellent filmmaking.Ethan Hawke in the lead role does a fantastic job. I read that his reactions to the super 8 videos were genuine and I love that they did it this way. The whole cast in fact were superb, including the children. Genuinely creative and high-quality horror films are somewhat of a rarity today, so when a good one comes along it is always very much appreciated. There is already a sequel out which I look forward to checking out next. If it is to half the standard that this one was it will be a very fine film.",9,1,2,27 March 2016
Don't Breathe," An above average horror film
","A 7.6 rating on IMDb is incredibly high for a horror film. So when I saw 'Dont Breathe' contained such a rating before going to see it, I suspected I was in for something pretty special. Director Fede Alvarez' one previous film, the 2013 remake of 'Evil Dead', was a very fine film. It was intense, scary and brutal. A new director stamping his mark on the genre from the outset. Could he live up to it a second time though? I think you'd have to say he did. This time he takes on an original story (a breathe of fresh air in the horror genre) that he has written himself. It's an intriguing premise. A blind man being robbed, who is more capable than first perceived and chooses to fight back. Then add in some extra twists and turns along the way and you have yourself a lot of potential. But we know that in this beloved genre of ours potential doesn't always equal results.Luckily Alvarez clearly has the filmmaking talents to pull it off. It's a very different type of story to 'Evil Dead' and yet still captures the same levels of intensity and brutality. One thing I didn't like was the opening scene showing a man dragging a character down the road. I love opening scenes that give a sneak preview into something that will occur later in the film when they are done right, but this simply wasn't. That type of a snippet should give the audience a 'Huh?' feeling or a 'How the hell are they going to make sense of that?' thought. This one achieved neither of those. Other than that though there really isn't a lot to criticise here. The acting is good, the directing is good and the whole experience is pretty damn enjoyable. 7.6 to me implies it should be one of the best horror movies ever made. To me it certainly didn't live up to that kind of level, but make no mistake, Alvarez is a director to take note of in the future.",8,0,3,16 September 2016
Sicario," Tightly made thriller that keeps the audience involved
","In the lead up to the Oscar nominations being announced this year there was talk of 'Sicario' possibly sneaking in for a Best Picture nod. I held off seeing it until after the announcement for this reason. After seeing it I'm surprised it was really ever considered a contender. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just not really the type of film that would often find itself nominated (even with the now extended field). For me it often came across as a film more intent on style over substance. Every character had to be ice-cool and every line had to be delivered so suavely that it took the air of realism out of a lot of scenes.Oscar-worthiness aside though it's a very watchable and enjoyable film. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are terrific, but the real movie stealer is Benicio Del Toro (and I don't often like him in films). He doesn't have a lot of lines but when he does you listen, because whatever he said is either going to be very cool or very important - or both. A film dealing with the Mexican Cartel is always going to have its share of violence, but I never thought 'Sicario' delved into gratuitous levels. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for his handling of what can be a tricky balance to find. The movie has an air of mystery around it that keeps the audience wondering and there's never a boring scene in between things. It's a beautifully shot and very well made movie that won't disappoint audiences anywhere.",7,1,2,16 January 2016
Jack Reacher," A real let down for fans
","'One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making 'One Shot', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, 'this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7' skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6'5' Jack Reacher? This can't be happening.' Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animal-like' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said 'does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character.' The Reacher books are about a single thing, and that is Jack Reacher. Don't get me the wrong, the stories in 90% of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this (albeit very late in the piece) by renaming the movie 'Jack Reacher'. A little in-your-face for my liking, but I could see why it was necessary so I didn't hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise's casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.Cruise was cast badly, and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you're an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece 'The Dark Knight'. He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.For starters, I'm reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touch-ups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would've been better placed in the role? Cruise's shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks 'I'm looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch?' To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit, only not quite to the same degree, but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly, he kept bloody smiling (or smirking, whatever you want to call it). I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there, because Reacher can be a bit of a smart-ass, but he didn't have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher's an animal, 24-7, he (very) rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously.The script was solid, it stayed pretty faithful to the book. I found the jokes and one-liners a little too frequent for my liking and took away from what should have been a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, Reacher was never really challenged physically. Sure, everyone he fought was bigger than him, but that's only because Cruise is so short. Never once did I think to myself 'how's Reacher possibly going to take down this guy?' Which always makes for the best fight scenes. One part of the script I did not like at all, again regarding the 'bad guys', was when two of them, whilst trying to attack Reacher, were practically fighting each other even harder. And just because they wanted to get through the door first? I felt like I was watching 'Home Alone' or something. I assume they were going for comedic value but it just went far too far for my liking.The rest of the cast were solid at best, in fact I found Rosamund Pike well below average in her performance, but I wasn't too bothered by this because they were the epitome of a support cast. They weren't who people came to see. People came to see Cruise and he let them down. The interesting thing is that the movie isn't being panned across the board, which is testament to how good the story is. It's a great story and could easily have been done without Reacher, which is basically what has happened for people who haven't read the books. They don't have those to compare the character to and so they leave the theater quite happily. And that's great for them. But for the rest of us they have ruined a great character. I hope when I read future books I can still picture the character the same way I always have. Sadly, I fear I may struggle.",5,180,344,4 January 2013
Les Misérables," Long and flawed
","When a film chooses to run for more than two and a half hours it has an expectation to justify this. Les Misérables does not. Most films with a run time this long do it because it adds to the film. They need that time to get the information out and include their action scenes. The Dark Knight is a prime example of this. Even in that case Christopher Nolan knew he would be pushing the audience's patience and so filmed the movie with very quick edits and cutaways to make the two and a half hours feel like much less. Les Misérables' long runtime on the other hand works against it. What could have been a solid story, with above average acting and some great musical numbers, instead turns into a snoozefest with the audience pleading for it to end. It's also a rare case where the first half of the film is far more entertaining than the second half. The movie's pace just grinds to a halt and never starts up again.Length aside, Les Misérables is held together by some good performances throughout the cast, none more so than Anne Hathaway who had a golden 2012 in support roles (Catwoman in 'The Dark Knight Rises' being the other). Her reasonably brief appearance is certainly the highlight of the film and by far the most watchable part. Her rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' was the highlight of all the musical numbers. Hugh Jackman (the other Oscar nominated member of the cast) was not as impressive for me. He just never 'wowed' me and his singing, whilst not awful, was nothing to write home about. Russell Crowe was so-so, I didn't love his singing but the intensity he brought to the role was well received. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen excellently provided some humour in a film that often takes itself far too seriously. Unfortunately this is a real miss for me. Almost every line in the film is sung (as most will already know going in) making it almost operatic in style, which is not for everyone, including me, but I promised myself going in I would look past this and judge the film solely on its merits. It still failed for me. I never cared about a single character and felt no sympathy or joy towards any one of them at any stage. The singing was adequate for the most part and nothing more. I personally could've happily gone through my life without ever hearing Crowe sing. As previously mentioned I found it too long and think a shorter run time would've found it with a lot more fans. Overall a pretty uninspired effort, only carried by a few good performances.",5,1,5,2 February 2013
The Happening," So very close to a return to form for Shyamalan
","I had such a good vibe going during this film. I couldn't work out why all the hate toward it. M. Night Shyamalan appeared to be back to his best so I began trying to work out which brilliant ending he was going to lay on us this time. There seemed to be little hints here and there that I figured would leave me saying after wards, 'ofcourse, why didn't I see that coming?' Instead I was left feeling absolutely robbed at the brain power I had spent on this movie.Shyamalan was back near his best in terms of building quiet suspense, even though we aren't entirely sure of what the disturbing occurrence we are in for is, which makes it all the better. The premise he's developed makes it easy for him to throw horrific images at us, but he does it with his own sense of style and creativity none the less. He's certainly nowhere near top form but it's definitely a step up from the awful Lady in the Water.One of the reasons this movie fails in a lot of peoples eyes is that it lends itself to being over-analyzed. We know what Shyamalan is capable of in comparison to what he's providing us with lately and so we naturally see little faults in all aspects of the film much more clearly. A lot of the dialog is awkward and unnatural and some of the character decisions are questionable at best. The ending however must go down as the big one when we consider this is the man's specialty. The Sixth Sense, The Village and my personal favorite Unbreakable all had endings that left us both shook up and satisfied for days, even weeks. The Happening doesn't even come close to having either effect on us.Not one to be proud of on Shyamalan's part and he's been let know this by his many razzie nominations. But it's not all bad and it's certainly not unwatchable. The man does have other traits beside delivering us with an incredible ending, despite what a few may think.",6,1,2,23 February 2009
The Shape of Water," Unfortunately you can tell it's trying very hard to win Oscars
","The Oscars are a funny old bird. Unfortunately after the #Oscarssowhite controversy a couple of years back they have lost a lot of credibility. They came out and made a promise to diversify the nominees/winners of the show in the future. What did that do? It meant that when a film like 'Moonlight' won Best Picture the next year people were left to question whether that was based on the merits of the film, or simply the fact that they needed the winning film to be based around black people. Now obviously people are questioning the same things over Guillermo del Toro and his film 'The Shape of Water'. Is it actually deserving or are the Academy simply trying to include the Latinos in the mix this time around? These are never questions that should be asked, but unfortunately they forever will be now. So is 'The Shape of Water' the real deal, or overrated nonsense? It's somewhere in the middle.The first thing that has to be said is that this is a film that is trying very hard to win Oscars. That comes across very clearly multiple times. We all know that the Academy love a film about film, so of course part of the film is set above a movie theatre and there is completely unnecessary scene set in it. That's a part of the film I didn't like. What I did like about the film was its intelligence. When you look back afterwards and examine certain plot points and clues this is actually a very smart and well thought out film. Without getting into spoilers this is a tough thing to explore, but needless to say there is some very interesting reading up on people's theories you can do after you've seen the film.'The Shape of Water' is in a two horse race to win Best Picture tomorrow with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri' (as I see it at least). Personally I think the latter is a far superior film and deserves the win. At then end of the day 'The Shape of Water' is a love story and I just didn't feel what I usually feel when I see the best love stories put to screen. Not a bad film, due to its intellect, but it's nothing earth shattering either.",7,2,6,4 March 2018
The Disaster Artist," Very close to perfection
","'The Disaster Artist' is probably the closest I've ever come to giving a film a 10 out of 10 and not ended up doing so. It's so nearly perfect and only one thing in my opinion really holds it back which I will get to a little later. The positives however are plentiful. I should point out early on here too that I am yet to see 'The Room'. I've been meaning to for years because I know it is something every film lover simply has to do, but I also know I'm not particularly going to enjoy it because the whole 'so bad it's good' thing doesn't apply to me in any way.So what makes this film so good? Well you have to start with James Franco's performance. It's bordering on flawless. In fact as far as performances based on real-life people go it may just be the best I've ever seen. How he got it down to such a fine art is beyond me. There are times (especially when he has his sunglasses on) where you will question whether they got the real Tommy Wiseau in for the scene. Impeccable acting.Secondly the script structure is a massive strength. Making a film about the making of a film can be a tricky thing to do, because getting the balance between characters and story can be nightmare. 'The Disaster Artist' will go down in a textbook as to how to do it for future film makers. The only negative I could really find in this movie was ironically Dave Franco's performance. I haven't quite decided whether he wasn't right for the role, or he was and he simply didn't get his performance right. Either way though it does have to be listed as a flaw in a near perfect film. Please see this film if you get a chance. It's too good to be missed.",9,0,1,1 January 2018
Zombieland," Funny, but not conventionally put together
","The only time I really tend to enjoy zombies in film is when they're done in a comedic way. 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' and 'Zombieland' are prime examples of how to nail this genre. Don't take yourself too seriously. 'Zombieland' finds itself a great little cast with a lot of chemistry and then the film just flows from there.I'm surprised 'Zombieland' is as well received as it is, particularly by critics, because it doesn't follow the usual formula of a film. It doesn't have a beginning, a middle and an end. It just kind of starts, things happen, and then the film ends almost in exactly the same spot as it started. There isn't a mission trying to be accomplished by these characters or a place they're trying to get to (well there kind of is, but not really if you know what I mean). It didn't really bother me, but I thought it would bother other people more.I think when making 'Zombieland' they just set out to make a film as fun as they could, and kudos to them for that. This cast works and they seem to be given free rein for 90 minutes. While I did enjoy it, I suspect it won't be hugely memorable for me. A good way to kill some time on a rainy day though perhaps.",7,1,2,22 October 2019
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Great movie but too long!!!
","From the first scene of the movie you can tell that Mr and Mrs Smith is going to be a fun ride - and it is, but the fun was slightly ruined by just pushing it 15-20 minutes too far. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie prove that they are absolute geniuses at making a film interesting and fun with their roles as Mr and Mrs Smith. Their obvious actual connection and witty lines make this movie what it is. Scenes such as the one where Jolie bends down on her knees and Pitt smiles to the camera get the director a great mark from me because he obviously realized what this movie needed to be - fun (and yes I know I'm sounding like a stuck record).In all seriousness Mr and Mrs Smith was well done on everyone's part, not just Jolie and Pitt's and there is not possibly a type of person out there that could honestly say they didn't enjoy this movie at least a little bit after they watched it. So watch it!",9,2,6,17 June 2005
American Made," A strong yet unmemorable film
","I was very pleased to see that 'American Made' had an R rating. Even though it certainly doesn't utilise it to the full extent that some other films would've, it's just nice to know that anything can happen and anything can be said. It really is becoming a necessity for a film to be watchable. 'American Made' is a slightly above average film that I enjoyed slightly more than I anticipated I would.Tom Cruise is in good (perhaps not great) form here. He's his usual charming self in a movie that relies very heavily on his ability to be entertaining. He's given some pretty decent dialogue to work with for the most part which helps. The film was actually a lot funnier that I expected it to be. It almost borders on being a comedy at times.The structuring is bit messy at times. It also runs 10-15 minutes longer than I feel it needed to. Some good pacing does help cover that up however. Clearly this a true story that takes some liberties to make for a more entertaining version of the events that actually transpired. At least they were up front about that fact. I wouldn't describe 'American Made' as a must-watch film, but if you do find yourself watching it I'd suggest you're likely to have an enjoyable enough time.",7,0,1,18 December 2018
The Witch," Had hoped for more
","Since the beginning of filmmaking Hollywood has struggled to deal with the subject of witches. In recent decades they have mostly just been used as a source for light humour and even children's films. Films like 'Practical Magic' and of course the 'Harry Potter' series have taken a mostly harmless attitude towards the subject, and the audiences have seemed satisfied. I am currently watching season three of 'American Horror Story' titled 'Coven'. Going into it I had pictured (and hoped for) quite a dark overall theme. Unfortunately what I have found is again a lighter approach, and I would have to say I'm not overly enjoying it. So when I heard there was a film coming out titled 'The Witch', which seemed from the trailers to have a very dark approach taken, I was excited. Did it live up to my expectations? Sort of.I left 'The Witch' with a sort of 'Meh' feeling, despite having enjoyed it for the most part. Frankly, I had hoped for more. I was aware this wasn't going to be your standard type of horror film with jump scares left, right and centre. An atmospheric horror is fine by me and something I often enjoy more than the alternative. But for me the atmosphere wasn't really having an affect either. It didn't help the dialogue was nothing short of exhausting to listen to and take meaning from. For me that element unfortunately took away from what the film was trying to achieve. It had to be there, it's simply unfortunate.There was a little bit of a mystery element surrounding things, which was probably the aspect I enjoyed most about the film. That may have lead a little to the 'Meh' feeling I got too though, as I felt the mystery never really came to much. The acting was superb, it would have to be said, and that side of things did a terrific job in covering up what could otherwise be considered a very slow-burning story at times. After the film I was left to ask myself a question. Are witches a potentially scary film subject? I'm yet to be convinced they are.",6,6,14,30 April 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Fascinating insight
","Zero Dark Thirty was originally supposed to be about the unsuccessful decade-long manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. That would've been OK. But on May 2 2011, when the world was celebrating, I can guarantee the filmmakers of Zero Dark Thirty were celebrating twice as hard. They'd just had their film completely rewritten in the space of half an hour. Now with a much more satisfying synopsis and a subject the world would be fascinated to see a re-enactment of, they were onto something special. The film is basically a two hour build-up to the main event, the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. But it's also more than that. There's some intriguing insight given into what went down over the course of ten years and it has caused a lot of controversy, but no one can deny that it's a very well made film.Kathryn Bigelow is making a big name for herself in Hollywood these days. Her last film was 2008's Academy Award's Best Picture winner 'The Hurt Locker' and now she's followed it up with another Best Picture nominated film. There's nothing feminine about her directing style. It's just as hard-hitting, and at times brutal, as any male director in Hollywood and occasionally even more so. The torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, while not taken too far, are realistic and effective. They serve their purpose well. If Bigelow can follow this up with a third success in a row then her name might just start to be mentioned alongside the greats. I'm sure a lot of people will be keeping a close eye on what she chooses to explore next.Jessica Chastain has been nominated for another Best Actress award this year at the Oscars for Zero Dark Thirty and is even in contention to win the award. I didn't think she was anything on the likes of Emmanuelle Riva personally, but I do think she's in golden form at the moment (much like Bigelow) and it won't be long before she wins herself a much deserved Oscar. As far as liking the film goes I'd suggest it's about as simple as this: if the concept of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden interests you, you'll like the film. If it doesn't, you won't. It was a touch long for my liking and I feel it could've had 15 minutes shaved off it to appeal to an ever wider audience who might not have the patience of others. Overall though an effective, engaging and fascinating piece of cinema.",8,1,5,16 February 2013
Steve Jobs," Perfectly written and everything goes from there
","I remember before 'The Social Network' came out people couldn't imagine how you could make an interesting screenplay out of the creation of Facebook. However they had underestimated Aaron Sorkin and soon after its release realised their mistake. The dialogue he writes and the pacing of his storytelling is second only to Christopher and Jonathan Nolan in my opinion. 'Steve Jobs' is another fine example of his talents. He tells the story in a unique way, dividing the story into three parts, and it works. Simple as that. Danny Boyle's direction is also excellent it has to be said but most of that stems from the great script he had to work with.Michael Fassbender has been nominated for Best Actor in a Lead role at the Academy awards. He is indeed excellent. His performance is snappy and on point delivering the wonderfully written dialogue in convincing fashion. Sadly for him this is DiCaprio's year and no one is taking that award away from him. Kate WInslet has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. I didn't think she was overly impressive. She did her thing well enough but I was never blown away and there was no one scene that made me stand up and take notice. I don't think she's done enough to knock Alicia Vikander off her perch.The wonderful pacing makes the two hour runtime fly by. Even if you don't have much of an interest in Steve Jobs and his story (like I don't overly) you can still enjoy it and get an insight into what the man was like. People can make up their own opinion on whether he was a good man or not. No one could deny he had his issues but they also couldn't deny there was a strong level of genius behind it all. Watch the film and make up your mind for yourself. You won't regret it.",9,27,51,24 February 2016
War of the Worlds," A film of two halves!!!
","War of the Worlds starts out great - it's exciting, intriguing, things are happening and happening fast - but then as soon as Tim Robbins enters the movie everything just becomes stale. It begins to turn into another type of movie entirely and a far less exciting one at that. Something good the second half did contain (as well as the first) was an outstanding performance from the young Dakota Fanning. The movies special effect, it must be said, are pretty special but another thing which lets it down is the confusion of the storyline. The end might as well have been in French it was that confusing.My recommendation - watch the movie until Tim Robbins comes into then leave and check out what happened later on an IMDb message board.",8,1,4,1 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," Where is Django when you need him?
","'12 Years a Slave' is a hard-hitting, honest film told passionately through the eyes of director Steve McQueen. It tells the true story of a free black man, Solomon Northup, who is abducted and sold into slavery. It is engaging and captivating and never relents for a second. It is very difficult to watch at times and never for the faint-hearted.The only real issue it has is that it's rather unsatisfying. Unlike 2012's 'Django Unchained' this film doesn't circle back and wrap things up nice and neatly for us at the end. We are shown our main character, Northup, returned to his family, but never get any vengeance on the evil characters we have come to know and hate during the course of the film. In fact, text is even shown at the end of the film before the credits to confirm that no justice whatsoever was attained against the abductors or the slave owners. This is historically accurate and how the film needed to be told, there's no doubt about that. But it doesn't change the fact that it is unsatisfying.The two choices for ending a film like this are either a win-win or a lose-lose for a director, depending on how you choose to look at it. Quentin Tarantino's approach of giving the audience an extremely gratifying ending, was much appreciated by his audiences and fit the narrative. But he was never going to win Best Picture with his film. McQueen takes the gritty approach, and whilst I know that I'd much rather watch 'Django Unchained' again over this any day of the week (for the above reasons), he's quite likely to get the most coveted prize of all, a Best Picture win at the Oscars. I'm not entirely sure which approach I'd prefer to take given the opportunity.The acting is brilliant. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o were all outstanding and deserve their respective Oscar nominations. Nyong'o was probably the best of the lot for me and fittingly has the best chance of taking home the award. Ejiofor carries the film excellently and his final scene is exceedingly moving.'12 Years a Slave' is quite likely to win Best Picture at the Oscars next month. As always there will be divided opinion over whether that should be the case. Personally, I don't think it is the best film out of the nominees, but it may just be the most important. There are a lot of 'based on a true story' nominees up for Best Picture this year, but it's safe to say none of those stories will hit you anywhere near as hard as this one will.",8,0,2,14 February 2014
Sausage Party," Wildly unfunny
","I'm a huge fan of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. The pair have delivered some of my favorite movies over the last decade. The thought of an R rated comedy also appealed to me. I'm a big fan of 'Family Guy', 'American Dad', 'South Park' etc. and would happily watch a feature length film of them with an R rating (the 'South Park' feature film is one of my favourites of all time). So all the signs were positive going into 'Sausage Party'. Then the movie started and it got off to quite a clunky, awkward and stunted beginning. That's okay though I thought, they'll ease into things as it goes along and the jokes will start to flow. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. At about the halfway point I realised I hadn't laughed once, didn't care in the slightest about the story, and was frankly bored out of my mind. What was this nonsense? What part of this exactly was I supposed to be finding funny? Did they think that the concept alone, of food being alive, could carry an entire 90 minutes of film, and that consequently they didn't have to write any real jokes? That's how it came across. I read that Seth Rogen had a hard time getting this picked up by film studios because of its dark nature. I now suspect they were just being polite in saying that was the reason, and truthfully they just knew that it was an incredibly weak script. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It won't put me off anyone involved, but I do hope they steer clear of the animated genre from now on. Stick to what you do best. You're brilliant at that.",3,9,21,26 October 2016
Joker," A very dark and gritty look at the creation of the greatest character ever put to film
","I always remember when 'The Dark Knight' was made Christopher Nolan saying that they made a decision very early on not to explore the Joker's origins. I always thought that was such brilliant decision because the less known about the character the more intriguing he is. So when I found out a 'Joker' origin movie was coming I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Interestingly, now that I've watched the film, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. It is a really well made film and I feel like that is its saving grace. If it wasn't well made people would be saying this film should never have been made.Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of his life. What a treat it must be for an actor to be asked to play this character (Jared Leto aside of course). He is masterful to watch and considering he's onscreen for basically every second of the two hour runtime, the fact that he never makes a misstep is quite incredible. Robert De Niro on the other hand was one of the only bad things about this movie. Completely miscast and boy has he lost his acting talents. It was quite hard to watch at times.This is a very dark film. I'm so glad they gave them an R rating to work with. The film wouldn't be what it is without it. Be prepared though for a very depressing ride for the majority of the film. This isn't your typical upbeat 'Joker' that you're used to. It ca even be a little uncomfortable to watch at certain points. I would have really liked this to be another hour long and actually got to explore more of him once he actually became 'Joker'. It felt like we did all the hard work to get to that point and then only got a snippet of the payoff we wanted and deserved. Still though, this is a very fine film that is well worth your time and money.",8,6,17,4 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," Keeps all the charm and fun of the original
","'Pitch Perfect' was a bit of a sleeper hit. I hadn't even heard of it when two people I knew told me it was their new favourite film in quick succession. It didn't sound like my kind of a movie but I thought I'd give it a go nevertheless. To my surprise I found myself really enjoying it and so was quite pleased to see they were making a sequel. Sequels are notorious for losing the magic of the original, particularly comedies which seem on a hiding to nothing most of the time. However, I found myself enjoying this one just as much as I had the original. Nearly the full cast had returned (always a good sign) and there were a few adjustments to the amount of lines particular characters were getting, determined by how popular they were in the first. The character 'Fat Amy' who was a real fan-favourite in the original had a very noticeable increase in lines. Elizabeth Banks took over the directing role for this one, in her first full feature film at the helm. I think she did a pretty good job for the most part. One thing I'd suggest she got wrong though was the final performance by the 'Bellas'. It simply wasn't good enough to justify winning the World Championship. In fact one of the few other performances we actually see in full by 'Das Sound Machine' was noticeably better. We were supposed to be swayed by the crowd simply cheering louder for the 'Bellas' but that wasn't fooling any intelligent audience member.This was one of the only real flaws though. Most of the jokes landed very well, the singing performances were very entertaining and the choice of songs throughout was spot-on and really got the audience into a jovial mood. There's also a charm about these movies that can be rare to come across these days. I really like this series and eagerly look forward to the third installment.",9,16,25,9 January 2016
Whiplash," Simmons is mesmerising
","The theme in 'Whiplash' could apply to anything at all in the world almost and I think that's part of what has made the film so popular. The movie chooses drumming as the subject for this particular story but showcases it in a way that makes people think 'wow, I wonder if I had someone to push me at *insert hobby/passion* and I was willing to devote my life to it, could I be the greatest of all time?' It's an interesting notion. The answer sadly for 99.9% of people would still be no, but what's to stop them trying? Was the character in the movie ever going to be one of the greatest of all time? That's up for the viewer to decide but it doesn't even really matter. What matters is that he had both the person to drive him and also the capability to devote himself to it. So one way or the other, he was going to find out. J.K Simmons has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the the Academy Awards for his role in 'Whiplash' and is almost certainly to win. And rightly so. He is absolutely perfect in his role with shades of R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket' coming to mind. Every scene he is in is captivating to watch. We the viewer are actually as nervous as the characters are supposed to be at what his character will say or do to them next. A real pleasure to watch.The film is far from being simply for music lovers. I was surprised how entertaining I actually found the whole thing. A lot of the scenes (mainly the ones with Simmons) were very funny in quite a dark way but also Miles Teller played his role very well and was enjoyable to watch. The final scene is absolutely brilliant and tops off the movie perfectly. A deserved nominee for Best Picture without a doubt.",8,1,3,6 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The best film I have seen in a long time!
","When I initially saw 'The Wolf of Wall Street' was to be three hours long, I was disappointed. I had looked forward to it for a little while, but usually struggle with films pushing over the two and half hour mark. Finally tonight I worked up the courage to go in there and endure the three hours. Little did I know it wouldn't be an issue in the slightest. In fact the next three hours would be some of the quickest of my life.What a movie! The direction, the writing, the acting - all beyond belief good. Scorsese has outdone himself, DiCaprio has outdone himself, in fact the whole cast outdid themselves. Jonah Hill, in far and away his best performance yet (miles better than 'Moneyball'), was Oscar-worthy good. He and DiCaprio battled for scene dominance time, after time, after time and the winner was the audience. Matthew McConaughey was also brilliant in his brief cameo. His appearance is so early in the film that some could be forgiven for forgetting he even appeared by the end (three hours is still a long time no matter how fast it goes by).The movie is hilarious from start to finish. It tells the story of Jordan Belfort and his rise to fame and fortune through stockbroking. I hear it's creating a little controversy (especially in the United States), and it has to be admitted it does push boundaries. The levels of drug use throughout the film are quite amazing at times and the amount of sex and nudity are admittedly high. But that's why this works so well. It seems Scorsese had almost complete freedom to tell the story the way he wanted, something I wish so many more directors had the opportunity to do.It takes brilliant pacing from a director and editor to make a film go by so quickly, and I can't remember a case of it being done this well since 'The Dark Knight' in 2008. Let's hope DiCaprio and Scorsese collaborate many more times in the future because when they do it's pure gold.",10,1,7,3 January 2014
It Chapter Two," Not your average horror movie
","Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average 'fast-food' horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well.",8,392,630,4 September 2019
The Green Mile," Classic Stephen King!!!
",It was nice to see a Stephen King movie without all the ghouls and goblins and monsters. Don't get me wrong Stephen is the King of monster movies but it was nice to know that he has a great ability with just good story telling movies. This was an amazing film. I can just imagine how many people would have cried from it and I can't blame them. It was really sad. Tom Hanks was superb as always (still waiting for a bad film from him). In fact the whole cast was near perfect. Michael Clark Duncan in his best performance to date. The movie deserved every one of it's excellent reviews and didn't deserve one of it's bad ones. Only possible thing wrong with this one is that it can leave you pretty upset thinking about what happened for the next few days.,10,0,1,9 September 2004
Kong: Skull Island," A massive improvement from 'Godzilla'
","Most people probably went into 'Kong: Skull Island' excited about some King Kong action. I went in excited to see what this fantastic cast could come up with. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. All incredible actors and yet all in some way underrated when it comes to their craft. So were they able to turn on the brilliance? Yes, indeed they were. The only one of the five who gave a weak effort in my opinion was John Goodman. His character seems like he's going to be the star early in the film, but then fades into oblivion as things go along. The rest all gave great performances but the best of the five for me was Reilly. He really turned the charm on and was given some great one-liners to work with. He was definitely my favourite part of the movie.As for the movie itself I was a little skeptical going in. I hadn't really enjoyed 2014's 'Godzilla' at all, and knowing this was a follow on in the same universe had me apprehensive. Luckily though, this was a far superior film in almost every way. The first (actually technically second) time you see Kong in the film is quite a mind-blowing moment. The share size they decided to make him is quite overwhelming and impressive. All the creatures in this movie though are made absolutely terrifically and look great. The action sequences (particularly the one near the end) are filmed exquisitely and are absorbing to watch.When the 'Godzilla vs. Kong' film is made they need to make sure they lean a lot heavier on Kong and less so on Godzilla. Kong is unquestionably a superior character and makes for far better films. He's relatable is why. People see themselves in him to an extent I believe. 'Kong: Skull Island' was a very good film that I would highly recommend.",8,3,4,31 January 2018
Shooter," Good action flick with misplaced morality perhaps
","Not being the biggest action fan, but being a big fan of Mark Wahlberg at the moment having just seen The Fighter, and also being quite intrigued by sniper films, I decided to give Shooter a look. I got pretty much what i expected going in - and that was one of a couple of faults I found with this film.I just felt, while there was the odd little twist here or there, overall the whole story felt by the book. Maybe not so much predictable, just unimaginative and nothing making you say 'wow, didn't see that coming.' At times it even felt a bit like a video game with all the casual shooting and killing of apparently more than expendable soldiers.Which brings me to my next problem. Who was really the villain in this movie? Wahlberg's character killed one hell of a lot of people in this film. Usually writers find a way for the hero to continue to evade capture and achieve their mission, eg. finding the real killer, without having to do serious harm to anyone. This film however seems to throw that rule out the window very quickly, and while that does make for better entertainment, is it really right that at the end he is let go scot free, simply because there wasn't proof he killed the archbishop? I'm not too sure how I feel about that one. I'm fine with villains getting away with things, I just don't like villains being portrayed as heroes or vice versa.But squabbles aside this is a pretty darn entertaining movie. Wahlberg is fantastic as Bob Lee Swagger. So much so that I couldn't help wishing he'd been considered for the upcoming Jack Reacher film One Shot (also based around a sniper funny enough), in which Tom Cruise has recently been cast in the lead role. Which led me to wonder whether a franchise could be made out of the Lee Swagger role. While I think it would certainly be possible, there is perhaps just one too many similar franchises in circulation at the moment, ie. Bond, Bourne and hopefully Reacher soon. But nonetheless hats off to Shooter for being an above averagely entertaining entry into the increasingly blasé action genre. 7/10",7,1,1,25 August 2011
Murder on the Orient Express," Great cast, great trailer, great film
","I was completely unfamiliar with the story of 'Murder on the Orient Express' going in. I had of course heard of it, however I had never read it, nor seen any of the previous film adaptions of it. I am very partial to a murder-mystery however, and so I was very excited for it. Adding to that excitement were a tremendous cast (including my main man Johnny Depp himself) and a trailer that blew me away. Now all the film had to do was live up to the hype I had created for it. Did it manage to? You bet it did.The thing that took me off-guard was that Johnny Depp was not only not the star of the film, he was actually playing one of the least interesting characters in the whole film. What also took me by surprise was how much I enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of the character of 'Hercule Poirot'. He was captivating to watch. He left me undoubtedly wanting more. I would happily welcome a follow-up film (which may or may not have been hinted at in the film).There's a lot of fun to be had in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. While it is a dialogue heavy film, it is exquisite dialogue. The amount of memorable quotes in this movie are far too plentiful to count. The twist at the end (which I'm assuming is the same as the source material?) was probably my least favourite part of the film, however it did make sense and I get it. Otherwise though this is a very hard film to find flaws in. Definitely a film not to missed.",9,20,47,8 November 2017
Arrival," Didn't draw me in like Villeneuve's previous work
","Denis Villeneuve has proved himself to be a very thought-provoking and intelligent filmmaker. Both 'Enemy' and 'Prisoners' were terrific films that left you thinking long after the credits rolled. Now, he has delivered us 'Arrival' and gone down a similar path. There's certainly a lot to think about and consider after leaving the cinema. The problem is that unlike his previous films, I'm not sure I care enough about the story to bother. This one didn't hook me in like the others. I wasn't enthralled with every scene needing to know what would happen next.The concept of aliens in film always seems to be a popular one. People are fascinated by them and I suspect they genuinely crave the experience of aliens coming to Earth. So a film that explores that prospect is always going to be popular. I do think it can lead to some lazy film making in places though. Because aliens don't exist, or are at least not yet discovered, there are no rules that you have to follow. Anything goes. If you want time travel to apply, it's as easy as saying that it does. You can have them look however you want, have their ship look however you want and give them any physical abilities you so choose. Whatever suits your story best I suppose.'Arrival' is a very well made film. It's beautifully shot and terrifically acted. It's a sci-fi film that also tries to be a drama and draw on your heart strings. In some places it tries to be too smart for its own good and just ends up getting messier than it needed to though. I think the biggest problem I found however was the characters. They were dull and seemingly unhappy people. If your characters aren't any good it's hard to care. Altogether I think 'Arrival' is a middle of the pack alien flick.",6,0,3,14 December 2016
The Terminal," Really good feel-good film!!!
",Tom Hanks truly is a genius when it comes to acting. This movie just once again proving to us he really can manage anything. The movie itself is pretty decent but let's itself down with a pathetic marriage midway through which just gives the impression they're trying a little too hard to make it a feel-good. The issue of misunderstanding of language can be really funny and I would expect to see it used more after the success of this film.If you're into feel-goods but you're a little bit old for the Home Alone type then this is probably just the one for you. If you're not big on the whole humor thing and you'd rather see Bruce Willis blowing baddies to bits then I'd take a punt that this movie isn't for you.,8,0,1,12 January 2006
Parasite," You name a genre, this movie covers it
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.",8,663,872,6 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A unique film told with a lot of class
","Every now and then you come across a film that is unlike anything you've seen before. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on what exactly makes it so unique but you are in no doubt that is. 'Birdman' is definitely one of those films. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu used a very distinct style while filming this (which sounds like it was a nightmare for the actors), but it has produced great results. It comes across as quirky and fun and gives a sense that the unexpected is right around the corner. I was surprised to see that he is a relatively inexperienced director, as this could easily have been mistaken for the work of a genius of the industry who had been applying his trade for many a decade.The acting is also nothing short of superb. Michael Keaton is obviously the stand out in the lead role. He's in a two horse race with Eddie Redmayne to win Best Actor at the Academy Awards this year and I wouldn't be shocked if he pulled it off. He is captivating in the role and never has even so much as a single weak scene throughout the film. The style the movie was filmed in will give his chances of winning a real boost as well, as you can tell it would have been anything but easy work to make.The other two actors who have been nominated for their supporting roles are Edward Norton and Emma Stone. Norton (who I often refer to as my favourite actor) is nothing short of his brilliant best. You know a performance is great when you are genuinely missing that character being on screen and that's how it was in this. He goes almost entirely missing near the end of the film and it is a real shame because I never felt like I got any closure on his character. Stone is also good, although I think gets overshadowed by the two main actors. I have found the Best Supporting Actress category to be a little weak this year and I think this has helped a few performances get recognition that may not have in other years. There's no doubting though that she held her own in every scene she was in and gave a very solid performance.'Birdman' certainly won't be for everyone. The person I was watching it with couldn't stand it and left about half an hour in for instance. It's billed as a comedy but it's far from conventional in that sense and could disappoint a few people in that way. It's absolutely filled with inside jokes (some right in your face, others not so much) that are imperative to keep in mind throughout if you are to fully appreciate it. The script has certainly been well thought out and the dialogue is excellently written. It's the only film in the Best Picture category giving 'Boyhood' a run for its money, and while it is a slight outsider (it has roughly the same chance of winning as Keaton does of upsetting Redmayne) I would not be the least bit surprised to hear its name read out as the winner come February 22. I've always said the Academy loves a film and about a film (or in this instance a play - as close as they're going to get this year). It will be very interesting to see it all pan out.

The Big Short," McKay experiencing life after Ferrell
","I read that this is the first film Adam McKay has done without Will Ferrell as the star. That's an interesting piece of trivia if you think about it. No one could deny he's had a golden run thus far but he's also had one of the funniest men ever to exist in the entertainment industry to write characters for. Until 'The Big Short' that is. Now suddenly he's writing something unlike anything he's done before, a film dealing with the financial crisis of 2008. Try making a comedy out of that they would have said. Well he took on the challenge. Is it a flawless film? Absolutely not. But is it one hell of an effort? Yes, that I'd have to agree with.The biggest problem McKay must have faced in writing and directing this was the need to get a lot of very technical and very, to put it frankly, boring information across without alienating the audience and making them feel stupid or having them lose interest. He tries some neat little tricks like having celebrities play themselves in cameos that give a metaphorical example for the topic at hand, or even going as far as saying that we as an audience are supposed to feel stupid listening to the Wall Street lingo, because that's the way they want it to be. Does it work? It does, but it only really covers up a small portion of the film. I'd imagine a lot of viewers would have been left very confused as to what was going on at certain points in the film. An unavoidable aspect of the film.The film relies heavily on its characters to push through a lot of the jargon and create comedic relief so that the whole thing doesn't feel too heavy. While these characters were based on real people, they certainly wouldn't have written themselves in a story like this. Four Hollywood heavyweights Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Brad Pitt were brought in to bring these characters to life. Bale has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards. He was good but I feel he lacked a lot screen time and his performance might be a touch overrated due to a glass eye. The real stand-out of the bunch for me was Carell. He gets far and away the most screen time of the four and uses it exquisitely. He was nominated last year for 'Foxcatcher' in which I didn't think he was overly impressive. I think this year he deserved a nomination more than he did for that. Sadly he missed out, perhaps not enough make-up? Sometime I wonder if that's all the Oscars care about in the acting categories.In total the film was nominated for five Academy Awards. Bale's one, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Of the five I'd say the only one it has a real shot at (and probably will indeed win) is Best Adapted Screenplay. Every other aspect was very fine, but it feels like one of those cases where the film should just be happy to be nominated for certain things - perhaps Best Director in particular.All in all though, if you've got the patience and the brain switched on and you're in a bit of a learning mood, it's a film you'll enjoy. If you're just after some lighthearted fun to unwind at the end of the day however, I'd suggest staying away from this one, it's a full on film. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but if it is you'll likely love it.",7,0,0,21 January 2016
Scream," This is how movies should be!!!
","Scream is one of the ultimate movies because of how it is done. By leaving it so no one knew who the killer was until the very end it kept the viewer really interested all the way through the movie. Although other movie shave done it obviously, no movie has done it this well. And then by making it so that there were two killers it covered up for any one being able to say that that person couldn't have killed them because he was here or he couldn't have killed him because he's not strong enough. One thing I would have liked to see them do is in the credits tell us who was meant to have killed who because that has always bugged me who killed Drew Barrymore's character because she looked at him and I would like to know who she was looking at. More movies should be done in this format where you've got to guess the killer/s.",10,0,0,6 September 2004
Prometheus," An enjoyable experience
","I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but with 'Alien: Covenant' not far away I thought I better take the time to check out 'Prometheus' and familiarise myself with the prequel series. I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in. I knew there was a lot of controversy, debate and divided opinions surrounding it. I had heard it described as both confusing and ambiguous. I happen to like confusing and ambiguous films because they leave a lot of fun to be had after the movie discovering people's theories and opinions. The product I discovered however wasn't really either of those things - at least not to me. I followed the story pretty easily and the things that were left up in the air really didn't bother me. I was happy to wait and see whether they were covered in either of the two planned sequels. I did quite enjoy the film though I have to say. Firstly, the characters were all terrific. There was tremendous diversity in the cast and every character worked and played off each other perfectly. Secondly, I found the story and the action scenes really interesting. I believed in the characters motives and that drove the plot ideally.I generally think that if I can enjoy a sci-fi film, then it must be good, because there are very few out there that I do like. 'Prometheus' was one of them. In fact it has me quite excited for the next two editions in the planned trilogy. I just hope there isn't a 5 year wait between the second and third ones too.",7,2,4,8 March 2017
The Water Diviner," Crowe doesn't have the mastery yet to perfect things
","'The Water Diviner' is Russell Crowe's directorial debut. It's an ambitious film to start your career with. There is a lot going on in this movie and even a veteran director might struggle with some of the complexities of it all. There are battle scenes, a love story, a family story and an underlying message all being intertwined throughout. For a first timer I thought Crowe did a good job, but for the standard we have come to expect in modern cinema it isn't quite up to scratch.A lot of the battle scenes just don't come across as convincing and thus lose a lot of their effect. When a master like Steven Spielberg directs a battle scene you buy into it, you feel like you're there, and the movie is much better off for it. The love story is probably the best directed element of the film. I wish it wasn't there, as it really does drag the movie down and make it quite dull for a period of time, but regardless it is well developed and executed. The main story of finding his sons (based on a true story) could have been done better. The reason for doing so, a promise to his wife, wasn't milked enough and really needed to be put forward powerfully so that the audience was always rooting for him in a big way. As it was, the motivation to support him in his mission waned a little at times.Altogether it's a watchable film, mostly due to Crowe's always fine acting. Anyone interested in war films will be certain to at least get something out of it. It's not Oscar worthy stuff but it is a decent effort for a first try by Crowe. I look forward to seeing if he embarks on directorial duties again and if so just how ambitious he is next time.",6,3,6,26 December 2015
Marriage Story," An incredibly natural film that nails every aspect it tries its hand at
","It's rare that films come along like 'Marriage Story' that are so natural and well made that you don't even feel like you're watching a movie, you feel like you're watching real people in real life. Everything about this film, the acting, the writing, the direction, all combine to create something quite masterful. Every hand this movie tries itself at it nails. Whether it is trying to be funny, heart-breaking or thought-provoking, it always gets it right. This is a really good movie.Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and Laura Dern have all been nominated for Academy Awards in their respective acting categories. They all gave masterful performances and deserve the genuine shot at winning they all have. Best Supporting Actress is always the weakest category and it typically tends to come down to who gets the most screen time, so I suspect Dern will take home the statue. The other two suffer from having very strong performances to compete against and so both may come up short. I would be happy to see either of them cause the upset though because they are excellent in this film.'Marriage Story' is told in a way which asks you to side with either the man or the woman. I would be very interested to poll people on this movie and see who they sided with and thought was being more reasonable. It's a tough one but I know I sided with Driver's character a lot more. Whether men tend to side with the man and women with the woman, or not, I'd be interested to know.The thing I was most shocked about was how funny the film was able to be. Sometimes it was just a random line that cracked me up, sometimes it was an entire scene. There is a scene between Driver and Martha Kelly that had me in stitches. 'Marriage Story' is unquestionably one of the best films of 2019 and is well deserving of its Best Picture nomination.",9,5,7,2 February 2020
1408," Very unsettling, but missing the cherry on top
","Wow. The first thing I must say is that I haven't been this much on the edge of my seat since I saw High Tension years ago. However the second thing I must say is I left the movie with a sense of dissatisfaction. The reason? The last quarter of the film.From the time the spooky stuff started happening in this film I wanted it to reach the conclusion. Not because I wasn't enjoying it, but because I wanted to see how they were going to go about ending it. Not many movies leave themselves this many different roads to go down. Perhaps they had too many options because I feel they chose the wrong one. That being said it could've been worse also.John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer who receives a hint about the mysterious room 1408 in the Dolphin hotel in New York. He plays him adequately, but never really makes you say 'wow' about him. Samuel L. Jackson plays the hotel manager who heeds the warnings and does so very well indeed. He really sets the scene well for this supposedly terrifying room and has us unnerved before we've even seen what it's capable of for ourselves.What makes the film so unsettling from here on out is the combination of well executed frights and the unknowing of what is going on due to the earlier mentioned many avenues the story could go down. Credit here must go to director Mikael Håfström and of course the master of storytelling Stephen King.1408 mixes elements of terrifying horror, intriguing thrills and even a few touches of drama and the result is a very solid, entertaining film. All involved deserve much praise. A few have been put off seeing it in the first place by the seemingly unoriginal story of a haunted venue. This is a shame because rarely is the concept done this well and those people are really missing a treat.",8,0,0,18 February 2009
Straight Outta Compton," Rap fans will love it
","It's a commonly agreed upon theory that the worse of a person you are, the better of a musician you would make. 'Straight Outta Compton' certainly does nothing to dispel those theories. There literally isn't a good-hearted, genuine person to be found in this movie. Every single character is deplorable, it's simply a case of to what extent. Now, that's not an insult to anyone, these people would be the first to agree that they are far from reputable characters. And the thing is that that's what makes 'Straight Outta Compton' so enjoyable. With a long run time of roughly 2 and half hours there are certainly varying degrees of quality at different stages of the film. The ending is certainly the strongest stage. The emotional story line that develops is well told and certainly does tug at the heart strings. The final word spoken before the credits role will also bring chills to anyone familiar with the rap genre. There are portions earlier in the film that certainly drag, and can have you at times wondering whether certain things needed to be included in the story line, thus making the film so long. I think a very strong ending does a lot to cover up the earlier indiscretions, and fair play to them for that. If you need one segment of your film to be especially strong, you'd be crazy not to make it your ending.It's certainly a film that will resonate for people who are fans of rap, but will it do the same for those that aren't? I'm not entirely sure on the answer to that. Whether the story is interesting enough to carry the average viewer, purely from a story line perspective, I think would be split about 50/50. I thought the actors all did a fantastic job portraying their real life characters and I was especially impressed by the sound they managed to create with some of the musical reenactments. Altogether, it's not quite as strong as I had hoped for, but it still remains a very solid, and at times excellent, film.",7,2,16,30 November 2016
The Woman in Black," A lot of bark, not much bite
","'Meh' was the feeling I was left with at the end of 'The Woman in Black.' 'Meh' to the story, 'meh' to the acting and even more 'meh' to the attempted frights throughout the film. There's not a lot of good stuff here. The last 10-15 minutes raise the bar a little (at least on the scare front) and then a questionable ending finally seals the fate on this one and we are able to finally turn it off.Daniel Radcliffe gives a very average performance. It feels like we are watching a boy playing a man's role. Taking on a horror movie first thing after the 'Harry Potter' series seemed a strange decision to me. One reason could have been very few lines for him to learn, which may have sounded appealing after some quite long editions to the 'Harry Potter' series had him working long hours to learn them all I'm sure. It takes you to the about the halfway point to realise there really isn't a lot of dialogue and that that there is is quite clunky and poorly written especially for a period piece.The biggest annoyance this film provides however is the countless amount of attempted scares (mostly on Radcliffe's character) which come to absolutely nothing. Soon nothing becomes frightening in the least because all this ghost seems to have in its armoury is trying to scare people. Of course it's revealed it can do a little more that, but more of a focus on this and less screen time with Radcliffe would have benefited this movie immensely. As I said the last 10-15 minutes pick things up a bit and do some redeeming. The ending is to each there own. Personally I was reasonably neutral over it, but if I had to lean one way I'd say I didn't like it as much. There are much better, more atmospheric and effective horrors out there at the moment (especially 'The Conjuring' if you haven't gotten around to seeing it yet), but if you feel like you've seen them all and choose to give this one a go just don't expect anything too special.",4,0,1,2 January 2014
Shrek," Donkey is an Outstanding Character!!!
",This movie is perfect for all ages which is what all excellent movies are. The jokes are actually really clever and original which is pretty rare these days. Mike Myers does an outstanding job as the voice of Shrek and I also thought Cameron Diaz was excellent as Fiona but the best voice of all without a doubt was Eddie Murphy's Donkey. The lines of this character are just outstanding and when you add to that how well they are said by Eddie it just makes for the perfect character. If you try and imagine this movie without Donkey it's actually a pretty flat and boring film with very few decent jokes and clever lines. Don't get me wrong Shrek has some stunners but they just wouldn't work as well without Donkey.,10,1,3,8 September 2004
Vanilla Sky," Great Acting, Confusing Movie!!!
","Very hard to keep up with this movie and even when it was finished I found myself wondering what had actually happened. While I couldn't keep up the story line I did notice that the acting was reasonable, especially from Cameron Diaz believe it or not. I found the way she slotted into this odd movie rather interesting and Penelope Cruz's best performance without a doubt. Tom Cruise not so sure about. He did well but it certainly isn't the one they'll be talking about when he dies (which would be Top Gun and Eyes Wide Shut). Since Kurt Russell wasn't in it for very long at all I did find it hard to make a decision as to whether he did well or not but considering he came in and tried to explain everything yet I was still wondering what was happening I'm going to say it was nothing memorable. But the stand out without a doubt was Cameron Diaz.",5,0,1,12 September 2004
Fifty Shades of Grey," Well executed but drags on a touch
","It's common knowledge American audiences aren't particularly comfortable with explicit sexuality in film. Look at Martin Scorsese's unbelievably brilliant 'The Wolf of Wall Street', all anyone could talk about was how much graphic sex there was throughout - completing overshadowing the masterpiece of a film itself. So I don't envy the filmmakers charged with the task of bringing the infamous '50 Shades of Grey' to the big screen. If they went too far with it people were going to be offended and if they didn't go far enough the fans would be let down. Keeping all this in mind I think they did a pretty good job.You'd have to have had your head pretty firmly under a rock not to have heard anything about the rigorous casting process that went on to find the two leads for this film. You'd hope with the amount of thought and effort that seemed to go into it they would have made some good decisions. I'm pleased to say they did. Dakota Johnson particularly impressed me. She especially nailed the early scenes where the character of Anastasia Steele is still shy and awkward. Her transformation through the movie was well acted and believable. A very impressive performance. Jamie Dornan was not the first choice for the role of Christian Grey, and I have to admit that before going into the film and based entirely on looks, I wasn't entirely convinced. Any doubts I had though were erased pretty quickly and he encompassed the role very well. He found the perfect balance between charm and having a dark side that the audience wants to know more about.125 minutes run time is pushing it a little for my liking because all the extra 20-30 succeed in doing is to frustrate the audience that we've already seen the extent of what they're willing to show us. It could never be said that this film pushed the envelope - if anything it certainly leans further towards the safe side. Having said that, had the film pushed any harder people would most likely have simply dismissed it as pornography. As previously mentioned I don't envy the decision makers in this instance. The actors sell it though and make the two hours very watchable. It also contains an interesting ending that I'd imagine wasn't an easy sell to the studio.",6,8,17,14 February 2015
Black Panther," This is considered Best Picture worthy?
","I remember being disappointed when 'The Dark Knight' wasn't nominated for Best Picture ten years ago, but also understanding that superhero movie aren't really what the Oscars are intended for. So when I saw 'Black Panther' had been nominated I thought it must be a truly incredible film and was looking forward to seeing it. What I got instead was a painfully boring, unoriginal and uninspired movie that shouldn't be anywhere near a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.I've seen some boring superhero movies in my day but this would be near the top. Twice I had to pause the movie and have a nap because every time I would try to watch it would put me to sleep. There wasn't one character I felt any connection to or interest in. The hero was bland and the villain was equally so.I can only think this nomination refers back to the #Oscarsowhite controversy of a few years back and the Academy's determination to rectify that. It's a shame because there are some truly great and worthy films of 2018 that highly deserved a nomination in 'Black Panther's place. There are very few redeeming qualities about this film. I would not recommend giving up your time or hard earned on it.",4,3,4,20 February 2019
Mother!," A little tedious to watch, but the concept is brilliant
","Some people would say you have to be a genius to make films like Darren Aronofsky does. I would also add to that that you have be a genius to watch and appreciate his films. By the end of 'Mother!' I felt like I had been hit by a truck. The film is almost hypnotic in the way it beats you to your knees and keeps you there for the entire run time. It's a film that almost doesn't want to be liked if that makes sense. The less you like it, the better it has done its job.Without discussing the metaphor this would be a very hard film to review (because that is in essence everything), so let's get into some spoilers. As I understand it, Javier Bardem's character is 'God' or 'Him' as he is listed in the credits. The film serves as a commentary on how (according to the Bible at least) all God wants is attention and to be loved, no matter how many people in the real world have to be destroyed, killed or blown up for him to achieve that.Now, to say that's a controversial subject to make a film about is an understatement. But you have to respect Aronofsky for being bold enough to take that plunge. There are some brilliant film makers working in the world today, but when you consider their career paths, a lot of them have played it very safely.'Mother!' is quite a tough film to review. If you judged it purely on its watchability factor you'd probably have to go quite low. If you judged it purely on the metaphorical story it is trying to tell, I think you'd have to consider it nearly perfect. I've decided to rest somewhere in the middle with an '8'. The only thing I can safely promise that you'll find about this film, is that it's utterly unique.",8,136,261,14 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Instead of bringing Superman up to Batman's level it has the opposite effect
","We all know what the genius Christopher Nolan did for the Batman franchise. He revitalised it and gave it new life. How did he do it? He made the universe realistic and created complex characters that were fascinating to watch. Now seemingly, all that hard work has gone down the drain and we are left with this. First of all, it is unforgivable for a film of this nature to be as boring as it was for as long as it was. If you rewatch 'The Dark Knight' you'll notice there is a solid half hour period of building up and introducing characters and story lines, and yet you never even notice because it is directed with impeccable pacing and intertwined with scenes of brilliant action. Director Zack Snyder completely fails in this regard. The films takes well over an hour to set everything up (even though there's less going on in this one story-wise) and it feels like double that.The film was either going to go one of two ways. Everyone knows that the Superman franchise has been completely lost for a long time now. The character is dull and people have finally realised it. How do they fix it? By introducing Batman, who conversely is at the absolute peak of his popularity after Nolan's treatment, into the same universe and hoping his popularity pays off. Only they went about it the completely wrong way. They took everything that was making Batman popular and scrapped it, while leaving in every aspect that made Superman so unwatchable - we get it, there's only one way to defeat him and it's been done a thousand times. When the action finally kicks off well into the film Snyder actually does a reasonable job with what he has to work with. The fight scenes are visually impressive but completely lack the thoughtfulness that Nolan created. Gotham looked impressive and there was a bit of a 'Sin City' feel about it that actually worked quite well. Ben Affleck as Batman was passable. He brought all the intensity necessary to the role, and while he was never going to have the acting chops that Christian Bale brought to the role, he still handles himself well for the most part and is fine in my opinion to continue on the role for the near future (he has a number of films featuring his Batman in the works at the moment).Overall the whole thing was a big let down for me. We weren't even treated to an action sequence to the kick the film off. Wonder Woman brought absolutely nothing to the film (I can only imagine she was a last minute inclusion on behalf of female audience members). The story was basic and even then didn't always make a lot of sense. Characters motives were often questionable at best. Altogether it was a complete misfire that I hope we don't have to sit through anything like again. I love Batman but not this version of him. I would rather sit through 'Batman and Robin' that watch this again and that it saying a lot.",4,11,32,23 March 2016
Blade Runner," Shouldn't be anywhere near the IMDb Top 250
","Before seeing 'Blade Runner 2049' I wanted to see the original 'Blade Runner' so I finally got around to watching it yesterday. To say I had hoped for more would be an understatement. When a movie is on the IMDb Top 250 movies list it generally is a very good sign of a high quality film. Unfortunately though some films slip through the cracks and make it for other reasons, such as critics giving it overwhelming positivity. If 'Blade Runner' was released today with the same story I doubt it would even get a theatrical release. Perhaps standards were just far lower in the 1980s.The simplicity of the story is what astounded me. Sure it's easy to follow (incredibly easy to follow), but there is also no depth and nothing worth thinking about and working out for yourself. We are treated to some of the worst written narration you will ever hear in film. It feels so out of place and forced and completely takes you out of the film when you are listening to it.The acting was also surprisingly choppy in a lot of cases. Apparently Ridley Scott isn't big into directing his actors - and it showed. This played a part in the fact that I simply didn't care about a single character in the film. Also the ending makes no sense whatsoever and again we are treated to a stupid line of narration going something like 'I'm not sure why he saved me'. There was very little to like about this film and I certainly hope the sequel is a vast improvement.",5,2,9,26 November 2018
Trainspotting," A very well made film
","Movies about drugs are always interesting to me. Being a pretty straight up person I've had little dealings with them in my life, and so find the subject matter quite fascinating. My favourite film to this day is 'Requiem for a Dream'. 'Trainspotting' is quite different to that film in a lot of ways, it's a comedy for one, but it also bears a lot of similarities. In fact almost every drug-based film seems to carry the same message (at least to me) and that is stay the hell away from them.The film works on two levels. Firstly, as a comedy. It is genuinely funny and had me in hysterics in two particular scenes. It is rare for a film to do this to me once, let alone twice. Also it works as a drama. The subject matter is heavy (at times very much so) and a brilliant acting display from the entire cast makes it work perfectly. As someone pointed out, and I tend to agree with, it never really feels like a movie. It feels like you are just a fly on the wall watching some very messed up people go about their lives.A sequel to this film has just come out and I will be very interested to see it. The film has a very open ending, that you would almost never see in cinema anymore, which will make it very interesting to see where things go to in the sequel. 'Trainspotting' is a very good film that hasn't aged badly at all, and in fact would put most modern films to shame with the class it is made with.",8,1,1,3 March 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," Doesn't quite have the magic this time around
","I'm a surprisingly big fan of the 'Pitch Perfect' series. I even enjoyed the first sequel more than the original. This time around though I don't think they got it quite right. There's a giant glaring hole in the middle of the film and that is an almost complete lack of a plot. Sure, one is kind of thrown in there near the end as an after-thought, but by that stage it's too late. The whole thing just feels like an excuse for these guys to perform more songs. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but when you can have both it's disappointing for it not to be there.Otherwise though all the things that made the first two great are still present. 'Fat Amy' is still in terrific form. Apart from the two commentators she really is 95% of the comic relief the film has, but she manages to carry it no problem. The character works really well and I'd have no problem seeing a spin-off for her. The songs were also good for the most part, but perhaps there weren't quite as many bangers as in the original two films. Not having the boys acapella band this time around I think quite hurt the film. 'Pitch Perfect 3' isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, I just don't think it can live up to the high standards set by the first two. If this is the last edition in the series though I think they can hold their heads very high, with a fine trilogy having been produced.",6,5,9,23 February 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Waititi can't put a foot wrong at the moment
","'Jojo Rabbit' is a really odd little film when you think about it. It's a satirical comedy about one of the most serious and dark times in human history. And yet somehow Taika Waititi manages to make it work. Now don't think that just because I'm a fellow New Zealander I will give Waititi a free pass on all his films. He's proving himself to be a very fine film-maker, but I'm far from his biggest fan. This film is almost impossible to hate though. If directing is considered to be Waititi's biggest strength, then his acting can't be far behind. He has incredible comedic timing and it is on full display in 'Jojo Rabbit'. Every scene he appears in is an absolute treat.The film has been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in a few days time. It deserves its nomination (I mean if you make a film about WW2 then you're about a 50% chance of getting nominated from the get go these days) but I can't see it managing to get the win. It just doesn't feel like the type of film that will appeal to quite enough voters to get over the line. Scarlett Johansson has also been nominated for Actress in a Supporting Role. This is incredibly her second acting nomination in the same year, combining with a Lead Role nomination for 'Marriage Story'. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category, but her performance here is admittedly great. She has a limted time to make us fall in love with and care for her character, and she achieves it and then some. A lot of years she would be a serious chance of taking home the award, but I feel that her 'Marriage Story' co-star Laura Dern will be too strong this year.The cast of this movie is amazing. It would take me too long to list all the great actors they managed to get on-board for this project. None of the them are a let down either. They all are perfectly cast and play to their strengths exquisitely. The thing about this film is that it is often so light-hearted and funny that when something serious happens it really takes you off-guard and hits you hard. You are suddenly jolted back into the reality that you are watching a Nazi war film. I had a good time with 'Jojo Rabbit'. It was about what I expected in relation to tone and I felt it worked well. It's worth a look.",7,0,0,4 February 2020
Lucy," Insulting and messy
","'Lucy' has a lot of flaws, but one of its biggest ones is the same reason they find it so hard to make a good Superman movie. Someone being all powerful is boring. When all someone has to do is use their mind to drop all the bullets out of a gun or throw someone aside there is absolutely no interest to be had in any action sequence the film throws our way. The movie tries to be a lot more than what it really is. It tries to be thought-provoking and intelligent but just comes across as a mess of ideas, with the audience insultingly trying to be convinced this is all possible. I'm not sure exactly how we are supposed to feel about the character of 'Lucy'. To me she's nothing short of pure evil. She will kill a completely innocent person without giving it a second thought and then in the next scene spare the life of a vicious drug-dealing mob leader who will consequently go on to take dozens more lives. She's portrayed as being the heroine we should root for but when you actually give it some thought she's no better than any of the villains. I had this same complaint about writer/director Luc Besson's other film 'Taken 3' as well. It seems to be a real flaw in his writing of late that he needs to fix. Overall it's a messy film that even Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson's star power isn't enough to save. There's an idea here that could have worked but it needed to be done in very different fashion.",4,1,5,7 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great pacing but I expected more creativity
","I'll start by saying I'm far from being a 'Star Wars' fanatic, or for that matter even really a fan. I happen to have seen all the movies to date and can appreciate them for what they are, but they are not really my preferred cup of tea. Hell, it took me almost 12 months to get around to seeing this entry into the series. All that said, I was still a little bit disappointed by 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens' simply because I expected more. I expected more in the way of a complex story and I expected more in the way of new characters. 'Kylo Ren' really didn't do it for me as the main villain. Obviously he had huge shoes to fill the terms of 'Darth Vadar' (this is even touched on in the movie), but I still feel like a better job could have been done. Also the story, while pleasantly easy to follow, felt like it was lacking in creativity. When your come to a 'Star Wars' movie you're prepared for a little bit of complexity.What I did really enjoy was the pacing of the film. It has a 136 minute run time and yet it feels like your standard 90 minute film, because it just flies by. When the credits rolled I remember thinking to myself moments before that there must be about 30 minutes to go. Daisy Ridley also immensely impressed me as the main protagonist. She was likable, charismatic and impressive in the action scenes. The only work-on for her before the next film would be her line delivery at times comes across a little fumbled. That shouldn't be too hard to fix.It's hard for me to guess how true 'Star Wars' fanatics are going to feel about this film, but I can tell you that for average folk like myself it's a watchable experience, but not a lot more.",6,6,11,22 December 2016
Unbroken," A brutal watch
","'Unbroken' is a tough film to sit through. I've seen characters have a rough time in films before (Donnie Wahlberg's character in the 'Saw' series had an immensely tough time of things), but when you know the film is based on a true story, and if anything is telling the light version of what actually happened, it's pretty tough to think about. I wasn't sure what to expect from Angelina Jolie as an only second time director, but was pleased to find she did a fine job. It was an unexpectedly hard-hitting film for a female to have to direct. There are very few female characters in the story and those that there are get very little screen time. It's a man's film with a woman at the helm and the results are impressive.Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the screenplay and it shows. It's a very finely written film. The pacing is terrific (the 137 minutes fly by), the dialogue perfect and the tension in almost every scene captured perfectly. Add to that great acting performances by the entire cast and there really isn't a lot to criticise this film for. War films are never going to be to the liking of every viewer, but if you are planning to sit through one anytime soon 'Unbroken' would be fine choice.",8,0,0,14 December 2015
Godzilla," A movie about giant monsters should never be this dull
","When the trailer for the 2014 'Godzilla' came out everyone was raving about it so I thought I'd better take a look (I don't usually watch trailers if I can help it). Admittedly it was a hell of a trailer but I remember thinking to myself there's no way the full 2 hour film can have this much intensity and excitement so it didn't seem like a true indication that it was going to be a great film. Sure enough I was right. An absolute snoozefest. The best scene in the movie made up most of the trailer and the rest was just filler.For a movie called 'Godzilla' the titular character really doesn't get a lot of screen time. This would be OK if the characters weren't such a complete bore, not to mention incredibly unlikable. Bryan Cranston was the only character that could have carried this movie from start to finish, but instead we are left with Aaron Taylor-Johnson playing a spoilt, miserable brat. I never once thought to myself 'I hope this character survives the movie', I simply couldn't have cared less about any of them for that matter. That is never a good thing in any movie of any kind.The film relies heavily on being visually impressive. At times it is for sure. But is that enough to carry a film? No way. From what I understand 'Godzilla' movie after 'Godzilla' movie turn out to be flops and there's a very simply reason for this - the character is ultimately boring. Once you've had your first glimpse at him and maybe seen him roar once or twice there isn't a lot left to see. I see that two sequels have already been green lit. I bet right now there's a scriptwriter who's been handed the job of those thinking 'why me? It was a stretch making one movie out of this character, let alone two more'. Good luck to you sir is all I can say.",5,0,0,29 December 2015
Life," A modern day 'Alien' made with a lot of class
","I was not surprised to read that 'Life' was inspired by 'Alien'. WIthout calling it a remake or a reboot, it is basically a modern day re-imagining. By the time I was old enough to watch 'Alien' it had aged a little too much for me to truly appreciate it, and so I felt I kind of missed the boat. There is something very unique about space films. Because it is something that very few of us will ever get to experience in our lives, and yet remains a very realistic film subject, it can be quite a wonderful thing to watch a movie about. Even without the prospect of aliens it is quite an unsettling environment. Throw aliens (and dangerous ones at that) into the mix and you should have a hell of a film.Having said that there is no guarantee of high quality simply based on that premise. You still need a talented set of filmmakers to make it work. 'Life' obviously had those though, because it is a very fine film. Firstly, it's quick to get about its business. One thing I do remember about the original 'Alien' is that it took a long time to get going. That is not an issue here. Secondly, the film's creature is created in such a way that it feels particularly realistic. It is very menacing, yet also very grounded and believable in a way that is hard to explain exactly. Only by watching the film will you truly understand what I mean.It is a well paced film too. At no stage does the story stall. An impressive cast also does a good job of keeping the audience tuned in. One character played by Olga Dihovichnaya was quite hard to understand at times with a very heavy accent, however that would be the only acting fault I noticed. Then to top off an already fine film, there is a very fun and interesting ending that will be heavily discussed I suspect. 'Life' is a very well made, tense, interesting and thoughtful film that I see the majority of audience members thoroughly enjoying.",8,17,37,23 March 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Good characters but needed more of a story
","Jemaine Clement has a very unique sense of humour. If you've seen 'Flight of the Conchords' you'll know that his is a brand of comedy that is not for everyone, but if it is for you you'll absolutely love it. It's an incredibly dry type of humour which is why I wasn't surprised to hear he was doing a vampire movie. It sounded right up his alley. And he nailed the humour, he really did. The only problem was he never bothered to accompany it with a story and so the film just feels like 80 minutes of improvised vampire jokes. I read that he and co-writer/director Taika Waititi wrote a script but never actually showed it to the cast and just let them improvise almost the entire thing and adjusted the script accordingly. For me they needed to take a leaf out of Larry David's comedy series 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' where everything is improvised but still with very strict guidelines of information that needs to be included to further the story. It works for him and I see no reason why it couldn't have worked here. Improvising everything including the story is just madness and it is sadly what holds this film back from being a truly great New Zealand comedy.",6,2,4,3 December 2015
Deadpool," Everyone can enjoy this one
","In 99% of superhero movies the hero himself is the most boring character (at least in my opinion). Even when it comes to Batman, by far my favourite superhero, I'm more than willing to admit that the villain is almost always still the most interesting character. However, this certainly can't be said for 'Deadpool'. Admittedly (even by him), he's not exactly a superhero. In fact the film ends up playing out as more of a revenge flick. Nothing is off limits. Cold-blooded killing, torture, nudity, it has it all and much more. The greatest thing about this film though is the simple fact that people who enjoy superhero movies will love it, but so will people who don't. That's an accomplishment.Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast in the title role. Having already had one try at the superhero genre, and failing badly, it's good to see he was willing to get back on the horse and give it another shot. I'm sure he's glad he did. The script is terrific, balancing humour, action and even drama exquisitely. The only put down I can find is that I would have liked to have seen a slightly more menacing villain. He was unpleasant, there's no doubt about that, but he never felt like anything of a threat. To be honest though that really is nitpicking in a nearly flawless film.",9,2,9,6 June 2016
Green Book," Chemistry makes the film
","'Green Book' is a film that had it not been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards I would probably never have gotten around to seeing. And yet I'm so glad that it was nominated because otherwise I would never have gotten to experience such a great film. This is based off a true story and clearly glamoured up to make a worthy movie out of a simple concept. The chemistry between the two main actors is simply phenomenal and makes this film what it is.Consequently both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Both are fully deserving. Both are almost unrecognisable at times because they lose themselves in their characters so deeply. I have a hard time imagining Mortensen winning, only because the field is so incredibly strong this year. He keeps churning out brilliantly performances every year though and he will get the Oscar he deserves one day. Ali on the other hand I can very much see winning. He had a tremendous amount of screen time for a 'Supporting Actor'. Combine that with the fact that he was genuinely brilliant and I think you could almost call him a lock.The film ticks all the boxes for an Oscar movie but I can't see it getting the win for Best Picture, simply because it failed to deliver the knock-out blow. It's consistently charming, genuinely funny, has a beautiful message about acceptance and pushing boundaries, is well acted, well directed and expertly written - and yet I still couldn't help feeling it was missing something. It never had that killer blow moment that knocked me off my feet. I wanted more from the ending (and yes I know it was based on a true story which limits their ability). This is a brilliant movie that just couldn't quite put the cherry on top.",8,0,1,4 February 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," One hell of a ride
","The original 'John Wick' was such a giant success that it was always going to get a sequel, whether it was pre-planned or not. In fact before 'John Wick: Chapter 2' was even made this was planned to be a trilogy with each movie following on almost immediately from the previous one. So what makes the 'John Wick' movies so great? For me, it's that they've found a very unique and effective style. In a world of very little originality, it's actually very hard to pinpoint a film that is like 'John Wick'. So many actions films today are just trying to be imitations of other successful franchises. 'John Wick' feels like it is very much going in its own direction. I like that fact a lot.'John Wick: Chapter 2' is one hell of an action packed film. It's almost overwhelming at times. In fact it nearly gets to the point where it is a downfall of the movie. You can only shoot so many people before it becomes a little tedious to watch. The action sequences are at their best when they are being creative. There is a lot of that, but it can get a little lost amongst all the constant chaos and killing.The story is very simple when you stop and think about it, however that's probably a strength of the film in a way. It's impossible to get confused because there really is nothing to be confused about. All that leaves is for the audience to sit back and have a good time. And a good time they will have with this film I suspect. As far as straight up action films go, this is about as good as they come today.",8,9,17,21 May 2017
Annihilation," Wonderful dialogue holds an otherwise forgettable film together
","I've never loved the sci-fi genre, I make no secret about that fact. Even though I can understand why it can create some impressive film concepts, it always bothers me that no one holds the writers to account. They can make anything happen in their universe that suits their story. That's far too convenient and an easy cop-out in my opinion. 'Annihilation' is a very heavy film. There are no efforts made at any point to make the audience laugh or even get the slightest chuckle. It takes itself very seriously.The question you have to ask yourself after watching a film like this is whether it is legitimately thought-provoking or simply complete nonsense hiding behind some clever dialogue and pretty scenery. It has to be said the dialogue in the film is its strongest aspect. It's well written and is worthy of further thought. The story concept on the other hand, less so. Call me cynical but when a film goes this far outside the box, it really doesn't demand a lot of time and thought be put into it. It's just too easy to do whatever you feel suits the story at any time.This won't be a film for everyone, nor will it be disliked by everyone. It seems to be quite polarising in that sense. Somehow I've found myself in the middle of the road. I didn't hate it, but I know it will be almost completely gone from memory by tomorrow. Nothing to write home about.",6,0,3,13 March 2018
Spectre," Mendes was born to direct Bond
","The Bond films since Daniel Craig came on board have been an interesting ride. 'Casino Royale' was brilliant, followed by the disappointing 'Quantum of Solace'. Then Sam Mendes came on board and 'Skyfall' became an instant classic. There were rumours Christopher Nolan could be coming on board for 'Spectre' which would have been absolutely mind blowing I suspect, but I can safely say that if he wasn't to be the one I was very happy to have Mendes back. He seems to have the style of Bond absolutely down pat. The opening scene of 'Spectre' is a particularly great example of this. So much fun and such a visually appealing scene. A great way to start the film and get the audience in the mood for the ride ahead. If there's any chance of getting Mendes back a third time I say go for it.There are so many aspects to any Bond film that you could write for days about it. It's actually a little overwhelming trying to assess every one of them. I liked Sam Smith's song 'Writing's on the Wall' a lot more with the credit sequence behind it than I did simply listening to it before I saw the film. Craig as Bond was as good as ever and I have to say I hope we get one more film out of him. Christoph Waltz in the role of the lead villain was good but I feel he was underutilised. They tried to give him similar scenes to Javier Bardem to shine but it didn't work to the same effect for me. I absolutely love Waltz so hopefully we will get to see more of him in the future. The script is pretty standard Bond, with some excellent twists here and there that should delight fans. There really never is a dull moment and the 148 minute runtime flies by, a sure sign of a very finely made film. I worried back when 'Quantum of Solace' came out that the allure of Bond was gone and that they were trying to make it something it was not and consequently ruining it. Luckily it seems that was a mere bump in the road and things are now well and truly back on track.",9,3,9,14 November 2015
Joy," More great characters with an inspiring story
","I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'Joy'. I had absolutely loved David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook', but hadn't enjoyed 'American Hustle' at all. This film certainly seemed to be more along the lines of the former but I couldn't be absolutely certain. After the first 15-20 minutes I wasn't having much fun watching it and had almost written it off. Then things changed. The character establishment period was over and interesting plot points began to be set up. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro began to steal scenes and then the always brilliant Bradley Cooper came into the equation. And suddenly a very fine film had begun to envelope. It's no secret that Russell is an expert in creating characters. His movies are filled with quirky individuals who are a lot of fun to get to know and a delight to share their story with. And what's the easiest way to bring your brilliant characters to life? Find the right actors/actresses to play them of course. So every year (Russell has become a lot more prolific in recent years) now we get a film with an almost identical cast. It's quite unique in a way, I can't think of another example of a filmmaker doing this, at least not in the modern age. And as long as the actors continue to get Oscar nominations out of his films and his films themselves also continue to be nominated I can see no reason why either party would or should ever pull out of this little arrangement.I mentioned earlier I wasn't sure which of Russell's two previous films I'd seen it was going to be most like. It certainly was most like 'Silver Linings Playbook', but it would have to be said it really is its own type of film. 'SLP' was a love story, 'AH' was a crime/drama and this was really a biography first and foremost I'd have to say. Lawrence really was superb in the lead role. Watching her act is almost like getting a massage, you just sit back, relax and let her work her magic. De Niro and Cooper were equally fine in their supporting roles and every one else involved was very competent. It seems to me this film has been marketed in a strange fashion that may turn a few people off but I hope it doesn't because there's a very fine film here that deserves to be seen.",8,6,24,23 December 2015
Moon," All the ingredients were there but it didn't quite work for me
","I often say Sam Rockwell needs to be in more films because he's an incredible actor. I recently realised how hypocritical I was being by saying this though, considering I haven't even seen all of his films. So in an attempt to do so 'Moon' seemed liked a good place to start. Kevin Spacey lending his voice to the film helped to spark my interest in the film and get me motivated to watch it. So did I love it as much as I hoped to? Sadly, no.Firstly, while Sam Rockwell's performance is fantastic, this isn't the type of role I most like him in. I like him in roles where I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. This one did not come across that way to me. I had the same sort of problem with Kevin Spacey's voice work. While it was pleasant to know it was him and hear that familiar tone, it really could've been anyone and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference to the film.As for the concept of the story, I liked it without loving it as much as I should've. I liked it in theory, but not so much in execution. I thought it could've been crafted better, both in terms of the reveal to the audience and also how the concept was played out after we find out what is happening. The whole thing ended up coming across a little dull and boring for my liking and the final third of the film just kind of petered out rather than ramping things up.'Moon' is a very good looking film though, there is no question about that. Add in a fine performance from Rockwell and a thought-provoking concept that will certainly intrigue most who watch it to some extent, and you have yourself a very watchable film. Just not one that I will likely be recommending to people.",6,1,4,17 January 2018
Her," A unique love story, not as groundbreaking as it could have been
","'Her' provides an interesting, and somewhat unsettling, insight into the future of technology and perhaps even love. It explores the idea of mankind falling in love with technology in the form of an operating system. It may seem like a bizarre world for us to ever live in, but is it really that unlikely? With the rate technology seems to be evolving I would suggest not. It's a good film, but maybe not as groundbreaking as some are suggesting.At first it's original, but once you come to grips with the uniqueness of it it becomes a bit like any other love story. Of course it's not, there are many thought-provoking ideas still being played around with, but the usual romance formula is still followed for the most part which was disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is good, if nothing special in the lead role.It drags on a little and could easily have had 20 minutes shaved off it. But for the most part it's a very solid movie. It's beautiful to look at (as most futuristic films usually are) and romantic in its own way. Worth a look, but don't expect to be blown away.",7,1,3,1 March 2014
The Nice Guys," No chemistry between the stars
","I often find the best way to gauge a comedy is to see it in a packed theatre and observe how many jokes actually get genuine laughs out of the audience. I saw 'Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising' in a full theatre a couple of nights ago and nearly every single joke landed, and landed big, with many jokes causing loud and extended laughter. 'The Nice Guys' tonight however, was quite the opposite. The amount of pieces of intended humour that raised no sound at all were more plentiful than the ones that did. I laughed perhaps five times throughout the entire film and never once more than a quiet chuckle. The main problem was a lack of chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Gosling was trying so hard in every scene to make things funny, but it was simply coming across as desperate. It wasn't natural. Jim Carrey overacts, but he still has a way of making it seem natural and hilarious. Very few people in Hollywood today can pull this off and Gosling is evidently not one of them. Crowe plays the straight guy, but doesn't add a lot in the comedy department either. A pairing like Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in '21 Jump Street' and its sequel, are what these guys needed to style themselves more around. Those two worked as a team and got hilarious results. Crowe and Gosling were just playing for themselves, and it comes across that way.It's not all bad though. There are some good action sequences and the story moves at a fast enough pace to be interesting. In fact the story and action are a lot more enjoyable elements than the comedy side of things, which I never expected going in. At the end of the day though I think this set out to be a comedy and failed in doing so. There's a lot of positivity in the reviews of this film, but don't be fooled. It's not as fun of a ride as a lot of them are making out.",5,8,22,28 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Perfection
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is the kind of film you don't even have to think about what you're going to rate it, it's simply a '10', no questions asked. This is unquestionably the best film I have seen so far in 2016 and incidentally the only '10' I have given out this year. I went in expecting it to be good, I had heard good things, and it still managed to top my expectations and blow me away. That's a sure sign of quality. Films you expect to be good going in have a lot tougher time impressing you than films you have no high hopes for obviously, so 'Hacksaw Ridge' must be a hell of a film. Another sign of quality is when the run time flies by. At 139 minutes, this is a long film by modern standards. However, the time just evaporates and when the credits roll you can't believe it's already over.So what makes it so good? Let's start with Mel Gibson's direction, it's impeccable. The pacing, the story, the characters, the action, it's all handled absolutely masterfully and just blends together perfectly to make such a nice viewing experience. The tone of the film is very heavy at times, particularly in the second half. The action is absolutely chaotic and yet somehow Gibson manages to make it all extremely easy to follow and keep track of everything that is going on. He also holds nothing back. It's almost unbearably gruesome at times and yet it's so good it's almost like he's sitting in the seat behind you, forcing your head still and making you watch.Andrew Garfield in the lead role was mind-blowing. He made me genuinely care for the character and sold me in every scene. The other person who blew me away was Vince Vaughn. I wasn't sure going in exactly what I was going to get from him. After his first scene though I finally understood his casting, and it was perfect. In a very similar role to R. Lee Ermey's in 'Full Metal jacket' Vaughn makes us laugh, but never at the expense of his character. We still respect him with our utmost sincerity, and you can tell the characters do as well. Again, we also care immensely for the outcome of his character. In that respect he was probably better than Ermey, but Ermey still topped him in terms of the verbal onslaught he unleashes on the soldiers.There's literally no aspect of the film I can think to criticise. It's as close to perfection as films generally come. I would advise you to come along prepared for a very moving film, both emotionally and visually. There are some very heavy moments, but if you're game, they all add to the incredibly high quality of the film.",10,7,14,22 November 2016
Sully," Flawed, but inspiring nonetheless
","Whether or not Captin Sullenberger was genuinely an American hero has been a much discussed topic ever since January 15, 2009. Some say what we did was incredible and certainly heroic, others will argue that he was simply doing his job (by the sounds of it he may even argue for the latter himself). Regardless of where you stand, no one could argue that he did his job fantastically well that day.'Sully' is actually a film I can relate to on a personal level. I was a flight attendant for a couple of years and during my time we had a flight that was showing signals of a possible internal fire. We had to return to the nearest airport and I (as the sole flight attendant on board) had to evacuate 50 passengers mid-runway. I can confirm that that is a harrowing experience that sticks with you for a long time afterwards. What these people did, both the pilots and flight attendants, will never be easy for them to forget.The film itself isn't perfect. The biggest flaw it has it that structurally it's a bit of a mess. A 3 minute event doesn't exactly lend itself to a film. The scenes of the actual crash are brilliant. They're captivating to watch and are filmed brilliantly. It's the filler that doesn't really sit that well. The board room scenes feel overacted and unnecessarily harsh. They are purely that way to add some conflict to the story. It was needed, but it feels far from natural.'Sully' is a film that could have been a complete mess without a competent director. Luckily, Clint Eastwood was up the task. I imagine his job was more a case of paving over the cracks in the script than anything else. He did his job effectively though and the end result is a good, if somewhat forgettable, tribute to some people who did their job fantastically on that particular day.",7,0,1,7 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," Caught me off guard by just how good it was
","I only recently got around to seeing 'Prometheus' and quite enjoyed it, without really loving it. Though for me to get any enjoyment out of a sci-fi film (my least favourite genre) is rare. So the fact that I had an enormously good time with 'Alien: Covenant' says a lot. This film was a lot of fun from start to finish.Firstly, the action really steps it up this time around. It is plentiful and brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott. The film moves at a break-neck speed and you've barely settled down from one action sequence before the next one is commencing. Also the aliens look absolutely terrific in this film, as does every CGI feature for that matter.Secondly, the characters are once again masterfully written. Michael Fassbender as 'David/Walter' is nothing short of captivating. The performances he gives as these characters deserve more recognition than I believe they will get. He's undoubtedly the stand-out, but there is not a weak link in the chain in this film.Finally, the overall plot line is quite brilliant. Less convoluted and confusing than 'Prometheus' (I didn't find it overly confusing, but I'm told some did), yet equally (if not more so) smart and intriguing. I love that this film has enough layers to it where not everything is always as it seems. In an action/horror movie those kind of elements can sometimes be put on the back burner, but not here.I would have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It took me quite off guard with just how affecting it was able to be. The two hour run time absolutely flies by and the credits are rolling before you know it. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, make sure you get out and see this film. You won't be disappointed.",9,95,186,11 May 2017
Draft Day," Would've been better if it wasn't so unrealistic
","'Draft Day' is one of those films that on first glance appears to be an inspirational sporting story with nicely weaved elements of drama and feel-good moments. Until you actually step back and consider the implausibility of what you've just watched that is. It deals in small elements of truth that have happened over the years, but is far from being 'based on a true story' (not that it ever claimed to be). Therefore the scriptwriters were able to take huge liberties in the way they went about telling their story. Sadly this probably worked on the majority of viewers because I imagine not a high percentage of people know how the NFL draft works and therefore were clueless as to just how realistic the trades being made were, and thus just accepted them. For them this was probably a great movie. For the rest of us in the know, it was anything but.You're probably wondering whether a film simply being unrealistic in this way can actually ruin it. Afterall there are very few movies ever made that are entirely realistic. The difference with 'Draft Day' is that it is based on a very specific and very real event held every year. The reason this isn't based on a true story is because nothing like this ever has or ever will happen. A love story on the Titanic, absolutely could have (and probably did to some extent) happened, liberties taken around fact. Ridiculous deals being made in the NFL draft, leaving the Cleveland Browns looking like absolute geniuses and the Jacksonville Jaguars look like the biggest chumps in the history of sport?

Dodgeball," Ben Stiller Deserves An Oscar!!!
","Terrific movie. Comedy of the year so far (if we just forget about Along Came Polly which was another Ben Stiller classic). Acting was definitely up to par for each of the actors. Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife in real life) was very good and looked the same. Rip Torn was good, not great, but Hank Azaria (who is also on the Simpsons and brilliant there to) who plays Patches when he was younger gives an outstanding cameo. Vince Vaughn did every thing possible with a not exceptional role. Certainly would have really helped his comedy career though without a doubt. Alan Tudyk was alright, but of course the star as in all his movie (literally) was Ben Stiller who was just so entertaining throughout the whole film. Whenever he was on screen you were excited because you knew it wasn't going to be boring. He seems to play dumb people very well in all his roles. What amazes me is how someone who can act with that much energy and enthusiasm in his role can change himself so much that he's able to play a role like his one in Along Came Polly which is basically the exact opposite. He's definitely one of the best comedy actors of all time even up there with Jim Carrey and Mike Myers.",9,0,0,30 September 2004
The Martian," More humour than I expected in a fine film
","There was controversy at the Golden Globes last month when 'The Martian' was nominated in the 'Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical' category, and in fact went on to win it. By that stage I hadn't seen it but had been told by many people (host Ricky Gervais included) that this was an absurd category for it to be placed in. So I went into the film expecting to find a deadly serious tone, however what I found was instead justification for it being put in that category. Amost all of Matt Damon's scenes are like a little comedy skit on his part. The rest of the cast play it very seriously but he is undoubtedly the star and if his scenes are all that way I see no issue with labeling it, at least partly, as a comedy. Damon has in fact been nominated for an Academy Award for Actor in a Lead Role for his performance here. He was personally helped by the category choice at the Golden Globes when he was able to take home the award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. On that occasion his competition was almost non-existent. Sadly at the Oscars it will be a different story, no one is taking that award off Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon is impressive in his role though, he has an ability to be charming without ever coming across cocky or arrogant. He's the guy you want to root for and thus was perfectly cast in 'The Martian'.The film has also been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Again I would call it almost a 0% chance of winning but that shouldn't take away from a well deserved nomination. For a film about a guy on a distant planet all by himself there is never a dull moment. Director Ridley Scott does a terrific job of pacing the film and the above average runtime of 144 minutes never drags. To me it felt like a cross between 'Armegaddon' and 'Cast Away'. All the elements of an epic blockbuster are there, while never forgetting about the emotional side of the characters and story. A well executed film that will be enjoyable for the entire spectrum of audience members.",8,2,4,25 February 2016
Furious 7," Not like the rest
","I'd be the first to admit I'm not the biggest fan of the 'Fast and Furious' series. I've seen nearly all of them somehow and just never really enjoyed them. Cars do absolutely nothing for me and the rest of the action I often find bland and uninteresting. This one was unquestionably different though. The death of Paul Walker in 2013 shocked film lovers. He was never the best actor going around, but he had been in some fun films and played some entertaining characters. 'Joy Ride' back in 2001 (incidentally the same year the first 'The Fast and the Furious' movie came out) is a personal favourite of mine. Of course it was reported that he was halfway through filming 'Furious 7' at the time and the film went into limbo until a decision on how to proceed was reached.If you had a crisis in the film making department, there are very few people I would rather have than James Wan at the helm to deal with the problem. The man has shown he is a class act. In a day and age when horror is all but dead, he has done the seemingly impossible and revitalised the genre with multiple franchises. 'Furious 7' is far from being a horror movie, and yet his film making capabilities continue to shine through. How they dealt with Walker's death, in regards to the film, was impeccable. If you didn't know going in that he hadn't been able to film half his scenes himself you would never have known the difference. I was quite blown away by just how well they did this.The film itself was surprisingly enjoyable. The opening scene introducing Jason Statham was a piece of brilliance and set a wonderful tone for the film. The action sequences were entertaining and well shot, however they did go on very long and I feel a little bit could have been trimmed off these to keep the run time down. Almost all of the cameos were well done, with the one exception being Ronda Rousey. Her complete lack of acting ability were very off putting and her celebrity status brought nothing to the film. Finally, the touching tribute to Walker near the end was quite beautiful and a lovely send off for the man. Well done to all involved for handling a difficult situation with class and aplomb.RIP Paul Walker",8,1,5,4 November 2016
