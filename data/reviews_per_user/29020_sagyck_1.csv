Mission: Impossible III," M:I # III: All For/About TOM CRUISE...!
","Mission: Impossible # III, is an excellent popcorn movie! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) take a break from the M:I. He was just engaged with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Suddenly, he received a call from his chief: Mustgrave (Billy Cudrup)! That's start again! A villain; Owen Devian (This Year Oscar Winner: Phillip Seymour Hoffman; really good as a villain but not enough scenes to do!) take hostage a M:I agent Lindsey Feris (Keri Russell; Ex-Félicity). Ethan Hunt with his M:I team; Luther (Ving Rhames; only actor with Cruise to appear in all M:I movies!), Declan (Jonathan Rhuys-Davies; Velvet Goldmine), Zuan (Maggie Q.)and all of them (the master chief of the agency is played by Laurence Fishburne; not enough used) try to save Lindsey... One of them is a traitor to the M:I Agency; guess who ...The movie travel from U.S.A. to Vatican to Singapour! Sometimes in a few minutes without any logic explanation... But with a good sense of humor! The Tech-Lab; Bengy (Simon Pegg) give a lot of good moment of humor! The action-packed movie is well directed by J.J. Abrams ('Lost', 'Alias'), but he overuse the shaking camera. Sometimes you not always see what really happens in the scene. You realize after... The other thing is the movie use too many cliché from the previous M:I movies! Many references to other movies: 'True Lies', 'Charlie's Angels'. The Screenplay is rarely logical! The lines too much predictable! We always could say the lines before the actor! The Movie is produced by Tom Cruise so like as the previous chapter all the action and the story is around the character of Ethan Hunt! I Know he is the central character but all the other actor(Fishburne, Russell, Cudrup, Monaghan, Rhuys-Davies, Rhames, Q., Pegg, and Hoffman are all supporting nothing more than that!), So All About Tom! Many of them could give to the movie so much talent and intensity, but Cruise is the HERO! P.S.: As in the M:I:2, don't search the plot! You will dying before finding it! That's a GOOD POPCORN MOVIE FOLKS, That's It...Éryck Bergeron",7,5,10,11 May 2006
