The Blair Witch Project," This movie will scare the hell out of you.
","I can say without a doubt that The Blair Witch Project, beyond all the hype and the fact that it isn't real, is the scariest movie ever made. As the movie moves further along, the intensity will increase and keep increasing as if someone off screen were slowly turning a knob. It's hard to comment on this movie without giving to much away. As the film reached its climax, I was breathing hard and my heart felt like it was going to rip right out of my chest. When it was over, I was shaking all over, frightened out of my wits. It may sound silly, but that's what happened. It even reignited my fear of the dark. It's easy to make fun of the film from it's previews and the countless spoofs done on late night TV, but watch it and you'll probably be frightened too.",10,1,2,3 October 1999
Akira," One of the best animated movies ever made.
","This is the movie that really began the process of making anime a serious genre. Though it takes a couple of viewings to understand the intricacies of the plot, this well thought out movie is one of the best animated films ever and a real highlight from the 80's.",9,0,1,3 October 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent.
","I had been waiting, as many had, for Fellowship of the Ring to be released since the film's preproduction had been announced. I admit I'm not what one would call a Tolkien fanatic. I haven't read the books for nearly a decade, and most of the memories of the novels has faded away. Nevertheless, I entered the theater with so many butterflies fluttering in my stomach that there was a chance I could have become sick.However, in the end, it was worth it. The cast and crew deserve all of the awards that should rightfully be coming their way. Peter Jackson proved his cinematic prowess that should escalate him above his detractors that only remember his early films like Bad Taste. The entire talented cast performed their roles perfectly, and if there was an Academy Award for Best Cast, it should go to them.Many times, special effects overwhelm a film, and even though their used with good intentions, they end up detracting from the picture. However, the effects used in LOTR only serve to enhance the storytelling and make the fantastic seem believable.It is with this that I have no doubt the upcoming sequels, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, will be just as good if not better. The filming has already been done, so all that remains is piecing the remaining chapters together.As of this writing, Fellowship of the Ring stands at the top of IMDb's top 250 films. While some may quarrel with this, I find it perfectly fitting. Years from now, The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be considered a classic piece of cinema. There's not a doubt about it in my mind.",10,0,0,23 December 2001
Spirited Away," A perfect follow up to Princess Mononoke.
","After Miyazaki created the more maturely minded Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an excellent return to some of his earlier themes, such as childhood innocence and how love and friendship can save the day, all without the typical shmaltz that infects Hollywood childrens' films. The film is a blast for older audiences, whether they watch the film with children or others their own age.Die hard Miyazaki fans will recognize the soot balls from the director's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro, which also strongly focused on childhood. Though, where Totoro was a lighthearted romp, Spirited Away is definitely darker, much in the sense of Alice in Wonderland, though it has nothing to do with Lewis Carrol's work. The atmosphere is entirely Miyazaki's own, and after watching it, it's easy to see how the film set a box office record, becoming the highest grossing domestic film in Japanese history, right ahead of Princess Mononoke.",10,1,2,17 September 2002
Resident Evil," One of the better video game movies.
","More and more, studios are turning popular video game titles into movies. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films tend to turn out between mediocre and awful. The one film that rose above the norm in my opinion was Final Fantasy, which, despite its shortcomings, still provided some wonderful entertainment.Resident Evil is much like Final Fantasy in that respect. For one thing, it never pretends to be anything more than it is, a film based on a video game that already has a B-movie plotline. Naturally, it's not going to win any academy awards, but Paul Anderson managed to make a film that should leave most viewers satisfied as long as they aren't too condescending in their opinion.The action sequences are energetic, which is an accomplishment when you consider that the vast majority of the monsters in the film shuffle along at about two miles an hour. Some of the scenes with the zombies massed together resembled a literal mosh pit of the damned.While the film doesn't contain any characters from the video games, it's obvious that Anderson did his homework when he wrote the script. The movie functions well as a prequel and to my knowledge doesn't contradict plotline of the games. In many respects, the movie was tailored a bit more to the fans of the games than the general viewing public. Perfectly setting up room for a sequel, fans may yet get a chance to see some of the game series's heroes in living color. It certainly deserves a sequel more than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in any case.To sum up, while Resident Evil is most certainly a popcorn flick, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. It has its entertaining moments, and if it's given the benefit of the doubt, it has its rewards as well.",7,1,1,19 March 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," If only life were fair.
","Grave of the Fireflies is a very sad movie. It really shows that even though the west 'won the war' and 'stopped the threat,' innocent people suffered on all sides. It's a well paced film, if a bit slow in places, but the message sent is clear.Seita and Setsuko are portrayed extraordinarily well. The pain that they endure really shows that life just isn't fair. Grave of the Fireflies shows that life cannot only be unfair, but unbelievably cruel. I just saw the film for the first time with a friend of mine who doesn't watch anime. He was just as moved as I was by it. It's sad that war causes so much pain for so many people. This is one of the best examples of a WWII movie that I can think of, because it's just so true.",10,1,2,19 February 2000
Princess Mononoke," Greatest Animated Film of All Time
","That, people, would have to sum it up right there. The animation is dazzling. The characters are wonderful, the plot is brilliant. It's an animated film with heart and goes after an older, more mature, understanding audience. Out of American animated films, very few come close to the heart this film has, the closest I believe is The Iron Giant. Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke, is what animation should strive to be, breaking free of the childish cookie cutter mold Disney has created, allowing for true artistic magnificence.",10,0,1,5 November 1999
