The Devil's Advocate," Satan? Call me Dad!
","The Devil's Advocate' is not your ordinary courtroom drama movie. It is outstanding in such many ways. Keanu Reeves, and especially Al Pacino, give us performances we'll never forget. And Charlize Theron - what a discovery! Of course she's very beautiful, and although this is her debut, her acting is terrific. The story itself is very flowing, not boring, and has a surprising twist at the very end. Maybe someday we will watch a sequel! A great movie all-around.",10,0,0,21 July 2000
