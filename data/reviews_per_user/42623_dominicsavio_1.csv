Source Code," masterpiece thriller
","What can i say, its just like a bullet train experience, massive & fabulous photography, extremely pleasing story with the great selection of cast, i love Jake Gyllenhaal, the way he acted is mind blowing. The most outstanding work of a creative artist Duncan Jones, he is the best.! There was a continuous consistency in performances. Ben Ripley the writer of this movie has a master mind, its surely defining the future, visual effects & sound mixing is perfect, Oscar is waiting for you haha..So for i watched lots of thriller movies, but i never watched a movie like this!! its just a Masterpiece.",9,0,1,9 April 2011
