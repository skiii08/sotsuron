Ali," Very, Very Boring
","First I have to say that Mohammed Ali is easily one of my favorite sports heros of my childhood so I'm not exactly unbiased. This movie's about as bad as they come. Will Smith does a good job but he's too small and not 'pretty' enough. Needless to say the fight scenes aren't very convincing. Add to this a choppy story line, poor directing, and a camera man that tries his best to upstage the cast. Actually, by the end of the movie I was convinced most of the scenes were taped by a drunk with a Handycam. The acting was good but with out a cohesive story to convey it's all for nothing. Some Heavy editing may do some good so it's probably best to wait for it to come out on television.",Null,0,0,28 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful movie!
","This movie drew me in. The character development was fantastic. After a short time I almost felt that I personally knew these people. The acting was no less than excellent. In fact, the characters seemed to have a depth I haven't seen in a long while.  Under the exquisite direction of Ron Howard, there were surprises at every turn. Just when I thought I had a handle on the plot and was convinced I knew exactly what was going to happen, reality would drop from beneath my feet. Nothing was given away. It was as much a mystery story as a biography of John Nash. Great Camera work and lighting, wonderful sets as well as little touches like cigarettes and swing made this movie come to life.",10,0,1,7 January 2002
