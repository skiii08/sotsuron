The Avengers," It's overrated because it's amazing!
",This...this movie here is by far one of the most memorable movies to date. The Battle of New York was a whole event I could look away from. Now that got me the most attention.,8,0,1,13 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Solidly good
","Deadpool 2 delivers well enough to be a worthy successor to the first Deadpool movie.Starting with everything I loved about this film: the jokes are on point. I'm was cracking up a lot. The action was amazing! All the cool stunts and fight scenes were Kingsman-level amazing! And finally, the ending was phenomenal. To see Deadpool erasing terrible events in the past such as killing off the horribly-made Deadpool mess in X-Men Origins: Wolverine or killing off 'Ryan Reynolds' before he signed on to do Green Lantern was everything to me.It looks like I love Deadpool 2 a lot, but no movie is perfect however.First off, I felt like Vanessa's death in the beginning was so dramatic and intense that it distracted me from the movie. I wanted to have fun with the comedy in this movie, but I just couldn't stop thinking about Vanessa.And secondly, I wasn't expecting the supposed X-Force team from the helicopter to die off that fast. Like whoa! Honestly, I didn't like that part. I had high expectations of an X-Force team to possibly form for a potential X-Force movie, but no it didn't happen. And knowing that some of those characters are from the Marvel comics, those hired superhero's had potential to be part of the action and have their own moments in the story. If the writers wanted to make a scene with superheroes falling to their deaths, it would've been wise to create characters not originally from the comics and let them be amateur heroes who fall into an insane death-spree.But other than that, it's a good movie.",7,0,0,8 June 2018
Ocean's Twelve," Better to stick with the heist topic
","I'd say Ocean's Twelve is a decent film in my opinion. But here's one major issue I noticed.I feel like the reason why this movie didn't do as well as Ocean's Eleven was because the story focused so much on the romance between Rusty and Isabel. The audience were expecting to see more of the crew to carry out a clever heist and steal the most valuable item locked inside a fancy location. Sadly, it was a lot less than what we wanted.",6,0,1,8 June 2018
Baby Driver," The killer track!
","Wow! I am so blown away by how this movie turned out! I have never seen a movie that mixes both action and music together into one whole violent musical rodeo show. Baby Driver successfully tells a story where the main protagonist has so much trouble on their hands and must do whatever they can to fix the problem. After watching through the whole film, I just want to go listen to music at that point.",8,1,3,13 June 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Just a good movie
","It's great to see more X-Men action after Days of the Future Past. I'm really surprised there was more story to tell after the timelines have split. Plus, the movie was well created to be presentable.The dialogue is always on point in the franchise. I'm also glad to see that Quicksilver is given a larger role. The ending scene in which Charles returns the memories he wiped out of Moira to her was emotional.However, there are some issues I had with this movie.Apocalypse was a little less threatening than I thought he'd be. I expecting him to be a villain who is the most powerful mutant of all mutants in the universe, yet he is defeated easily.Also, the death of one of my favorite characters, Alex Summers/Havok, was no surprise to me at all. Considering the fact that the character wasn't seen much in the promotional phase with the press and advertisements, I knew he wasn't going to stick around through the whole movie. Even when avoding spoilers, I just knew his despise will come up soon and it did.In conclusion, this is fairly great. Comic fans might expect a lot from these type of movies, but they got to give some credit for what was presented.",7,0,1,13 June 2018
