The Devil's Advocate," thought provoking...excellent
","Can enough be said about Al Pachino?  Excellent acting...for previous skeptics of Keanu Reeves' acting abilities, this should serve to calm your doubts.  All this, an intriguing storyline, intense special effects, and enough food for thought to keep The Devil's Advocate at the top of my mind for 2 days after viewing.",10,0,0,28 July 1999
