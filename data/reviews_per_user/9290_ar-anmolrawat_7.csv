It," You'll Float Too! You'll Float Too!
","No one can adapt the saga Stephen King has written accurately because it is simply too big to be adapted into just two movie, but still 'IT' will surely scare you. I just loved how terrifying Pennywise is. I loved how one of my favorite chapters 'The Apocalyptic Rock Fight' is there in the movie with a kick-ass score in the background, I loved the kids who played the characters, I absofuckinglutely loved the BGM and I loved the comic relief; it was hilarious. What I didn't like was the excess of scares. It's not bad, but whenever I remember conjuring, I think that's the way to make a horror movie, the buildup should be so terrifying that you don't have to put that much closeup shots of the entity. Next, I have had the same problem from Andy Muschietti in Mama as well. I hate the overtly done CGI. Keeping it real is more scary than those cartoonish transitions the CGI monster makes. Apart from that, I loved it. 8 on 10 I just love when they do it in the old school way! Regarding the climax ****Spoilers**** It was decent. I mean, IT feeds on fear and it was somehow justified. They couldn't have put up the orgy thing in the movie or it would have been banned, but yeah, it was a poetic thing and hard hitting at the same time. PS, I watched in IMAX and yes, the big screen helps.",8,4,8,14 September 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A Warmhearted and Refreshing Experience
","Marvel definitely knows how to pull off anything except *cough* Age of Ultron *coughs*. Never though watching the same friendly neighborhood spider-man would be such a refreshing experience. The movie is total fun, warmhearted and a treat for web slinger's fans. A reboot this early after The Amazing Spider-man couldn't have been done better.",8,5,11,8 July 2017
Dunkirk," It's not a movie, but art!
","It's not a movie, but an artistic piece that will surely bag many Oscars. I was a tad bit disappointed because something was missing from the movie. I absolutely loved the direction. Nolan shines here and arguably, it's all in his court this time because there is no script to the movie. It's all about how he has portrayed the events through his perspective. I loved the BGM, which is obvious when Hans Zimmer is involved. I loved the acts; so believable. even Harry Styles, a singer gave a flawless act, now that's good direction. I loved the cinematography. Those grand shots with that epic score was phenomenal. I loved the climax scene. It gives you goosebumps literally. I loved how it does not involve back stories of characters, those blood boiling dialogues, war strategies, lead characters coming out like hero or the melodrama that is common with war movies. It is about the rescue and that's what you get to see. Loved his narration in three different perspectives. But still, I missed something.",9,4,13,24 July 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A CGI Mess that Lacks Emotions
","Beauty and the Beast is a huge mess. None of the characters looked convincing enough. CGI of the Beast was poor and not for a single second he appeared to be promising; all thanks to the CGI and voice over. The songs were dull and I felt the urge to skip them, which I did, a couple of times. There was no chemistry between Belle and the Beast. The acts were over the top and not at all convincing. Bill Condon has managed to create another below average piece, which is not a surprise if you have seen Twilight!",4,7,12,8 July 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Entertaining but with flaws
","Pros: Its Thor and it will always be entertaining. Comic scenes are perfect and make you laugh. The second half has some great visual effects and good action. The climax fight is what most of the people dint like in the reviews but I loved it. Chris Hemsworth has owned the character and I can't imagine anyone else in that outfit now. Loki is funny and intriguing. Overall a good package but not as good as the first installment.Cons: Comic scenes were good but there were too many. If you wanted it to be dark, you will be a bit disappointed. As a character, Malekith was not developed properly. The story does not revolve much around him even though he is the main villain of the movie. The first half was a bit dull as compared to the second half. The 3d effects are not up to the mark and i was feeling irritated watching it in 3D as there was nothing so great about them that I had to watch everything with a tint of black.Overall if you like Thor, you will like the movie. He is my favorite Marvel character (of course after Tony Stark). Natalie Portman has nothing much to do except being a mess or the source of problems for Thor and Asgard.The post credit scene reveals a bit about Avengers: Age of Ultron and was worth waiting for.The post post credit scene is something you may as well skip as it's definitely not worth the wait.I liked the movie but wanted it to be better.7 on 10",6,0,2,9 November 2013
The Purge," The promising concept gone all wrong
","The concept was pretty good but soon, the whole focus of the movie changes to offer slasher material to the gore fans. The tensed environment may make you shudder here or there but the entire purpose of The Purge is lost and it becomes a usual house intrusion movie. This is where the movie falls flat.The kids are unbearable and every decision that is made in the movie is indigestible. If it would have started as a house invasion movie, I may have rated better but since it began with something else and finished off being totally out of the line, I would give it 4 on 10",4,1,2,4 November 2013
Life," A Good One Time Watch
","Life is a decent movie with some decent acts and visuals. If you have seen the likes of Alien, you'll see what's coming, but the movie still manages to maintain the thrill. A good one time watch, which could have been slightly better without the forced climax. That stupid climax really put me off!",6,2,5,8 July 2017
