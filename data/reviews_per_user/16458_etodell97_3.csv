Casablanca," Ehh...
","I've had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'd been working my way through all of the other movies surrounding it. I finally forced myself to watch it using the logic of 'it's ranked high on the IMDb Top 250, how bad could it be'.To clarify, I am not saying that Casablanca is a bad movie, I'm just not saying it's fantastic. I can see how it might be 'groundbreaking' and 'innovative' back when it was made in the 40's, but in todays world, it is not amazing. It's very difficult to compare a movie from the 40's to a movie from the 21st century, in fact the only way I know to compare movies is based on my afterthoughts. What qualifies a movie as 10 stars for me, is a movie that either gives me the chills at the needs because of how amazing the ending was, or if the movie keeps me thinking about it for days afterward. It's a movie that has an ending that is permanently engraved in me. Movies like The Shawshank Redmption, The Sixth Sense, The Intouchables, Memento, The Green Mile, Full Metal Jacket, etc...A 9 star movie is a movie that I find to be entertaining, but not quite as memorable as a 10 star. The 9 star category for me has a lot of good movies in the category, such as Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Fight Club, etc... However, Casablanca is not as memorable as any of those movies either. The movie is not, I just don't find myself challenged by the movie. The acting was okay, but nothing that blew my mind. I understand the message of the movie, and how powerful it was supposed to be. The movie was slow, too slow for me. It left me with the same problems as the Godfather; I think that the movie is building up to some dramatic ending, but then it just mellows out. This seems like the kind of movie that was regarded as the best of all time for many years, but, unfortunately for fans of this movie, there are many other movies that surpass this one. My opinion is that people tend to rate movies they consider 'classics' higher than the new blockbusters, even if both eras are capable of producing movies that are equally as good as one another. Honestly, the only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating than it has (from me) is because there was never a part in the movie where I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but there were scenes where I began to fall asleep. Five minutes after the movie was over, I found myself thinking about my plans for the following day, and what I planned on having for dinner. When I watched higher rated movies, for example Into The Wild (10 stars), I found myself putting myself into the protagonists situation, and then i found myself running to the bookstore to get the book about the true story. This movie didn't have that lasting impression on me.Even though my opinion is most likely contrary to every other movie watcher on here, I think that i have a valid point by saying that this moving brings nothing 'revolutionary' to the table, and by that I mean that there is no part of this movie that leaves me teary eyed, laughing hysterically, or piece together a complex mystery. The movie is just... ehh...",4,2,5,7 April 2014
The Intouchables," Unbelievable
","I honestly cannot imagine how anybody could dislike this movie. The first scene captivates the audience in a way unlike any other, by showing the unlikely, and genuine, relationship between two people who would appear to be, upon first glance, polar opposites. I have read through a handful of negative reviews and it, quite frankly, really bothers me. Not only did I find the movie to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it was also very sentimental, especially more towards the latter portion of the film. This is one of only a few movies that I have ever watched that has had my utmost attention for the entire duration of the film. Not once did I find my mind wandering off, and I most certainly was never bored. However, on a more serious note, I think that the movie also shows how, sometimes, the most unexpected people could become some of the most important people in your life. I would, without a doubt, give this movie a 10/10 and recommend it to everybody. Even though the movie is in French and I found myself reading the subtitles the whole time, I was still able to very easily capture the whole essence of the film. Amazing!",10,1,2,25 March 2014
Toy Story 2," Rotten Tomatoes
","So, I would like to think of this review not much as a review on the movie, but rather on the critique that I saw this movie receiving on Rotten Tomatoes. So, I was looking through the is it of top movies on that site and noticed how Toy Story 2 has become the highest rated movie on the site, which really got under my skin. I'm not usually one to be critical of other peoples opinions, but after watching my fair share of films, not in a million years would I put Toy Story 2 as my number one movie. I understand that it is difficult to compare Toy Story to most other movies due to the significant difference of the graphics, but (in my opinion) there are so many movies that are better than this movie. I do not understand how a group of critics who make their living off of analyzing movies have concluded that the movie deserves 100% on the ratings. In 1993, one of the most heart touching movies ever (Schindler's List) was released. This movie was surpassed no only by this excuse of a high rated movie, but also by 'The Social Network'. The next year in film produced a dynasty of films which included (Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, and Forrest Gump). Ultimately, Forrest Gump snatched the Oscar for best picture, but proceeded to only receive a 75% (ish) rating from the critics, as opposed to Toy Story 2 which was nominated for ONE Oscar (a soundtrack related award), which it didn't even win. So I have started to question what critics qualify as a good movie, because not in a million years would I (and most other sane people) compare the artistic depictions in Toy Story 2, to The Shawshank Redemption, or Goodfellas, or Fight Club for that matter. I am giving this review 5 stars not to trash the movie, but rather because five is the median of the possible ratings I could give. (Just to clarify now). It's past midnight in my room right, 85 degrees in my room, laptop on my lap, overheating. I'm sweating horribly due to the heat, but yet I continue my rant because I'm frustrated. I am frustrated because after watching my fair share of A-list movies, I wouldn't even put Toy Story 2 in my top 100 (and based on the rating the movie has on here, I can safely assume that most other people agree with me on this site). I guess I will end my rant by stating that Rotten Tomatoes has annoyed me. I have always been loyal to this site, and rarely gone onto that excuse of a Movie Review site.",5,2,4,20 May 2013
