Angels & Demons," Like an Episode of 'Murder, She Wrote' in the Vatican with Tom Hanks
","Tom Hanks reprises his 'Da Vinci Code' role of Dr. Robert Langdon in 'Angels & Demons.' This time around, the puzzle Dr. Langdon has to solve is the location of the Church of the Illuminati (hidden somewhere in Vatican City), and he better find it fast, since a bomb hidden in the Church is set to go off at midnight, destroying Vatican City. Mixed into the main plot line is the usual Catholic Church intrigue, a deadly assassin, and Ayelet Zurer (playing a scientist) as the female lead.At its heart, the story is a 'whodunnit' no different than any usual episode of 'Murder, She Wrote', except the stakes are bigger, production values are higher, and we get Tom Hanks playing the role of the unflappable mystery-solver.Even though the movie doesn't push any boundaries creatively and the plot is completely ridiculous, 'Angels and Demons' is an exciting, involving movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. The reasons it works are: 1) Ron Howard's kinetic direction; 2) the movie never lets up, there's always something happening; 3) great production values and locations; and 4) Tom HanksBecause of the pace of the movie, you don't really notice how silly the plot is, and even when you do, you ignore it because the movie is so well made. In other words: yes, it's a silly movie, but relax and enjoy the ride.If there was an Academy Award for 'wrenching an exciting movie out of not-so-great source material' then Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and crew would win it for 'Angels & Demons.'",7,0,1,24 July 2009
Two for the Money," Sports, Gambling, Pacino and Russo -- What more do you want?
","I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and I'm glad I ended up seeing it. If you like sports, gambling and movies, then this is the flick for you.'Two for the Money' tells the story of ex-College QB Brandon Lang's (Matthew McConaughey) introduction to the multi-billion dollar world of sports betting. Brandon starts out working for 1-900 number company in Las Vegas and soon discovers his ability to predict the results of College and Pro football games at 80% accuracy. This draws the attention of Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) the owner of a large sports advisory service in NY, who hires Brandon and introduces him to the world of big-time sports betting. And that's when the action starts.Although the story takes place in a sports betting company, and has some great scenes about sports betting, the movie is really about the three main characters -- Walter, his wife Toni (Rene Russo), and Brandon -- and the relationships between them. Each character has their own history and motives, and watching the events unfold is the core of this movie. The performances are great, you get what you have come to expect from Pacino and Russo, and McConaughey also does nice work with his character. Jeremy Piven gets props for his role as Jerry, Brandon's rival at the betting agency.'Two for the Money' gets 8/10 from me.",8,7,16,16 October 2005
Stripes," Long, boring and unfunny. Should be left back in the 80's.
","I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that 'Stripes' is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and 'Stripes' is a bad movie.Now, 'Stripes' may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.Why is it bad? Mostly because 'Stripes' is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as 'Anchorman' which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.'Stripes' further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in 'Stripes' revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in 'Stripes' funny either.'Stripes' is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's 'buddy' comedy I would recommend 'Stir Crazy.' Like 'Stripes' the humor in 'Stir Crazy' is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike 'Stripes' it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.",3,36,67,9 July 2009
The Dirty Dozen," Another silly war fantasy from the 60's
","This is one of the many WWII fantasy movies to come out of the 60's where a small group of American soldiers massacres Nazi's by the millions to win some mission or the other. Others include 'Where Eagles Dare', and 'Kelley's Heroes'. The actors are quite good, and the premise is interesting, but the way its carried out and scripted is completely unrealistic, silly and downright cheesy. That's why they're fantasy movies, as there's no connection to reality in any movies in this genre.This is really on par with 'Lord of the Rings', except instead of slaughtering Orcs by the millions, they're slaughtering Nazi's. Some prefer Elves and swords, others prefer GI's and machine guns, but its all the same. So, if you like to see wacky American misfits killing Nazi's like its no tomorrow while delivering one snappy liners, then this is the flick for you. Otherwise, I would skip it and watch 'Three Kings' or 'Black Hawk Down' which are far superior war movies.",1,14,39,16 January 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," There's a lot of good reasons this movie bombed
","I'm familiar with most of the great gangster movies that have come out, but I've never heard of this title until recently. Well, I found why I've never heard of it -- the film is long, boring and disappointing. Somewhere in there is an interesting story, but 'Once Upon a Time in America' does not tell that story.Basically, with flashbacks occurring here and there, the movie follows a group of kids in their journey from young hoods to adult hoods. However, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is too long, too disjointed, the story is not compelling, and the acting in the early parts of the film is atrocious (especially the child actors). A large part of the problem with the movie is Sergio Leone's directing style. Leone loves long stares and glances and wide panoramic shots, and unlike in his westerns, this style simply does not work here. In Leone's westerns these long sequences effectively built up tension while here they are just boring cinematic filler.It seems that Leone lost objectivity in editing because a lot of scenes drag on unnecessarily, making the nearly 4 hour running time seem twice as long. In the first hour alone there's more than 5 minutes devoted to a scene of a 12-13 year old girl dancing ballet while a young Noodles (the main character) secretly watches. Did this really need to be 5 minutes? The point is made in the first minute -- she's a beautiful young girl and Noodles is in love with here. Why stretch it out for another 4 minutes? There's no point to it unless you like watching young girls ballet dance.Soon afterward we're treated to a another 4-5 minute scene of a little kid eating pastry while melodramatic music gushes in like its some sort of pivotal scene. It boggles the mind why stuff like this was not edited down -- it doesn't move the story, its not cinematic and its not even acting, its 4-5 minutes of a kid eating cake.Lastly, whereas a movie like 'The Godfather' comes across as realistic and believable, 'Once Upon a Time in America' while ostensibly gritty and realistic is anything but. Certain events in the story are completely unbelievable and hard to view as anything but fiction, which is not an asset when you are making a hard, gritty gangster movie.If you like long 4 hour movies I guess this is for you, but to anyone else I would say that there's a good reason this movie has largely been forgotten, so proceed at your own risk.",2,150,285,4 September 2005
Lord of War," More boring Hollywood moralizing
","The story of an amoral arms dealer from New York could be made into an interesting movie, but this isn't it. 'Lord of War' is a paint-by-numbers, preachy, finger-pointing, 'oh, isn't the arms trade so unethical and it kills kittens and puppies too' piece of Hollywood garbage. Whatever happened to characters, stories and dialog? The big studios wonder why box office numbers keep declining, well its because of crap like this.Nicholas Cage stars and narrates the entire movie, as Yuri, the arms dealer, who with help of his brother, becomes an arms dealing kingpin. This movie takes you from his start, in Little Odessa, to his time at the top. It was a boring story with boring characters, where nothing happened. I couldn't sit through the entire thing.",1,22,50,10 March 2006
Sin City," Same old stuff wrapped up in a new package
","Sin City is Frank Miller's 'Sin City' comic book brought to life by the directorial magic of Robert Rodriguez with the able assistance of co-director Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino.Packed with hot young Hollywood talent (Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy) and cagey old acting vets (Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke) the movie is a technical and visual tour de force that has been described as the best adaption of a comic book to grace the silver screen. And actually, it is... the movie is a living comic book from the dialogue to the look of the characters to the camera-work. 'Sin City' is also shot mainly in black and white, adding considerably to the feel and the atmosphere of the movie, which is best described as grim, gritty, violent, sadistic and slightly misogynistic.And it's this atmosphere that causes me to question 'Sin City'. It's no accident that Tarantino is associated with this project since 'Sin City' and the comic book its based on are the children of the pulp movie genre which Tarantino popularized with 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and the 'Kill Bill' series. And this leads me to ask: how much sadistic violence is enough? I like flying body parts and savage beatings as much as the next film-goer but I'm starting to get tired of it because every new 'edgy' 'pulpy' 'gritty' movie now has the same elements. The shocking graphic violence, the tough guy characters and the hard boiled dialogue which once was fresh and new has been reduced to worn out clichés.Not to mention the misogyny running through 'Sin City'. In one scene the movie shows a wall full of chopped off women's heads displayed as trophies. Sure, it can be viewed as part of the story but what exactly are the filmmakers trying to say? What purpose does the scene serve? Its just shock for the sake of shock. Also, the women in the movie are depicted as whores, strippers, or helpless victims. Again, its part of the movie world but what point are the directors trying to make?Perhaps I'm jaded, but having watched more than a few of these types of movies I'm now waiting for a director to take the Tarantino formula into a new direction. With 'Sin City' the genre has completely been played out, there's nothing new story wise and we're treated to variations of the same old characters we've seen before. Ultimately, the only distinguishing feature of 'Sin City' is the visual style of the movie. Is it enough? Maybe, but not to me. It would be cool to see something new in terms of character development or story once in awhile.",Null,49,94,4 April 2005
