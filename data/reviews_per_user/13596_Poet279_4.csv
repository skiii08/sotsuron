The Blair Witch Project," Not even worth matinee price
","I think the only thing that could have made this movie even remotely frightening is watching it on a portable television, in a tent, in the middle of nowhere, with two people you wouldn't trust as far as you could throw them, while a bunch of film students with too much time on their hands stand around in the dark going 'Oooo-oooooh!!!'  Unless you can manage to see BWP in this setting, please, for the love of God, don't waste you're time!!  It'll suck you in and turn your brain to mush.  Not to mention the complete sense of vertigo you'll feel.  For God's sake folks, they were film students-shouldn't they know how to hold a camera straight?!  If you feel it is necessary to your continued existence on this planet to see this movie, bring a barf-bag and some Dramamine.  But if you can possibly help it, DON'T SUBMIT!!  YOU CAN DO IT!!  DO NOT GO SEE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!! Unless you are a glutton for punishment or want to be able to buy a T-shirt that says 'I survived the Blair Witch Project and only threw-up twice,' there really is no point.  If ya really want to see a scary/freaky/suspenseful movie that is representative of the genre, go rent the Evil Dead trilogy.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sexual tension among the Jedi
","I loved the movie, though I am a bit partial because I love Ewan McGregor. I admit, I am obsessed with TPM and I have no clue why.  I do think it was better than ANH, but not as good as Empire, and about par with ROTJ. Still, I am more captivated with it than any movie I have seen in a great while. I think a major reason I loved it so was because of the slash fanfic feel. Slash fic is fan fiction written about erotic situations involving two characters of the same gender, in this case Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. There is a great amount of sexual tension there, and it keeps bringing me back.",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
Velvet Goldmine," A visually stunning piece of homoerotic art
","This is a beautiful movie full of slashy images.  It's kind of like the homosexual, British version of The People vs. Larry Flint.  Only with style.",10,1,1,8 June 1999
Trainspotting," On rewatching, loved the film
","I first saw Trainspotting when I was 15.  And I hated it.  Except for Ewan McGregor naked, that I liked.  But otherwise I hated it.  Now I am 18, and with Ewan McGregor in the new Star Wars movie and my best friend bugging me to rent it for her, I rewatched it, and I loved it.  I guess with age came perspective.  I understand it much better than I did, and I can appreciate the vivid imagery used in the film.",10,1,2,25 May 1999
