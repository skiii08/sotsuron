Marie Antoinette," Lost in Translation
","Marie Antoinette is the Mommie Dearest of historical features. It is a 2 hour revisionist fashion show/travelogue that manages to be historically inaccurate, inexcusably shallow, badly acted, intellectually insulting, anti-feminist, and campy in equal measure. To top it all off, it's technically amateurish as a boom mike was clearly visible in no less than 20 scenes. Yes, you did just read that. In one low angle tracking shot through some grass the upper glare panel of the camera was visible. I kid you not. Because of this movie, I'm beginning to wonder if Lost In Translation was just a fluke. It's almost inconceivable that a movie from a major studio and up-and-coming director could have been released with this many mistakes and such a poor script. Needless to say, I don't recommend paying your hard earned cash to see it. Yet, it may be a smashing success and become a camp classic for the very reasons why I had trouble with it.",3,1,4,22 October 2006
