First Man," /facepalm where to begin...
","/facepalm where to begin...Well unlike this movie I wont waste a ton of time.(Note I am checking SPOILERS so the imdb staff checking this can decide if they consider it such. I dont consider such spoilers but some might for some bizarre reason.)Excellent special effects?. check.. actors and actresses that can actually act? check. Historical clips? checkA director that is in dire need of lessons on making this sort of film without putting the viewer nto a coma? Yep CHECK there fore sure!For the love of all that can be good in a bio-pic/documentary get David Attenborough to teach this director!!!!Spielberg should be ashamed of his name being associated with this massively BORING waste of timeYou could easily chop out over an hour from this film and not only not loose anything of value but it would abe a massive improvement.And before you assu,e otherwise.. i can easily handle films of truely epic length and some I have seen are truely massive in that regard.Once Upon A Time In The West,
The Right Stuff,
Schindlers List,
Magnolia,
LOTR-ROTK,
Seven Samurai,
etc etc the list of movies far longer than this yet infinely better is not lacking.If you want a movie on this subject or close to it.. The Right Stuff and Appolo 13 right off the bat come to mind and both are seriously excellent filmsand of course one I have not seen yet but have heard rave reviews from vergood sources (not msm shills for the studios etc or blatanty BS sites like what rotten fruit has become)Apollo 11 (2019)Sorry but the fact this is rated a 7 on here is beyond suspect (Lets hope imdb is not going the same way as RT has) since everyone I have spoken with about it (and that is a very large # not just friends chatting) all agreed with me.. potential was there but damn.. snooze fest 101 was the result.",2,1,4,19 March 2019
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Over rated but has a few priceless moments
",Honestly.. I'd never happily pay money for this movie... overall I found it very amateur in nature.. though I do applaud the priceless 'dinner party' scene... I say anytime we can make fun of such anal retentive conservatives the better off we all are. However I still wouldn't say it's anywhere near as funny as some people. (Then again I hated Napoleon Dynamite.. and I am literally a Generation X baby which supposedly is whom the movie was made for.) At best wait for the DVD and spend the $3 to see the dinner party scene.. or if you are one of the wing-nut conservatives best stay away or it'll just infuriate you! (Hmm if you are WATCH it since annoying you off is a good thing IMO).Now for much better laughs I'd go back to more professionally done movies..,6,0,2,20 November 2006
Captain Marvel," /me yawnz..
","The controvery over BLs idiotic rants was more entertainingSpecial effects + bad writing + bad acting from a very forgettable lead does not a good movie makeAdd to that the absurd feminist crap they are desperately trying to shove down everyones throats just adds to the level of a bomb this movie isThe sad part is just like the backlash over the last jedi the tards in charge still firmly have their heads up their arses and refuse to listenStop the policics crap, stop trying to shove progressive garbage into moviesGOOD writing plus at least decent acting seems t be a lost art and the more idiots like BL open their mouths the more we all end up loosing since whhat could have been good is instead a steaming pile of crap.. and then t wont end up making actal good movies in the future due to the financial failures caused by such arrogance and attacking the FANSEnd result... they got zero $ from me or any of dozens of my friends whom refused to go see this movie due to BLs crap I watched it since I got to waste the time for free and ultimately end result is I want that lost time back,,, even having a nap would have been a better was to spend that timeMeh would be too nice for this bland garbage. skip it you are not missing out and by skipping it you also help drive home the point of attacking the fans or trying to shove politics where it does not belong is a very bad idea.3 stars 2 fr SJs acting and 1 for special effects zero starts get added for the rest of this drivel",2,36,61,13 March 2019
Last Flag Flying," /facepalm
",/facepalmOMG what a pointless boring horrific waste of time and acting skill. Great actors sure.. I can't blame them at all as all three have more than proven themselves elsewhere... but for this movie but that didn't help one iotaHowever that said.. this movie while I wanted to like it was horrific! I've watched some really bad sh*t over the years.. including many very pathetic B movies that had a budget of a case of beer that were better done.. (Check out my other reviews for examples of some really bad movies)/.Seriously though.. the director has crafted what can only be called a pointless steaming pile of crap.. this movie was so bad did something shocking to those that know me and how many movies I've watched..I TURNED IT OFF mid movie!!!!!It's insanely rare for me to ever turn off a movie before watching it all (barring emergency/other obligations etc obviously).. well this was one of those few.. I just couldn't take it anymore.. it was putting me into a coma!!Seriously.. it was so absolutely pathetic I killed it after forcing myself to suffer through aprox. 2/3 in the desperate hope that it would somehow get better. That somehow the acting talent presented in the 3 leads would somehow get to shine... that hell some idiot on set would accidentally knock over the nearest pail of water onto the power cables to shock some life into this pathetic mess..Sadly this was not to be.. do yourself a huge favor.. DON'T waste the time even starting to watch this piece of crap.. The really sad thing is I'm always comparing bad movies by default to anything Ewe boll has touched... and he's so far out to lunch he thinks hes god gift to cinema while being the opposite in reality.. and this pos excuse for a morie does to tbe best of my knowledge not involve him at all.. scary thought..The director should b so far beyond ashamed of this it's not funny... and the 3 main leads.. god help their careers if they ever sign on with him or anything this bad ever again.. I doubt their careers would survive such again regardless of their acting skill.In the great wise words of Monty Python and this movie:RUN AWAY!!! RUN AWAYYYYYYYY!!!!!,1,4,13,11 February 2018
Ted," Sigh
",Oh Seth... Seth.. Seth... poor Seth MacFarlane... How conflicted you are.You can be an insanely hilarious guy.. your stars Mark and Mila can be as well. They both funny and very personable (and Mila is seriously smokin).. I've worked with both and can't say a bad word about either ever. It was my pleasure to work w/them to say the least and I'd be happy to do so again anytime.Family guy and your work on roasts etc is priceless.However... wow.. you really shot yourself in the foot on this one.It does have some good laughs.. but overall.. it is as if you were trying to make two movies at once. One a kidified pile of Disneyish crap and the other an adult comedy.. Sadly due to that conflict it ultimately fails miserably. :(Many of us had such high hopes for this movie and I cannot fault the cast. But the screenplay creators / director dropped the ball on this one. It could have been a true classic.. but instead is destined to be a dust collector in the bargain bin.I hate to say it but for Seth MacFarlane fans.. as well as fans of Mark and Mila... skip it.. far too many will be bitterly disappointed.Oh and a FYI.. my wife and my brother in law.. also big fans of Seth feel very much the same on this film.,5,5,7,12 November 2012
The Witch," I want a refund for the time lost watching this coma inducing POS excuse for a film
","At the end the creators display this info'This film was inspired by many folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries and court records.Much of the dialog comes directly from these period sources.All I can say is your sources SUCK! Holy hell slow burn my ass slow burn at how horrifyingly bad this pile of crap is.. it desperately wants to create a creepy scary atmosphere.. it falls flat on its face to say the least.For that do yourself a favour and watch 'The Descent'.. it hands down succeeds on that count in spades.. and get the Euro ending not the lame ass US version!I didnt pay for this movie.. thankfully.. but despite that I swear I should be billing the amature clowns that foisted this crap upon the world for the ti,e I sadly will never get backI could include spoilers as well but there is no need how can anyone spoil somethis this coma inducing???Also before you foolishly assume I am not one of the short attention span putz reviewers thaat can't handle slower moving films.. glacial paces does not mean bad BAD means BAD and on that this film is BAD.. hence why the 1 star.. I sadly can't give it lower... believe me it deserves lower!90min runtime... felt like 90 weeks...",1,4,12,14 May 2019
Casino Royale," A.. a clue.. a clue.. all they needed was a clue...
",A.. a clue.. a clue.. all they needed was a clue...That clue was of course to get some superior writing.. and damn they came through in spades for this one.For so many lame films labeled as Bond through the later 80's and 90's... then they got Brosnan (whom I always thought was a natural for this role).. only to forget about the most important part of any movie.Good Writing!..They wasted a lot with Pierce sadly.. concentrating on gadgets etc.. instead of a real plot and development that was actually realistic.Well I'd say they scored a bulls eye for this one and Craig was above and beyond excellent for this role..Now the only question is can they do it again? Only time will tell.In the meantime I recommend this highly as an excellent film.. and I dare say better than the Departed (which was good but lacked in the end.),10,1,5,1 April 2007
Munich," meh spielberg half hearted attempt at a spy movie
",Seriously valid real life subject.. good actors.. reasonable theory of how to do X but it seemed more an anti-violence agenda than a thriller about real justice vs the terrorists that maimed and killed XXXXX # of people in the name of their religionSorry but in the end a reasonable flick but SS certainly could have done far better imo esp given he didn't lack funds or acting talent.Therefore while its not a bad film per se it is not an award winning class some think it is. so i give it a pass at 6 stars.,6,2,3,22 November 2019
Footloose," ugh
",Sorry.. but aside from a few moments.. it's a very very sad misguided bad attempt at the original.#1.. pro dancers s 'real' characters... that alone sunk it.#2.. horribly unneeded remakes of original songs... really???? #3.. BS 'acting' from above mentioned pro dancers. They can dance.. no one will argue.. but god help them when they try to act.etc etc..Sorry but HORRIBLE is the end result for those of us that know better.. and have lived it.Elaboration beyond this is a waste of typing other than as a warning to those knowing the original and contemplating this POS.Oh and 'DonFishies' nailed it for the last paragraph... possibly the only real redeeming performance.. sad as I am to say it.. :(,3,10,17,7 February 2012
