Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why?
","Alright, it's all too easy to just rip the ass out of a movie like this, so I'm going to go ahead and let you know up front that I'll do my best to give this a fair review and point out anything that's good. Now then, let's discuss the plot; The film opens with two Jedi being send to 'mediate a trade dispute' in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. In the process, the Trade Federation (the party that they were supposed to be meeting with), attempt to kill them, and as a result, the Jedi flee to the Planet Naboo below in time for the Trade Federation to launch an invasion of the Planet. In desperation, the Jedi unite with the Queen of Naboo, and flee the planet, bound initially for the Galactic Capital of Coruscant. In their escape attempt however, their spacecraft becomes damaged and they are forced to make an emergency landing on the remote Planet of Tatooine where they meet a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually helps them get off world and back to Coruscant. Once there, the Galactic Senate proves unable to help with the brewing crisis on Naboo from the Trade Federation Invasion and the Queen decides to return to Naboo herself to deal with the problem. The Jedi decide to return with her to get to the bottom of the situation and inform the Senate of the real motivations behind the Trade Federation invasion. In the process the Jedi become embroiled in a fierce Lightsaber duel with a supposedly extinct Sith Lord, Darth Maul. At the same time, the Queen leads the Royal Palace Guards to retake the palace and capture the leader of the Trade Federation. Also at the same time, the natives of the planet, the Gungans fight to try and eliminate the Trade Federation Army and little Anakin Skywalker leads the attack on the orbiting Trade Federation ships. In the end, one of the Jedi are killed in the fight with the Sith, the Queen retakes the palace, the Trade Federation ships are destroyed, and the Gungans triumph over the Army, and we're set up for the next one. OK, now if you're confused by that summary, then you are not alone. Never mind that that plot is incredibly complex, which wouldn't be a problem if the situations were better set up and the character motivations better explained, but it's just so convoluted.Here's what I mean; In the film, Anakin Skywalker is supposed to be an incredibly smart kid, who builds robots and podracers, and has these superhuman qualities. Under normal circumstances, that could be really interesting and could set up a really great character arc from Episode I to Episode VI. But in this film, you just don't buy it. The child actor (Jake Lloyd) is simply horrible. The delivery of every line of duologue is clunky and goofy and just unconvincing and it sucks you even further out of the movie (if that was possible). It's pitiful, simply put. On top of that, this character who is so uninteresting and fake, (and who is supposedly only 9 years old), is a pivotal point in the plot because he miraculously wins the money that the Jedi use to repair their ship and return to Coruscant. It's like a completely incompetent person wrote the screenplay to this film.Specifically speaking though, what's bad about this film? Well there's a lot, so let's just dive right in: The Writing (as I said) is boring. This is supposed to be a sprawling space saga and it's written in the same way as a Soap Opera and is about as interesting. It's like this movie was written by two different people. One person wrote this silly goofy script involving some stupid, lame, slap stick character called Jar Jar Binks, who is a Gungan that the Jedi run into on their way to find the Queen. He's supposed to be a point of interest for children and it just comes off as unnecessary and unfunny to adults. On the other end of the spectrum, once the Jedi arrive on Coruscant, we get introduced to this incredibly boring pseudo-political duologue. It's clearly not for children because they'll just check out and not pay attention to the film, but at the same time, it's clearly not for adults either because it's uninteresting and doesn't make much sense. So the conclusion can only be that the film has no specific audience, but that it tries (and fails) to be applicable for all ages. That can work in a film, but you have to keep the elements subdued for it to work right. If you don't it can turn out really horrible.The acting (for what it is) is actually passable for the most part. As I said, Jake Lloyd was horrible as Anakin Skywalker, but Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman all did the best job they could have done with the material given to them. As for the Special Effects and the visuals, the Special Effects are actually pretty good, and so are the visual imagery of the film. That's why I gave it 4 stars and not 1.The simple fact of the matter is that Writer/Director George Lucas wanted to tell the story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker, and that's fine, and that's interesting, but he wanted to do it in a way that would make him as much money as possible, (i.e. 3 films instead of just 1). There just was not enough story for 3 solid films. Citizen Kane anyone? Overall, Episode I is a shallow, uninteresting and pathetic attempt at recapturing lightening in a bottle, (at which it failed). The only thing that this film succeeded at was reducing Star Wars to a cheaply made cash grab. Thanks George.",4,2,5,19 June 2012
Alien," Perfectly Pitched Suspense
","'A mining ship, investigating a suspected SOS, lands on a distant planet. The crew discovers some strange creatures and investigates.' That's the summary of the plot you'll see if you read it on IMDb. But what does that really mean? Well, I could go on and on and on about it, but in short it simply means, one of the best science fiction films of all time. Basically the plot goes as follows; The Commercial Starship Nostromo is en-route back to Earth when the crew is awakened from Hyper-Sleep on orders from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (who own the ship and employ the crew), to investigate what amounts to be an SOS from a downed Alien Spacecraft. Once the crew touches down on the planet, LV-426, the captain and two supporting crew members venture out into the crashed vessel, and soon a crew member has an alien life form attached to his face, and has to be returned to the ship immediately. After the crew determines that they can do nothing further while on the planet, the ship returns to space and the crew prepare for hyper-sleep again. Also by this time, the crew member with the alien attached to his face has mysteriously recovered and the alien itself seems to have fallen off and died. This proves to be WAY wrong when the true intentions of the creature become clear by way of an Alien bursting out from inside the crewman's chest. In the confusion, the creature gets away into the bowels of the ship, and now let the terror and suspense and the basis for most 'Monster Movies' for the next 30 years ensue.Now, one thing that this film does really well is create a feeling of tension and suspense. In every scene in this movie, even in the beginning before anything happens, you're on the edge of your seat because you already know going in that the title of this film is 'Alien', so that can't be good news for the people in it, and the musical score is already ominous to the point of suggesting that at any moment the whole thing could just hit the fan. I honestly attribute this to the direction of Ridley Scott. The man knows, to this day, just how much to show you in a scene, and that's the key to this film. You don't see that much of the Alien. It's all up to you as the audience to make up for yourself what the creature can do and what it fully looks like. This film has some of the most spectacular film imagery in film history, and it's all thanks to Scott and his editor.The writing (especially now adays) is really something to talk about. In most creature movies that have come out since Alien, you have a bunch of characters that mean less than zero to the ultimate conclusion of the story, and by the endgame, you just don't care about the last character standing because you're not emotionally invested in them. In Alien, you are absolutely invested in these characters. The script really lends itself to some very interesting, and often times humorous dialog between crew members, (more often than not involving Harry Dean-Stanton and Yaphet Kotto who play the ship's pseudo-mechanics Brett and Parker, respectively); and therefore it's monumental then one of them dies. Something you just don't find in sci-fi anymore, and you should.Something that really goes hand-in-hand with the writing is the Acting. Everybody is at the top of their form in this film. Sigourney Weaver (in her feature film debut no less) embodies the strength, intelligence and subtle sexuality of the character Ripley. She absolutely IS this character. Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Veronica Cartwright all hit home runs with their roles as Dallas, Kane, Ash, and Lambert respectively. Again, good acting...something you don't see in sci-fi films like this anymore.Overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi, suspense thrillers and/or just a fan or Ridley Scott, I highly recommend Alien to you. It's masterfully crafted to be nerve shatteringly suspenseful, and it's one of my favorite films of all time, period. And yes, because it's the inevitable question, I DO love Alien more than Aliens, just so we're clear. In fact, if I had to pick some of the most important films of the past century, the list would include Star Wars, Casablanca, Pulp Fiction and Alien for sure.10/10 easy.",10,2,4,19 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What?
","OK, now as I have said in my other Star Wars Prequel Reviews, I will do my utmost to give this film a fair review and point out anything that is good if I find it. OK, let's start with the plot; This film is set 10 years after the events of 'Episode I' and Queen turned Senator Amidala of Naboo is returning to Coruscant to vote on the creation of a 'Grand Army of the Republic' to counter the uprising Sepratist Movement, when an attempt is made on her life. Fearing that she may be in mortal danger, Chancellor Palpatine asks the Jedi Council to place the senator under their protection. Enter the now adult Anakin Skywalker, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi. After another attempt is made on the Senator's life, the Jedi Council decide to send Anakin away with her to her home planet of Naboo where they hope she'll be safe, while Obi-Wan goes off to pursue a lead on the planet of Kamino, where he discovers a secretly manufacture Army of Clones. At the same time, Anakin and Padme slowly begin to fall in love. At the same time, Anakin is racked by horrid dreams of his mother being tortured on his home planet of Tatooine, and leaves Naboo with Amidala to find her. Upon arriving, he quickly meets his step father and takes flight after his mother, only to find her as she is dying. As she dies in his arms, he looses all control of himself and slaughters the entire village of the Sand People who kidnapped his mother. While this is happening, Obi-Wan confronts the man responsible for the two failed attempts on Padme's life and, and after a brief confrontation, he pursues the man (Jango Fett) to the Septatist Base World of Geonosis, where he discovers Count Dooku, a former Jedi, now leader of the Sepratist Movement, and Obi-Wan is captured. Answering his distress signal, Anakin comes to his aide, and he and Padme too are captured. As a demonstration of his power, Dooku orders the trio's execution in a giant arena, but as the final blow is about to be struck, Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jedi Master Yoda arrive with a force of Jedi Knights and Clone Troopers to hopefully save Anakin and Obi-Wan and capture Dooku and stop a full scale War. In the ferocity of the battle, Anakin and Ob-Wan face off with Dooku, who easily defeats the two and is about to kill them until Yoda shows up and saves them, but Dooku escapes and the war begins, thus we have a sequel yet again.So like the last film, we have an incredibly complex plot to follow where we as the audience are expected to accept too many things that we are and are not told, and once again, it's convoluted as hell. Here's what I'm saying; We're expected to buy into the relationship between Anakin and Padme when it's flat and one-dimensional. The way most good movie romances work is the visual representation and the interaction between the two characters and the history between the two, whether it's from a previous film or told in flashbacks; not necessarily the dialog that's exchanged between them. The reason this is one-dimensional is because we see two attractive young people in very romantic settings along scenic vistas. We're supposed to connect the dots in this film and see that their in love when you just don't buy it. And here's the thing, that would actually work if the previous film had established a real connection between the two, but the previous film did not do that, so all we have now is this stale, fake and unbelievable movie puppy-dog romance. At the same time, we're expected to accept something we're not told by the existence of the whole subplot of the Clone Manufacturing Planet. It's only hinted at why this planet has been selected to manufacture Clone Soldiers. Something about a dead Jedi Master placing the order in secret? What? It would be different if this was explained later in the sequel, but it wasn't. The concept is just there, in this movie alone. But yet, we're just expected to go along with it and not ask the big questions. That really shows the limited range of the writing of this film and the prequels in general.As far as the Acting goes in this film, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are both still fine, but the new addition of Hayden Christensen is...well, a kiss of death. He's just so pitiful and whiny in every scene that it's just disgusting. He's one of the worst parts of this movie, aside from the special effects. Speaking of which, they're terrible. This really was one of the first films made almost completely using CGI. And as a result, it all looks plastic, manufactured, and fake, and it completely ruins the concept of 'a lived in space' that the Original Trilogy were all about. But speaking from the heart though, I still love the imagery of Star Wars (Lightsabers, Spaceships, and CGI), no matter how bad. Sue me.I can keep going on and on about why I hate this movie, and why it's bad, but I won't, for two reasons. One, I have a word limit, and two, because I've already covered the broad strokes of why it's bad and I don't like it. Overall, this film is a lazily assembled, shallowly constructed excuse of a Star Wars film, and is without a doubt the worst one of the series.3/10. Bad.",3,1,2,19 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Solid Reboot? You bet.
","OK, so the burning question on everybody's mind is; Is this Spider-Man better than the Sam Raimi directed version starring Toby Maguire? Answer, yes. But in all fairness, that is a loaded question. Is this film a better origin story than the original 'Spider-Man'? Yes. Is it better than any other Spider-Man movie that came before? No. It's better than 'Spider-Man' and it's a hell of a lot better than 'Spider-Man 3', but 'Spider-Man 2' is still (in my opinion) the best Spidey movie that's ever happened, and it's gonna take some serious wizardry to top that one in the future. I'm going to try and break down this film as best I can and tell you what's good and bad about it. Here we go: Character wise and story progression, the direction by Marc Webb is fantastic. He did a great job of capturing the character moments that really moved the plot along and kept you invested in the characters. Webb's direction is much better than anything Sam Raimi did in 'Spider-Man', because Raimi seemed more concerned with the feel of a live-action comic book. When you look back and watch 'Spider-Man' now, it's easy to see just how close to a graphic novel or comic book it really is. When you watch this film, it's almost like you're watching a scene from 'The Dark Knight' it's so far removed from the comic books that inspired it. Good job Webb.As far as the acting and characters go, they were all perfect to me. Andrew Garfield was phenomenal as Peter Parker, and as Spider-Man. His rendition of Peter was a very socially and personally repressed individual, who had numerous personal issues, and he was much more complex character than I was personally expecting. In the Sam Raimi film, he was a pretty straight forward character: he's a nerd, he has a crush, he gets bitten by a spider, he gets his powers, his uncle gets killed, and he sobers up immediately and uses his powers for the best. In this movie, Spider-Man is a cocky, smart ass teenager who, just because of the death of his uncle, isn't just gonna go out and fight for 'truth and justice'. In fact, the whole character arc of 'with great power, comes great responsibility' comes later on at the end of the movie, and is the major driving force of this film, not necessarily one specific 'villain'. In fact, the villain in this movie is a side effect, of sorts, of this character driven storyline. In the Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man', it always seemed like the driving force of the whole plot was the threat of Norman Osborn and by the time he becomes a threat to New York, Spider-Man is already out swinging around kicking ass and has mastered his powers completely. In this film, it really shows the work that goes into understanding his powers, and even shows the limitations of them, which is interesting. On a side note, I loved the concept of him having to construct his web shooters. One, it's more faithful to the comics, and two, it really illustrates the intelligence and skill that Peter Parker possesses.Emma Stone was excellent. She plays the part of Gwen Stacey as a very smart, cute, and sexy love interest to Peter Parker, and the relationship is believable and sweet. That's the best way I can describe it. And here's a switch; she was actually useful to Peter and the plot line. She wasn't anything like Bryce Dallas-Howard's version of Gwen as this essentially useless damsel in distress, and was definitely a huge improvement over MJ in Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man', because all MJ did was scream and cry for Spidey to save her every 5 seconds. There are 2 action sequences in that film where Spidey fights the Goblin and MJ is just screaming in the background. Thank God for Emma Stone and this reboot.Rhys Ifans, did the best job he could have done with his character of Dr. Curt Conners aka The Lizard. This is really the weakest part in an otherwise strong film. The story focuses almost too much on Peter and Gwen, and therefore leaves most major character development for anybody else to fall by the wayside. All you know is that this man worked with Peter's father, he has only one arm, and he is desperate to get it back no matter what the cost morally or physically to anyone or anything, up to and including himself. I really think that had the script allowed for more time to focus on Conners, like showcasing his wife and son, etc., then it would have been more emotionally engaging, and as the ending is now, it just feels a little bit hollow. If the film had made it a bit more clear that Peter's ultimate goal was to save Dr. Conners from himself, so to speak, rather than to get to Gwen and save Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen. Too much on the central characters when secondary elements needed to take over.There were just a couple other minor problems that I had with the film, one of them being the concept of Peter's Parents. It's very evident that his parents are key to the plot, but after the first, I'd say half hour, it focuses less on them and more about Peter and his powers. I would have liked more back story on Peter's parents and how that relationship impacted Dr. Conners as well. Secondly, after Uncle Ben is killed, Peter searches like a madman for his killer. But unlike the Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man', he doesn't ever find the man who did it, and he just kinda stops looking after a while. I mean, you can easily rationalize it in the plot of the story, but it's just a little strange that he just stops, no matter what personal discoveries he makes and what he decides to do as Spider-Man.8/10 easy.",8,2,13,4 July 2012
Avatar," Dances With Wolves in Space...
","I really don't understand what people mean when they say this film is 'James Cameron's Masterpiece'. This film is the same old cliché recycled story that we as movie goers have seen a hundred times over.I can literally think of three other films with this exact same story arc and plot line as I type this review. One, you have Lawrence of Arabia, Academy Award Winning film including Best Pictue. It's based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British officer in World War I, and it's a great movie. Two, you have Dances With Wolves, yet another film that won Best Picture in 1990 and was based in the American West. Three, you have, of all things, Pocahontas. It deals (as all of these movies do), with a man finding his true nature and coming to the aide of an indigenous people in the face of oppression. So let me ask; Why, if there are numerous other films that have the same premise, then why does everybody fixate on Avatar? I don't understand. The thing that makes or breaks a movie in most cases is the film's ability to be relateable and it's ability to connect with the audience, and the relevance of the movie in the real world. While Avatar is visually stunning, I'll completely agree with that, it's not relevant at all. The movie was 99% rendered in a computer, (granted it was based on live performances), but if that's your movie's hook 'Look at what I can do with my Camera!!!', then that's not too good, especially when you KNOW that going into the movie. When you watch Dances With Wolves, you're aware that it's taking place in the real world and it's a potentially true story. Aside from the overall plot and execution of Avatar, the casting really bothered me. Lets look at this: Sam Worthington was hollow as hell and anybody could have played him. And at this point in the game, he's just been forced down our throats to the point where the studios are just saying, 'Here's your next big star!'. Zoe Saldana didn't really bother me too much except she was a little over the top in places, such as when she first meets Sam Worthington's character. Sigourney Weaver was actually really good in this movie. I had no issue with her what so ever, and she's a Cameron favorite. How could I resist that? Lastly, and this ties in with what I said before about the computer generated aspect of the film; the overall character design was too 'perfect' for a primitive alien culture. Picture this: Instead of the Na'Vi being this perfect fantasy creature, they looked like an 'alien of the week' from Star Trek: The Original Series? I'm just saying that if the Na'Vi looked less perfect then would Jake Sully have really found himself? Umm...yeah, probably not. All the movie really accomplished was creating a perfect sci-fi creature for Nerds.Overall, I don't hate Avatar. I actually can see that there are some good elements to it and it was done pretty well. That's something that will always be true of Jim Cameron movies is the quality of them. They'll always be really high quality. That being said, I just have too many other problems with it and I just can't get past them because there are other movies out there that are just executed a lot better and are so much more relevant than Avatar.5/10 not stupendous.",5,2,4,31 January 2012
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction: An Exercise in Brilliance
","Before I knew what a cultural phenomenon Pulp was, I knew that this film was incredible. Seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time, I was awestruck. After seeing it, I can 100% say that it is deserving of every bit of praise it gets. Lets break this down: The acting is all top notch. Whether it's Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Eric Stoltz, Uma Thurman and even Quentin Tarantino himself, they're all perfect for their roles in every way. Whether the character the actor is portraying is loud and obnoxious or an exaggerated mousy caricature, all are on their A-Game. The story is realistic, but at the same time it's ridiculous and over the top. While this combination of seemingly incompatible story elements could be potentially disastrous in an average film, Pulp is well aware of it's absurdity and makes fun of itself to the nth degree. The fact that the film is so over the top, yet very dark at it's core is completely offset by the hilarity that comes with the situations that the characters find themselves in,(i.e. being caught and rapped by two redneck homosexuals in the Hollywood hills). The writing, in my own humble opinion, is some of the best ever produced. Period. Whether the dialog is an exchange between two characters talking about rats, milk, or a Royale With Cheese, every word spoken is genuine and real and horribly hilarious in it's nature. You, as an audience member know that you shouldn't be laughing at what's happening on screen, but the film's sly whit is infectious and it keeps you smiling and guessing until the end of the film. Some people call Pulp Fiction 'a movie about a movie'. I can't argue their point; Pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70's, as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. Some people see this as a weakness to Quentin Tarantino's direction, saying that he's limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. I don't think that's true, personally, but in my opinion it's one of his strengths. He takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. He did that with Pulp and he continues to do it today, with films like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. Boiling Pulp Fiction itself down however, the true lovers of cinema, the people who will know exactly what Tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. That is however not to say that casual viewers won't like the film. It has a little something for everybody and is, without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. I hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film.",10,1,3,7 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best of the Prequels DOES NOT Equal a 'Good Movie'
","Let me just say straight off that I'm a huge Star Wars Fan and in my eyes, the Original Trilogy are some of the greatest films ever made. Now that that's out of the way let's review this: There are some positives about this movie - not many - but there are positives. First off, let me list the positives. Thankfully, this movie is a massive departure from the previous two in terms of the tone. Gone are the days of JarJar Binks' idiotic slapstick and cringe-inducing child actors in pivotal roles, (Jake Lloyd anyone?). Also, in spite of the bad acting running rampant through this, and all other prequels, Ian McDiarmid does do a pretty admirable job in the role of Palpatine. He's the best actor and (coincidentally) does the best job with the material given to him in the film. Lastly, let's recognize some pretty damn good special effects. The special effects were outstanding, despite being the only real backbone to the film and not an interesting story of any kind. This brings me into the negatives of the film, and there's A LOT, so let's dive right in. First of all, as I just said, there isn't much of a story left. What I mean by that is that after the horrid debacle of the previous two films, the only thing that's really left to happen in this movie is the actual transition of Anakin Skywalker over to the Dark Side of the Force. Now, I'm sure that you (like I did when I was a kid) thought that would be a really cool concept: The movie could take it's time to develop the one defining catalyst that pushed Anakin over the edge after years spent in war and strife. You finally get to see the one singular second that forces Anakin to become Darth Vader and live a life of servitude and misery. And we as an audience could finally be redeemed from two films of crap...But no, we get the most stale, manufactured, insincere, boring and unbelievable character arcs in film history. I mean come on, I could buy the whole thing where Anakin reacts on impulse and severs Mace Windu's hand at the chance to save his wife from imminent death, but when it actually happened, it just seemed to me like that if Yoda had been there and run into the room at that very second and handed Anakin a MilkyWay, he wouldn't have turned to the Darkside. Basically, the entire Star Wars Prequel Saga tried (and failed I might add) to tell a similar story to Citizen Kane. Is that a common comparison? Yes. Is it inaccurate? No. Let me compare the two side-by-side and you decide for yourself if the characters and story are similar: CITIZEN KANE - A young boy is taken from his home at a young age and separated from his beloved mother. Flash forward to his young adult hood and we see that he is a brazen, idealistic person with a code that he lives by called the Declaration of Principles. Finally we see him mature into a very powerful and successful business man who has everything he wants, but eventually his power corrupt him and he becomes an arrogant and belligerent jerk who forces everyone he loves away from him. He eventually dies a very miserable and lonely man. OK, now there are obviously big differences in locations, events and people outside of Kane/Skywalker, but the basic character motivations that affect them are the same. Why were the Star Wars Prequels not just one movie, very similar in structure to Citizen Kane? I can tell you it's not because it couldn't have been done. In fact, George Lucas did base the original Star Wars movie off of an Akira Kurisawa film entitled 'The Hidden Fortress'. The Hidden Fortress is essentially the same story as Star Wars, but it's told in a way with Robots and not Japanese Peasants. Same rule applies to The Prequels and Citizen Kane. The reason why the prequels became three movies and not just 'The Star Wars Prequel' is because Star Wars and its accompanying sequels are titled 'Episode IV, V, & VI', respectfully. I'm sorry to break it to all you fan boys out there, but that's why we have 3 crappy movie and 3 great movies in this franchise, and not 4 great movies in this franchise. Now, moving away from the story and how it relates to other things, let's discuss the acting further. Ewan McGregor is pretty good in the role of Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman does a very good job with her crappy role. That's it. Now, moving onto the CGI in the movie. It is very good, but it's only good in its own right. What I mean by that is that though it's technologically impressive, it's wrong in the context of the story. There's no reason why there needs to be CGI everywhere in a scene that just involves two characters talking. It could (and should) just be a practically built set with CGI out a window or something. This is especially true considering that every single scene in this movie that is not intensive in CGI is shot like a soap opera in shot-reverse shot. Not only is this a sign of lazy filmmaking, but it's also a constant reminder of the lost potential that this and the other prequels had. While I'm on the subject of storytelling, the tone of this movie is A LOT darker than the other two prequels. That's good in the sense that we don't have to sit through anymore horribly idiotic scenes that leave us adults rolling our eyes. That being said, why was this movie SO DARK? I understand that Darth Vader was a bad guy, but did he have to be a homicidal maniac that killed small children? NO. Not needed. I'm going to stop before this gets ridiculous. Thanks.",6,1,2,24 March 2012
Prometheus," Not a Prequel, but a Damn Good Sci-Fi.
","I really have to suggest for anyone who has not see this movie, PLEASE do not read this review yet. Now then, as the title may suggest, I loved this movie. Now on to what I think has caused some distancing amongst sci-fi fans; the concept of prequel or spin off? In the traditional sense of the word, this is in no way an 'Alien Prequel'. Is it set in the same universe as 'Alien', yes. Does it 'share some of Alien's DNA', yes. But does it take place directly before the Alien and/or does it ruin some very important back story like certain other films (the Star Wars Prequels) have done, no. Calling this film a prequel just severely undercuts the film as a whole, and I think that's a chief reason why some people were a little disappointed with what they saw at the theater, but I'll get more into that later. For right now, I'm gonna talk about the film in it's entirety. The film takes place at the end of the 21st century, in the year 2093, I think. The scientific vessel Prometheus has been sent on a sanctioned journey by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, to a distant solar system to discover the origins of the Human Race. The exploration team is led by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), and a host of other characters including Janek, played by Idris Elba, the android David played by Michael Fassbender, Peter Weyland played by Guy Pierce and Meredeth Vickers played by Charlize Theron among others. Once the crew arrive on the planet, LV-223 (Note: This is not the same as LV-426, the planet on which Alien and the sequel Aliens take place on.), needless to say things don't exactly go as planned with the scientific expedition turned survival mission and let the horror and the intensity ensue. Alright, let's talk what really worked for me; The direction by Ridley Scott is fantastic here. He really lets all of the important characters breath and flourish in a film that's really not necessarily about the characters, and each and every shot in the film is just so crisp and beautiful it's breathtaking, something that I think would have been sorely lacking if the film was directed by anybody else. The acting is mostly top notch; Noomi Repace, formerly of the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' fame, delivers whole heartedly in this movie, and continues the long line of strong female characters created by Ridley Scott. There's one scene in particular where she has to manually program and operate a machine to remove a parasitic life form in her body. That scene alone is more than enough to win you over to her side. Michael Fassbender is fantastic as the Android 'David'. He actually reminded me of Peter O'Tool in 'Lawrence of Arabia' in his demeanor and diction. Idris Elba was excellent as Janek, the Captain of the Prometheus, was spot on. He offered some much needed comic relief in the film, and actually reminded me of Harry Dean-Stanton and Yaffit Koto in the original 'Alien'. There was really only one glaring problem for me in the acting department, and that was Logan Marshall-Green. He's more or less a 10 cent version of Tom Hardy. I hated him in this movie as a matter of fact. His delivery of every line was painful to watch. A lot of movie goers seem to really detest the writing of this movie and I really don't know why. The writing (in my opinion) was very good. It proposed questions that even it didn't have answers for. It keeps you very much interested and guessing the whole time, which is fitting since the writer of LOST, Damon Lindeloff, wrote the script. Now, back to what has divided a lot of people on this movie: The concept of it being a prequel or not. Here's my theory on how all of this ties into the 'Alien Univeerse' and/or the Alien Films: I think that a Chest Burster in 'Alien' could have mistakenly gotten onto the face of one of the 'Engineers' on LV-426, (aka the Original 'Space Jockey' on LV-426) centuries ago and once hatched; the Xenomorph killed the entire crew on that one ship and just died in a corner somewhere when its life cycle ran out. Then after centuries had gone by, the Company (having lost contact with Prometheus) tricks the crew of the Nostromo into showing up to find the Space Jockey 'fossilized' as Tom Skeritt says, and well, we know the rest. I'm just thinking that the 'Engineers' were using that whole solar system as a weapons manufacturing facility, with each planet manufacturing its own biological weapon. The Prometheus and its crew just happened to stumble onto this one planet at this point in time, totally independent of 'Alien' or 'Aliens'. As for the creature at the end of Prometheus being a Xenomorph or not, I think it might be a version of a Xenomorph, but it's not a pure (what we would call) 'Alien'. Assuming my theory is correct, and that all of these planets in this solar system are manufacturing different biological weapons, it would make sense that all of these weapons would share the same basic biological material. Think of it like this: You have a Lego Kit. This Lego Kit can be used to make 3 different robots, all of which look different, and have their own specific defining physical traits and features. But even though they don't look similar, they all still have the same basic building blocks. Overall though, I truly loved this movie. Just the bad acting by Logan Marshall-Green and some early pacing problems are what keep it from being a 10/10 for me. A good Sci-Fi movie hasn't come along like this since 'Blade Runner', which Scott also directed, and I loved it. I'd even like to see a sequel.9/10 easy.",7,2,7,10 June 2012
