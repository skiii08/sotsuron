10 Cloverfield Lane," Take a chance on this movie
","For those who might think that this is not going to be their kind of movie, take a chance, grab some popcorn, and lose yourself. Well-written, well-directed, and well-acted. If you like the unexpected, you will enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane.I promise you that as long as you don't read spoilers, you really won't know where this is going at virtually any point in the movie. That is the definition of a well-constructed, enjoyable film. You go along for a journey with the three actors who make up the entire film. It is both fascinating from a film study standpoint and mesmerizing at times from an audience standpoint. There are plenty of reviews you can look at for clues or insights or spoilers. My suggestion is resist: sit down in the theater with as blank a slate as possible and go for the ride.",9,2,4,11 March 2016
