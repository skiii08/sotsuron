The Avengers," A Dream come true
","A marvelous marvel from Marvel, 'The avengers' is a worth watching flick, and it belongs to every age group, a grandfather will enjoy this movie as much his grandson will.Cast - Everybody is looking very nice in their respective uniforms, but Mark Ruffelo as hulk, Jermey Runner as The hawk, Tom Hiddleston as Loki are outstanding.Story - Is about OK, cant expect much on the story side as this is the first movie and it is mainly concentrated on assembling, an average highly predictable but enjoyable storyline.Direction - Joss Whedon has put a lot to make a weak storyline work, he is brilliant.Likes - Action of the movie is really nice but it doesn't take actions to a new level we have seen better action sequences already. Comedy (with minimal scope)Robert Downey Jr. and hulk does make you laugh at some points. Great VFX. Climax !! Unlikes - it lacks on the emotional front,as there is only 1 girl among 5 hunks its pretty obvious as well.",8,1,4,30 April 2012
