Hereditary," Excellent horror. But this movie will make you sad.
",This move is an amazing punch in the gut. THEN the horror starts.,10,8,16,12 June 2018
The Martian," Seriously - this is what movies are supposed to do...
","'The Martian' was a phenomenal film, score, acting and source material. Movies are magic, they are and can be transcendent, a showcase of human potential and chapter mark for a brand new idea. How about showing someone fighting mans oldest foe (nature), with his greatest weapons (hope and knowledge)? This movie is a textbook example of borrowing source material and breathing full blown life into it. There are dozens of critical analysis of either, but this film can reach out to people and show people, literally, where we could go next.Its a lesson for grade school, high school and college - instead of giving young people impossible, nonsensical lessons in the use of mathematics, advanced mathematics, botany, rugged outdoor survival, - solve for X and get Whateley home!",10,13,30,19 October 2015
