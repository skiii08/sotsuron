Requiem for a Dream," A terrible movie!
","The message (or idea) of this movie is that 100%, everyone, who take drugs die in a painful death, or they live a life you can´t really call a life! Thats not true, and to say that it´s stupid, like this whole movie.But the fear of drugs it tries to spread is not the only one in this movie. When Marion needs drugs, she goes to a BLACK ugly looking guy. Why do you think he is black? Continue yourself...Well, if the makers of this movie had made Philadelphia (a very good movie, with very good acting) all of the people around the main character had also died because of AIDS. Why? I doesn´t mater, it´s just shocking and cool... His friend would be an ugly black guy Tom Hanks would probably die in terrible pain and shout: 'If you´re gay you will die of AIDS!!!'.Also, the whole movie is a huge logical mistake! At the beginning they take drugs, and it seems they´re used on it, as they already took it years. Then suddenly in half a year (or a bit more) they die. How does this fit? It doesn´t!If you want to scare someone of drugs (and of somebody else?) this is your movie! But if you believe this, you´ll never try just one cigarette, or drink a cup of coffee because you´ll die, and the doctors will kill you with electric shocks or something else (thats the point of this movie!)...But the movie has also another message: Life sucks! Life is ugly and nothing worth! And because of this message I really hate this movie (I loved it to give it a 1/10!!). If you want to see a good REALISTIC movie go and watch Philadelphia. It has another look on the life, which says: Even you´re practically already death, there is still something worth fighting for!",9,1,3,26 June 2003
Memento," @Jacob-Mugo and all
","I watched the movie just once, but I think I understand it more or less (can it be understood? No, I just have my version!).I believe Dodd was the second man that attacked Lennys wife. His 'friends' were Teddy and Natalie. After the murder they started to realize, that he lost his memory and they started to use him as a killer, they just had to give him some hints and he thought he is after the murderer of his wife (maybe the first time it happened was on the picture he burns?). Then Natalie somehow got the money and wanted Dodd and Teddy to be killed, so she made up all the things to bring Lenny to kill them both.Well, thats not very fascinating (as the movie is); the fascinating on it is Lenny. His life is just one thing, he tries to find the murderer of his wife, so he follows the clues. How often did it he already? I think 2 times (the picture I mentioned and Teddy), but after a while he will somehow start a new hunt for the murderer and he will find new clues!I think this would explane from where the 'Never answer the Phone' could come (this was a very important part of the whole movie to me), or the huge 'Teddy G rapped my wife' (or somehow like this). I think this text was written by someone else on him (why should it be backwards?).A fascinating, complex thriller (maybe I didnt understood it...) worth seeing it more times!",8,0,3,8 June 2003
Spider-Man 2," Did i see the same movie??!! That was really cheap,stupid...
","I saw the movie and thought it will have here a rating somewhere near 5.And then i see a TOP250 rating!!!Did you (who voted this so high) see the same movie as I?!Let me list just some stupid things about this 'masterpiece':MJ (how can someone in serious movies even call someone like this!!??) Mary Jane Watson (LOL) and her love story is one of the most stupid things filmed.She doesn't even know in whom she is in love with.She nearly marries someone;but she is far away from loving him.And then all this 'surprising twists' in this love story.That was really too cheap. And shall i write something about the famous scene (where she leaves the church, the sun is shining, the music is playing...)?! Better I don't.Or what about about Peters Aunt. And the scene where she hangs on an umbrella.That was more stupid than words can say.Or the great special effects? Some praise them. Hm; saw the same in the first part. Saw much better in X2 (which is a REAL movie with a REAL story).But OK, these are just stupid pieces of the whole movie. My most important point,and i can't understand the others didn't notice that. It is the completely stupid mixture what this movie is. We have some really stupid scenes (mentioned above).Then we have some scenes which try to show us the big emotions from movies for grown people (when Peter tells his aunt he could have saved his uncle).And then she walks slowly and quiet away (it tries to be great emotional cinema; but IMO this reaction was completely unrealistic; especially when they meat the next time!).Or when we see she hasn't enough money and mas to move to another apartment. But on the other side there are such stupid moments in here(umbrella...) That doesn't work out; it doesn't fit; it is wrong. At least it felt so to me. I made me go 'oh oh' !And there is even more of this 'mixing'. There is even more comedy (the newspaper scenes), but there are also some horror elements (doc oc - LOL, another stupid name in this movie).At all: this was much more a comic as it was a movie. If it would focus on a more serious or on a more funny story...both would have be OK. But this?! No, that was anything else but OK. As the first part was!My rating: 4/10",4,4,9,12 July 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnie is back in T3! Will we see him in T4?
","It´s not better then T2, and I think its not (much) worse. As others said, the acting, effects, action was ok, but Mostow wasnt the right man for this movie. The T-X was as good as the T-1000 (acting), and Kristianna Loken is not the one to blame if you didnt like T3.Here are just some things:1. When Mostow saw Arnold in the leather jacket he said: Now we´re making a Terminator! Well, I´m very sorry to tell you that, but you were making a Terminator also before that. The movie needs too much time to start! Untill the machine is looking into the screen (this was very chilling to me) it´s OK, but then there are a few minutes really, ugly sh... and nothing hapens. Instead of showing Kate and John so much, that should be shorter and he should show us how Arnie got the gun... Then suddenly the Action starts, too suddenly! I think the composition of the movie is very bad, this is indicated even by the fact the movie is just 1:40 long (and for this Arnie had to pay extra!!).2. Humor is OK, but it was too much! It was funny and I liked it (more funny then Bruce Almighty and Anger Management), but somewhere the director must say: It´s enough!3. My most important point (and why I think the movie is not as good as the first 2 Terminators): In T1 and T2 John Connor is not born or hes not very important to the movie. Through the movie we see a cold fight, with less emotion... T3 has too much of John and Kate and their emotions... Even the Terminator is funny...! John Connor is 'The One', the leader of the people, but this is during the war, this here is before it, John Connor isnt so much important here!It seems that Director and Producer must have a T4 in their minds. If it will be without Arnie it is already sh... and not worth of making it! When Arnie will be back (I doubt in this!), then you need a story directly after the war started, in which John Connor wont show us his emotions, but show us why he is so important; it cant be just that he says he´ll take the lead.",8,0,0,7 August 2003
American History X," With no question a really good movie!
","But in some way I expected a speech (or at least a memorable sentence) against racism. But it´s more the quiet way of protest.And for me a question, what will happen after Danny was shot?It wasn´t just meant as a shocking end, but it also gave you the possibility to discuss. Will he again become as he was earlier, or will he see where this all leads?
I´d like to believe that he will see it, but the ending means for all the others it continues as before!",Null,0,1,19 June 2003
Schindler's List," Best movie of all time!
","Right after 'The fellowship of the ring'. I liked the second one more because of its story, effects, sound, acting and its a really magnificent movie. But on the other hand we have a moving, perfect movie. It presents a so important part of history, reminds us of what happened in a very emotional way, but never gets boring (sorry, but many other great movies have this HUGE 'error'). With Liam Neesons (Oscar Schindler) and  Ralph Fiennes (Amon Göth) we see two of the best performances ever (together with Marlon Brandos and Robert de Niros Godfather).It has also some moments which stand out from the whole movie and will stay with me for all time (what is a proof for really good movies). Here are 2:-When the first train wrongfully brings the Jews to Auschwitz and we see a colon of people walking into a building. Then the camera moves slowly to the top where we see a huge chimney, out of it coming black dust and we hear only the sound of the fire...-When Schindler is 'recrouting' people for his factory he also employs a teacher. When the teacher is sad by the Nazis he isnt 'important' he cant understand it. He says: Since when arent literature and history important? I love this sceen and its in my opinion the best of the movie. History-we must know the history so we dont make the same mistakes as people already made (racism...). and literature- literature represents of what are humans possible. Creating something beautiful, that has not really a practical use (dont misunderstand this!) but its made for higher reasons. The Nazis dont understand higher reasons, they just want them to work, so they can win the war. There is no space for something beautiful.-Finaly one of the last scenes: When Schindler is driving away at the end. He starts to compare things to human lives...: This symbol, its made of gold. For it i could save two lives!...And there are much more! One of the best movies of all time and for all time!",10,9,13,26 October 2003
Hero," A nearly perfect movie with fantastic scenes and cinematography!
","It´s nearly hard to express how magnificent this movie is. First I thought it will be packed with perfect Martial Arts and lots of computer tricks, but it has other, much more impressive things.I enjoyed the playing with the colors very much (first red, then blue, white and green). Possibly they have a deeper meaning (4 seasons?), but it´s better to sit and let the colors make an impression on you. From this point it would be an 10/10 movie.Then there are the Martial Art and the effects. They looked to me very unnatural. It´s so obvious the actors are hanging on some thin ropes. The story is a little bit confusing, and here the colors are very good used to make it easier to understand the movie.In all a beautiful experience, with one fantastic scene after the other. For me the best one is when Moon and Flying snow fight in the forest, but see it your self!",10,0,0,24 June 2003
Atonement," Beauty and perfection
","To say it straight away ...I can't remember a movie before Atonement to picture such a broad spectrum of the human soul in one single movie, and yet is every aspect portrayed with such detail and beauty.In this movie everything seems explained; guilt, love, sorrow, hate, hope ... crime, war, peace ...The direction was really impressive, the cinematography just beautiful, the soundtrack was perfect, the sound editing thrilling. I don't want to give everything away, but if you see this movie, is hard to look at the movie itself, because there are all those perfect details in direction ...As for the ending ... I guess some will love it as the whole movie, some (including me) will find it 'inapropiate' to the movie, stealing a bit of its beauty!",9,4,6,29 January 2008
