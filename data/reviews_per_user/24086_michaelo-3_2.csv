The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely the worst movie I have ever sat through in my life.
","I would like to know who and what chemical the people that rated this movie was on when they rated it an 8.  I don't believe that this film should be rated as a movie or any other type of entertainment.  The real title should have been, 'three idiots lost in the woods'.I have seen better home movies of children in the hospital.  For the sake of movie go-ers everywhere please review the people who rank these movies, and weed out the tasteless.The only startling part of this movie was that it would never end.  I have been an avid movie go-er for 40 years.  Love all sorts of movies.  But that is the key, it must be a movie.  This film is a rip off.  Take it out of the theatres, put it back in the small artist shops that seem to think it is quaint to support off of the wall attempts such as this.DisgustedCritics wake the hell up and be honest with the movie going public.",Null,1,3,11 August 1999
American Beauty," Why is family dysfunction Popular?
","I did not like the movie, I thought it glamorized perversion and family dysfunction. Although the acting by Spacey and Benning was excellent, should have had better material.  Does the movie show a typical neighborhood?",Null,0,0,16 October 1999
