The Avengers," So overrated...
","The absolute only reason I would give this movie a rating of three is because the visual effects weren't terrible. In all honesty, I had no intention of ever seeing it, but because my father bought it, I watched it. And winced all the way through.Now, I'll preface this by saying that I'm a fan of darker comic adaptations, and I'm certainly not an expert on The Avengers in general, but in my opinion this was one of the most obnoxious comic adaptations I've ever seen. Quite a long list of specific grievances here: Loki's character was laughably dramatic. Everything was overwhelmingly loud (explosions; hello), the acting (with Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo being exceptions) was sub-par at best, and the few weak attempts at humor literally had me putting my hands over my face out of embarrassment for the writers. I won't even go into the blatant discrepancies between the comics and the film. It was just so... so bad. Basically, this is one of those movies that's really, really horrible, but everyone wants to believe it's good because of the anticipation buildup, and it's aimed at the idiots who don't actually care about comics or characters but are stupid enough to act like they know everything about them after they see it. I'm angry with the film industry for this one, although, sadly, it turned out to be exactly what I expected: a money maker. That's all it is. If you're looking for any talent, honor, or artistic merit, you won't find it here, folks. Just a lot of explosions.",3,10,22,19 October 2012
