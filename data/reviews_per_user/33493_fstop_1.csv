Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Beautiful, and Weak!
","By Far the most beautiful, but weakest of the 4 films to date.  Although it is set during a raging battle, you only witness 2 deaths in the entire film (not including droids)!  It seemed to volley between 3rd grade humor and over technical banter.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
