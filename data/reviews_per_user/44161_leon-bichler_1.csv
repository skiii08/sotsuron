Hereditary," Worst movie, I've ever seen (besides killing of a sacred deer)
","My first review at all! This waste of time and money in the cinema forces me to that! A really stupid, boring, demonic and obviously esoteric and occult movie with clear antichristianic message. Instead of nice thrilling scenes, many disgusting pictures and a real bad script!",1,2,7,23 September 2018
