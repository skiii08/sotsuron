'The King's Speech'. It even won Original Screenplay.Now, 'The King's Speech' is a deserving film. Though, I loved 'The Social Network, 'Winter's Bone' & 'The Fighter' more, yet I cannot over-look this acclaimed film.Tom Hooper's 'The King's Speech' tells the story King George VI, who, to overcome his stutter, is introduced to Lionel Logue, an unorthodox speech therapist. The two men become friends as they work together, and thus begins a journey of friendship & responsibility.'The King's Speech' is about a Man trying to Voice his opinion. Oscar-Winner Tom Hooper makes his protagonist interesting & subdued at the same time. He uses him. He makes him human & down-to-earth. Splendid Job, Mr. Hooper! The Screenplay is wonderful, so is the Cinematography.Colin Firth delivers remarkably as the King and makes his Oscar Win seem justified. Watch him in the scene when he begins to weep near his wife, and by saying he's not worthy begin a king. It's simply superb! Geoffrey Rush scores as Logue. Rush is a limitless talent and here's another performance that proves that fact. Helena Bonham Carter is charming as the Queen. Guy Pearce is another topper. Michael Gambon is very good.

Saturday Night Fever," Groovy!
","John Badham's 'Saturday Night Fever' is a groovy, spicy and lastly energetic movie. John Travolta puts on the coat with grace, goes on the dance floor and provides some clap-slap dance moves. 'Saturday Night Fever' is about a young immature fella, who finds himself stuck between family issues and disco-dancing. His journey is thrilling and very musical. John Badham's direction captures Travolta's sissy movements with a jig on the crust. Travolta rules the show with a super performance. His dancing, though very 'Girly' makes you move nonetheless. But what truly moves you is, as mentioned, his performance. He gives his character importance and he keeps the atmosphere alive. Travolta now ranks as a legend, for being a full-round performer and rightly so. At the end of the review, I suggest you check out this musical-classic for it's sheer energy and Travolta's honesty. Two Thumbs Dancing Up!",8,0,3,7 October 2010
The Lobster," Funny, Fk'ed Up!
","'The Lobster' is genuinely innovative, at times hilarious, but overall, its abstract. There's really nothing here that seems offensive, but I don't know what it wants to be. At best, its Funny, but Fk'ed Up!'The Lobster' Synopsis: In a Dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.I liked 'The Lobster' to an extent. I liked the bleakness of the near future & the absurdity of its characters. Its a violent story, but a world fumed by havoc. But, overall, I didn't understand what this film was trying to say. Sure, its about human dependency, but why the graphic nature & why such an unsatisfying end? I was puzzled once it ended.Efthimis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos's Screenplay has some great dark humour, but is confused & overstuffed for the most of it. Lanthimos's Direction is well-done, as the bleak mood is correctly maintained. Cinematography & Editing are top-class.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell slips into the character & performs with admirable conviction. Also, his overweight appearance adds to his part. Rachel Weisz is ever-marvelous. John C. Reilly is beyond brilliant & is also the film's biggest highlight. His 'lisping man' is a marvel. Ben Whishaw is okay, while Léa Seydoux oozes menace.On the whole, 'The Lobster' is a very weird film.",5,3,10,5 January 2016
Moneyball," A Fantastic Film!
","'Moneyball' is a Fantastic Film, in all respects. Bennett Miller's Direction is skilled, Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin's Screenplay is wonderful, and the performances, are excellent! 'Moneyball is The story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.'Moneyball' executes Billy Beane's Exhillirating Journey with flourish.

Blade Runner 2049," A Visual Marvel!
","A sequel to the cult-classic Blade Runner, 'Blade Runner 2049' is A Visual Marvel, that is a feast for the eyes. No Kidding, This Neo-Noir Sci-Fi Flick reminds us the power of visuals in celluloid & takes you in the future with finesse. Not a single frame falters, in fact, as this visual poetry progresses, the presentation gets deeper & deeper.However, Master Director Denis Villeneuve doesn't succeed entirely. Reason? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's Erratic & Overlong Screenplay. Sure, the world of 'Blade Runner 2049' requires time, so one can absorb it, but was there a need to drag the film for nearly 3 hours (163-minutes, to be precise), Nope! Despite some terrific sequences & an intense atmosphere, the Writing lags at many a times & takes away a good bit of 'Blade Runner 2049'. While Visually Stunningly & Magnificently Shot by Cinematography God Roger Deakins, this Epic tale needed a crisper & more consistent, Screenplay.'Blade Runner 2049' Synopsis: A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.'Blade Runner 2049' is a tale on humanity, survival, violence & sacrifice. The world here is mix of futuristic dynamo, to utter ruin of waste lands (Mad Max: Fury Road, anyone?), contrasting the effects of human choices & the bleakness of the future, that remains in our bare hands. We follow K, the Protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in this bleak & violent journey, where rogues are hunted down and killed, where the cops hold power until they also are massacred & ruthless leaders who manufacturer rogues with sinister motives. Its all too much to swallow & while some of it went above my head, most of it caught my attention & the visual scenery spoke much more, than most of the dialogue. The first-hour beautifully builds up, offering some sharp action combat sequences & introducing its characters gradually. There is a sense of impending doom, covered in gorgeousness & its all visually poetic. BUT, the second-hour goes for a toss. Overlong & Erratic, the second-hour suffers on length & solid substance. And while there is a pleasure in watching Blade Runner Veteran Harrison Ford reprise his popular role, the film overstays its welcome. The narrative needed to be Written better, given the team that this film is blessed with, on and off camera & also, some editing, by at least 25-minutes. Had that been the case, 'Blade Runner 2049' would've been 2017's very own Masterpiece!And before I acknowledge all the talent here, I must start with the Star of the Show - Roger Deakins. The Cinematographer outshines himself here & leaves you mesmerized. 'Blade Runner 2049' is among the most well-shot films of recent & Deakins' Genius with the Camera, is something to be experienced. Despite the flaws, I would recommend every Cinephile out there to watch 'Blade Runner 2049' for its Cinematography. You'll be reminded, just like how I was, that being, how each & every frame can turn into Visual Mastery. The Academy has to honor Deakins next year, or else, they ain't doing any good!Denis Villeneuve is in great form, yet again. The Master Director has directed this Magnum-Opus with a vision that is easy to envy as well as to inspire. How I wish the Writing supported Villeneuve & Deakins, as their work here is nothing short of astonishing. Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch's Score is fantastic. Art & Costume Design define perfection. Graphics are incredible; among the best I've seen in recent times. Make-Up, also, is very-well done. Performance-Wise: Ryan Gosling as K, makes for an interesting hero. But there are no surprises in Gosling's turn here, its regular Gosling. And that can be underwhelming since his last release was La La Land. Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard & adds the much needed punch to the proceedings. Jared Leto as Niander Wallace, the antagonist, is creepy to the core. Leto emerges as a scene-stealer here, despite the fact that he only appears in a cameo. Ana de Armas as Joi, Gosling's holographic companion, is effective. Sylvia Hoeks as the villainous Luv, is exquisite. She stands out! Robin Wright as Lt. Joshi, is first-rate, as usual. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'Blade Runner 2049' is visually empowering, but not as strong as a whole. Its definitely worth a watch, but it doesn't really surpass the expectations.",6,6,18,6 October 2017
Angels & Demons," Cinema At Its Best!
","I haven't read the novel, thus, I went inn watching it with huge expectations.... Directed by Ron Howard, Starring my favorite and everybody's favorite Tom Hanks... and yes, people have been roaring the novel.... and the film has become a major blockbuster.I enjoyed 'The Da Vinci Code', but 'Angels & Demons' written by the same author, made by the same director & and has the same actor reprising his role. Now here it is, 'Angels & Demons' is cinema at its best. A all-rounder, a highly entertaining, highly gripping, highly delightful experience. Honestly, 'Angels & Demons' is the finest entertainer I've seen this year. One of the best films I've seen in this decade, and yes a film I'll remember for years to come. Bravo!Highpoints of the film: Everything. A Fantastic Entertainer. Performances are superb. Tom Hanks delivers a bravura performance, I love this actor, I will love him till my last breath. Ewan McGregor is excellent, his character is superb. Ayelet Zuer is very good. Stellan Skarsgard is first-rate. Any flaws? Nothing. On the whole 'Angels & Demons' is superior product in all aspects.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino rocks!
","I loved volume one... it's one of my favorite films. 'Kill Bill: Vol.2' is also great, but lacks compared to it's first, in a way... as this is a continuation. Tarantino's outstanding direction keeps you hooked... he's in form as ever. In my eye, he's the finest filmmaker of this generation. The sequence when Uma escapes from the coffin is the high-light of the enterprise. Amazingly short & written. It's the best movie scene in a long time. Though, I think the way Bill was killed was boring. It just doesn't work, Uma should have given him a tough fight rather than performing a kung-fu stint. Nonetheless, this film's a must see.Uma Thurman is outstanding as the revengeful bride. Late actor David Carradine is flawless. Daryl Hannah & Michael Madsen are superb. on the whole, not as good as it's prequel... but worth a watch. Thumbs Up!",7,5,12,27 September 2009
Vertigo," A Fine Psychological Thriller!
","Alfred Hitchcock, a master of horror/thrillers, delivers A Fine Psychological Thriller with his much-loved classic 'Vertigo'. A claustrophobic, puzzling tale, that works in many ways. 'Vertigo' Synopsis: A retired San Francisco detective suffering from acrophobia investigates the strange activities of an old friend's wife, all the while becoming dangerously obsessed with her.'Vertigo' has everything going for it, except, for its mercilessly slow-pacing. Sure, not every story needs to be fast-paced, but at least there needs to be proper pacing. The only minus point of 'Vertigo' is its pacing. But coming to the winning points, Hitchcock creates a world of doubt & deceiving with dexterity. He Directs this difficult human-tale, authoritatively. Alec Coppel & Samuel A. Taylor's Screenplay offers delicious twists & turns, which engross its viewer effectively. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is dull.Performance-Wise: James Stewart enacts his part with gusto. Kim Novak is highly competent. Barbara Bel Geddes is credible.On the whole, 'Vertigo' may not be Hitchcock's best, but it definitely stands out as a well-done Psychological Thriller!",7,1,2,28 February 2014
Black Swan," Chilling!
","Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a Chilling film. It's scary, ambitious, abstract & courageous. Darren Aronofsky is at his best here, as he manages to hold your attention in most parts of the film, and Natalie Portman delivers a performance that was meant for an Oscar!'Black Swan' tells the story of a Nina played by Portman, a ballet dancer, perfect fit for the White Swan, while Lily played by Mila Kunis, has a personality that matches the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.About 107-minutes long, this psychological thriller never really loses pace. In fact, the writing, in some sequences is nail-biting. But, the culmination, leaves you in mixed emotions. Though beautifully shot & executed, the desired impact seems to be missing. A little more of detail would've worked big time! Aronofsky directs this chilly fare, with el'an. In fact, his Oscar-Nomination was so well-deserving. Cinematography is brilliant. The Ballet Dances are wonderfully performed.Performance-Wise: Portman obviously steals the show in an Oscar-Winning Performance. And her Ballet Dances, are mesmerizing. Mila Kunis is a revelation. She delivers her finest performance in here. Vincent Cassel is bombastic, while Barbara Hershey proves her caliber once again. Winona Ryder in a brief role, is passable.On the whole, A Winner! Go For It!",8,2,3,22 March 2011
Changeling," A Milestone....
","Based on real life events in 1928 Los Angeles comes a Milestone of a film, made by none-another than CINEMA LEGEND Clint Eastwood. 'Changeling' is must watch for each & every human being alive! 'Changeling' is not only about a mother & her lost child, but also focuses on the shitty & corrupt side of the LAPD & on the infamous 'Wineville Chicken Coop' case. This is real stuff, this happened way back in the late 1920's. Honestly, 'Changeling' is such a real & moving experience, that you really forget that you're watching a film made by Cinematic Legends.Written Brilliantly by J. Michael Straczynski & amazingly executed by the Greatest Film-Personality, Sir.Eastwood, comes a film that we'll remember for a really, long, long time for sure.In the acting department, Angelina Jolie delivers an astounding performance as Christine Collins.

Rob Marshall's direction is decent. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is fine. Stunts are fabulous.Performance-Wise: Depp is fun and effortless as Captain Jack Sparrow, once again. His body language and comic timing are perfect. Penélope Cruz is satisfactory. Ian McShane is fantastic as the baddie, while Geoffrey Rush has a blast playing Barbossa, once again.

'Men in Black 3' Synopsis: Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.'Men in Black 3' is a highly satisfying sequel, that lives up-to the gargantuan expectations. The Screenplay Written by Etan Cohen is extremely entertaining & the entire twist in the tale, that allows Brolin's bravura turn as the young agent K, is its trump card. Barry Sonnenfeld's Direction is grand. Cinematography & Editing are marvelous. Make-Up & Special Effects are spectacular.Performance-Wise: Brolin as the young Agent K is gloriously heroic & scene-stealing. The Academy-Award-Nominated Actor has never been this good. A Hallmark Performance! Will Smith returns as Agent J & he gets it right, once again. Tommy Lee Jones too returns as Agent K, but here he's reduced into a cameo, as its Brolin taking away his part with glory. Jemaine Clement as Boris the Animal, the frightening villain, is excellent. Emma Thompson as Agent O, is delightful. Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, an alien with precognitive powers, stands out. Bill Hader is noticeable.On the whole, 'Men in Black 3' is terrific entertainment.",9,0,2,29 October 2012
The New World," Poetry!
","Terrence Malick delivers Poetry with 'The New World'. A riveting, heart-melting film, with a historical touch. It may not cater to everyone's taste, but for Mailck's fans, like me, there is almost everything here. 'The New World' Synopsis: The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.'The New World' has strong characters, that lead the narratively firmly. Malick's Screenplay isn't just a Pocahontas legend, its also about mother nature, its about love, its about war & violence. The film flows beautifully & Emmanuel Lubezki's Mesmerising Cinematography makes the film a visual delight! Malick's Direction is poetic. He's a master at his craft, who combines nature in his storytelling. And he does it so effortlessly. 'The New World' is amongst his most sensitive works to date. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Editing is perfect (I have watched the 135-minute version). A Special Mention for the legendary James Horner, who's score is simply enchanting.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell gives his all. The supremely talented actor is subtle & throughly believable. Christian Bale has a small role, but he enacts it remarkably. Christopher Plummer adds weight to his part. But its Q'orianka Kilcher who steals the show. As Pocahontas, the performer brings life to a difficult, tender part & shines from start to end. On the whole, 'The New World' is truly a memorable piece in filmmaking. Watch it for the master that is Terrence Malick.",9,0,1,9 September 2015

The Monuments Men," A Mostly Engaging Watch!
","Loosely based on the non-fiction book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter, 'The Monuments Men' is a well-crafted & mostly engaging film by George Clooney, that wins over its flaws. While the Writing's tone shifts abruptly at times, the fine cast & deft direction by Clooney keep the goings-on thoroughly watchable.'The Monuments Men' Synopsis: An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.'The Monuments Men' is based on a true-story about war heroes who went near the war-zone to save creative masterpieces. You'd ask who goes out there in the middle of a bloodbath for sake of art? These heroes did! Why? Because Art defines humanity & how Art stands tall for its time & beyond. 2 of its heroes even lost their lives while on their mission & guess what, their sacrifice wasn't only to save art, but also humanity that lies beneath the masterpieces we talk about to date. Be it Michelangelo's Madonna or an Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece to name a few, remain as Artful & are considered as Creatives Masterpieces. And these heroes made sure they remained among us, despite the violence & menace all around them. Now that's Heroism!And it helps that the cinematic motion-picture about these heroes is bought to life by Oscar-Winning Film Giant - George Clooney. Keeping the pace moving & his direction consistently deft, Clooney delivers a film that offers some inspired laughs & a number of fascinating moments, that win you over. Of course, Clooney & Grant Heslov's Writing isn't always tight & the tone shifts from light to dull at times, but overall, this is a fascinating story that you might have not even heard of, but should experience, to respect its heroes. Clooney knows his job & while he can Write better, he sure knows how to direct & create an atmosphere for its subject matter. Phedon Papamichael's Cinematography, Stephen Mirrione's Editing, Alexandre Desplat's Score & the Excellent Production Design, merit a special mention. Performance-Wise: Clooney delivers, yet again! He delivers an entirely committed performance, that never hits a wrong mark. Matt Damon is terrific, as always. Its nice to see this versatile actor indulge himself in a strong supporting role. Cate Blanchett is extra-ordinary. Her sequences with Damon, stand out. John Goodman & Bill Murray deserved meatier roles & lines, but add to the narrative by just appearing here. Bob Balaban is top-notch. Hugh Bonneville & Jean Dujardin leave a mark. On the whole, 'The Monuments Men' is definitely watchable.",6,0,3,7 September 2017

'10 Cloverfield Lane' is Sharply Written by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken & Damien Chazelle. The tense proceedings are expertly written, as you do feel for the lady in trouble. The claustrophobic mood (the film is set in a bunker), is eerie, but suits the film well. What I was particularly impressed by was the flow of the narrative. It slowly warms up & ends on a strong note. Of course, I personally thought the end would be a bit different, but it still works. The Writing is solid, at most parts.

Ali," A Well-Acted Film!
","Boxing Legend Muhammad Ali's life unfolds in 'Ali'. Directed by Michael Mann, this biopic, which failed at the box office, actually deserves a watch, for the fine performances it offers, along-with commendable direction by Mann. 'Ali' tells the story of Muhammad Ali, played by Will Smith, from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture as of the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston, his conversion to Islam, criticism of the Vietnam War, banishment from boxing, his return to fight Joe Frazier in 1971, and, lastly, his reclaiming the title from George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle fight of 1974. 'Ali' is engaging in parts, not in totality. Reason? The Erratic Screenplay, that sometimes gives it's icon his due, while sometimes, backlashes him with overly-long scenes. Screenplay by Eric Roth, Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson & Mann himself, works in parts. It definitely could've been tighter & even shorter. Mann's direction, on the other-hand, is commendable, as always. The Boxing Sequences are stunning, while the Cinematography & Editing, are crisp. Make-Up, is marvelous. Performance-Wise: Will Smith as Muhammad Ali, is damn impressive. The actor never loses focus & pays tribute to the ring-legend. Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, is first-rate, although, he is hardly recognizable, thanks to the terrificly done make-up. Jamie Foxx is good. Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, is sincere. Ron Silver & Jeffrey Wright are passable. Jada Pinkett Smith & Mykelti Williamson support well. Others fill the bill.On the whole, 'Ali' isn't flawless, but well-acted & nicely executed, nevertheless.",7,0,1,19 November 2011

The narrative arrests you & doesn't let you go. Its so much fun watching the two young bloods doing so much wrong, to get it right. Phillips's Direction is super. Its good to see him back in form, after a hiatus. 'War Dogs' is definitely among his best films to date! Lawrence Sher's Cinematography captures the greed & madness, with fineness. Jeff Groth's Editing is razor-crisp, 114-minutes swing by smoothly. Art & Costume Design are excellent. The brief action-bits are well-done. Cliff Martinez's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: While its Miles Teller who gets the main role (and also does a voice-over throughout the film), 'War Dogs' still belongs to Jonah Hill. Jonah, an actor who never fails to surprise, is simply fabulous. Jonah sinks his teeth into the part & performs with enviable bravado. He's every bit of the greedy a-hole he plays & gets the best lines as well, who he delivers with his uniqueness. Also, his laugh, is another highlight. Having said that, Miles is quite-good as well, but this is Jonah's show & he owns it. Ana de Armas looks gorgeous & plays the mandatory female influence, with honesty. Kevin Pollak is first-rate. Bradley Cooper shines in an extended cameo.On the whole, 'War Dogs' is a Dynamite! Don't miss it. And how about a 3rd Oscar-Nomination for Jonah?",9,2,10,20 August 2016

Child 44," Tom Hardy Delivers A Knockout Performance!
","Based on Tom Rob Smith's 2008 novel of the same name, 'Child 44' is a yet another showcase of Tom Hardy's excellence. The supremely talented actor is in complete show-stealing mode here, delivering a knockout performance from start to end.'Child 44' Synopsis: A disgraced member of the military police investigates a series of nasty child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union.'Child 44' is strictly an okay film, though. While its beautifully Directed by Daniel Espinosa & Photographed by Philippe Rousselot, this mystery-thriller still fails to mesmerize you. Reason? Richard Price's Adapted Screenplay, which ranges from riveting to plain dull. I did get goosebumps in some sequences, especially in the film's intriguing first-hour, but was mostly bored in its dull second-hour. Also, the final-act doesn't work. 'Child 44' had all the makings of becoming an instant classic, but what is eventually served, despite a few genuinely terrific moments, is an average fare, at best. Performance-Wise: As mentioned right from my summary, Tom Hardy has topped himself, yet again! With his flawless Russian accent to perfect body language, Hardy proves that he's the best in the business today, among his contemporaries. Noomi Rapace is competent, as always. Gary Oldman is adequate. Joel Kinnaman isn't menacing enough, while Vincent Cassel seems to have done his bit in a massive hurry. Jason Clarke is wasted.

Airlift," Sincere, But Never Power-Packed!
","Based on a courageous true-story, 'Airlift sadly isn't half as powerful as its story actually is.

But, for some odd reason, there is barely any tension in the film. Raja Krishna Menon, Suresh Nair, Rahul Nangia & Ritesh Shah's Screenplay is a mixed bag. It begins superbly, but 30-minutes into the film, the pace drops. I wasn't tensed or aghast by the way the war erupts nor was I particularly rooting for the Protagonist in his mission. And its the Writing to blame. Also, The first-hour moves on a slow-pace & the story doesn't move forward. The second-hour picks up momentum & fares better in comparison. But overall, 'Airlift' never soars! The Writing needed to be stronger & more urgent.Raja Krishna Menon's Direction is decent. Cinematography is gritty & nicely mounted. Editing is mostly crisp, although the first-hour is slow-paced! Art & Costume Design are average. Action-Sequences are raw & rustic. Background Score is top-class. Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar delivers a committed performance, enacting the heroic protagonist with honesty. Its his performance that acts as a major plus point to this otherwise ordinary film. Nimrat Kaur is okay. Purab Kohli is very good. Kumud Mishra is terrific, as always. Inaamulhaq & Prakash Belawadi ham it up in supporting roles. On the whole, 'Airlift' works in parts.

He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.

The regret, the pain of killing an innocent kid, you fell the pain he's going through. Calling his performance as fantastic would've been an understatement. Bombastic, ya, maybe, but a performance like this is above the words and higher than any praise. Ralph Fiennes is, as always, commendable. Brenden Gleeson is outstanding; especially in the climax. Clémence Poésy does a good job.Now get this straight: 'In Bruges' is above-the-normal-stuff, way above. This film is gory at places agreed, but in totality, A treat for the viewer! The film will gain a cult following in the coming years, and will be remembered as one of the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!",9,1,3,7 August 2009

Cory Lambert, the protagonist (Jeremy Renner) is a man who's dealing with his own demons & gets a shot at redemption when this brutal murder occurs.

And its the diversity & the connection of these 2 characters that make 'Wind River' all the more interesting. And Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay intelligently intertwines the extreme gap of its leading characters in a world of brutality & crime. The Writing builds up slowly, but never loses the momentum. What works more so for the Writing is the consistently serious tone, that never changes gear for the sake of cheap thrills.Sheridan's Direction, too, is competent. Ben Richardson's Cinematography stunningly captures the wilderness as well as the brutality. Gary D. Roach's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are authentic. Action-Sequences are nicely choreographed, but are too violent. Performance-Wise: Renner & Olsen do some of their best work here.

I'm Not There," Watch it for Cate Blanchett!
","Inspired by the life of iconic American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, 'I'm Not There' is a confusing take on the music-legend. If there is anything that stands tall here, it's Cate Blanchett, who takes up the challenge to play a opposite sex and perform with such energy.'I'm Not There' captures the journey of Bob Dylan, weirdly. Over-here, Six actors depict different facets of Dylan's popular life and public persona: Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, and Ben Whishaw. Though an interesting idea, the film lacks a solid and sharp screenplay. Also, at times it's very difficult to grasp it's momentum. Todd Haynes's direction is good. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is passable.Acting-Wise: As mentioned, Cate Blanchett rules the show, and plays Dylan with energy. Marcus Carl Franklin is alright.

It's 94 minutes long in running time, and it's quite entertaining all through. Penelope Spheeris's direction is good.Mike Myers is quite good as Wayne. But I believe, it's Dana Carvey who steals the show. As Garth, he sports a horrendous wig, plays his part effortlessly and makes you laugh at the very right places.

While its ambitious to a fault (the film particularly lags in its initial reels), its overall a great story of a leader, who's over-the-top & risky decisions led him to create history of its own. This is a personal story about a man in great power & how his courage & at times, humor, led him to become a leader to follow. Churchill is not a perfect man, he's always in need for a drink or smoking up a cigar with less regard to polluting a room, but he's a determind man with a vision of a true Prime Minister, that knew how to deal with the forces when the world was at War. McCarten's Screenplay is engrossing & despite some flaws for its initial tepid start, make up for a well-written Screenplay. Wright's Direction is commanding & powerful. Bruno Delbonnel's Cinematography & Valerio Bonelli's Editing are fantastic. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention. Dario Marianelli's Score, also, is good.But the reason to really watch 'Darkest Hour' is, of course, Gary Oldman. With his perfect body-language, to his impeccable dialogue delivery to the fierceness in his eyes, Oldman is truly remarkable. This has to be his finest performance ever after his mesmerizing turn in 'Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy'. With Golden-Globe & SAG Nominations already in, Oscar Calling is meant to happen. Of the rest of the cast, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn & Lily James, are in top-form.On the whole, 'Darkest Hour' is a Gary Oldman showcase. And it helps that the showcase is also a pretty good period piece. Watch It.",7,12,27,14 December 2017

RD Jr proves yet again we don't need another Stark/Iron Man when he's around. He's fantastic, once again. Mickey Rourke is another topper. The Legendary Star is kick-ass as Whiplash, he hardly has any lines, but his powerful expressions speak more than needed! Sam Rockwell is terrific in a villainous role, the highly-talented actor sinks his teeth into the character. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming. Scarlett Johansson looks a million bucks and does a good job.

But, the second hour plays a spoilsport. The goings get confusing, and the culmination is the weakest link. It may be damn new in terms of ending a story, but I somehow, couldn't grasp it.Terry Gilliam's direction is first-class. The screenplay is generally superb, but gets confused mid-way. Music by Paul Buckmaster, is haunting. Roger Pratt's Camera-Work is worth a mention.In the acting department, Bruce Willis is good. Brad Pitt is the show-stealer. The star-actor is superb in a role that is very difficult to execute. Madeleine Stowe is another topper. She's in terrific form. Christopher Plummer, as always, is perfect.On the whole, this is some real weird/good/absurd stuff that has a lot going for it. Strongly recommended!",7,0,1,19 September 2010

The first-hour works wonders, but the second-hour slows down & the flaws in the Writing show up. The final-act, to put it bluntly, isn't half as emotionally moving as it deserved to be. In short, the Writing lets 'The Danish Girl' down, at some parts.Tom Hooper's Direction is dignified. He has handled some of the most dramatic scenes, with great conviction.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Strictly for the hoi polloi
","Gavin Hood attempts X-men for the first time... Bryan Singer made the first 2 installments, Brett Ratner made the final part. In that way, Hood makes the very first installment.... on how Logan turned into Wolverine. The sequels to this one are highly entertaining... especially The Last Stand. but our main question is that does the very first part convince or not? The answer is yes, as well as a no. X-Men Origins: Wolverine has some amazing action, a killer performance by Hugh Jackman and beautiful locales... but apart from that it has nothing great to offer. X-men Origins: Wolverine lacks the power, the script doesn't hold and has no graph... jaisa shuru hui, waise hi katham hui. Gavin Hood had the chance to make this one a masterstroke of an entertainer.... he had everything going with him... high budget, big stars, and most of all... a Brand which has gained a cult following over the years. but sadly he makes, 'X-men Origins: Wolverine' an average watch. Not near its expectations!Pluses of the film: Action sequences are amazing... each and every stunt makes you go WOW!. Locales have been exploited beautifully by the cinematographer. And of course, Hugh Jackman. He plays his part amazingly... and stands out. This film would've sunk without this screen icon. Minuses of the film: The script isn't as good as it should've been. It lacked the rage, it lacked the excitement. The writers David benioff & Skip Woods have done a disappointing job. Gavin Hood's direction is also below the mark. And one more minus point... every actor apart from Jackman is terribly wasted. Its sad to see an actor like Ryan Reynolds being reduced in such roles. He's completely wasted in a apology of a role. Liev Schreiber is not in from, again due to weak characterization. Ditto for all the other actors.on the whole 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' could've been cinema at its best... but sadly, it isn't.",Null,0,2,20 June 2009

With an Ensemble that delivers like never before, A Screenplay so strong you can't move & Directed with such command, 'Spotlight' is a major achievement from every corner of filmmaking.'Spotlight' is The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.The harshest aspect of 'Spotlight' is, that its based on a True-Story. A horrifyingly shocking one. But this is a heroic story about those who went against the church & exposed its demonic priests. Its a challenging, undeniable story, where justice is eventually served to those who deserve nothing but pure punishment. 'Spotlight' works from start to end. McCarthy and Josh Singer's Screenplay is powerful, as disturbing as it is. The Writing refuses to slow-down & the narrative is so engrossing, you can't move from your seat. You watch the heroes uncover a regrettable chapter of human history & the approach in the narrative, is no-holds-barred. Its non-stop, high-powered Drama. McCarthy's Direction is defines Command.

Terminator Salvation," An okay fare!
","I've grown up watching The Terminator series... I've been a hardcore fan of the James Cameron epics. I've seen T2 at least 10-12 times... oh man, what a classic! But Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines directed by Jonathan Mostow, which came long ago, was a disappointment. Ditto for McG's 'Terminator Salvation'. The problem for me first of all is, Terminator can never be the same without Arnie... he immortalized Terminator... he's the best and minus him, Terminator will lack the fun. The second problem is the slow treatment, minus the action, the film hardly has anything that makes you go WOW! In a nutshell, 'Terminator Salvation' is an okay fare at best. Performances: Bale is good as John Connor. Sam Worthington is impressive. Anton Yelchin, first featured in Star Terk and now Terminator Salvation, this boy is going places. His performance is passable. Bryce Dallas Howard looks angelic and delivers a sincere performance. Helena Bonham Carter is wasted.On the whole, 'Terminator Salvation' is no where close to its earlier parts. A strictly one time watch!",5,1,3,27 June 2009
Aquaman," A Visually Dazzling, Yet Overstuffed Spectacle!
","Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, 'Aquaman' is the big DC Blockbuster that finally opened in cinemas today in India. Directed by James Wan, best known for helming the spooky Conjuring Series, now delves into the Superhero mold and delivers a visual spectacle. Wan, however, suffers partially on the account of an Overstuffed Screenplay, that is patchy and overlong.'Aquaman' Synopsis: Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa in a winning performance) the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.'Aquaman', who appeared in last year's disappointing Justice League, gets his solo origin story here and the Superhero is an instantly likable one. And Momoa gets into the skin of the superhero and delivers a fun turn, that leads 'Aquaman' to much success. Momoa not only looks the part, but brings a fabulous heroism to the part, which was essential here.Another ace of 'Aquaman' are its visuals. This biggie looks like a dream! The world created underwater is dreamy and will leave your eyes mesmerized. The Graphics are of top-grade, and 'Aquaman' is easily the BEST looking DC film, yet! And the action-sequences, though way too many, are proficiently picturised and executed. Some of the stunts are wow! I'd like to point the one sequence that takes place in Italy in the film's latter half. Its stupendous!However, despite magnificent visuals and Momoa nailing the titular role, 'Aquaman' suffers due to an overstuffed Screenplay. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick & Will Beall's Screenplay brings much action and a fast-moving narrative, but has no soul. Sure, 'Aquaman' wasn't going to be an experience full of pathos and soul, but here, there is none of it, not even a slight bit of it. The film keeps moving forward, not giving enough time to its characters to make them connect with the viewers, and there is just too much action here! I mean the action does leave a big impact, but there is an overdose of it here, quite frankly. It appears as if the Writers ran of out ideas in the middle, and kept writing action set-pieces until they found another aspect to continue upon. And there is barely any humor here, which is surprising, since Momoa seems to be good at being funny! The Writing could've been better, for sure!James Wan's Direction is top-notch. As mentioned earlier, 'Aquaman' is a visual delight and the Director gives the film the look it deserves. This is a grand film and looks every bit of it. Don Burgess's Cinematography is fantastic. The lensman has captured the film beautifully. Kirk Morri's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper. 'Aquaman' feels a little too long at a 143-minutes, some trimming, of at least 20-minutes, was required. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Rupert Gregson-Williams's Score is super.Barring Momoa, 'Aquaman' boasts an impressive host of actors, but the ones who stand out are Patrick Wilson (impressive as the villain) & Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko (efficient in a strong supporting role). Amber Heard as Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus & Temuera Morrison as Thomas Curry, are adequate.On the whole, 'Aquaman' is definitely fun, but it doesn't utilize its potential to the fullest. A Decent Watch!",6,43,108,14 December 2018

Concussion," Will Smith Returns!
","Based on the 2009 GQ exposÃ© Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas, 'Concussion' is a welcome return to form for Will Smith. The Oscar-Nominated Star/Actor is back in top-form, delivering a powerful performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a man of great honesty. Smith is back to his element after a long time.'Concussion' Synopsis: In Pittsburgh, accomplished pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu uncovers the truth about brain damage in football players who suffer repeated concussions in the course of normal play.'Concussion' is about a man's fight to speak the truth. This is an interesting true-story, thats been told effectively on celluloid. This biographical sports medical drama engages at most parts, although the second-hour is a bit dragging. But overall, I was arrested by the force of 'Concussion'. And by that I mean, Will Smith. He deserves Oscar Attention for this one. He slips into the character effortlessly & he picks up the accent, most accurately. Its a pleasure to see him back to being the terrific actor he is, even though its been years since he invested himself so deeply into a role. Offering him tremendous support are Alec Baldwin & Albert Brooks, who ignite the screen in strong supporting roles. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, too, adds depth to her part. On the whole, 'Concussion' is certainly a film worth watching as Writer-Director Peter Landesman keeps the narrative tight, at most times.",7,2,8,30 December 2015

'Don Jon' Synopsis: A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love.'Don Jon' is sexually explicit, verbose & even predictable after a point, but what keeps the wheels moving is the smartly Written Screenplay by JGL.

Thor: Ragnarok," Funny & Silly To The Point Of Overkill!
","The sequel to 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World (both entertaining films), 'Thor: Ragnarok' has to be the silliest superhero movie in a while. And luckily, its the silliness is intentional.'Thor: Ragnarok' Synopsis: Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela and the impending Ragnarök.'Thor: Ragnarok' works till it lasts, but I have one question: Did the humor have to be on till the point of overkill? Sure, the jokes land well & even energy remains all through in the narrative, but after a point, I laughed only because I had too. Its fun to watch Thor aka The Hammer of God on a light note & being the bum of many a joke, as well as watching HULK being supremely angry, with Bruce Banner being the ever surprised in real-self. But only till a point.Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost's Screenplay goes all-out for the laughs & succeeds. But at the expense of a mediocre villain & a few lagging pieces. The Terrific Taika Waititi Directs this recent Superhero Blockbuster, with the perfect blend of madness & ambition. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume & Graphics, are outstanding.Of the cast, Chris Hemsworth shines as Thor, continuing to play the part with complete commitment. And he's so funny here! Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk, is very good. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, is okay. Cate Blanchett as Hela, is reduced into being a seductive, but one-note villain. And Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster, steals the show. On the whole, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a good time, but nothing more.",6,2,5,30 January 2018

'Zodiac' Synopsis: A San Francisco cartoonist becomes an amateur detective obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer.'Zodiac' is engrossing, intense & disturbing. The journey of the unknown serial killer is nightmarish, but it unfolds fabulously on celluloid. This rather under-rated film narrates a story of crime & mercilessness with detail & concern. There is hardly a dull moment in the narrative. However, the excessive running-time of over 151-minutes, needed some trimming. James Vanderbilt's Screenplay, which has been Adapated by Robert Graysmith's non-fiction book of the same name, is solid & arresting. David Fincher Directs 'Zodiac' brilliantly. He has handled each & every moment with dexterity. Cinematography is claustrophobic, while the Editing is mostly crisp.

Hotel Rwanda," Moving!
","Based on real life events in Rwanda during the spring of 1994, 'Hotel Rwanda' takes us back in time & tells a regrettable tale of human tragedy.

Paul Rusesabagina is an example of how good & concerned a human can be, given the right thought.

Ready Player One," Fun!
","Based on Cline's 2011 novel of the same name, Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' is a fun watch, that sees the versatile director flex his talent for a summer blockbuster yet again. Although largely imperfect, this bid-budgeted Sci-Fi Adventure is never out of breath or visual bedazzlement. 'Ready Player One' Synopsis: When the creator of a virtual reality world called the OASIS dies, he releases a video in which he challenges all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune.'Ready Player One' is about video gamers & I'm certain video gamers are sure to enjoy this ride. The story here is basic, with an earnest protagonist (Tye Sheridan) who must fight against an evil villain (Ben Mendelsohn, in fine form). But, Spielberg is up for the challenge & he delivers entertaining sequences. I'd like to single out the sequence involving the Stanley Kubrick Horror Classic 'The Shining'. Its truly a terrific sequence, that captures both, humor & rush. Also, the visuals are to die for. 'Ready Player One' is a pure visual dream.Now coming to the flaws, the biggest problem with 'Ready Player One' is that it lacks soul. While its definitely a fun watch, this story lacks soul and also hardly has any characters that you actually feel for. And thats where the Writing lacks the bite. It goes all-out in imagery & action, but its out of considerable depth. Its all great to look at it, but there isn't any genuine emotion here to feel.And yet, 'Ready Player One' isn't low on its marks. Its very much, a watchable & at times, hilarious film, that delivers a bang for your buck. Screenplay by Zak Penn & Ernest Cline is up for the bets, but lack of emotional depth take away some of its glory. Spielberg's Direction, as always, is well-done. I mean, he just gave us the terrific 'The Post' 3 months ago & now a popcorn entertainer with 'Ready Player One'. Now that's range! Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography is top-notch, as ever. 
Michael Kahn & Sarah Broshar's Editing is finely done. Alan Silvestri's Score is lovely. And oh that nostalgia of the 80's music! Art & Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Tye Sheridan shines in the leading-role. The actor brings a certain likability to the part & stays committed throughout. Olivia Cooke is a Stunning leading-lady & a delight to watch. Lena Waithe has her moments. T.J. Miller is very funny. Simon Pegg is decent. But its Mark Rylance as the deceased creator of the OASIS, who steals the show.On the whole, 'Ready Player One' is imperfect, but never not worth watching. Go in and have fun.",6,1,1,2 April 2018

Tarantino nails every bit of 'The Hateful Eight' & celebrates human madness with no filters!I loved 'The Hateful Eight', because it blends violence, sadistic humour & entertainment, perfectly. This is Typical, Vintage Tarantino showing his powers yet again! His Screenplay is fast-paced & brutal. But it never falters. This is among Tarantino's Finest Screenplays to date. As for his Direction, Tarantino creates a world of unruliness, like only he can! Robert Richardson's Excellent Photography & Fred Raskin's Razor-Sharp Editing compliment Tarantino's twisted vision.

"I, Tonya"," Allison Janney Steals The Show In This Wild Biopic!
","Before I give my thoughts on 'I, Tonya', let me just say two words: Allison Janney. The Multiple Time Emmy-Winning Actress delivers one of the STRONGEST Performances of the year, in her portrayal of LaVona Fay Golden, Tonya Harding's Mother from hell. Janney is pure Oscar-GOLD.And now coming to the film...'I, Tonya' like any other sports Biopic, shows us a woman from being a bullied nobody to becoming a somebody in the world of sports. Over-here, we explore Tonya Harding's hardened journey, that is at times powerful & at times exhausting.'I, Tonya' Synopsis: Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie, in great form) rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband (Sebastian Stan, very good) intervenes.'I, Tonya' is about Tonya's violent journey, that started from an impossible, no-holds-barred mother to a violent, brutal husband, who eventually ruined her career. But, Tonya is not a victim of her circumstances. Here is a woman, who despite being thrown into a world of ice-skating & rigorous competition, left a strong mark. She may have not done the right things to get to the position she got, but she was a talented personality who had the power to mesmerize & inspire.Steven Rogers' Screenplay begins superbly & the personal interviews of its characters throughout the film, give it that extra edge. The first-hour is solid & gets into Tonya's world & the people involved with a wicked sense of humor. The second-hour is a little disappointing & overlong, and the sub-plot involving the 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's rival and Olympic teammate, offers less impact. The Writing isn't always compelling & takes away some glory from the film, overall. The Dialogue, however, are crackling & foul to the core.Craig Gillespie's Direction captures all the madness & ambition, with skill. The Director is in good form this time around. Nicolas Karakatsanis's Cinematography & Tatiana S. Riegel's Editing are strongly done. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention.Performance-Wise: Janney is outstanding & is sure to pick up many awards for her portrayal here. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the Oscar home, next year! Margot Robbie, also is in very form, delivering a credible turn as Tonya. Sebastian Stan is entirely convincing as the violent husband. And Paul Walter Hauser is terrific as Shawn, one of Stan's friends, who leads Tonya & Stan, into much trouble.On the whole, 'I, Tonya' is an imperfect biopic about an imperfect woman. Do watch it though, especially for Janney's sterling performance.",6,56,84,11 December 2017
Molly's Game," Jessica Chastain is ACE in Sorkin's Impressive Directorial Debut!
","Oscar-Winning Writer Aaron Sorkin makes his Directorial Debut with 'Molly's Game', a true-story about a Woman who used her mind to bring up the stakes & made it big, despite falling hard eventually. Sorkin keeps the narrative entertaining almost throughout, but its Jessica Chastain who proves to be the real ACE here. Its a superlative performance, that empowers the show!'Molly's Game' Synopsis: The true story of Molly Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game and became an FBI target.Molly Bloom went from being an Olympic-Class Skier to a Poker magnet. Its interesting to see Chastain embody Molly, starting from scratch to end up being an FBI target, after having made a lot of money. Sorkin's Screenplay is well-done, despite flaws. The narrative is thoroughly watchable & the sequences involving Molly & her Lawyer (Idris Elba, in fine form), stand out due to clever dialogue & also due to Chastain & Elba's winning on-screen chemistry. Having said that, Sorkin's Screenplay isn't always on point. The sub-plot of Molly & her strained relationship with her father (Kevin Costner, terrific in a small role) isn't entirely engaging. Its these bits that appear flabby & take away some glory from 'Molly's Game'. So the Writing goes this way: The rise of Molly is engrossing though, her fall also has winning moments, but the sub-plot is weak, despite the commitment of the actors. Sorkin, a master at his craft in Writing, however trumps over the flaws & delivers a nicely done Screenplay, that explores a Woman's journey. Sorkin's Direction is pretty good, leaving his mark in his debut. I would like to see Sorkin calling the shots again. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are superb. Daniel Pemberton's Score is well-done. And now to the ACE - Chastain. In what can be called as her sexiest performance yet, the actress is terrific as Molly Bloom. Portraying a woman who went through emotional turmoil & later hosted the biggest bets in the world of Poker, Chastain is firebrand. She has never looked this gorgeous before & her performance, is all heart & soul. Truly among the strongest performances of the year!On the whole, 'Molly's Game' isn't perfect, but it has enough merits to earn itself a viewing. Recommended!",7,9,18,1 January 2018
Dear John," Average...
","An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's novel of the same name, Lasse Hallström's 'Dear John' is average fare about two lovers. I had zero expectations from the film, and that's the reason I wasn't disheartened.'Dear John' has it's heart at the right, but it's brain is confused, like me. The film beings on a promising note, but loses pace as our hero goes on War. The Richard Jenkins track is a yawn, it looks out of place. Even the culmination leaves a lot to be desired. Nonetheless, 'Dear John' is one-time watch.Hallström's direction is good and so is Terry Stacey's Cinematography. Acting wise, Channing Tatum is excellent. Amanda Seyfried is decent, she excels in the finale. Richard Jenkins does not deliver. His role does not do justice to him! Others are fine.'Dear John' was not a dazzling experience, but a decent effort. Watch it if you must!",5,0,1,17 May 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Awesome!
","Based on The Adventures of Tintin, a series of comic books created by Belgian artist Hergé, 'The Adventures of Tintin', directed by legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg, is an awesome entertainer, that is amongst the better films of 2011. It works from start to end, and does complete justice to the legendary comic hero.'The Adventures of Tintin' Synopsis: Tintin and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship commanded by Haddock's ancestor. But someone else is in search of the ship.'The Adventures of Tintin' is amongst the finest performance capture films to date. I grew up reading Tin Tin comics, and I also loved the television series it had to offer. As a cinematic experience, the film gets it right from start to end, and entertains throughly. The Screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish is fast-paced, humorous & enjoyable. Also, the characters, each of them, leaves it's own mark & remains memorable. Spielberg's Direction, like always, is imaginative & stunning. While the Production Value, is outstanding. The Performance-Capture, is astonishing. Cinematography, Editing & Sound-Mixing, are perfect. Performance-Wise: Jamie Bell is superb as Tin Tin, while Andy Serkis is lovable as Captain Haddock. Daniel Craig scores as the menace. Simon Pegg & Nick Frost as Thomson & Thompson, are cute. Others lend support.On the whole, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a winner all the way. An entertaining & memorable film, that will be loved by one & all. A Blockbuster is on it's way!",10,1,4,12 November 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Masterstroke!
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is a Cinematic Masterstroke, that gets EVERYTHING right. Be it Writing, Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Music, Performances, it hits the right spot in every category. Without a shed of doubt, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is an unbeatable piece in Cinema.'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' Synopsis: Two Western bank/train robbers flee to Bolivia when the law gets too close.'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is gripping & very, very entertaining. The journey of these 2 robbers, unfolds with flourish. William Goldman's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is remarkable & influential. George Roy Hill's Direction is perfect. Cinematography by Conrad L. Hall, which won an Oscar as well, is spectacular. Editing by John C. Howard & Richard C. Meyer is sharp. Music by Burt Bacharach, again Oscar-Winning, is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy & Robert Redford as The Sundance Kid, make impeccable screen heroes & deliver incredibly relaxed performances.

Crash," A Flawed Gem!
","'Crash' is A Flawed Gem! Though Not worthy enough to have Won Best Picture at the Oscars, it still has some strong merits. 'Crash' Synopsis: Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives collide in interweaving stories of race, loss and redemption.'Crash' is partly astonishing, partly bland. Its a strange film in many ways, as some of its episodes leave a remarkable impression, while some appear tasteless. I was particularly impressed by the chapter involving a racist white police officer, (played by an astounding Matt Dillon), who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner. Another chapter which is interesting is the one involving a black detective, (played by Don Cheadle), who's estranged from his mother; his criminal younger brother and gang associate. The rest of the chapters are either passable or under-whelming. Paul Haggis & Robert Moresco's Screenplay has its pluses & minuses. Haggis's Direction, on the other-hand, is decent. Cinematography is classy. Editing is fairly done. Performance-Wise: Of its mammoth cast, its Matt Dillon who steals the show. He enacts the racist cop who later comes in terms with his humanity, with brilliance. He very worthily was Nominated for an Oscar. Another impressive performance comes from Thandie Newton. She's excellent. The rest of the cast, enact their parts with sincerity. On the whole, 'Crash' is not a masterpiece, but an impressive watch nevertheless.",7,0,1,9 June 2014
Snatch," Amazing!!
","'Snatch' is an Amazingly written film, that also offers top-notch direction, prolific cinematography & bravura performances from it's stellar cast. Guy Ritchie deserves all the brownie points possible, for writing & then executing such a twisted, dark & violent subject, in such a humorous and stylish manner.'Snatch' contains two intertwined plots - one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter, who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster.I rank 'Snatch' to be Ritchie's finest work since 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. This flick is one heck of a cinematic experience, that begins with a bang, and continues it's pounding moment all through. Ritchie is at his very best, as a writer & director! Tim Maurice-Jones's Cinematography is prolific.Now to the performances: Jason Statham is excellent. Vinnie Jones & Brad Pitt are absolutely legendary, while Dennis Farina, Stephen Graham & Benicio del Toro are style personified. Robbie Gee is a complete natural. Alan Ford is first-rate. Adam Fogerty, Mike Reid, Sam Douglas, among others, also deliver wonderfully.On the whole, A Must Watch for Every Cinema Fan! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10,0,2,16 February 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Great Film!
","Stanley Kubrick is one of those filmmakers, that can explain versatility in it's true sense. Kubrick has never been a person the Academy-Awards acknowledged, but a person that loved movies way too much.'Dr. Strangelove' is amongst the greatest comic satires I've seen. It's a great film, that is in intact with humor, performances that are done with gusto, A Screenplay that is like Sunrise and direction that is neat in every aspect.'Dr. Strangelove' is about an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and follows the President of the United States, his advisor's, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse.Like it's idea, this 95-minute long feature is a pleasure to watch. Kubrick delivers each and every aspect so neatly, that I was once again in awe of him. Peter Sellers in 3 roles, is very good. George C. Scott is simply Godly as an over-the-top patriotic General. Others also deliver wonderfully.Stanley Kubrick is still alive, so are Peter Sellers & George C. Scott. Their work in here, is enough to make them immortal. I can see myself as a grandfather years n years from now on, and I can see my grandchildren watching this 1964 cult-film. Bravo!",10,1,2,16 January 2011
The Bodyguard," Simply Superb... A Classic!
","Mick Jackson's 'The Bodyguard' is a film that has a routine story about a Secret Service Agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a music icon, from an unknown stalker. Depsite zero novelty, I loved the film. It holds appeal from start to end, it keeps you interested even when the story isn't really moving. In short, a winner all the way! 'The Bodyguard' was also a Box Office Blockbuster Hit during it's release, way back in 1992. It has since gained a fan-following, it's a classic. It's Lawrence Kasdan's water-tight screenplay that keeps you glued, and Jackson's direction keep the proceedings alive.

The Expendables," A Letdown!
","Sylvester Stallone is a legend, no two options on that! He is one of my favorite stars, I was crazy about him in his 'Rambo' days. As a fan, I expected a lot of entertainment from his latest flick 'The Expendables'. The film stars each and every Action Star, apart from Van Damme and Jackie Chan. It's obvious you'd except outstanding entertainment & bad-ass action from this one, right? Sadly, I got not even half of the entertainment I had expected.About a team of mercenaries head to South America on a mission to overthrow a dictator. Sly the writer, brings down Sly the director as well. 'The Expendables' begins with a bang, but loses the grip 30-minutes into the film. In fact, the story just doesn't move. For example, Dolph Lundgren's track, it contributes nothing to film. But yet it is given a start, middle & end. Also, Jason Statham's romantic track is a yawn. It looks out of place! But, the climax is superb. It's explosive Action, and lives up to the genre of the film.One expected much more from Sly. His writing is not sharp. His direction, due to a poor screenplay, is average. Even the scene between Sly-Arnie-Willis fails to make an impact. Jeffrey Kimball's Cinematography is fine. Editing by, Ken Blackwell & Paul Harb lacks fin-ace.In the acting department, Sly, the actor, is surely in form. But the show-stealer, is undoubtedly, Mickey Rourke. The veteran is remarkable in a cameo appearance. The scene where he recalls his past, his expressions, his dialouge delivery, is simply awesome. In fact, it's the most effective scene in the entire film. Jason Statham is just right. Jet Li is fair. Dolph Lundgren doesn't work, mainly due to amateur characterization. Randy Couture is okay. Eric Roberts hams. Steve Austin is able. Charisma Carpenter, looks angelic in a small role.On the whole, A must watch only for Sly's devotees. Otherwise, catch this directly on DVD!",4,52,89,20 August 2010
MASH," Altman Magic!
","The Late/Great Robert Altman was a visionary & his vision is amplified in 'MASH', which is based on Richard Hooker's novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors. This satirical black-comedy war film, has an ingenious plot & the master director nails it to the hilt.'MASH' Synopsis: The staff of a Korean War field hospital use humor and hijinks to keep their sanity in the face of the horror of war.'MASH' is about the human spirit, above everything. Though horrible things happen (well, whats worse than war), the characters find some humour to keep their sanity. 'MASH' raises many intentionally laughs, but this is quite a dramatic subject, which is brave enough to offer some amount of optimism in a bleak situation. The Late/Great Ring Lardner, Jr.'s Oscar-Winning Adapted Screenplay is nearly perfect. 'MASH' is undeniably funny & also daring, as it tackles something that's hard to execute or narrate. Altman's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with precision. He's truly missed! Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. Johnny Mandel's Score is super.Performance-Wise: Donald Sutherland is a scene-stealer. The now Hollywood Legend is a delight here, delivering a funny, eased out performance, that ranks among his best works to date. Elliott Gould is first-rate. Tom Skerritt is perfectly in sync with his character, while Robert Duvall bristles in a cameo. Sally Kellerman, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is absolutely fantastic. Others lend very good support.On the whole, 'MASH' is A Must See. Let The Altman Magic Continue!",9,2,3,27 July 2016

And it mixes both the sides wonderfully. I was engrossed & thrilled by the film, I loved how it progressed & I even loved how it culminated.The only minus point in my opinion, was the excessive violence. The violence is just too graphic & disturbing. And I personally believe, that, if there was less bloodshed, its impact as a whole of a story would've been even more.Guillermo del Toro's Screenplay is Magical. Its engrossing & thrilling. But, of course, the violence could've been toned down. His Direction, on the other-hand, is Fabulous. Cinematography by Guillermo Navarro, Which Won An Oscar, is stunning. Art Direction & Make-Up, which also Won Oscars, are pitch-perfect. Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: Ivana Baquero delivers a haunting performance. She plays her part so well, that her performance comes across as unsettling & haunting. Sergi López is deliciously despicable as sadistic army officer. His performance too, is unforgettable. Doug Jones is extra-ordinary, as always. Maribel Verdú is a revelation. Ariadna Gil is effective.On the whole, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is An Unmissable Gem!",9,2,6,9 May 2012

The Way Back," Peter Weir can do better...
","Peter Weir is one of my all-time favorite storytellers. 'The Truman Show' was a wonderful film. 'Witness' & 'Dead Poets Society' also were memorable fares. 'Fearless' offered some strong performances. 'Master And Commander' also had it's share of pluses.However, Weir latest flick, 'The Way Back', which is a war drama, about a group of prisoners who escape from a Siberian Gulag camp during World War II, doesn't rank amongst his finest works.'The Way Back' begins with a bang, and has a rock-solid first hour. The problem, I thought, began in the latter hour. The writing gets weak, and the pace dips for quite sometime. The writing needed to be sharper, especially in the latter hour.Weir's direction, as always, is note-worthy. Cinematography is striking. Editng could've been sharper. Performance-Wise: Jim Sturgess rules the show, with a fantastic performance. Sturgess is an actor to watch out for! Ed Harris is good, as ever. Colin Farrell is superb, and gets his Russian accent correct. Saoirse Ronan is fair. Mark Strong, Gustaf Skarsgård & Dragoş Bucur are passable.On the whole, A Good film, that had the potential to be a GREAT film, but due to it's loose-ends, it's expected impact seems to be missing.",6,1,4,8 April 2011

Ruffalo is natural to the core, displaying love, frustration & ambition with effortless ease, while Knightley is a delight. She expresses each & every emotion, so beautifully. Also, the on-screen chemistry between the two, is exciting. Catherine Keener is fantastic. Has Keener ever delivered a bad performance? Hailee Steinfeld is nicely restrained.

As Jim Morrison, Kilmer delivers a knockout performance, that deserved an Oscar Nod, if not a Win.'The Doors' Synopsis: The story of the famous and influential 1960's rock band and its lead singer and composer, Jim Morrison.'The Doors' celebrates music & Morrison's journey, which unfortunately is just a memory. Morrison was talented & handsome, but he gave inn to drugs & all the wrong stuff, only to end his life. However, 'The Doors' is infectiously entertaining & addictive. Master Filmmaker Oliver Stone Directs 'The Doors' with visible energy & enthusiasm. The Screenplay is worthy & depicts Morrison's journey with no diplomacy. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: Val Kilmer is At His Finest. He plays the legendary musician with mesmeric ease. Undoubtedly, its among the finest performances from the early 1990's. Among other performers, Meg Ryan is first-rate as Pamela Courson.On the whole, 'The Doors' is rich in music with a heroic leading performance. Strongly Recommended!",10,1,1,23 October 2013
Malcolm X," Denzel Washington is Fantastic as Malcom X!
","Denzel Washington is Fantastic as the African-American figure Malcom X! Denzel, A Miracle of an Actor, delivers a knockout performance, that's truly meant to be treasured & deeply respected. Amongst The Greatest Embodiments I've Seen! 'Malcom X' is a masterful film, a biopic that's vastly executed by Ace Filmmaker Spike Lee. The Legend of Malcom X unfolds on Screen in a running time over 201-minutes, but every minute, is arresting. Washington anchors the film with his Oscar-Nominated Performance as the legendary figure. Among the supporting cast, Christopher Plummer is very effective & so is Angela Bassett. 'Malcom X' is a must watch. A High-Voltage, Power-Packed Biopic!",10,4,11,26 October 2012

Nacho Libre," Jack Black At His Best!
","Jack Black is widely known for his impeccable comic timing. The actor has delivered several hilarious performances all through his impressive career, but his work in 'Nacho Libre' ranks as his finest. And even as a film, its an enjoyable comedy!'Nacho Libre' Synopsis: Berated all his life by those around him, a monk follows his dream and dons a mask to moonlight as a Luchador (Mexican wrestler).Loosely based on the real life of Fray Tormenta, a catholic priest, who, had a 23 year long career as a masked Luchador. 'Nacho Libre' is funny from start to finish, what if some of the jokes are offensive. There is no major flaw in the narrative, because the protagonist's journey amuses & entertains. The Screenplay Written by Jared Hess, Jerusha Hess & Mike White progresses wonderfully & is filled with comic moments. Jared Hess has Directed the film well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent.Jack Black's performance is truly worth applauding. He's flawless as Nacho.

The Town," Damn Good...
","Ben Affleck's 'The Town' is indeed a Damn Good Film. It's gripping, superbly directed, greatly acted & wonderfully photographed. Ben Affleck indeed has come out with a winner! 'The Town' is more of a complicated love-story. It's really not a story of a few robbers, nor about a man trying to clean up his deeds. It's a complicated love-story, where there so many obstacles around it. Ben Affleck goes into the zone of 'The Town' and makes sure he makes a memorable fare.About a 124 minutes, the film never really loses you. The only moment when the screenplay gets a bit boring is in the middle, but makes up for it with a dramatic and captivating climax. Affleck rocks as a Storyteller, no doubts! He's made a fine film... and in each frame there is a visible stamp of the filmmaker. Bravo! A Special Mention to Robert Elswit, who has photographed the film with flourish.In the acting department, Affleck, as an actor, also is in top form. One can easily state this performance amongst his best efforts. Jon Hamm is so natural in his part. Rebecca Hall is excellent. Blake Lively leaves a mark. Ditto for Chris Cooper. But the show truly belongs to Pete Postlethwaite & Jeremy Renner, who play their parts with unmatchable ease.On the whole, visit this 'Town'... despite the violence around it. Recommended!",7,0,1,15 December 2010
Closer," Close to perfection!
","Mike Nichols's Closer is an excellent film in each and every aspect. A remarkable film. The film keeps you gripped from start to end. I feel the film didn't show sex even a bit, which left me disappointed. Otherwise, it is an awesome film from 2004.Performances: Clive Oven steals the show with a stylish performance. Julia Roberts is excellent. Jude Law is superb. Natlie Portman is amazing. She delivers her careers best performance.Closer is a honest film which deserves a watch. A must watch for each and every cinema lover!Two Thumbs Up!",9,3,5,19 February 2009
Suicide Squad," A Disappointment!
","Based on the DC Comics antihero team of the same name, 'Suicide Squad' comes with BIG hype & expectations, but sadly, this superhero flick lacks the bite. No, its not as lifeless as Batman v Superman, its much better than that, but overall, the zing & the madness are missing here. It has merit, but not enough to camouflage its flaws.'Suicide Squad' Synopsis: A secret government agency recruits a group of imprisoned super-villains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency, which inevitably leads to chaos.'Suicide Squad' begins awesomely & the antiheroes are introduced with style & flair. But as soon as antiheroes step out into the city to stop havoc, the film just falls flat. Thats mainly because the film doesn't do much with its characters. The supposed 'Worst Heroes EVER' (as promoted in its posters), are reduced into normal heroic tools, who indulge in ultraviolet confrontations with the opposing rival. Oh and coming to their rivals, The Enchantress, is a weak antagonist, who doesn't emerge powerful or intimidating enough. Also, why is the Legendary Joker reduced into a cameo? The Joker isn't a part of the 'Suicide Squad', in fact, he appears as a minor sub-plot for Harley Quinn, whom he's out to save amongst the violent state.David Ayer's Writing & Direction weaken 'Suicide Squad'. Though Ayer succeeds in making the film look comic-bookish & begins the film with on a really strong note, his Writing stagnates after a point. As mentioned before, the characters remain underused & there is a sense of potential being shun away. Ayer's Writing needed to be far stronger. His Direction, on the other-hand, is fine at places, but isn't consistent, as the pacing shifts as does the narrative. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is decent. John Gilroy's Editing is alright. Graphics are fantastic & so are the Action-Sequences. Steven Price's Score is excellent. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. Make-Up deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: 'Suicide Squad' has a huge ensemble cast, but its Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, who steals the show completely. Robbie is absolutely sensational as the whacked-out yet sexy & unpredictable Harley Quinn, who's romance for The Joker appears real. The terrific actress owns the screen, each time she appears on. Following her up in a surprisingly short & under-written role, Jared Leto puts up an impressive portrayal of The Joker. Comparing him to the Mighty Jack Nicholson or the Late/Great Heath Ledger, wouldn't be fair, as he's barely given much time here & he's not giving the same personality, this is a very gangster version of The Joker. But, overall, he can surely be looked forward too in another, bigger role of the legendary villain. Will Smith as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, plays it right, & its good to see him loosen up a little. Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang, gets limited scope, but he does well. Jay Hernandez as Chato Santana / El Diablo is barely there, while Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Waylon Jones / Killer Croc, who's completely under make-up and graphics, is wasted. Cara Delevingne as Dr. June Moone / Enchantress, doesn't work. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, is alright. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, is authoritative, as always. Ben Affleck returns as Batman for a cameo & he looks the part even more now. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Suicide Squad' disappoints, despite a few pluses.",5,2,5,7 August 2016
Taxi Driver," A Legend of it's own!!
","Martin Scorsese's cult favorite 'Taxi Driver' has it's own class, it has it's own aura, it has it's place. Like mentioned from this writer's headline, a motion picture which is a Legend of it's own! Suprsingly, Scorsese won the Academy Award for Best Director 30 years after 'Taxi Driver' released. Now, that's injustice! De Niro didn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in here either? 'Taxi Driver' is a milestone, no praise can justify it's talent & respect.This is a story of lonely man, 'be aware', it doesn't cater to any age group, it's for them who understand Cinema & understand the depth of 'Taxi Driver', this is not an entertainer, it's like a haunting tune.Scorsese's direction 'O My God', so so amazing. Paul Schrader's writing, flawless. Performances, De Niro is a legend, an astounding performance. Foster has been pretty since then, her performance, simply superb. Harvey Keitel, another fine performance. Others are apt.'Taxi Driver' is a film that belongs to people like me, who understand talent & repay them respect for their body of work, which is 'legendary' is every department.",8,1,1,25 January 2010
Shutter Island," Excellent...
","Scorsese's Body Of Work is inspiring... it boasts talent, delivers entertainment and most of all - Films that haunt you! Scorsese with his latest venture 'Shutter Island' touches new highs, he experiments something that comes out with flying colors! Based on the novel by the same name by Dennis Lehane, 'Shutter Island' is a haunted film. It's a psychological thriller, it's scary, it's moving. Scorsese's direction is so twisted, daring and bravura that you become Leonardo DiCaprio, you become the U.S. Marshal. What works the most for Scorsese's finest film is it's direction, that is truly Oscar Worthy. It's f''''ng amazing! 'Shutter Island' proves two facts: 1. Scorsese is unbeatable in what he does. 2. Leo is Hollywood's Finest Actor today. He reaches the caliber of De Niro, Bridges and Pacino in my eye. The Icon is astounding, I was in awe of him... he's so so natural. Leo will take away the Best Actor Award, Oscar next year! Unless, there is manipulation! My Salute to these 2 Cinema Icons!'Shutter Island' is a Masterstroke! A Winner All The Way!

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Its Good, Till It Lasts!
","The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger, 'Captain America: The Winter Solider' is good fun, but only till it lasts. If you are willing to let go off clichés & a sluggish pace, then the Captain is all you want this weekend! 'Captain America: The Winter Solider' Synopsis: Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is been-there-seen-that, as far as the Script is concerned. What I was particularly disappointed by, was its sluggish pacing. The pace is still considerably tight in the first-hour, but is loose & dreary in the latter-hour. Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely's Screenplay hardly offers anything new, but to what it sticks too, which is quintessential super-hero mode, it does justice to it. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is epically mounted. Cinematography is top-class. Editing is dull. Special Effects are awesome. The Action Set-Pieces are expertly executed. Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Captain America, is pimping hot. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, does fairly well. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon, is alright. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, enacts the bad-guy, effortlessly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, looks least interested. Sebastian Stan as James 'Bucky' Barnes / Winter Soldier, leaves a strong impact.On the whole, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is passable, good-looking entertainment.",6,4,8,4 April 2014

Lost in Translation," Lost In Awe...
","Sofia Coppola's 'Lost In Translation' is one of those films that I was in awe of. I remember watching this gem years back... I loved it then, but after watching it after 5 years later, today, I was indeed awe-struck. It's an extra-ordinary story, with the most ordinary, or rather depressed characters.'Lost In Translation' which was awarded the Academy-Award for Original Screenplay to Sofia, was an unbeatable winner! This isn't a love-story, this isn't about 2 people who are lost and wandering in a city that seems alien to them. In a running time of a 100 minutes, it's a wonderful experience for the viewer. What is the biggest plus point of this cult-hit, is that, you enjoy and look forward to know what will happen next in the lives of these 2 bored people. Sofia Coppola proves she's a talent, that is boon to cinema. Her Screenplay and Direction are simply flawless. The soundtrack also is amazing. Just Like Honey is one of my all-time favorite songs...Bill Murray is outstanding in here. The Veteran Actor steals the show with a subdued, witty and charming performance. Scarlett Johansson is also at her fiery best. Plus, she looks angelic. Giovanni Ribisi is perfect in a brief role. Anna Faris is excellent in a 5-minute long role. I am still Lost In Awe of 'Lost In Translation'. It's a must watch film for each and everyone, Two Big Thumbs Up!",10,0,3,11 June 2010
Tangled," A Must Watch for Kids!
","'Tangled' is A Must Watch for Kids. The fairytale, the astounding animation, the wonderful 3D effects... it's an ideal baby film. As an adult, I too enjoyed the film, though, not totally.After watching masterstrokes like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' recently, I've raised my expectations way too much from an animation flick. As I had heard the legend of Rapunzel as a kid, 'Tangled' didn't offer much novelty to me. But despite the popular story it adapts, the film holds you, especially in the first hour, which is superb. The only shortcoming in this love-story, is the overdose of Songs. They keep popping up, and one truly wishes if they weren't hammered so many times.Looking from the point of view kids mainly, I suggest you do make your kids watch 'Tangled', as it will be a dazzling & memorable experience for them. And I'd say for those, who still are a kid at heart, do watch it... the spell-binding animation & 3D effects are sure to keep you energized.",6,9,14,21 January 2011
Doctor Strange," Not Magical Enough!
","'Doctor Strange' comes up short compared to its gargantuan expectations. Despite staggering visuals, a strong leading-man & some fun jokes, this superhero spectacle is eventually a disappointment. Reason? Lazy Writing & Uneven Pacing.'Doctor Strange' Synopsis: A former neurosurgeon embarks on a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world of the mystic arts.'Doctor Strange' begins dull, but gathers some momentum once Strange embarks on his journey. But, the pace drops again once Strange learns the magical force & a not-so-strong villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen, not in form this time), add to its disadvantages. The action is spectacular, though. Once Strange begins to kickass, there's not stopping him & its a lot of fun watching him do that. Even the jokes here evoke laughter, even though they come in limited doses. The visuals are mind-blowing, the action works, but Writing wise, its loopholes all over.Scott Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill's Screenplay works, only in parts. The pace, also, is uneven. The film jumps from being fun to plain dull. And no film, despite its technical achievements, can rise above a rather weak Screenplay. Derrickson's Direction, on the other-hand, relies on visuals to deliver. Cinematography is excellent, while the Editing needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Make-Up is finely done, as well. Michael Giacchino's Score is tops.Performance-Wise: Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange, is superlative all through. He rises above the narrative's underwhelming edges & delivers a rock-solid portrayal of the superhero. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, is first-rate. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, is underused. Ditto for Rachel McAdams & Michael Stuhlbarg.On the whole, 'Doctor Strange' is Not Magical Enough.",5,14,30,4 November 2016
Interstellar," Stellar, Indeed!
","Christopher Nolan's much awaited 'Interstellar' is Stellar, Indeed! Nolan takes us to space & beyond, delivering a film that's both, astounding & futuristic. Made unfathomable ambition & force, this Sci-Fi/Family-Drama, deserves a watch for the experience it gives you as a viewer & also a human being.'Interstellar' Synopsis: A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.'Interstellar' raises questions on the future & on what maybe the fate of mankind after all. Jonathan & Chris Nolan's Screenplay fills in all the scientific punches to lead it in, that eventually, is more a tale of a father & his daughter. 'Interstellar' proudly captures the strong bond of family-bond, that we all experience & relate too in our lives. The portions back home on earth are wonderfully executed. The Sci-Fit bit, however, is stunning & equally captivating. The twist & turns in the narrative, featuring a surprise cameo Matt Damon, only keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next. Its purely edge-of-the-seat rush.Chris Nolan's Direction is gargantuan, just like the film's scale. Nolan handles this important story with care & style. Each & Every Visual has been filmed amazingly by Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. You can't look away from the Screen for a single moment! Lee Smith's Editing is pretty crisp, despite the film's mammoth length, which goes on for more than 168-minutes. Hans Zimmer's Score is exhilarating. Visual Effects are Oscar-Worthy. Performance-Wise: Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, delivers a heartfelt performance. The Oscar-Winning Actor is the soul of this epically structured film. Anne Hathaway as Amelia, is perfect in her portrayal. Jessica Chastain as Murphy, Cooper's long suffering daughter, is splendid. Her emotional breakdowns tear you apart. Wes Bentley as Doyle, is effective. Casey Affleck as Tom, is nicely restrained. John Lithgow as Donald, is subtly funny. Michael Caine as Professor Brand, is dignified, as ever. On the whole, 'Interstellar' is not merely a film, its an Experience. Heavily Recommended!",9,3,10,8 November 2014

Stanley Kubrick takes us back to a squad of U.S. Marines through their United States Marine Corps Recruit Training and depicts some of the experiences of two of them in the Tet Offensive (1968) during the Vietnam War. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a so-so-so good, that I was left awe-struck. The first 40-minutes shows as how 'Maggots' turn into 'Heroes'. The rest of the 80-minutes is on the war-back-drop. The climax is epic, beautifully thought & executed.If given a chance My Review for 'Full Metal Jacket' would never end.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Knockout!
","Written, Produced & Directed by Martin McDonagh, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', is a film so dark & timely, that it makes you laugh till it hurts. This riveting tale on anger & grief, is told with command & power. And the Performances are Incredible!'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' Synopsis: A mother (A Firebrand Frances McDormand) personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder when they fail to catch the culprit.'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the kind of film, that uses anger as its energy & rage as its heart. Watching McDormand, the grieving & raging protagonist, challenge the local authorities & await the culprit behind her daughter's brutal death, is a mix of delicious dark humor & racial violence. So while you have McDormand as the bad-ass, there is also a strong supporting role, played by a wild Sam Rockwell. As the hillbilly cop, Rockwell is tempered, foul-mouthed, violent & unforgiving. He's the cop you wouldn't want to come across if you ever happen to be in Missouri. And that's exactly what makes 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' such a delightful mix of contrasting rage. Its the same emotion that the characters go through here, with the only difference being how they go about it. While the cop uses his hands and legs to break bones, the protagonist adds toughness to herself by putting up Billboards. As I mentioned earlier before, here's a film that uses anger as its energy & rage as its beating heart!McDonagh's Screenplay is top-notch. Its no-holds-barred & a depiction of an America, we don't usually explore in movies. Its power-packed stuff, with some delicious, unexpected twists & turns. McDonagh's Direction is brilliant, too. McDonagh has handled this dark-comedy/crime-drama with precision. Oscar Glory, seems possible! Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, merit a special mention. Carter Burwell's Score is soothing, as always. Costume Design & Make-Up are well-done, as well.And now to the performances! Frances McDormand is simply superb! As the grieving & raging protagonist, McDormand expresses rage, helplessness & courage, with magnificence. Its a sheer pleasure to watch McDormand take on the local tough boys & scream her rage with the Billboards. This is her finest performance in years. Also in terrific form is Woody Harrelson, as the cop who McDormand throws her righteous rage at. Harrelson's sheriff is a soft man, who understands the wrath of a grieving mother as well as accept his inability to catch the culprit. He also has a nice sub-plot with his family, with whom he shares his emotional connect. Harrelson delivers a restrained, controlled performance, proving us once again that he's versatile performer.Sam Rockwell plays it crazy & has a blast! His turn as the racially aggressive cop is hard to beat. Rockwell attacks the role full throttle. As Rockwell's outrageous mother, Sandy Martin is a hoot. Her performance comes close to stealing the entire film. Please give her some attention this awards season! Of the rest of the cast, Caleb Landry Jones, John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage & Lucas Hedges stand out with impressive supporting turns. On the whole, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a knockout! This is one of the best American films of the year! Don't Miss It.",9,4,12,8 December 2017

In terms of presentation, 'Pacific Rim' heartens, but when it comes to solid storytelling, 'Pacific Rim' disheartens. Travis Beacham & del Toro's Screenplay works in parts. The first-hour is slow-paced, while the second-hour delivers action-sequences in abundance. The Screenplay needed to be stronger! del Toro's Direction is imaginative. Visual Effects are Top-Class, while the Action-Sequences are stunning. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, deserve a mention.Performance-Wise: Idris Elba is perfect. Charlie Hunnam is very sincere, he enacts his part with gusto. Rinko Kikuchi is credible. Charlie Day is excellent. Ron Perlman is okay. Ellen McLain & Burn Gorman are fair.

Empire of the Sun," A Letdown!
","Steven Spielberg is GREAT, his knowledge of adapting stuff leaves me profound. Now, 'Empire Of The Sun' is no-way a bad film from this legendary storyteller, but surely is way below his margin. Here's why: A film like this which is about Hope, Courage, Battle and Blood needs to keep you at the hook, but sadly, one can't connect with the film.'Empire Of The Sun' has some aces, The Performances, The Cinematography. Spielberg's direction is fascinating, like always. But this semi-autobiographical flick, lacks a water-tight screenplay, which spoils the fun. Also, the film is very lengthy, which also effects it's impact.Coming on the bright side, the performances: Christian Bale is remarkable. The then 13-year old plays his part with great understanding. A Supermely Talented Actor, who saves this otherwise soul-less film. John Malkovich is absolutely amazing in a strong supporting role. Miranda Richardson is also very good.On the whole, A Letdown.

And Bradley Cooper shines as Kyle, giving an excellent performance overall.'American Sniper' Synopsis: Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.'American Sniper' is bold & disturbing, the horrific violence which happened in real life, is equally off-putting on screen. The excessive bloodshed/gore makes you feel repulsed. But, that's the reality it depicts, and hence this biopic works. Even the sequences involving with Kyle & family back home, offer moments of genuine warmth & subtle sadness. Kyle was a man of pure charisma & bravery, A true patriot, who fought & served for his country. And his sudden untimely death, by a veteran he was trying to help, is nothing but a massive shame. But as they say, the mighty shall fall & that's exactly what happened with the late/great Kyle.Jason Hall's Adapted Screenplay is honest & affecting. Eastwood's Direction is good. He has captured the intense war sequences, as well as the sequences back home, with conviction. Cinematography by Tom Stern & Editing by Joel Cox & Gary D. Roach, are passable. War Sequences are impressively executed. Performance-Wise: Cooper has emerged into a versatile actor & 'American Sniper' proves it. As Kyle, Cooper sinks his teeth into the part & delivers a measured performance. Sienna Miller as Taya Renae Kyle, his wife, is wonderful. Her emotional breakdowns appear real. On the whole, 'American Sniper' isn't for the faint-hearted, but this is a tale worth watching, for those who can absorb violence. And for Kyle, Rest In Peace.",7,37,77,12 January 2015
Glory," Strictly Okay!
","Based on the novel One Gallant Rush by Peter Burchard, 'Glory' is high on ambition, but low on execution. Despite a stellar Denzel Washington & Mesmerising Cinematography, this war epic falls on short on its scripting level & lethargic pacing.'Glory' Synopsis: Robert Gould Shaw leads the US Civil War's first all-black volunteer company, fighting prejudices of both his own Union army and the Confederates.Edward Zwick is a terrific storyteller, but honestly, 'Glory' isn't among his better works. I wasn't engaged in the narrative & the lethargic pacing got to me after a point. Kevin Jarre's Adapted Screenplay isn't powerful enough. I loved some scenes in its second-hour, but overall, I found the goings-on to be mostly dull. Better Writing was most definitely needed! Zwick's Direction is satisfactory.The Late/Great Freddie Francis's Cinematography is mesmerizing. 'Glory' is a visual delight, no two options on that! Another ace is Denzel Washington's Oscar-Winning sterling performance. As Private Silas Trip, Washington enacts the tormented soul with unmatchable ease. He owns the show.On the whole, 'Glory' is not magnificent, but it has some plus points. Watch it, but only if you must!",5,1,4,30 July 2015

Lion," Remarkable Performances Lead A Decent Film!
","Based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley with Larry Buttrose, 'Lion' tells a true-story so heartbreaking (though beautiful eventually), you'd be heartless not to be moved by it. And despite that fact, cinematically, 'Lion' is a decent film, that never becomes a triumph due to its uneven Writing. But, the Remarkable Performances lead the show!'Lion' Synopsis: A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.'Lion' has a heartbreaking first-hour, that arrests you & emotionally drains you. Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, the protagonist, delivers such a realistic performance, you actually believe the kid is lost in the big bad world. Pawar adds such depth to 'Lion', its hard to keep your eyes off him, as he struggles with being lost, homeless or later smartly dodging a pimp who sells children. The first-hour works without any stops! Its the second-hour, however, when 'Lion' results into monotony. Dev Patel is remarkably complex in his role of the older Saroo, but his journey to get back home after living 25 years with his adoptive parents in Australia, is repetitive. And by the time Saroo actually gets home, the emotions are done by. The first-hour has a addictive feel to it, but the second-hour is monotonous & drags itself for a bit too long!Luke Davies's Adapted Screenplay is excellent in the first-hour, but slows down right after. One truly wishes if the Writing remained superior, as this is a true-story that's nothing less than a triumph. Garth Davis's Direction is well-done. Cinematography is sharp. Editing is fair. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Performance-Wise: Sunny & Dev are obviously the winners here, but that doesn't mean the supporting players don't leave a mark. Nicole Kidman, to begin with, is masterclass as the Saroo's adoptive mother, who portrays true feeling without every over-doing it. David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive dad & Kidman's husband, is another topper. He's first-rate! Rooney Mara as Saroo's girlfriend, is precisely natural & owns the part with dignity & restraint. Priyanka Bose as Saroo's biological mother, also, is quite good. Deepti Naval is in top-form! Tannishtha Chatterjee is remarkable. And Nawazuddin Siddiqui is terrific in that one scene he appears in. On the whole, 'Lion' is an uneven film, about a triumphant true-story.",6,6,14,31 January 2017
Forrest Gump," A Film Above Words!
","Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain't worthy enough for what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis's, Watch 'Forrest Gump', and you would yourself become a fan of this man and take your words back.IMDb writes: 'Forrest Gump', while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above words, my summary correctly copies that. It's a journey of a man left alone, it's his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud citizen.About 140 Minutes long, 'Forrest Gump' unfolds fearlessly. This is Robert Zemeckis's finest work to date. His cinema has never been so engaging before. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay provides liberties to it's historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump & Gary Sinise, as one of Forrest's important people in his journey, pack in performances, that can surely be described as, 'Tour De Force'. Robin Wright as Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her character.On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo, that sentence in Caps, is an understatement.",10,4,7,20 September 2010
Southpaw," What. A. Punch.
","Antoine Fuqua's 'Southpaw' is electrifying stuff! It rides very high on emotions & pure drama.

Its a tale with a soul. It isn't pointlessly mellow or overtly sensitive. This isn't just a story about a man, its about a husband, a father, a friend & a boxer. It captures the struggle & dedication of its protagonist & how he bounces back when life knocks him out. Its Modern-Day Rocky, with a more violent touch.Kurt Sutter's Screenplay is inspiring & thoroughly engaging. I never disconnected with the story, I was involved & moved by it. Fuqua's Direction is razor-sharp. 'Southpaw' is among his best works to date. Cinematography is well-done. Editing is finely done. The Choerography of the Boxing-Fights is very good. The Late/Great James Horner's Score is perfect. Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal is the heart & soul of 'Southpaw'. The immensely talented & fearless actor transforms himself (his physique is wow) & emotes remarkably. After sterling performances in Nightcrawler & Enemy recently, Gyllenhaal triumphs yet again! He reminded me of a younger Stallone & that's saying a lot. Forest Whitaker is another topper. Though he enters the scene pretty late, the acting giant dominates the screen, while complementing Gyllenhaal at every step. Rachel McAdams is affecting & beautiful in a brief role. Oona Laurence is outstanding; Its a powerhouse performance. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson & Naomie Harris are decent. On the whole, 'Southpaw' will leave you pumped, by its sheer energy & power.

American Hustle," Great Performances, but Ordinary Film!
","David O. Russell, the supremely talented filmmaker of films such as 'The Fighter' & the instant classic 'Silver Linings Playbook', brings us the much awaited crime-comedy 'American Hustle'. Now, does it work?The Answer is neither a yes or a no. To begin with, the film is blessed with Great Performances by its amazing cast. Its also blessed with O.Russell's Stylish Direction. But what it lacks, most importantly, is a Solid Script. The Writing Material is clichéd, though often funny, its never out-of-the-box or awe-inspiring. Though the film begins brilliantly, the momentum keeps going down, especially, in the last hour. One Expected Much More! 'American Hustle' Synopsis: A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power-brokers and mafia.'American Hustle' begins so well, that I thought I was in for a joyride! Unfortunately, the Writing surrenders to clichés & the pace drops. Though the characters & their darker-side kept me engrossed at parts, the story as a whole, isn't captivating enough. Eric Warren Singer & O. Russell's Screenplay underwhelms, though there is some genuine merit in it. O.Russell's Direction is Stylish. He handles this crazy-con affair with much style. Cinematography is fine. Editing isn't sharp. Art & Costume Design are excellent.Now Coming To The Performances! 'American Hustle' works primarily due to its cast, who deliver so wonderfully. Jennifer Lawrence is astonishing as the nagging wife. She delivers a performance that deserves her an Oscar Nomination for supporting actress. Despite limited screen-time, The Academy-Award-Winner is the show-stopper here! Bradley Cooper enacts the overenthusiastic FBI agent, superbly. Christian Bale as a con-man with a bad hairdo, is simply terrific. Amy Adams as Bale's seductive British partner, bares it all, quite literally! She's first-rate, yet again! Among other performances, Jeremy Renner is not in form this time around, while Robert De Niro is spellbinding in a surprise cameo.On the whole, 'American Hustle' works in parts, but Fine Acting is undoubtedly its biggest attraction!",6,3,9,30 December 2013
Top Secret!," Only If You Can Stomach This One!
","When one gets ready to watch a film made by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker....the viewer should take a look at their work. Their work is Baffonery, Crazy, Nutty & Horrifyingly Stupid. Not everyone can like their work. I do, I loved 'Airplane' and I continue to hail it as the finest slap-stick comedy ever.Coming to, 'Top Secret!', This flick is amongst the stupidest films of its time, that manages a set of good laughs in the meantime. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker eat Humor and digest slap-stick comedy. They can do anything! They are perhaps, the least bothered writer-directors of all-time.'Top Secret!' tells the story of an American pop singer, played awesomely by Val Kilmer, who goes to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival. While there, he becomes involved in a resistance movement and helps his lady-love, rescue her father, who is being held by the Germans and forced to build the deadly Polaris naval mine.Val Kilmer is awesome, as told before. Also, he dances with great energy and the songs he sings, have the funniest of lyrics. The Late Michael Gough is exceptional, as always. Others perform their 'Crazy' roles, efficiently.On the whole, In comparison to 'Airplane', this flick offers lesser laughs and thus, I rate it a 6 on 10.",6,3,5,17 March 2011

Fargo," Bravo!!!
","'Fargo' is an amazing film. The Coen Brothers once again prove, that they are indeed Boon to Cinema! How lovely to think of, the film begins claiming that it's a true story. But once you begin to read about this super-hit, you come to know that it's fictitious. The Coens give a wonderful answer to their lie, that you itself believe, yep this is my next-door story, of at least that they think about such stuff. 'Fargo' is marvelous dark-comedy crime film, that leaves you awe-struck with it's charm.McDormand plays a pregnant police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals. A grim, violent and rather disturbing subject comes up more as a Revelation, rather than being a depression watch.The Coens at their fiery best. Their Screenplay was complimented with an Academy-Award. Their direction, yes, this was a collaborate effort, comes flawless. Roger Deakins's Cinematography is superb.In the acting department, McDormand is mind-blowing in a role that won her numerous award. She lives her character from start to end. William H. Macy is like never before. The actor is terrific, and nearly steals the show. Peter Stormare is fantastic. Steve Buscemi goes completely over-the-top, he doesn't impress in here. John Carroll Lynch is perfect.On the whole, 'Fargo' is one of those films, where you feel proud to be a Cinema-Fan. It's one of the greatest films of it's time, or maybe, of all-times.

It narrates James Hunt and Niki Lauda's famous rivalry with much style. Peter Morgan's Screenplay is always on the move, although the film tends to get a bit too lengthy in the second-hour. It needed to be trimmed by at least 15-minutes. Ron Howard is a master at his craft & 'Rush' is another glowing example to the fact. Cinematography is rich. Editing needed more sharpness. Art & Costume Design are okay. Make-Up is flawlessly done.Performance-Wise: Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, delivers competently, while Daniel Brühl as Niki Lauda, is efficient.

Aiding him in his effort is Nina, a TV-news veteran.'Nightcrawler' follows a man's desperate journey to prove himself. He goes to extreme measures, to get out there. The protagonist, Lou Bloom, played by Gyllenhaal, first comes across as a sympathetic junkie who's a victim of a bleak America, but later comes across, as a manipulative & power-hunger animal. Its a sharp, but risky character, who grows on you & later haunts you.Dan Gilroy's Screenplay is dark, but exciting, as well. It also delivers some humor, which comes as a much-needed relief in the intense proceedings. Gilroy's Direction is pitch-black, complementing the film's mood, most accurately. Cinematography is grim. Editing is pretty crisp. And now of course, let's move on to Gyllenhaal. His embodiment here deserves some serious awards consideration. He's every bit of the freak he portrays, and for sure, he's the best choice for this part. A Special Mention for Rene Russo. Its so nice to her in a substantial role after long time. She's fabulous & shares an awkwardly interesting on-screen chemistry with Gyllenhaal.On the whole, 'Nightcrawler' packs a solid punch! Very Strongly Recommended!",9,2,3,5 December 2014

The Italian Job," Killer Time-Pass...
","A remake of the 1969 British film of the same name, 'The Italian Job' comes up a winner. The 1969 cult-hit, in 2003 was revised with it's technology and style. I haven't had the pleasure of watching the original which personified the 'heist' theme, but I surely can say, I know what 'The Italian Job' is all about.The film is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold bullion from a former associate who double crossed them. The film scores big time, mainly because it entertains you from start to end. Stylish and Accomplished, filmmaker F.Gary Gray pays homage to his favorite film and has done his job exceedingly well. He's a fan of the film he's making, and that's quite visible throughout. The action sequences are amazing. The climax, is spell-binding.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is fantastic. The actor lives his character from start to end. Charlize Theron looks a billion bucks, and delivers a truly fine performance. Seth Green is terrific and provides comic moments. Jason Statham is perfect. Mos Def is good. Edward Norton is a bore this time. Donald Sutherland is okay in a cameo.Watch this heist remake... it entertains and has it's moments to leave you talking and thinking about it. Thumbs Up!",8,8,15,11 July 2010
Justice League," Injustice.
","'Justice League' is the kind of a disappointment that hurts your gut. No jokes here, but this much-hyped Superhero Spectale lacks fizz. What's surprising is that this is an even weaker film to DC's very own & forgettable Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice. 'Justice League' Synopsis: Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater threat. The fundamental problem with 'Justice League' is it's poorly written Screenplay. While the first-hour is all about forming the league, with their back stories, the second-hour is an action mayhem. And very sadly enough, none of it really works. Barring a few funny one-liners & a set of spirited actors, there is nothing that stands out here. And Steppenwolf has to be THE weakest DC villain in a long time! So it's the Writing, that's clearly the culprit here! Zack Synder's Direction underwhelms. Cinematography is of standard quality. Editing lacks sharpness. Art & Costime Design are brilliantly done. Action-Sequences are decent. Graphics are surprisingly tacky. The Score is alright. Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck continues to be a tough Batman & impresses, but it's sad that his version of Batman is so underwritten. Gal Gadot is a firecracker as Wonder Woman. She looks absolutely ravishing too! Ezra Miller shines as The Flash, delivering a sporty performance. Jason Momoa too makes a mark as Aquaman. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is alright. Others lend ordinary support. On the whole, 'Justice League' is a poor show. A major disappointment!",3,2,7,18 November 2017
Man of Steel," The Return of The Man of Steel!
","Based on the legendary DC Comics character Superman, 'Man of Steel' marks a worthy Return of The Man of Steel! There have been Superman movies before, and the ones with Christopher Reeve playing the Superhero, were simply amazing, but 'Man of Steel' proves to be the finest Superman movie to date. Director Zack Snyder, Producer Christopher Nolan & Writer David S. Goyer, deliver an action-packed summer blockbuster, that entertains & thrills. 'Man of Steel' Synopsis: A young itinerant worker is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage when Earth is invaded by members of his race.'Man of Steel' has an engaging first-hour, the struggle of its heroic protagonist is indeed grasping. But, its the second-hour that takes the film to dizzy heights. Non-Stop Action & Explosions left me awe-struck. The action depicted in the film is jaw-dropping & marvelously executed. The film has some astounding special effects, that only elevate those sequences. The Story by Nolan & The Screenplay by David S. Goyer, give Superman a new world altogether. His journey from Clark Kent to Superman is different this time, but luckily, the new vision to his legend, is satisfactory. Zack Snyder's Direction is stupendous. He has handled the dramatic, as well as the action-sequences, with dexterity. To envision such a film & then making it so good, is a rare achievement. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design, are excellent. Score by Hans Zimmer, as expected, is top-class.Performance-Wise: Henry Cavill as Clark Kent / Superman / Kal-El, is credible. He has the charm & the appearance of the superhero. Amy Adams as Lois Lane, is first-rate. Michael Shannon as General Zod, is, as always, mind-blowing. Kevin Costner & Diane Lane as Jonathan & Martha Kent, are wonderful. Russell Crowe as Jor-El, is a bad-ass! Ayelet Zurer as Lara Lor-Van, is passable. Antje Traue as Faora, is damn good. Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, leaves a mark. On the whole, 'Man of Steel' is full of merits! Strongly Recommended!",9,9,18,14 June 2013
Footloose," Superb!
","Loosely based on events that took place in the tiny, rural farming community of Elmore City, Oklahoma... Herbert Ross's 'Footloose' is about a small town where rock-and-roll has been banned. You just can't dance over-there! Boy, It's a superb film... as a viewer, you're highly entertained!'Footloose' is an expression, of how far would you go to make a dream come true. Dean Pitchford screenplay is engaging and Ross's direction is terrific. It has some memorable moments, especially when Bacon dances his guts out or even the penultimate portions that focus on John Lithgow. The soundtrack is foot-tapping, surely 1984 grooved on it! Kevin Bacon is the soul of the film. 'Footloose' explores the dancer and actor inside him. Despite being a highly-talented personality... he has remained under-rated! Sad to know he doesn't have the fan-following that he truly deserves. A special mention to Lithgow, Lori Singer and Dianne Wiest for their flawless performances! 'Footloose' is a must watch. It's entertaining, foot-tapping and the now-veteran Bacon to keep you glued. Two Thumbs Up!",8,6,10,25 June 2010
Cast Away," Master-Class!
","'Cast Away' is not an easy film to watch. A man stuck in an abandoned Island and his loneliness can be very off-putting. But when a subject like this is handled by Hollywood Legends like Robert Zemeckis & Tom Hanks, you know that something great is in store.'Cast Away' is not the greatest film of all-time nor is it the best film of the year it released. But it's an extra-ordinary film, that is hopeful by nature. About 142 minutes long, 'Cast Away' is not about an isolated man, it's not about his sadness, but about love & hope. 'Cast Away' is film that has it's heart, mind and soul in the right place.Robert Zemeckis has gone down as one of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers ever. His body of work is impeccable and a true legend. 'Cast Away' is amongst his strongest and fittest efforts to date. William Broyles Jr.'s Screenplay is wonderful, with memorable dialogue. Cinematography by Don Burgess's captures each moment effortlessly.In the acting department, Tom Hanks is outstanding. He is the most successful actor, box office wise, and as an actor, he easily ranks amongst the best in his dictionary. Helen Hunt is excellent, as well. Chris Noth also, is very effective.On the whole, Such Films Come Very, Very Rarely! A awe-struck, Two Thumbs Up!",10,0,0,13 September 2010
The Revenant," Iñárritu Triumphs Again!
","After giving us a Masterpiece & Winning The Academy-Award for Best Director, Picture & Screenplay in Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu returns on celluloid with 'The Revenant'. And the master storyteller triumphs again! Let me inform you: 'The Revenant' is NOT Meant For The Faint-Hearted. This is a brutal, unforgiving, hardcore film about survival & revenge. This a story filled & driven by blood & bruises. But if you are thick-skinned, don't dare to miss this one. This is filmmaking at its most creative & most relentless. 'The Revenant' Synopsis: In the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.Inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass, 'The Revenant' is ideally a vendetta fare, that's been shot so gorgeously, you forget you're watching a story thats been depicted on celluloid an endless number of times. Iñárritu creates a World of violence in the wild, where people are butchered, the animals are ferocious than ever. Watching the protagonist struggle after a brutal bear mauling (Which by the way is a Frightening Sequence), is often difficult to watch, as he struggles & how. But at the end, Justice is served & the dramatic climax leaves a superb impact.Mark L. Smith & Iñárritu's Screenplay is unforgiving. Its a survival tale with vendetta as its wallpaper. The wilderness & the violence have no end here & the narrative remains strong, despite its predictable storyline. Iñárritu's Direction is Masterful. He has handled the film with breath-taking ambition. Emmanuel Lubezki's Cinematography makes 'The Revenant' a visual marvel. The Two-Time Back-to-Back Oscar-Winner has captured every frame, with such beauty, you almost feel you're in the story. A Third Oscar? Well, why not!Stephen Mirrione's Editing is sharp, although the film tends to drag a bit & is a bit too long (157-minutes). Some trimming would've only enhanced the impact more. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto & Bryce Dessner's Score is brilliant. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Action- Sequences are raw & brutal. CGI is perfectly done.Now to the Performances! 'The Revenant' features Two of the Finest Actors of their generation coming together: Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy. And they more than rise up to the occasion. Leo is phenomenal as the struggling protagonist, who must avenge the death of his son & bear any numbers of consequences that come his way. Its a committed performance, that has great layers. Hardy is despicable as the chief villain, delivering a marvelously evil performance, that haunts you. Of the supporting cast, Domhnall Gleeson stands out with an impressive act.On the whole, 'The Revenant' is Visually Dazzling, Fabulously Acted & Impeccably Made. A Must Watch!",9,17,39,25 December 2015

'Bridge of Spies' Synopsis: An American lawyer is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot detained in the Soviet Union.'Bridge of Spies' tells the story of a man, who won, despite the violence & political pressure around him. James B. Donovan's fight to get back the ones who belong home & also send the one to his place, without ever disgracing anyone, is engrossing. Its such a powerful, riveting true-story, that I was left amazed. Matt Charman, Ethan Coen & Joel Coen's Screenplay is excellent. It never slows down & the way this story progresses, is awe-inspiring. The Writing remains super-strong at all times! Spielberg's Direction is flawless. The Master Filmmaker has handled this historical dramatic thriller, without one single fault. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is picture-perfect. Michael Kahn's Editing is razor-crisp. Thomas Newman's Score is superb (Although its strange not to hear John Williams's musical genius here, since he's a Spielberg regular). Art & Costume Design are efficient.Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, is commanding, as ever. The Screen Legend ignites the proceedings, with magnetic energy. Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel, is the scene-stealer. He enacts the spy in question, magnificently. And the on-screen chemistry between Hanks & Rylance, is enviable. Amy Ryan as Mary McKenna Donovan, does well. Alan Alda as Thomas Watters, is impeccable, as always. Austin Stowell as Francis Gary Powers, leaves a mark. Others lend perfect support.On the whole, 'Bridge of Spies' is Cinema At Its Best! Don't Miss It!",9,5,11,17 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," For Potter Buffs, Only!
","Harry Potter. How popular is this character? He's become a person, whom, the entire world knows, and to a large extend, adores. I am not a Harry Potter buff, but, I can't deny that it's concept and the world Potter lives in and the powers he and his people are blessed with, are truly innovative.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - 1', which is basically the last part, is now made into two parts cinematically, so that the magic waves for another cinematic experience. However, this Part 1, isn't really the most entertaining Potter film to date.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - 1' begins well, and the battle between the good versus the evil gets more intact, in fact, more violent. As I have not read the book, I have no idea how Rowling plans to end the story, however, this section of the final book is not really nerve biting. One more aspect that goes against this any-way successful film, is it's painfully long running time, which is over a 145-minutes. The film could have easily done away at least by 15-20 minutes.What stands tall in this Potter flick, is it's breath-taking Cinematography by Eduardo Serra. The lens-man captures the exotic locales with remarkable framing and execution. David Yates direction is passable. In the acting front, Daniel Radcliffe continues to be Harry Potter, and shines, yet again. Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron are efficient. Among the other list of supporting actors, Helena Bonham Carter leaves the strongest impression.On the whole, As my Summary Says in Caps, for Potter Buffs, Only! I didn't really enjoy this one, but buffs will!",4,1,5,26 November 2010

'American Psycho' Synopsis: A wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, gratuitous fantasies.'American Psycho' works because the Screenplay Written by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner, is sadistically engaging. Sure, its not a flawless film, but it still works largely, because the protagonist, Patrick Bateman, the psychopath, is an interesting character. His journey is full of blood & sadism, but he still appeals as a despicable leading man. Mary Harron's Direction is wild. Cinematography captures the violence as well as the madness, ably. Editing is good.Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the psychopath, is incredible. Bale has delivered amazing performances all through his impressive career, but his work in 'American Psycho' ranks amongst his finest. The Oscar-Winner is in complete form, yet again! In the supporting cast, Willem Dafoe & Jared Leto stand out.On the whole, 'American Psycho' is uninhibited & brutal. You need a strong stomach to absorb this one!",9,0,0,5 August 2013

While the first-hour keeps you at the edge of your seat, the second-hour gets slow & slightly dull. The climax is well-done, but a sharper & faster second-hour was needed. Ernest Lehman's Screenplay is suspenseful & exciting. Hitchcock's Marvelous Treatment makes 'North by Northwest' so memorable. Cinematography & Art Design are good. Editing isn't sharp enough.

Knowing," Body Beautiful of Minus Soul...
","Have you heard the phrase Body Beautiful of Minus Soul.... I am sure you must have. Knowing directed by Alex Proyas is true to that phrase. The film's idea is more than interesting, the film has Nicolas Cage, then what's the problem? The film's 1st hour is excellent,, but the second hour loses grip, the film becomes boring and tedious. The climax is shocking and really funny. Writer Ryan Douglas Pearson had the opportunity to make 'Knowling' a killer script, with brilliant execution to the motion picture. Sadly the writer and director give the viewer a toss. Pluses of the film: The film's idea is catchy, so is its first hour. Nicolas Cage provides the star-value. Minuses: The film loses grip, especially the climax which is a complete letdown. The Adam & Eve concept falls flat. Background Music could've been stronger, as the film has those fast- paced moments. Final word? 'Knowing' is at best an average fare.",5,2,5,28 June 2009

","Spider-Man movies have been really good. The ones helmed by Sam Raimi were particularly impressive, as those films focused on the idea of the boy beneath the mask, Peter Parker.

Dangal," A Well-Made, Well-Acted Film With A Strong Message!
","After 2 years, Aamir Khan strikes back with 'Dangal'. And here's a film, that proves the superstar's genius yet again! Director Nitesh Tiwari & Aamir team up to tell The affecting true-story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari, to their eventual triumph. Its a film that delivers entertainment & a message that's important & worthy.'Dangal' explores Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two wrestler daughters' struggle towards glory at the Commonwealth Games in the face of societal oppression.'Dangal' is about the human spirit & that talent & passion don't come under any particular gender. If your a Man, you can achieve impossible goals & if your a Woman, you achieve the very same. 'Dangal' is about Mahavir Singh Phogat's courageous journey & how against all odds, he trained his daughters & made them GOLD in the world of wrestling. Early on in the film, Mahavir, who sadly quits wrestling after his father's discouragement, says 'only my son can make my dream come true'. But he has four daughters despite his willing to have a son. To his astonishment, one fine day, when two bruised boys come to complain after receiving a beating by his girls, he realizes his daughters (now teenagers) have the power & punch to rule in the ring. And thus, begins Mahavir's journey with his daughters that leads to history.'Dangal' is an important film, that is a wake up of call for all those, who underestimate women as a lesser sex. Women are powerful, strong & capable & at par with Men. We cheer for Geeta & Babita as they fight against all odds & your heart goes for Mahavir, who sees his dream come true through his daughters. The first-hour soars. Its a joy to watch the daughters get entangled in the world of wrestling & also inspiring to see them grow. You're engrossed by the passion Mahavir trains them with & how they grow as people & wrestlers. The second-hour slows down for a bit & that's where 'Dangal' falters. The sports movie clichés come in & the angle of a unlikable coach (played by Girish Kulkarni) doesn't really work. For a film that starts off with such precision & keeps you glued to your seat all through the first-hour, suddenly turns predictable. Also, Geeta's arrogance towards Mahavir & Family, don't stir up the emotions one might expect. But, things come back with force with a terrific finale, that will leave you cheering. Watching Geeta become India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she wins the gold medal, is something to be witnessed. Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain & Nikhil Meharotra's Screenplay adapts an inspiring true-story, into an equally inspiring film. Though imperfect due to its clichés & some melodrama, the soul of 'Dangal' remains strong. The message of the film, to be honest, is even bigger than the film itself. The Writers deserve credit for delivering a story that celebrates women as 'heroes' & also, fatherhood. Nitesh Tiwari's Direction is very-well done. He's handled some of the film's most dramatic & emotional sequences, skillfully. Cinematography & Editing are quite good. Pritam's Score is fabulous. Art & Costume Design are perfect, while the wrestling sequences (done by Sham Kaushal) are raw & effective.Performance-Wise: Aamir Khan is the heart of 'Dangal'. His physical transformation from fit to fat, to his nicely done haryanvi accent, is note-worthy. But its his eyes & body-language that touch you. He is wonderful as a man who'd stop at nothing to see his dreams come true & at the same time, lend pride to his daughters' achievements. Aamir delivers one of his finest performances to date! Sakshi Tanwar, as Aamir's wife, is marvelous. She's remarkably restrained. Fatima Sana Shaikh as Geeta Phogat, is excellent. And watching her wrestle, looks as real as it could get. Sanya Malhotra as Babita Kumari, is fabulous. She gets a smaller role in comparison to Sana, but shines all through. Zaira Wasim as young Geeta & Suhani Bhatnagar as young Babita, are adorable. They steal some of the best moments in the film. Aparshakti Khurrana is lovable & so is the actor who plays his younger self. Girish Kulkarni is okay. On the whole, 'Dangal' isn't perfect & yet its an important film, that delivers a strong & important message. Definitely, worth a watch!",7,6,16,23 December 2016
Salt," Decent Flick!
","Phillip Noyce's 'Salt' is a decent action-thriller that focuses on Spys. The film has it's share of shortcomings, but manages to sail safely.Angelina Jolie stars as Salt a CIA agent, who is accused of being a double agent. Her journey from there-after, is filled with loads of action, and many twists and turns.'Salt' has a paper-thin plot, but it's list of twists keep the proceedings alive. However, I would like to state, that, the culmination doesn't appeal. The actual twist in the tale doesn't leave any impact whatsoever. Writers Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland could've truly worked for a better culmination.Phillip Noyce's direction is fair, while the stunts are the mainstay of the film. Angelina Jolie is excellent as Salt and goes on to prove her potential once again.

However, the over-dose of Songs & Lack of Drama at times might make you feel slightly dull. But the actual minus point in this actually well-made film, comes in it's running time. It's a 129 minutes long, and editor Virginia Katz could have easily used the scissor at places. Nonetheless, the striking performances, the energetic direction, and wonderful music remain with you more than it's flaws.Each song has a feel to it, though the songs run-in as a 129 minute long melody, they manage to remain with you. Performance-Wise: Eddie Murphy is Awesome. He truly delivers his finest performance here. Jennifer Hudson's Oscar-Winning performance seems justified, as she gets it right. Beyoncé Knowles is good and sizzles in each song gracefully. Jamie Foxx is earnest. Anika Noni Rose does a sincere job. Danny Glover is fine.

Heslov's direction has it's touch. Robert Elswit's Camera-Work is also very good. 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' would've been half of the entertainer it is, if he hadn't had amazing performances. First of all it's a sheer pleasure to watch 4-Accomplished Actors come together in one film. Clooney is fantastic from start to end. McGregor is in top form, this is easily amongst his best works.

Shrek Forever After," Time to say Shrek Good-Bye...
","Shrek has gone down a cult film character... so has Donkey, Fiona and Puss in Boots, thanks to the film that these characters became such a craze. Shrek was awesome, Sherk 2 was legendary, but the last one before this one 'Shrek The Third' was a yawn. Now comes 'Shrek Forever After', which ends the Shrek series... well if there is one more left, then I guess I won't be looking forward to it! The problem with 'Shrek The Third' and 'Shrek Forever After' are it's script. The writing is bland, you except a lot from Shrek, due to the wholesome entertainment we've witnessed before. The Final Chapter has it's share of funny and light moments, but they are far and between! What saves this disappointment is it's characters. Myers as Shrek is as good as ever! Diaz gives Fiona the voice she needs. Donkey and Puss-In Boots voiced by Icons like Murphy and Banderas are the life of the show. They are funny and spot-on.

Dunkirk," A Visual Marvel, Minus Soul!
","Written, Co-Produced and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 'Dunkirk' is a magnificent technical achievement, that is a feast for the eyes. Nolan, a master in his craft, sadly fails as a Writer, delivering a War Epic that's ambitious & huge in scale, but also soulless. Its definitely a well-made film, but not in the level of how a Nolan motion-picture generally is.'Dunkirk' Synopsis: Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.'Dunkirk' puts 3 different time-lines together & jumbles them into a king-sized narrative. The film begins with a flourishing impact, showing us how the soldiers are in constant havoc. What follows is how survival is at stake & how the carnage of war can damage those who go at the battlefield to protect their nation. Nolan handsomely mounts a visually staggering war epic, that doesn't have a single frame that lacks ambition or genuine skill. The war depicted here in 'Dunkirk' is intense & hardcore, that's sure to leave you disturbed.BUT, 'Dunkirk' lacks a cohesive Screenplay. Nolan's Screenplay is packed with intensity, but is too busy to make us feel for its heroic characters. Seen from three perspectives, 'Dunkirk' has too many characters, but not for one, do you feel for. And that's indeed disappointing, considering this is a film about War Heroes. Nolan crowds the film with three perspectives, but forgets too give its characters depth. And that's certainly unacceptable from a guy like Nolan. Nolan made Superhero films that were more about the heroes without the capes, and delivered an affecting family-drama while indulging in the Sci-Fi zone last time, but in 'Dunkirk' there is not a single character that you'll remember or even, feel for, despite their heroic courage. Nolan's Writing is a letdown & comes up as a minus.Nolan's Direction is marvelous. He's a master at his craft & the atmosphere he sets in here, is simply terrific. How I wish his Writing was as strong as his Direction. Hans Zimmer's Score is magnificent & turns 'Dunkirk' into a heart-pounding experience. Hoyte van Hoytema's Cinematography is astounding. The lens-man has filmed each & every frame, with flawlessness. Lee Smith's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. The Choerography of the War-Sequences, are tremendous. As mentioned earlier, 'Dunkirk' is a remarkable technical achievement.Talking of performances, its only Tom Hardy as Farrier, a Royal Air Force pilot & the Legendary Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton, the pier-master during the evacuation, who stand out. On the whole, 'Dunkirk' is certainly a well-made film with plus points, but the lack of depth in its characters, are hard to ignore. Its a crushing disappointment.",6,13,24,22 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Watch It for Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance!
","'The Amazing Spider Man' lacks the excitement in comparison to the legendary the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. But if you look at it as a new story all together, it offers some interesting moments. But, for me, this film works primarily for one reason: Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! 'The Amazing Spider-Man' Synopsis: Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.'The Amazing Spider Man' is fabulously shot & grandly made. But, I personally felt, that, the Screenplay wasn't up-to the mark. To give its due rightfully, there are some very interesting sequences & the action set-pieces are excellent, but overall, the desired impact, seems a bit missing. Screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent & Steve Kloves has merits, but it could've been stronger nonetheless. Marc Webb's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is vast. Graphics are outstanding. Action set-pieces, as mentioned, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for top honors. The actor is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! Its a performance that deserves immense praise. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, does a good job. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard, plays the menace easily. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker & Sally Field as May Parker are impressive, as always. Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, is in command after a long time. Irrfan Khan as Dr. Rajit Ratha, deserved more footage. On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider Man' isn't Amazing, but stunning to look at nevertheless.",6,34,70,29 June 2012

The story about the 'special' within us all, is told sensitively, although there are some mind-bending action bits here too. Its eventually a tale about finding the better in us, in a world, where the good is dying slowly, but surely. The message is important & its delivered with zeal.Phil Lord & Christopher Miller's Screenplay is delightfully entertaining. it borrows some of the most iconic characters of film history & pitch them in perfectly, without ever looking overdone. The Writing is super-strong at all times. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is dazzling. The Visual Effects are OUTSTANDING! A Special Mention for Mark Mothersbaugh's Score.Performance-Wise: Chris Pratt leads the pack & enacts the unlikely protagonist, with full commitment. Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle, is charming. Will Arnett as Batman/Bruce Wayne & Liam Neeson as Bad Cop/Good Cop, are the show-stoppers though. Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius & Will Ferrell as the villainous Lord Business, also leave a solid mark.

Captain America: Civil War," Popcorn Entertainment It Is!
","The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger & 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 'Captain America: Civil War' is Popcorn Entertainment! Its fun, engrossing & watching the Superheroes fight it out between them, is a sight to be seen. This is how a Superhero Film should be.'Captain America: Civil War' Synopsis: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.'Captain America: Civil War' is not perfect, its not even close to it. But what it is, in totality, is an arresting Superhero film, that shows Marvel's most prolific Good Guys fight it out. And I'm gonna say it again, the Sequence involving Team Capt vs Team IronMan, is exhilarating. Just a month ago we saw a STINKER involving Superheroes, but the real gift for fans like me, is this one.Screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely is mostly arresting. Although, its a bit too long & a bit too busy. I did not particularly enjoy the final 20-minutes, I felt the 'final showdown' could've been sharper. But otherwise, I ain't complaining. The narrative slowly builds up & the reason why the good-guys go against each other, makes sense. Its involving & undoubtedly entertaining. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is superb. They have handled this blockbuster, with flourish. Cinematography is top-notch, while the Editing could've been crisper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences & Graphics are FANTASTIC. Henry Jackman's Score is great.Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, delivers a committed performance, but its Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, who steals the thunder. This is a more serious Stark we see here & its a welcome change. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, is in form. Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo, is solid. William Hurt as Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, defines command. But The Highlights, however, are Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man & Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther. Holland is scene-stealing good, while Boseman is electrifying. I personally can't wait to see their standalone films in the coming future! And Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, shines. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Captain America: Civil War' is great fun! Do Watch!",7,10,20,6 May 2016
American History X," Amazing...
","'American History X' is an incredible film. Writer David McKenna and Director Tony Kaye deliver a message in bold letters, well their message effected me at least. It's a film that has guts and gore... it stands out! Some films entertain and vanish away, and some films remain haunted. 'American History X' is one of those powerful, 'Well-Written' films that leave you wanting for nothing. It talks about voluntary manslaughter, it's a tale of Two Borthers... it's about complexes, it's about color, it's about the anger within... A Masterstroke!Let me get one thing straight: 'American History X' is not at all meant for the faint-hearted. You need a strong heart to sit through the intense proceedings, and most of all: Should be viewed by those who are 17+ only.Moving on, I found Edward Norton's character highly powerful, it has a life to tell. And the character looks more fascinating and disturbing due to Norton's terrific performance. He showcases himself like never before, and proves that he is indeed one of the most talented and well-dressed actors of modern-era. Edward Furlong also takes this rough journey with pedestrian.On the whole, after watching 'American History X', I just said WOW! If you're a cinema fanatic, then watching this film should rank amongst the top category. Two Big Thumbs Up!",9,0,2,20 May 2010

I found myself terrified at my seat, almost shutting my eyes & ears whenever a sound or visual offered something ghostly. I was particularly terrified in a superbly done sequence, involving a painting & a nun. Believe me, I'm never looking at a nun in the same manner! Wan, Chad Hayes, Carey Hayes & David Leslie Johnson's Screenplay (supposedly based on a true-story) is hauntingly scary. 'The Conjuring 2' is almost at par with its predecessor, as the scares here, are truly well-done. The Writing superbly warms up in its first-hour & turns into a ride in the second-hour, only to culminate into a feast of a climax. Wan's Direction is brilliant.

No Strings Attached," Decent Flick....
","Ivan Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' is a decent romantic-comedy, laced with charming performances by it's lead cast. Even the freshness attached to it, comes up as a sorta relief.'No Strings Attached' stars Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher, as two friends who end up having sex one morning and begin to worry about their friendship being ruined. They then make a pact to have a 'No Strings Attached' relationship, that, to have casual sex without falling in love with each other.The idea is fresh, and the writing in the first hour, especially, is interesting & enjoyable. But, like every other romantic-comedy, the second hour suffers from the usual clichés. However, the freshness in the first-hour doesn't let it's impact go a miss completely. Ivan Reitman's direction is fine. Cinematography is good. Editing is fair.Performance-Wise: Portman & Kutcher, both, are equally charming. Portman gets it right from the very beginning, and doesn't fail to impress, yet again. Kutcher, like always, gets his timing spot-on. In the supporting cast, Kevin Kline gets very limited scope. He deserved more footage. Greta Gerwig is alright. Lake Bell is extremely natural. Cary Elwes is hardly there.On the whole, 'No Strings Attached' is a decent watch.",6,2,6,3 May 2011

M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Sushant Singh Rajput Delivers His Finest Performance in an Okay Biopic!
","Sushant Singh Rajput's talent comes full circle with 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story'. As the cricket legend, Sushant gives his all in a performance, that comes across as an embodiment, rather than an impersonation. 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' explores the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, right from his journey from being a ticket collector, to a trophy collector and the world-cup-winning captain of the Indian Cricket Team.Director Neeraj Pandey chooses a worthy true-story as his latest project, but succeeds only partially. The film is too long at 3-hours & the Writing is never remarkable. Of course, Dhoni is a man made of pure merit, who's seen tremendous struggle, before emerging into a phenomenon. But, 'The Untold Story' has an average Screenplay, that arrests in parts.Pandey & Dilip Jha's Screenplay is alright. Despite choosing to tell the story of a real-life euphoric figure, the Writing never soars. It works in parts & works best when it sees its protagonist off the pitch. Also, the Dialogue are surprisingly weak. Definitely, a much stronger Screenplay was the need of the day! Pandey's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Various Artists, is melodious.Performance-Wise: Sushant is great, no two options on that! Of the rest of the cast, Anupam Kher is remarkable as Dhoni's father, delivering a genuinely heartfelt performance from start to end. Rajesh Sharma is wonderful as Banerji, who's the first to realize Dhoni's potential. Kumud Mishra excels as well. Bhumika Chawla as Dhoni's Sister is nice & its refreshing to see her on-screen after so long. Kiara Advani as Dhoni's Wife & Disha Patani as Dhoni's Girlfriend, are strictly okay.On the whole, 'M.S.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Great Idea, Gone Wrong!
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is the purest example of a Great Idea, Gone Wrong. Come to think to of it, the idea, The hero has to defeat the heroine's 7 ex-boyfriends, in order to win her heart. It has tremendous potential and the film begins with a roar, but as soon as the film passes 60-minutes, you know that something has started to go wrong.'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' has some terrific moments, super stunts, lively music and memorable performances working for it, but where it falters, is it's writing. The writing is of top-grade in the first hour, but as soon the hero meets opponent to opponent, it gets monotonous and dragging. Even the climax for that matter, leaves no impact.Edgar Wright's Screenplay loses pace, while his direction is no hot-shot. Bill Pope's Cinematography is good. The Editing is fine. Performance wise, all the actors have done very well. Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, is excellent. The youngster gets into the skin of the character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good. Ellen Wong is fantastic. Kieran Culkin is outstandingly funny in his part.

Man on the Moon," An okay biopic, though Carrey is fantastic...
","MiloÂš Forman is a legendary filmmaker, he's made the best of films during his heyday. I've always been a fan of his, always loved his work. 'Man Of The Moon' however, ranks amongst his okay efforts. A biographical film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, comes a biopic, that doesn't really entertain.Kaufman was an amazing entertainer, who got in Tony Clifton & Latka Gravas, both of which are legendary today. 'Man On The Moon' brings the biopic to life, but, it could've been better. The film beings with a bang, but slides as soon Kaufman becomes a flop star. Some biopics are worth-watching again and again and again, but 'Man On The Moon', despite being an honest effort, isn't one of those gems.Carrey is the highlight of the film, playing Kaufman from top to bottom. He's fantastic in every dialog he delivers, A Golden Globe isn't all, he at least deserved to earn a Nomination at the Academy Awards. Courtney Love is excellent.

A biopic that moves you, scares you and gives the you courage to survive in the world where bloodshed is a common thing.'The Pianist' takes us to the legendary journey of the late Władysław Szpilman with predestine.

What A Freaking Life, and What A Bloody Way To Show It!!! Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is one of those performances that shine even in the darkest night. It's a performance that is haunted!

The Favourite," Olivia Colman Achieves Greatness in Yorgos Lanthimos's Wicked Tale!
","'The Favourite' is Director Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film to date. Yes, the man who gave us a film like The Lobster (I haven't seen his other works hence I only have that one film as a reference), now presents us a period piece, of power, greed, cruelty and lust. While not perfect, 'The Favourite' is nonetheless an entirely well-made tale, who's wicked behavior is hard to resist. And Olivia Colman, in the film's meatiest role, achieves acting greatness. It's a virtuoso performance from the firebrand actress.'The Favourite' Synopsis: In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz oozing ease of a seasoned veteran) governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone, a complete hoot) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.'The Favourite' is a twisted tale of three complex women who are unable to look at life without power in their hands. What I particularly loved here was the diversity of its principal characters, who have only one similarity: the greed for power. And while not all of their cruelly ambitious motives land as arrestingly as expected, its hard not to be seduced by these women. I really enjoyed the sexual tension as well as the unpredictability among the women.Having said that, 'The Favourite' has a few shortcomings of its own. Deborah Davis
and Tony McNamara's Screenplay is a little too long and lacks some sharpness. Sure, length is never a problem, but the Writing lacks some bite in the film's latter half. While the first-hour is a mix of sadistic humor and delicious twists, the second-hour is less effective in the same nature it begins upon. But again, these aren't flaws so deep that they take away from an otherwise engaging film. The Writing, for a large chunk of the film, is swift and arresting. Lanthimos's Direction is lush. The man has outdone himself here and has Directed this period piece with sheer class. Robbie Ryan's Cinematography is gorgeous. The Lensman has captured this classy affair with absolute ease. Not one frame lacks beauty. Lanthimos and Ryan deserve Oscar-Attention, next year! Yorgos Mavropsaridis's Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are astoundingly done. The Score is top-notch.And now to the performances! 'The Favourite' has a strong ensemble cast, who bring in their A-Game. Colman takes the lead, of course. As Queen Anne, Colman is acting greatness at its truest. She expresses grief, pain, jealously, love, fear and humanity, all at once, in a performance that deserves respect and accolades. Colman is the underdog this year, who has left us all spell-bound, with a portrayal so deep and personal, it would be unfair to rank it only among the best of the year. It's much more than that.Following up to Colman, Weisz and Stone are exceptional. Weisz is quietly powerful as a women who fears losing her power and love, adapting and entirely inhabiting the character for a first-rate turn. Stone is at her most uninhibited and portrays the opportunist to perfection.And while it's the Women who rule the show without any doubt, the men here also do credible jobs. Nicholas Hoult, in particular, is a complete revelation in a key-role, while Joe Alwyn delivers a yet another impressive performance.On the whole, 'The Favourite' is not perfection, but it most certainly is a well-made, gorgeously shot film with some excellent performances, and one that merits an Oscar. Watch It!",7,2,4,31 December 2018
Seabiscuit," A Film With A Spirit!
","Based on the best-selling novel Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand, Gary Ross directed 'Seabiscuit' is a film with a Spirit!

The characters, The Horse itself, are wonderfully explained. However, the film definitely could've been trimmed, by at least 10-15 minutes. Ross's direction deserves brownie points, as well.

Jeff Bridges is natural & restrained throughout, while Chris Cooper is simply fantastic. Elizabeth Banks is passable. Gary Stevens & William H.

Revolutionary Road," A film that becomes Reality after a while....
","Based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, Filmmaker Sam Mendes brings us 'Revolutionary Road', a film that becomes Reality after a while. Astounding! 'Revolutionary Road' is different, very different. At a running time of 113-minutes, this film grows on you & the intense moments look as if they are going on near you. I have never let a film grow on me, but Sam Mendes, this son of a gun... did that! When the end-credits rolled, I then realized that I am indeed watching a movie, I was left awe-struck.As this is a film, apart from the high-class direction, every other department is flawless. Coming to the acting department, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver bravura performances. Kate is astounding. She's so real. Leo is fantastic from start to end. Michael Shannon is outstanding. An Icredible Actor! Kathy Bates, Richard Easton & Zoe Kazan are good. David Harbour is excellent. Kathryn Hahn is passable.A 9/10 rating, because this ended up being a movie, not something going-on near my eyes.",9,1,1,7 January 2010
Foxcatcher," Superbly Acted, but Lazily Paced!
","Based on the true events, Bennett Miller's 'Foxcatcher' has some great performances, but as a film, despite some powerful moments, its uneven, thanks to a lazily paced narrative. The narrative is so slow, that it gets to you after a point.'Foxcatcher' Synopsis: The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher lead by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances.'Foxcatcher', which is Written by E. Max Frye & Dan Futterman, attempts to re-tell a true story with honesty. But, as mentioned from my summary itself, the film is is very slow. I was engrossed by du Pont's ambition, but the sub-plot involving the estranged brothers, is far from impressive. And lastly, I couldn't feel for any of the characters. I never cheered or booed them, I was simply bored after a point.Bennett Miller's Direction is well-done, capturing the film with a sense of paranoia. Cinematography is striking. Editing is the weakest link of the enterprise. Make-Up is great.Performance-Wise: Steve Carell as du Pont, takes a sharp turn, by portraying a part as dark as this. He deserves brownie points for justifying a part, that's completely opposite from his general on-screen persona. Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz, is very sincere. Mark Ruffalo as Dave Schultz, totally steals the film. He is incredibly strong in a supporting role. Vanessa Redgrave as Jean du Pont, the mother, is wasted.On the whole, 'Foxcatcher' aims for the moon, but loses force mid-way.",6,2,6,31 December 2014

Avengers: Infinity War," Fun. But its the same old story!
","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.",6,9,21,29 April 2018
JFK," Masterful!
","Oliver Stone loves to make and watch Reality on celluloid. He belies escapism in most of his films. 'JFK' is hard-hitting film, that examines the events leading to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and alleged subsequent cover-up, through the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison.'JFK' is a film that is very interesting to watch. And at the same, too tragic to sit-throw. The aftermath of the assassination gets disturbing after a point. However, Jim Garrison's battle to win the right, is one cinematic experience! Oliver Stone diminishes his inhibitions in here. He makes a film as a long as a day, and goes in detailed information. His direction is stunning and is beautifully lensed by Cinematographer Robert Richardson.John Williams's Music gets into the skin of the film. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show with a sterling performance. He plays the smiling bad guy with ease. Kevin Costner performs exceedingly well as Jim Garrison. Gary Oldman is first-rate. Others lend Remarkable support.On the whole, 'JFK' is a film that blows your mind, takes away time from your day and plays with it's viewer. Masterful, indeed!",10,2,12,20 September 2010
Behind The Candelabra," Good Performances!
","'Behind the Candelabra' offers Good Performances by Two Terrific Actors -- Michael Douglas & Matt Damon. Enacting Liberace & his lover Scott Thorson respectively, Douglas & Damon are uninhibited & fearless in their portrayals. Its their sheer work here that outdoes everything else! 'Behind the Candelabra' is Based on the tempestuous, yet troubled, 6-year relationship between Liberace & his (much younger) lover, Scott Thorson.Steven Soderbergh Directs 'Behind the Candelabra' with confidence, but the Adapted Screenplay Written by Richard LaGravenese is half-baked & monotonous. While the relationship between Liberace & Scott Thorson is well-developed, the sequences, after a while, get so repetitive, that I was getting restless. The Final Act is depressing, but Soderbergh handles it with enough patience. I wasn't disappointed by Soderbergh's Direction at all, but the Adapted Screenplay did underwhelm me. Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas as Liberace & Matt Damon as Scott Thorson, are fearless & uninhibited. Their on-screen chemistry, also, is pitch-perfect. Rob Lowe, in a smaller part, is earnest. Dan Aykroyd is adequate.On the whole, 'Behind the Candelabra' works due to its strong leading performances.",5,3,5,28 November 2013
Beasts of No Nation," Well-Acted, but Unevenly Written!
","Based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Uzodinma Iweala, 'Beasts of No Nation' is well-acted, but unevenly written! The sad part is that this tale, as brutal as it is, it still isn't as powerful as it proclaims to be.'Beasts of No Nation' is A drama based on the experiences of Agu, a child soldier fighting in the civil war of an unnamed African country.'Beasts of No Nation' is well-made, but not very well-written. And thats its minus point. Cary Joji Fukunaga's Adapted Screenplay doesn't engage entirely. I was definitely aghast at times, but the monotony put me off. Once Agu is taken under the wings of the villain, the sequences tend to repeat & what follows also, doesn't turn out to be gut-wrenching. Fukunaga's Writing needed to be more harrowing. His Direction, however, is realistic to the core. Performance-Wise: Idris Elba as Commandant, is terrifying. This is a performance that Elba can boast for a long, long time. He creates a human in the monster he portrays & that's a really big achievement. Abraham Attah as Agu, is tremendous. The child slips into this difficult, disturbing part & portrays it without a single false note.On the whole, 'Beasts of No Nation' needed to be more powerful. Watch it for the superb acting nonetheless.",6,17,30,1 November 2015
Gone Girl," I Now Pronounce You Monster & Monster...
","Ddapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the same name, David Fincher's 'Gone Girl' is a Terrifying, Frightening Portrait of a Failed Marriage. Flynn's Screenplay shifts from arresting to heart-pounding, while Fincher's Direction is incredible. Also, the performances are remarkable! 'Gone Girl' Synopsis: With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent.'Gone Girl' is about two monstrous individuals. Nick & Amy, the protagonists of the film, played by Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike, are flawed, violent, insensitive, yet loving & together. Their journey as a married couple, turns out to be a horrifyingly bumpy ride, but as a viewer, I had a ball! We see the two protagonists struggle with their inner demons, particularly Nick, who also faces media scrutiny & is declared a monster. We watch Nick battle himself & review his relationship over the years with Amy. You watch a man being broken into pieces, just out of perception & the bashing he receives from the media, who now have become monsters themselves, to run their channels at any cost. Flynn's Adapted Screenplay examines dishonesty, the media's reckless behavior, the economy's effects on marriage and appearances. It captures many themes, which in turn, becomes a deliciously twisted thriller. Fincher is a master storyteller & with 'Gone Girl', he's scored a home-run. His treatment to this tale on human-horror, is perfectly creepy & also vast. Jeff Cronenweth's Cinematography is mesmerizing. Each & Every moment has been captured, impeccably. Kirk Baxter's Editing is razor-sharp. Original Score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is haunting. Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike are at their finest. Affleck is pitch-perfect as the man in question, delivering a performance that is raw & real. Pike, however, steals the show with an unforgettable turn. She's spell-bindingly chilling in her portrayal of an estranged wife. She is definitely up for an Oscar-Nomination next year! Carrie Coon is terrific. Neil Patrick Harris is exceptional, yet again. Tyler Perry adds some much needed comic relief in the intense proceedings. Kim Dickens is first-rate.Despite a running-time of over 145-minutes, 'Gone Girl' doesn't offer a single dull moment.

Well, that is it yet to be explored. Our topic of day, is the Mega-Budgeted, Hugely-Awaited Emmerich's '2012'.Now when you make film on a phenomenon like this, you better make a highly gripping & nail-biting fare... In terms of Graphics, '2012' is a all-rounder, but in terms of screenplay.... it has minuses written all over it.'2012' starts off really well... the first disaster sequence with John Cusack & family flying off in plane is a delight. It's one of the most gripping sequences ever in a movie. Unfortunately, right after that the film starts getting tedious. Even the climax in the ship doesn't create any impact. Well 'Africa' will love this movie for sure... you guys know what I mean! Another aspect that goes completely against the film is the track between The President & his daughter. It's just doesn't touch you, emotion is completely missing. This track could've easily been avoided.In a film like '2012' you don't expect much from the acting department, but here's a mention for John Cusack who delivers a sincere performance. He is the soul of the film. Others do what they supposed are to do, 'Scream'.on the whole... We {Humans} are anyways Ass Holes... so 12-21-12 isn't really a bad sentence for us!

'Peaceful Warrior' Synopsis: A chance encounter with an enlightened stranger changes the life of a college gymnast.'Peaceful Warrior', as a film, is meaningful & sensible. Kevin Bernhardt's Screenplay is well-written & offers moral. Victor Salva's Direction is, at best, sincere. To be brutally honest, the lead star is convincing but he can never reach or even come close to Nolte's performance. Nolte anchors the show with a performance, that remains with you even after the show has concluded. Nolte transports you to a world where magic exists, its beyond a performance of merit. On the whole, Nolte is the true Warrior of 'Peaceful Warrior'.",10,1,3,19 October 2012
P.S. I Love You," Why should I love it?
","I want to ask Richard LaGravenese, the director of this film a simple and straight question? What genre did he want to make in 'P.S I Love You'. Romance, Darma, Art-house or Bland Cinema. If Bland was his motive, then he sure has succeeded. 'P.S. I Love You' is as bland as it sounds. I mean, its a really good concept but unfortunately it turns out to a disappointment. Why drag a wafer-thin concept till you get exhausted? Why delivering unwanted scenes and why letting such a great idea go to waste. This film disappoints and how!Lets go with the pluses first: The film's idea is beautiful, A guy who dies in the first ten minutes of the movie, continues to be is protagonist. The films first hr is commendable and interesting. First-rate performance by Hilary Swank. Gerard Butler's cameo is fantastic. Lisa Kudrow is hilarious. Others are also good.Minuses: Why drag a wafer-thin concept? Why put the vacation track? What's Jeffery Dean Morgan's character? Why not adding Sex Scenes? 'P.S. I Love You' is a sheer disappointment. Thumbs Down!",3,0,0,21 March 2009

'A Quiet Place' Synopsis: A family is forced to live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound.John Krasinski is in very good form. The superb actor, who helmed the very underrated 'The Hollars' sometime back, returns to the director's chair with a superlative horror offering. Krasinski along-with Bryan Woods & Scott Beck, has penned a story that's actually more about family than fear/dread. While 'A Quiet Place' is a horror film, with fear as its trump card, the Writers here, add a tremendous heft of emotions. Watching the family of Abbott's trying to survive in a world where creatures destroy humans at the tip of a sound, is heartbreaking & heart-pounding. This is a brave horror film, that remains silent for most part & creates fear in its silence. While there is some repetition here that takes away some of its glory, there's still not denying its rock-solid merit.Krasinski's Direction, also, is top-notch. He directs a scary atmosphere with genuine dread & also uses silence as one of the aces of the film. 
Cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen is fantastic. Christopher Tellefsen's Editing is razor-crisp, culminating the film in 90-minutes. Art & Sound Design are marvelous. Graphics are superb. Costume Design adds authenticity to the intense proceedings.Performance-Wise: Emily Blunt & Krasinski excel. Blunt, one of the finest actresses of our times, expresses fear, grief & courage, with complexity & remarkable conviction. Krasinski is wonderfully restrained & portrays his part admirably. Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe are top-notch. On the whole, 'A Quiet Place' is a really good horror film, that is also affecting. Go, get spooked!",7,9,15,17 April 2018

Amadeus," A Masterpiece on the word Jealousy...
","Adapted from Peter Shaffer's stage play with the same name, Milo Forman's celluloid version of 'Amadeus' comes up as one of the finest Hollywood films ever.While watching 'Aamdeus' the only question going on in my mind, was that can films be so good and gripping? Can they be so so neat, that even it's 120 minutes running time seems like nothing. If your a REAL Cinema fan, then watching 'Amadeus' is not a must, but a rule for every Cinema lover. Loosely based on the lives of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart & Antonio Salieri, this tale of success, jealousy, death and guilt unfolds so well, that you truly hate Salieri for his demon side. The climax is simply spell-binding, with Salieri and Amadeus seeing each other eye to eye. The death of Amadeus, and the guilt that Saileri carries teaches you a lesson to never ever ruin someone's life for your own meanings.Performance Wise: F. Murray Abraham as Salieri deserved each and every bit of that Oscar he got. He's superb in his middle-age, but simply Fantastic in his old-age portions. Tom Hulce is excellent as Amadeus. Elizabeth Berridge looked so cute then, and her performance is natural to core. Note her expressions in Amadeus's death scene, you'll get goosebumps. A really young Cynthia Nixon delivers a first-rate performance as Amadeus's maid. Others are proficient.On the whole 'Amadeus' is a True Masterpiece from Hollywood.

The Game," A Well-Made Film!
","'The Game', directed by the legendary David Fincher, is A Well-Made Film, that grabs your attention, thanks to it's terrific story-line, that is innovative, escapist & yet, arresting. The only glitch, comes in it's culmination, which left me in mixed emotions.'The Game' tells the story of an investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.'The Game' begins fabulously and grabs your attention from the very start. The Writing, in the first-hour, especially, is so engrossing & captivating, that it hardly gives you a chance to move your eyes from the Screen. The second-hour is interesting as well, but I thought the culmination, was plain average. The Screenplay by John Brancato & Michael Ferris is very good, but they definitely could've come up with a better end. David Fincher directs this Psychological thriller, remarkably. His work, in each and every scene, is praise-worthy. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Art Design is passable.Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas pitches in an incredible performance.

Kick-Ass," Truly Kick-Ass...
","Superheroes, we love them don't we? Personally speaking, I worship the over-hyped power trons for their extra-ordinary un-real-ness. Batman has been my all-time favorite, no one touches his style and mannerisms. But the topic 'I' am talking about today, is about a set of self-made superheroes, who are strange/abusive/violent and majorly amusing. Pesto, let's enter the world of 'Kick-Ass'! Based on the comic book of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr, 'Kick-Ass' is truly a kick-ass film, that leaves you enthusiastic.

Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D'Amico, has trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante 'Hit-Girl'. It's a normal revenge story from one side, and 'I Will Stand Up For What's Right' from the other. Hahah, 'Kick-Ass' defies normal stuff, and makes it's superheroes as real as possible.'Kick-Ass' has the coolest super-kid! 'Hit Girl' is 'Kick-Ass', by all means. She is the most effective guard possible, and undoubtedly, a cult-personality in the film-dom. And... Red Mist is the worst superhero ever!! Matthew Vaughn has enjoyed making this film, and his love for his dream-project is visible from scene A to Z. Ben Davis's Cinematography is top-notch. The Editing is sleek. Stunts are 'Kick-Ass'!!In the acting department, Nicolas Cage steals the show. The Academy-Award Winner is incredible, and is truly missed after he leaves the scene. Aaron Johnson as the original 'Kick-Ass' is superb. Chloë Grace Moretz as my favorite 'Hit Girl' is fantastic. She lives her part from start to end. Mark Strong is quite good as the evil-head. Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist, is annoying. Clark Duke is likable. Lyndsy Fonseca is perfect.On the whole, 'Kick-Ass' rocks!

With the help of a young woman, he sets out to prove who he is.'Unknown' offers some terrific thrills. The twists & turns genuinely work. However, the culmination could've been more effective.

This is an honest love-story about a boy and a man, who can't help but fall in love with each other, despite never coming to the world of their sexuality. And the way Director Luca Guadagnino has shot its leading lovers, is something to watch. There is genuine heartache in its characters & also undeniable love. This is a love-story, that's sad but also heartfelt at times. James Ivory's Screenplay is expertly written, offering a story on love & longing, without ever indulging into melodrama. Luca Guadagnino's Direction is simplistic, but extremely effective. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Cinematography captures the passion of its leading lovers, with gusto.

The Hurt Locker," Over Rated!
","Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker' is is news... it has a buzz, it has an Oscar chance... it's an Incredible film! Really, not for me at least. 'The Hurt Locker' is a weak product with not much going for it.'The Hurt Locker' has been directed well, no second thoughts on that, but apart from that True fact... nothing works. Bigelow's direction works, but the screenplay by Mark Boal doesn't. It's anti-plotted film, with no-character having an aim. Some films are highly over-rated, which achieve cult status instantly, but over the years, when my review will read many IMDb users they will agree with my comment.Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is rustic. Editing by Chris Innis & Bob Murawski is good. Acting wise, Accomplished actors like Ralph Fiennes & Guy Pearce get terribly wasted. Jeremy Renner is okay.In my opinion, this over-rated flick deserves a watch only for Bigelow's superb direction.",4,5,12,21 January 2010
Sultan," Salman SOARS In This Engaging Film!
","After much hype & buzz, 'Sultan' has finally arrived. And oh boy, what a winner this is! This Ali Abbas Zafar flick is an engaging & entertaining film, that's as much a love-story as its a sports drama. And its a pleasure Watching India's Numero Uno Star SOAR! 'Sultan' Synopsis: Sultan Ali Khan (Salman) rises from being a nobody to becoming the world champion in the world of Wrestling. But everything comes at a price....'Sultan' has a familiar narrative, its the much-known story of the underdog. But, 'Sultan' doesn't settle within the rags to riches story, despite clichÃ©s. 'Sultan' is about a man, who rises form nowhere, becomes a hysteria, and then falls apart again, only to eventually triumph. What I particularly enjoyed here, was the engaging nature of its narrative, it may not be flawless, but its definitely arresting. While the first-hour takes us to our hero's past, where the romance cutely blossoms with the hero & the heroine (Anushka Sharma), its the second-hour when the film comes to its truest. You watch the hero beat down & come up right from the pit. 'Sultan' is film about wrestling, but not only the one done in the ring, but also about the one we fight in our lives. Its about the fight beyond the ropes & rounds.Ali Abbas Zafar's Screenplay & Direction, are very good. 'Sultan' finds Ali at his best & his unmemorable previous works, are now forgiven. His Writing follows a familiar narrative, but it doesn't fail to entertain or engage. And that's exactly why 'Sultan' works. Ali's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done, as he has handled the film well. Artur Zurawski's Cinematography is fantastic. The lens-man has captured all the emotions, with beauty. Editing is good, but could've been sharper. The only glitch in 'Sultan' is its running-time (169-minutes). Some trimming was needed. Vishal-Shekhar's Score is superb. Each & Every Track is in complete sync with the film & yet its melodious. Costume & Art Design are perfect. The Fight-Sequences (MMA) are competently choreographed & executed. Background Score merits a special mention.Performance-Wise: Salman SOARS as Sultan. The Superstar delivers one of his finest performances to date, offering a portrayal worth applauding. His performance is arresting & his physical transformation (from fat to fit), is indeed inspiring. 'Sultan' salutes Salman's charisma & he more than lives up-to the mark. Offering Salman wonderful support is Anushka Sharma, who's genuinely affecting as his long-suffering wife. Watch her breakdown in the pre-interval scene & that says it all. Even the Haryanvi Accent is perfectly done by both the leading performers. Amit Sadh sinks his teeth into the part & performs excellently. Randeep Hooda is ever-terrific. He ignites the screen with his portrayal as Salman's bad-ass coach. Anant Sharma is first-rate. Kumud Mishra is good. Abhishek Duhan leaves a mark in a brief role. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Sultan' is a winner! It may not offer a lot of novelty, but its undeniably entertaining. Go, Watch It!",7,16,30,6 July 2016

'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' Synopsis: Peter Parker runs the gauntlet as the mysterious company Oscorp sends up a slew of super-villains against him, impacting on his life.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is visually brilliant & the action set-pieces, are outstanding.

But overall, everything comes across as predictable & foreseeable. The narrative is very been-there-seen-that!Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & Jeff Pinkner's Screenplay is very okay, although a twist in the finale, does leave an impact. Marc Webb's Direction is dull. Graphics are top-class. Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, continues to deliver sincerely. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, looks gorgeous. Jamie Foxx as Electro/Max Dillon, delivers the best performance in the film. He's creepy & menacing. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn, hams. Sally Field as Aunt May, is dignified. Paul Giamatti as Rhino, appears in a tiny role.On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is far from amazing.",5,17,34,1 May 2014
Ex Machina," Original & Shocking!
","Alex Garland's 'Ex Machina' is an Original & Shocking Sci-Fi Thriller, that brings an all new twist to the genre it adapts.

Its pure genius.'Ex Machina' Synopsis: A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breath-taking female A.I.'Ex Machina' is claustrophobically engaging. The doomed atmosphere, coupled with its deliciously twisted narrative, keeps you hooked on the screen. The characters are effectively written & the interactions between the Androids & the Humans, holds tremendous appeal. I was confounded by their journey.Garland's Screenplay is a knock-out, adding up as a huge high in the Sci-Fi genre. The Writing is thoroughly engrossing & the finale, is absolutely mind-bending. Garland's Direction is strongly done. He has made a smashing debut as a storyteller with 'Ex Machina'. Rob Hardy's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic mood marvelously. Mark Day's Editing is good. Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow's Score is appropriate. Graphics are first-class.Performance-Wise: Oscar Isaac is mesmerizing.

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A Superb Entertainer...
","Chris Weitz directed 'New Moon' is a superb film, that turns out to be a memorable cine-going experience.'New Moon' is like a Batman, Superman flick... where logic needs to damned. A film that has Vampires, Werewolfs & Volturis as it's main characters. I didn't enjoy the first flick, but this one has impressed me.To state Robert Pattinson as a Superstar, would be like insulting the guy. I was stunned the way my younger sister, and the entire Cinema {which was filled with chicks} erupted when he entered the screen. The guy is a Youth Icon, and a fabulous actor. Kristen Stewart is impressive. Taylor Lautner is quite good. Michael Sheen stands out in a brief role.'New Moon' is a blockbuster entertainer.... watch it for Pattinson & Stewart!",7,2,10,11 December 2009
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Rab Ne Banayi Boring Jodi!
","Aditya Chopra's 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' is a disappointment. The films fails to keep you gripped , especially in the second hour. The film starts off really well, but fails in the second hour completely. The Aditya,Shahrukh combo fails this time. Though the movie fared well at the box office, but not a fan-favorite. Performances: Shahrukh is one my favorite actors, His performance as the simpleton is astounding, but he hams it up as the over-the-top fake Raj. Anushka Sharma is a cute face and has acted very well for her first film. Vnay Pathak is fantastic as SRK's friend. 'RNBDJ' is an average fare at best.",6,4,12,2 March 2009

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Strange, but well-made....
","David Fincher is a fantastic director... 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' proves that! But does the aging-backwards fare impress? The answer is, yes and no! The problem here, is the length and its unique treatment... every cine lover won't enjoy this one. Some will love it for its niche, while some will hate it for being a long-long biopic. Fincher brings the short-story to life beautifully with his epic direction... but script wise, the film has its loose ends. The tale of Benjamin Button leaves you curious as well. Final words,, watch this man's journey only if you're a die-hard fan of Brad Pitt and unique themes.Pluses of the film: Fincher's direction is outstanding. His Oscar-Nomination was meant to happen. Production value from all sides is A class. Performances are superb: Brad Pitt is fantastic as Ben Button. He plays his part with remarkable ease. Cate Blanchett is excellent.

'The Piano' has a terrific start, an okay middle, but a fascinating end. It's a film that has a lot of sex, it's a film that has it's heart at the right place. Campion won the Academy Award for Original Screenplay and she deserved it hands down! Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin deliver Incredible Performances. Hunter as a mute pianist proves her potential, despite winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in here, she has still remained as a underrated actress. It's sad to know that the industry doesn't offer her the roles she truly deserves. Anna Paquin, on the other hand, at the age of 11 won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She's a legend! In other performances, Harvey Keitel is wonderful. Sam Neill is superb, delivering one of the finest performances of his life.'The Piano' is a must see film. It's a film that has potential.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A film I'll remember all my life!
","Quentin Tarantino, according to me is the finest filmmaker of this generation. I am a huge, huge, huge, fan of his right from his Masterpiece 'Reservoir Dogs'. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is milestone of a film.Blame the Legend for making absurd & weird films, but no one can deny his astounding talent. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' has a plot that is as thin as paper, but the presentation & execution leaves you awe-struck. No it doesn't end... there's a second, but this one over-powers the latter.Be it the characters, be it the violence/gore or the wacky performances. In my eye, this is the Finest revenge-drama of this decade. A true Masterpiece! Tarantino is a legend of a filmmaker and there's not even a half percent doubt on it. He's just outstanding.The actors are superb: Uma Thurman is fantastic as the bride. Lucy Liu is classy. Late actor David Carradine is excellent as Bill. Daryl Hannah is first-rate as the one eye-patched B'''H. Michael Madsen stands out. Others are perfect. And ya, 'Bang Bang' is one of the finest songs ever!'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is outstanding work of cinema. Two Big Thumbs Up!",9,1,3,27 September 2009
Jerry Maguire," Fun!

'Show Me The Money' echos throughout the film, even when the characters weep in sadness.'Jerry Maguire' is a yet another story, that can be termed as a 'Rags To Riches' kinda satire. Over-here, 'Jerry Maguire', The Hero loses everything, but eventually gets his job right. Failure shatters him, but success enlightens him.Cameron Crowe's Screenplay packs in tremendous characters, each one stands out. His writing is sharp at most places, and the connect with it's hero remains intact. His direction is splendid almost throughout. The only shortcoming, is it's running time. 139 minutes seems a bit too far-fetched. If 15-20 minutes shorter, the flick would have been an ideal 10/10 fare. Nonetheless, Crowe has done his job right.With such tremendous characters in hand, the performances were bound to be memorable. Tom Cruise is superb as 'Jerry Maguire'. He lives his character in each and every frame. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is absolutely legendary in a supporting role. Renée Zellweger is excellent, while Regina King is spontaneous. Beau Bridges, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr & Bonnie Hunt lend very good support.On the whole, do check this one out, as it offers entertainment and proficient performances.

Clash of the Titans," A disappointment...
","A remake of the 1981 film of the same name, itself loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus, 'Clash Of The Titans' is a dull fare. 3-D has never been so pointless before! 'Clash Of The Titans' has a tepid start, a fair second, but a bland end spoils the fun. Louis Leterrier's direction relies on CGI completely. Cinematography by Peter Menzies, Jr. is the mainstay of the film, he's done a mind-blowing job.In the acting department, Sam Worthington is okay. Liam Neeson is wasted.

I saw myself laughing at the situations, what if in a second viewing. The Screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin & Todd Phillips crosses the boundaries. Its abusive, rude, graphic & offensive, but thats what 'The Hangover' movies are known for. Todd Phillips's Direction is mediocre.Performance-Wise: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms & Zach Galifianakis are back & they are utterly amazing, once again.

Silence," Scorsese's Brutal & Thought-Provoking Passion Project Is A Must See!
","A long-time passion project for Martin Scorsese, which he developed for over 26 years, 'Silence' has finally come alive. And to its fortune, Scorsese delivers one of the most powerful films ever based on Faith, Humanity & God Itself. This is a Brutal & Thought-Provoking Film, that questions our existence & the religious beliefs we're surrounded by.'Silence' Synopsis: Two priests travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor and propagate Catholicism. While there, they are faced by severe protest & torture. 'Silence' left me disturbed & thought provoked. Scorsese delivers such a brutal tale of people driven by faith & later being tortured for their beliefs. The Japanese torture & brutalize the Christians as they try to propagate Catholicism. To be honest, you need a very strong stomach to absorb 'Silence', its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. The goings-on are very intense & at times, brutal.Scorsese doesn't shy away from showing what has to be shown. This tale of faith & the violent prosecution that follows, is told with relentlessness. And by the time you reach its final-act, where a shocking twist unfolds though an character, you're bound to be shocked. 'Silence' truly questions humanity & how faith can be questioned too. And above all, it questions God with pain & sorrow. Scorsese's Direction is remarkable. He brings his passion to life with gut-wrenching intensity. Without a shed of doubt, 'Silence' finds him at his peak! Jay Cocks & Scorsese's Screenplay, Based upon the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. is frightening, but arresting all through.

Logan," Brutal & Brilliant!
","The third and final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013), 'Logan' is the darkest & also THE most brutal X-Men film to date. Director James Mangold & Lead-Star Hugh Jackman returning for one last time as Logan/Wolverine, deliver a superhero film, that's Super in its truest sense. The one's an emotional, gruesome, gritty & powerful film, that holds your attention, despite excessive violence. Faint-Hearts please stay away, but those who relish Hardcore stuff, Grab A Ticket Now!'Logan' Synopsis: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.'Logan' explores very less of Wolverine's journey, its all about Logan this time. 'Logan' is a character study of a superhero finally off his prime & facing enemies who are stronger than him. Even his life may end, for someone to whom immorality was certain. And that's exactly why 'Logan' works so hugely. The narrative is about Logan's constant fight to survive as well protect his mentor & a young mutant, who's on the run. The villains are ruthless & Logan's fight against them, is clap-worthy.The Violence is too much though. I'm not complaining here, I mean a superhero with claws so sharp can't be projected with fake juicy blood, but the bloodshed here is rather disturbing. Whenever there is action up on screen, its brutal & unforgiving. The finale, particularly, is no-holds-barred. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you, dear faint-hearts! The biggest triumph of 'Logan' is its emotional connect. Logan & the young mutant girl, share a wonderful relationship here, as does Profresser Xavier. The connect among them, despite all the brutality around, forms 'Logan' in its entirety. I was engrossed & even concerned about Logan & Co. here, I was connected with them & was rooting for them when they fought the evil-heads.Scott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green's Screenplay is intense & engaging. Its all-out brutality, with strong emotional undercurrents. The Writing, though predictable at times, is thoroughly arresting. Mangold's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with authority. Cinematography & Editing are very good. Action-Sequences/Stunts are spectacular & pushes the 'R Rating' with force. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Graphics are top-class. Background Score & Make-Up, merit a special mention.Performance-Wise: Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/ Wolverine for one last time & he's in terrific form. Right form his broken body-language, to the aggression he expresses when the claws are out & to the softness he emotes when building a connection with the little girl, Jackman brings fabulous layers to his portrayal. This is the best performance Jackman has delivered being Logan/Wolverine. Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, is remarkable. The Screen Legend adds tremendous depth to the part & shines in every scene he appears in. Dafne Keen as Laura, is a surprise packet. She's electrifying! Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, is menacing to the core. And is it ironic that the chief villain here is named Donald?? Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gabriella, does well in a brief role. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Logan' is Brutal & Brilliant! Two Thumbs Up!",9,8,17,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Major Disappointment!
","If disappointment had lost a literal definition, it would be 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes. Despite the best of graphics & stars in hand, this summer bigger suffers from a stilted narrative.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Synopsis: When Tony Stark tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has only one saving grace & that's its graphics. The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works. On the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance.",5,57,118,24 April 2015

Elysium," Ambitious but Deeply Flawed!
","'Elysium' is Ambitious but Deeply Flawed! It does have some striking moments, pumping action & an earnest performance by Matt Damon working on its advantage, but the screenplay, from start to end, is average.'Elysium' Synopsis: In the year 2154, the very wealthy live on a man-made space station while the rest of the population resides on a ruined Earth. A man takes on a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds.'Elysium' has a tepid first-hour, but a fairly okay second.

Action-Sequences are excellent. Even the graphics are equally superior. Cinematography & Editing are sharp.Performance-Wise: Matt Damon shines. He plays the protagonist earnestly. Jodie Foster is fair. Sharlto Copley is strictly okay. William Fichtner is hardly there.On the whole, 'Elysium' appeals in parts.",5,1,2,16 December 2013

Alice in Wonderland," Average Fare...
","This Legendary Filmmaker has made remarkable films in the past, to name One or Two would be injustice, he's made great films throughout his career. I being a Tim Burton fan from childhood was super-super-excited about 'Alice In Wonderland'. Unfortunately, this ranks amongst Burton's weakest effort to date. 'Alice In Wonderland' is boring, it lacks the pace. Plus, why making this a 3-D flick, it would've been much more better minus that. The film has an boring start, an okay middle & an ordinary end. The cult cartoon doesn't get it's due here. It's shocking to know that a guy like Tim Burton made such ordinary stuff. His body of work has got a lot of gold medals, but 'Alice In Wonderland' is no-where a gold-medal type effort. The Graphics are good, but now we're tired of appreciating Graphics again and again. 'Avatar' had a the best of visuals and script. This one lacks a solid script, which is it's biggest flaw. Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp delivers a dynamic performance. He gives The Mad Hatter a different style altogether. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the Red Queen. Mila as Alice does a fair job. Anne Hathaway is wasted. 'Alice In Wonderland' is at best an average effort. This one's a colossal disappointment from one of the finest filmmakers of Cinema!",4,3,8,12 March 2010
Avatar," James Cameron - The True Legend Of Cinema!

A Visual Delight!'Avatar' is an Outstanding film, I have never enjoyed a film so so so much. Cameron takes you in the world of Pandora, he takes you to the roots, he sucks you into this filmy world completely. 'Avatar' even shows the selfish side of us, 'Human Beings', how far can we go for our needs. Cameron's supremacy returns, it's been 12 years, agreed... so what, he gives a film that we'll remember forever! 'Avatar' cannot be missed by anyone, and I mean anyone!! Performance wise, Sam Worthington is superb as Jake Sully, playing his part with great understanding. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, though she's an animation throughout, she has dubbed beautifully. Sigourney Weaver is first-rate as usual. Stephen Lang is fabulous as the conniving bad-man. Giovanni Ribisi is superb in a brief role. Michelle Rodriguez is in form after a long, long time. She excels. Joel Moore as Norm is likable. Others, the rest of Na'vi are perfect.James Cameron's 'Avatar' is a film that shines, with a rare aura. Go visit Pandora right now!

Selma," Honest, but ordinarily treated!
","Ava DuVernay's 'Selma' is an honest film, about a significant chapter in American History, but the tone as well as the execution is so ordinarily done, that it doesn't throw you in the power you might expect. It has its share of pluses, but overall, it has a very thin vibe, which adds up as a minus.'Selma' Synopsis: A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.Late/Great Dr.King's journey to secure equal voting rights, was nothing short of astonishing. He emerged victorious & made a breakthrough for all his people. And 'Selma', without a shed of doubt, is a earnest attempt to re-tell his story.But, as I mentioned before, the treatment is plain ordinary. Be it sequences of those violent epic marches or moments of Dr.King's personal life, they all look as if they were shot with less enthusiasm.Paul Webb's Screenplay is good, but not gut-wrenching. Ava DuVernay's Direction is impressive, but only in parts. Cinematography & Editing are sharp. Score by Jason Moran is passable.Performance-Wise: David Oyelowo as Dr.King, delivers a committed performance. He embodies the American legend & enacts the part with gusto. He's the best thing about 'Selma', hands down! Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson, is over-the-top. Tim Roth as George Wallace, is limited to a few scenes. Common as James Beve, is fair. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, is very good. Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, is wasted. Martin Sheen as Frank Minis Johnson & Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Fred Gray, leave a mark.On the whole, 'Selma' isn't bad, but it isn't great either. One expected much more!",6,7,15,13 January 2015
The Artist," A Well-Made Silent Film!
","'The Artist' is A Well-Made Silent Film in all respects. Writer-Director Michel Hazanavicius's look back to the glorious days of film-making, seen through the eyes of it's protagonist, comes across as a brave attempt.'The Artist' Synopsis: In Hollywood, 1927, As silent movie star George Valentin wonders if the arrival of talking pictures will cause him to fade into oblivion, he sparks with Peppy Miller, a young dancer set for a big break.'The Artist' has gained unanimous critical acclaim as well as numerous awards. However, I do feel, that despite true merits, the reason why 'The Artist' works primarily, is because it's a Silent Film, rather than it being a Path-Breaking film. Michel Hazanavicius's Screenplay is brave & well-done, but in the second-hour, it falls into the clichés, that are honestly speaking, beaten to death. The entire Journey of it's Protagonist's ups & downs, doesn't offer any novelty. I truly feel, that the Screenplay could've been stronger in the second-hour.Michel Hazanavicius's Direction, on the other-hand, is beautiful. Here's a storyteller who had the guts to make a Silent film, in an era where Silent films are extinct. His vision, though clichéd after a point, deserves brownie points nonetheless.Cinematogrpahy by Guillaume Schiffman, is stunning. Editing by Anne-Sophie Bion & Michel Hazanavicius himself, is decent. Art & Coustume Design, are great. Music by Ludovic Bource is good. Performance-Wise: Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, delivers a performance that is very-well maintained. He doesn't make George Valentin a caricature, which is the best aspect of his performance. Bérénice Bejo as Peppy Miller, is very charming. Uggie, The Dog, is lovable. John Goodman plays a filmmaker of the 20's with superb energy. James Cromwell is adequate. Penelope Ann Miller does well.On the whole, Even though it does, I'm not going to dare to call 'The Artist' a disappointment.",7,0,2,29 January 2012

Invictus," A Gem...
","Clint Eastwood brings us 'Invictus', a inspiring true story. Based on events in South Africa before and durning the 1995 Rugby World Cop, hosted in the country following the dismantling of apartheid.

It's so fascinating to see someone reach it's goal with success, so much of belief and intelligence. Your gripped, moved and inspired in those 132 minutes.

'Mission: Impossible' follows agent Ethan Hunt, and his mission to uncover the mole within the CIA who has framed him for the murders of his entire IMF team. 'Mission: Impossible' begins well and only gathers it's momentum in the process. Being an Action-Thriller, this Box-Office Blockbuster, offers the correct amount of thrills & chills.

La La Land," An Imperfect Gem!
","Damien Chazelle's 'La La Land' is made with pure ambition & genuine skill. A Romantic-Comedy Drama packaged as a Musical, this recent Oscar Frontrunner is a dazzling watch. However, Despite its luscious beauty & an extraordinary performance by Emma Stone, the film is somehow fumbles in its later half, that takes away its glory to some part. But, a small glitch doesn't shun away its undeniable merits!'La La Land' Synopsis: A jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) falls for an aspiring actress (Emma Stone, at her best) in Los Angeles.'La La Land' is a love-story, that has some of the most beautifully choreographed musical numbers in years. Each & Every song is exquisite & a treat for the eyes. I was awed by the detailing & the overall presentation. Hats off to the team!And Chazelle's world works, even when its not being a musical. Yes, the love-story between its leading characters is warm & believable. You watch & later explore these two people in love & how their dreams come their ways. 'La La Land' is a love-story for sure, but it also indulges in themes like life itself & how dreams cannot be compromised, even when they damage relationships, at times. Chazelle treats the narrative with realism all through the first-hour.And that's exactly why the second-hour underwhelms. The addition of a sub-plot (featuring John Legend, who offers Gosling to play with him), is clichéd & seems out of place for a film, that so beautifully mounts itself on such magic in the first-hour. Chazelle's Screenplay takes risks & adds extravagant musical numbers & drama, & makes them come together, but he seems to have given in to clichés & a lackluster middle-point. I wasn't impressed by the sub-plot nor by the difference of opinion the couple get into there after. Chazelle's Screenplay picks up again & the culmination is affecting. How I wish he dared to add something more, rather than adding a turn, we've experienced an umpteen number of times in such stories.Chazelle's Direction is fantastic & there's no doubt on that. While his Writing lacks perfection, his Direction is superior at all times. 'La La Land' is a visual spectacle with soul & Chazelle's true skill as a storyteller, comes to the front. Surely some Oscar calling awaits him!Linus Sandgren's Cinematography is top-class. Tom Cross's Editing is terrific. Justin Hurwitz's Score is enchanting. 'La La Land' is a true musical ride, as the songs here are chart-busters! Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Emma Stone owns 'La La Land', with a career-best performance. Stone, fearless & relentless, emerges a big winner here, delivering a performance that comes straight from the heart. She beautifully conveys her dreams of being an actress, who sadly hasn't gotten a chance to shine & how truly she falls for a man. Stone is faultless & may I say, that she has never looked this gorgeous before. Ryan Gosling, on the other-hand, is nicely understated as the jazz musician, who'd never let his passion be bygone, even though its nearly dead. Gosling expresses with ease & his approach to love, is real. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Stone & Gosling, is infectious! A special mention for J. K. Simmons & Rosemarie DeWitt, who shine in brief roles.On the whole, 'La La Land' doesn't utilize its potential entirely, but its still a solid effort that shouldn't be missed. Its definitely among the better films we've seen this year & this film deserves to be experienced in the cinemas (I saw it at IMAX & it only heightened the impact). NO where else.And, I miss you Los Angeles! See you soon!",8,1,10,10 December 2016
The Last Samurai," A Terrific Film!
","'The Last Samurai' is A Terrific Film, in all respects. The Writing Material is superior, the Direction is spell-binding, the Cinematography is stunning & the Performances are top-notch. Only thing? The film is too lengthy. Some trimming would have only enhanced it's overall impact.'The Last Samurai' stars Tom Cruise in the role of American soldier Nathan Algren, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with Samurai Warriors in the wake of the Meiji Restoration in the Empire of Japan in 1876 and 1877. An Emotional & Engaging Epic-Drama, 'The Last Samurai' is a crispy flick, that is worth your time. The film succeeds by holding your attention at most times, and has the potential to strike a fan-base all through it's legacy. Edward Zwick is in top-form this time around. He directs this story, spell-bindingly. The Screenplay by Zwick, John Logan & Marshall Herskovitz, is superior. Cinematography by John Toll, is Stunning. Editing by Victor Du Bois & Steven Rosenblum, is good. However, the film definitely could've been trimmed, by at least 15-20 minutes. I feel, if slightly shorter in terms of length, it's overall impact, would have only enhanced. Music by Hans Zimmer is impressive. Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise is fantastic as American soldier Nathan Algren. The talented actor delivers a performance, that is easily amongst his finest to date. Ken Watanabe, in an Oscar-Nominated performance, is bombastic. Koyuki is wonderfully restrained. Shin Koyamada does well. Masato Harada, Billy Connolly & Timothy Spall are passable. Others lend good support. On the whole, A Film, That Is Worth Your Time!",8,1,2,31 August 2011

You may call him a traitor for leaking information related to the Government, but what he saw & uncovered, couldn't have been kept as a secret. He thought about the people & although not all may respect that, its definitely a move instigated by circumstances & a sense of concern.And 'Snowden' is strongly structured film that captures his turbulent journey. Stone & Kieran Fitzgerald's Screenplay is consistently engaging & the pace never drops. Its to the point! And Stone directs the film with his usual force, keeping the narrative engrossing as well as alarming. You're with Snowden as his uncovers a shocking truth & you stay with him till the end.

It would've been so difficult & challenging for him.A Special Mention for Malcolm McDowell, who's performance as Alex, a charismatic, psychopathic, is SADISTIC & UNFORGETTABLE.

The Fly," You Have To Watch This Film, at any cost!
","I don't know how the 1958 version was mastered, all I can say is that, 'The Fly' is creepy film, quite an xperience actually. So the question I have been asking myself after renting this film, is that, 'Was It Worth It' or 'It Wasn't'? 'The Fly' to me as a hardcore Cinema-Fan is a mystery, sure it did impress me... but as soon as the film ended, I was unable to give out the verdict to myself, it's a haunted 1986 horror fleshed cult classic. My summary is my ecstatic expression by saying, You Have To Watch This Film, at any cost!While I am yet to elaborate with the script and the direction, I can easily talk about the acting.

Love & Mercy," Average!
","Based on the life of musician-songwriter Brian Wilson, co-founder of the Beach Boys, 'Love & Mercy' is strictly an average biopic, that never becomes too arresting to be called a knockout on the legend its based upon.'Love & Mercy' Synopsis: n the 1960s, Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson struggles with emerging psychosis as he attempts to craft his avant-garde pop masterpiece. In the 1980s, he is a broken, confused man under the 24-hour watch of shady therapist Dr. Eugene Landy.'Love & Mercy' suffers from erratic Writing. I liked past & future angle, its not like I didn't. But, the final half-hour, especially, the penultimate moments, lack the fizz. I wasn't emotionally engaged nor was I blown away by drama. At best, Michael Alan Lerner & Oren Moverman's Screenplay works in very limited doses. It needed to be stronger, no two options on that!Bill Pohlad's Direction is alright. Coming right away to the performances, John Cusack & Paul Dano enact Wilson, differently, but engrossingly. Dano enacts the younger version, adding uneasy youthfulness to the part, while Cusack, on the other-hand, enacts a more troubled version of Wilson, but the under-rated actor nails every nuance. Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter, is splendid & remains in character throughout. Paul Giamatti as Dr. Eugene Landy, is perfectly menacing as the doctor from hell.On the whole, 'Love & Mercy' could've been better.",5,3,5,31 December 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," Average...
","'How To Train Your Dragon' is an average fare. Though most of the people loved it and made a super-hit , I personally believe, this animation flick lacks a solid script.'How To Train Your Dragon' is set in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it.The idea is interesting, and the animation is heavenly. Where this flick falters, is it's writing, which is too predictable after a point. The final 40-minutes are been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff. It had the potential of becoming a terrific film, but for me, it came out as an average watch.The characters are wonderfully voiced. Jay Baruchel in the lead role, brings in various emotions to his character, while Gerard Butler, voices wonderfully as the lead Viking.On the whole, I have grown up watching Masterstorkes like 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty And The Beast' , I carry loads of expectations from Cartoon-Animated Cinema, and so why, I was disappointed by this one, thanks to the predictable script. Watch it if you must!",4,6,38,6 November 2010
Total Recall," Only If You Can Digest It!
","Paul Verhoeven's Box-Office Winner 'Total Recall' is a Weird, Interesting, Gruesome & at times, Confusing film, that can be viewed only by those who can digest 'Gore' in cinema. However, I had some fun while viewing this Sci-Fi flick.'Total Recall' tells the story of an apparently unsophisticated construction worker, Doug Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is either a patient for a failed memory implant procedure or a freedom fighter from Mars relocated to Earth. He attempts to restore order and reverse the corrupt influence of commercial powers, all while faced with the possibility that none of these events are real and pursuing them could damage his brain.An interesting idea, but Verhoeven's take on it is simply weird. His take on Mars and how it would look if humans lived there, are unique and beyond imagination. There is a particular character of a prostitute, located in Mars, who offers a set of 3 breasts! Now, excuse me, but there is a character like that in here, and even gets enough time to hook your memory. Moving on, The Writing is solid at places, but goes confusing at times. Cinematography by Jost Vacano is perfect. Editing is fair.Acting-Wise: Arnold Schwarzenegger is superb. In fact, he gets it right from start to end. Rachel Ticotin is decent, while Sharon Stone comes across as mysterious. Ronny Cox is effective as the main antagonist. Michael Ironside is earnest. Ray Baker & Mel Johnson, Jr. are ordinary.On the whole, I had some fun, but I didn't have a complete blast. I'd say, to those who don't mind such gore on celluloid, should check it out once.",6,1,3,23 April 2011

Shine," Geoffrey Rush - An Acting Legend!
","Geoffrey Rush's performance in the biopic 'Shine' is one of those Shining Cinematic moments that pack in happiness, un-seen talent and respect. Based on the life of pianist David Helfgott, who, suffered a mental breakdown and spent years in institutions comes to life with Rush's most urgent performance to date.'Shine' as a film, is a notch above the ordinary. Some biopics are fascinating, but 'Shine' is fascinating and memorable only because of Geoffery Rush! Nonetheless, it's a well-made film.I don't have much left to write about the film, and if I start writing about Rush.. then this review might not even end. Rush's performance will go down as one of those rare performances, that would haunt actors and wanna-be actors for a long, long time! Those 10 stars for Geoffery Rush only!",10,2,3,26 May 2010

From start to finish, this unforgiving tale of war & violence, unfolds masterfully. The tense narrative is magnificently handled, although the unsettling gruesome violence, may put you off completely. You need a really strong stomach to absorb 'Sicario'. Its a relentless story, that doesn't get subtle at any given time.Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is hardcore, no-holds-barred. It progresses engrossingly & you're invested in its characters, throughout. The twist & turns are cleverly thrown in & the intensity level remains high. The Writing doesn't falter, EVER! Denis Villeneuve's Direction is fantastic. 'Sicario' finds him at his darkest, yet finest hour. The way he has handled this traumatic tale, deserves distinction marks. Roger Deakins's Cinematography is legendary. Seriously, how good can this Lensman get? Joe Walker's Editing is flawlessly done. J贸hann J贸hannsson's Score is haunting. Action-Sequences are gruesome, but effectively executed. Performance-Wise: Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro & Josh Brolin take 'Sicario' to an even higher level of greatness, by their performances. Blunt is absolutely stunning in her portrayal. She's affecting & real. del Toro is astonishing. The amount of power he brings to his part, is something to be seen. And Brolin is first-rate, creating a man that's easy to believe, but impossible to like. On the whole, 'Sicario' is truly terrific. Two Big Thumbs Up!",10,1,7,10 October 2015
Pretty Woman," One Of The Best Ever....

Jack Reacher," Fair!
","An adaptation of Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot, 'Jack Reacher' is Fair! A watchable, but deeply flawed action-thriller, that sums up best as a one-time watch.'Jack Reacher' Synopsis: A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.'Jack Reacher' is sluggishly paced & ordinarily executed. Sure, some sequences in the first-hour are stunning, but they are limited. Christopher McQuarrie's Screenplay is inconsistent. At times, super, at times, dull. Overall, a much stronger screenplay was needed! McQuarrie's Directon, on the other-hand, is well-done. Cinematography & Editing are standard.Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise is excellent as Jack Reacher. He keeps the show alive with his act! Rosamund Pike is restrained. Richard Jenkins & Robert Duvall are perfect. On the whole, 'Jack Reacher' is thrilling, but only in parts.",5,1,4,30 January 2014

The Shape of Water," Sally Hawkins engrosses in del Toro's Ambitious yet Predictable Fantasy Drama!
","Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is visually dazzling & impeccably acted by Sally Hawkins. And sadly enough, its also predictable. While there is much to admire here, especially its technical aspects, its also a bit underwhelming how one can predict the entire film ahead. But del Toro is in form here and that enough makes up for its flaws.'The Shape of Water' synopsis: In a 1960s research facility, a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a relationship with an aquatic creature (Doug Jones).'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's love letter to cinema, as he said, so there is a beautiful Broadway dance here, along-with a love-story that tugs your heartstrings. There is genuine romance here between the mute woman & the aquatic creature. del Toro makes sure he keeps the narrative like a fantasy & the beauty remains intact in its characters & in the water.On the downside, is a tiresomely one-note villain, played by Michael Shannon, the wicked Colonel who tortures the Creature, even after he gets two of his fingers ripped apart. The antagonist is predictably a racist & misogynist, who only lives by orders & has no heart to speak of. del Toro tries to make Shannon's bad-guy human, but he barely remains anything but a regular villain in a film where you're suppose to be on the creature's side. And it doesn't help that Shannon, an otherwise brilliant actor, goes over-the-top.Another minus in this beautiful looking motion-picture, is the predictable story-line. You know where this is headed right from the word GO. And while some of it is genuinely interesting & offers heart, there is no denying its clichÃ©d form. And the strong violence puts you off after a point.And despite the minuses that cannot be overlooked, the pluses still remain unmistakably powerful. del Toro's Direction is dreamlike & takes us into its world of picturesque beauty & gruesome violence. del Toro is in his element here & proves once again that he's among the most passionate filmmakers of our times, despite none of his films being perfect. Dan Laustse's Magnificent Cinematography, Alexandre Desplat's enchanting Score, Sidney Wolinsky's nicely done Editing, along-with extraordinary work on the Art & Costume Design, only add to the narrative's merits.Performance-Wise: Sally Hawkins is engrossing in her portrayal of the mute protagonist, who falls in love with a creature. Hawkins is pure heart & soul, fleshed out in a sublime performance. Hawkins leads 'The Shape of Water' with her astounding performance. Expect strong Oscar chase! Of the rest of the cast, Doug Jones does a splendid job as the creature. Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor, as always, is perfect. Octavia Spencer raises the best laughs as Hawkins' co-worker & friend, while Michael Stuhlbarg excels as a doctor who believes in freeing the creature from the sadists around him. On the whole, 'The Shape of Water' isn't perfect, but there's no denying its beauty or its strong leading woman.",6,4,9,11 December 2017
The Untouchables," An Entertaining Film!
","Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables' is An Entertaining Film, that offers some really gripping moments. The film also boasts some well-crafted performances, that only play as a advantage.'The Untouchables' is an autobiographical account on the efforts to bring justice during the Prohibition era. It's a Violent/Gruesome Battle between the Good and the Evil.David Mamet's Adapted Screenplay offers some truly gripping moments. But, I'd like to point out, that, Bobby De Niro's character, who plays the main antagonist here, gets very limited scope. He is reduced into a tiny role, and thus, the impact of a menace is missing. An important character such as this, deserved more footage.Brain De Palma's direction is stylish. Cinematography is absolutely perfect. The Action-Sequences are superb. Editing is fine.Performance-Wise: Kevin Costner is excellent. He holds the film. Bobby De Niro doesn't get much scope. Sean Connery shines in an Oscar-winning role, while Andy García is effective. Charles Martin Smith does well. Patricia Clarkson is impressive in a brief role. Others offer good support.On the whole, A Memorable Action Crime-Drama. Check it out.",7,1,2,7 April 2011

","'The Godfather: Part III' is An Under-Rated Masterpiece! A Terrificly Written, Wonderfully Directed & Outstandingly Acted, Motion-Picture, that has not gotten the respect it truly deserves. Is it better than it's Legendary Prequels? No, but it's still a Great Watch. 'The Godfather: Part III' Synopsis: In the midst of trying to legitimize his business dealings in 1979 New York and Italy, aging mafia don Michael Corleone seeks to vow for his sins while taking a young protégé under his wing.In comparison to it's Prequels, the third installment, isn't all that meaty or heavy. BUT, It's still a Masterpiece! It gives a proper end to the legend of Michael Corleone. It culminates beautifully. Mario Puzo & Francis Ford Coppola's Screenplay is Terrific & matches up-to the expectations. Also, it gives a proper end to it's Powerful Protaganiost. Coppola's Direction, is Wonderful. Cinematography by Gordon Willis, is sharp. Editing, Art Design & Sound-Mixing, are impressive.Performance-Wise: Al Pacino is GODLY as an aging Michael Corleone.

Andy Garcia is excellent. Diane Keaton gets it right. Sofia Coppola is passable, while Talia Shire is amazing. Eli Wallach is first-rate. George Hamilton & Joe Mantegna leave a mark.

The Disaster Artist," James Franco SOARS as Tommy Wiseau in this Hilarious & Affecting Comedy!
","Tommy Wiseau's 2003 cult film 'The Room' is widely considered to be the worst film of all-time by too many, although I accept I haven't dared to watch the film yet. I did see the trailer though in anticipation for 'The Disaster Artist'. And oh boy, the trailer itself made it clear to me how big a dud it is.But Director-Producer-Actor James Franco takes inspiration from that super-dud movie & turns it into a behind-the-scenes look at 'The Room', and delivers his best film to date. Franco goes all-out in his portrayal of Wiseau, pitching in one of the year's best performances, that redefines comedic idiocracy to an all new level. Franco is a force of nature & portrays a terrible actor, with terrific timing. 'The Disaster Artist' is all kinds of amusing & ridiculous, but its never out of heart or genuine feeling. I LOVED IT!'The Disaster Artist' Synopsis: When Greg Sestero (Dave Franco, in good from), an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true.'The Disaster Artist', above all, is a story about dreams & ambition. Wiseau may never become the artist he thought he'd become, but he did make a movie & gained a cult-following, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. 'The Disaster Artist' explores Wiseau's unrealistically abysmal vision & what went behind the making of his dream project 'The Room', and turns it into an unexpected story on living your dream. Franco keeps the proceedings hilariously over-the-top & captures Wiseau's absurdity with the perfect blend of madness & ambition. With several laugh-out-loud moments & a few really affecting ones, Franco churns out 'The Disaster Artist' with astonishing success.Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber's Screenplay, which is based on the non-fiction book The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Film Ever Made by Greg Sestero & Tom Bissell, is splendid. The humorous tone is fabulously maintained & the sequences that follow one after the other, deliver big laughs, but its the relationship between Wiseau & Sestero, that is the emotional core of the film. Watching two men, one way crazier than the other, chase their dreams & believing in each other despite facing repeated rejection, is heartfelt & relatable. Franco's Direction is excellent. He's handled this comedy proficiently. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design deserve a special mention. Make-Up, also, is very well-done.Performance-Wise: Franco's turn as Wiseau, is a Tour-De-Force. Right from his accent (which Wiseau proclaims to be from New Orleans, but sounds nothing like it), to the restlessness in his body-language, to delivering the worst performance as 'Johnny' in 'The Room', Franco SOARS. This is his finest performance to date, that truly deserves Oscar-Attention. Go, get it Franco! Of the rest of the cast, Dave Franco does a good job as Sestero. Alison Brie is extremely charming as Sestero's girlfriend. Seth Rogen as the script supervisor is first-rate. Josh Hutcherson, Ari Graynor, Jacki Weaver, Zac Efron & June Diane Raphael, all who appear as actors in 'The Room', are hilarious to watch. Sharon Stone & Melanie Griffith appear in fun cameos.On the whole, 'The Disaster Artist' is anything but a disaster. This Comedy based on the Worst Film, is actually among 2017's best films! Don't Miss It.And...Oh, Haai, Mark!",9,2,10,5 December 2017

Zombieland," The Best Zombie Flick Till Date...
","Ruben Fleischer's Masterpiece 'Zombieland' is undoubtedly the Best Zombie Flick Till Date! I don't remember being so, so ,so entertained in a film! Paul Wernick Rhett Reese, the writers of 'Zombieland' are geniuses! The word Zombie petrifies people, but in 'Zombieland' they try their best, but our Hero Tallahassee played by America's first cult star Woody Harrelson beats them to death. 'Zombieland' is funny, brutal, gory, & clap-trap. The climax at a theme park, is full-on.... one of the best climaxes ever! Coming to acting, Woody Harrelson is my favorite actor, right now. De Niro, Pacino, Michael Keaton, Jim Carrey, Dustin Hoffman, Tim Robbins & now Woody Harrelson. His outstanding portrayal proves what he is! Jesse Eisenberg acts & narrates wonderfully. Emma Stone looks a million bucks, and performers, as expected, superbly. Abigail Breslin is just getting better & better with every release. An Icredible Performer! Bill Murray stands out in a brief role.'Zombieland' rocks...... Reccmended for all!",9,0,0,29 January 2010
A Beautiful Mind," A Remarkable Film!
","The Only Thing Greater Than the Power of the Mind is the Courage of the Heart, says 'A Beautiful Mind'. Ron Howard is a legendary storyteller, no two options on that! But his work of performance in 'A Beautiful Mind' takes him to a place only a Cinema-Fanatic can merely imagine!Based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel Laureate in Economics, 'A Beautiful Mind' unfolds wonderfully. Some lives are worth hearing about, talking about, and Mr.John Nash is one those very-few gifted people, who prove the evil within us wrong. A Legendary Man, his ups and downs, his strengths and weaknesses come alive in 'A Beautiful Mind'. In my opinion, There are some films that entertain, There are some films that enlighten & There are some films that simply motivate. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a rare combination of all the three genres mentioned above! Mr.Howard won each and every award possible for his work-here, and that isn't a surprise at all. As mentioned above, this film takes this Genius to a level only a few people make it to. Akiva Goldsman's adapted screenplay is marvelous. Roger Deakins Cinematography is awesome. Music by James Horner, is excellent.In the acting department, Russell Crowe is fantastic as Mr.John Nash. The star/actor sinks his teeth into the part and delivers a performance that can silence even his worst critics. To state this as his finest work, would truly be an understatement. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Nash's Spouse. She performs like never before, and is at par with Crowe in several scenes. Paul Bettany is effective. Ed Harris is, as always, note-worthy. Josh Lucas is good. Christopher Plummer is restrained.On the whole, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a Remarkable Film in all respects! One of the Greatest True Stories, translate, into becoming, One of the Greatest Films of it's time! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10,0,1,19 August 2010
The Departed," Haunting...
","A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this! This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis 'Frank' Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrier. Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well.'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10,4,6,12 July 2010

Psycho," A Terrific Film!
","'Psycho' is a Terrific Film, in all respects. It's chilling, it's captivating & it's memorable. Directed by Maverick Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic, is indeed time-less!'Psycho' depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, played shockingly by Anthony Perkins, and the aftermath of their encounter. Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum. Alfred Hitchcock's Direction is spell-binding. The master storyteller directs this psychological thriller, most convincingly. John L. Russell's Cinematography is chilling. Each Frame looks haunted. The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly. What Perkins achieves by playing Norman Bates, is nothing short of an embodiment. Perkins performs as if Norman Bates, was actually waiting for him to play him on celluloid. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that is above any praise! Janet Leigh is fantastic. Vera Miles, John Gavin & Martin Balsam leave a mark, as well. On the whole, 'Psycho' is much more than it's infamous shower scene. It's a film that leaves you haunted, with it's sheer power!",9,1,1,3 August 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Michael Bay is fantastic!
","My headline is exactly what you feel after watching the mega-budget 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen'.Michael Bay has made epics, including the 2007 Super-hit 'Transformers'... this being its sequel doesn't live up-to its previous part. 'Transformers' was an amazing experience, with almost everything going with it. That film was a winner, but the sequel, for which people rushed into the cineplexes and making this a Blockbuster, isn't really that great.The problem: The script lacks fire, it's paper thin and gets dragging towards the end. As they say, first impression is last impression, the first made people to wow all the way, but the second lacks the fizz. The film doesn't hold in most parts, apart from the climax, there is hardly anything that makes you go Holy Cow!!! A special mention for: Bay's brilliant direction, one wished he would've come up with a stronger screenplay. Performances by Shia and Megan are top notch. Shia is fantastic. The Graphics are as fascinating as the first.Minuses: Script doesn't hold.To sum up, 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen' had the potential to make you go wow! But sadly, that doesn't happen here!",6,7,17,10 July 2009
The Witch," Frightening & Engrossing!
","Writer-Director Robert Eggers's 'The Witch' is a Frightening & Engrossing film, that left me awed. This one's an unsettling, slow-building horror masterstroke, that delivers some thrills, but is overall a work of pure treatment. 'The Witch' isn't all about scares & spooks, but a tale that grabs you & throws shivers down your spine, even without a single cheap scare. 'The Witch' Synopsis: A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.'The Witch' is an exercise in fright. Believe me, after the All-Time Blockbuster The Conjuring, 'The Witch' is another film of the 2010's that does the horror genre right. Eggers's Screenplay moves on an intentionally slow-pace, only to build & build to an unforgettable culmination. You watch the ill-fated family being torn apart from the evil & although heartbreaking, the narrative remains engrossing. Eggers's Direction relies on treatment & he has aced it here. He treats every moment with a sense of paranoia & unpredictably, adding all the more force to the goings-on. Egger is the True Hero of 'The Witch', as he gives his all & rises with a superior Horror Film.A Special Mention Jarin Blaschke's excellent Camera-work & for the Performances by Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson & Kate Dickie. On the whole, 'The Witch' is a solid watch. Go, get scared (for real).",9,3,9,25 April 2016
Jersey Boys," Just About Decent!
","Clint Eastwood, The Greatest Star-Actor/Director of all-time, has given us some remarkable films to follow. But with 'Jersey Boys', he offers a rather standard musical biopic, that's just about decent!'Jersey Boys' is the story of four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey, who came together to form the iconic 1960s rock group The Four Seasons.The musical moments in 'Jersey Boys' are powerful, no seconds thoughts on that. But, the Writing, is lackluster. After an energetic first-hour, the film loses pace & overstays its welcome by at least 20-minutes. The Screenplay by Marshall Brickman & Rick Elic aims high, but loses air mid-way. Eastwood's Direction is atmospheric. But he's done better. Cinematography & Art Design are excellent. Editing is anything but sharp.The Performances range from good to average. I was particularly impressed by Christopher Walken's winning turn as late Angelo DeCarlo. He's rugged & dominating. Of the boys, John Lloyd Young stands out.On the whole, 'Jersey Boys' is ambitious, but flawed too.",6,1,2,7 November 2014

The sub-plots aren't very impressive & the first-hour, in particular, lacks aim. Its only when the war-heroes return, is when 'Mudbound' takes flight, before that, its a slow-moving slog that's headed to nowhere. Dee Rees' Direction is impressive, though.

Sausage Party," Fun In Parts...
","Seth Rogen is a man with funny ideas & his latest animation-food-based-comedy 'Sausage Party' is another mad attempt by him & Co. And to give this food-talking film its due, its fun in parts & has sequences that genuinely make you laugh. But, the writing is erratic & hence the impact isn't entirely enjoyable.'Sausage Party' follows a hot dog sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) who tries to discover the truth about his existence, and goes on a journey with his friends to escape their fate.'Sausage Party' is vulgar, offensive & also funny, no doubt. But the narrative ranges between fun to ordinary. I enjoyed the camaraderie of its central characters & also their love for foul language. The first-hour starts well, but dips considerably in the middle, especially when the food-goons make it out of the store. The laughs shorten & the sequences aren't amusing enough. However, 'Sausage Party' comes to full-power in its final-act, which is fun as well as funny. A post climax-sequence involving the food-goons going crazy in orgy-mode, is Laugh-Out-Loud Funny. But, that's the deal, 'Sausage Party' is erratic, and that's its only minus.Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter & Ariel Shaffir's Screenplay is innovative & funny, but could've done better, giving its potential overall. I wanted to laugh more! Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernn's Direction is quite good, as the animation is spiced up. Kevin Pavlovic's Editing is crisp, as the madness is wrapped up in 88-minutes.Coming to the Vocal-Performances. Seth Rogen as Frank, the heroic Sausage, is tops, as always. Kristen Wiig as Brenda, a hot-dog bun & Frank's love-interest, is excellent. Bill Hader as Firewater, an old Native American bottle of liquor, Tequila, and El Guaco, a guacamole gangster, is a riot. Edward Norton as Sammy Bagel Jr., a bagel & Salma Hayek as Teresa del Taco, a lesbian taco shell who develops a lustful friendship with Brenda, steal the show. Michael Cera as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends, is cute. Danny McBride as Honey Mustard, a grocery who was returned to Shopwell's and tries to warn Frank of their fate, is loud. James Franco as the Druggie, a junkie drug addict who is the first known human to see the foods as sentient beings, brings the house down. Jonah Hill as Carl, a sausage who's packed with Frank and Barry, is effective enough. Paul Rudd as Darren, the manager of Shopwell's, who the food-toons are frightened by, is first-rate. Others lend superb support.On the whole, 'Sausage Party' has flaws, but it isn't without its moments.",6,8,17,15 August 2016

"Hail, Caesar!"," Average...
","The Coen Brothers are geniuses. No two options on that. And sometimes, even the best of the minds around us, stumble & deliver something not very exciting. 'Hail, Caesar!' by the Coen Brothers, is their first downer in a long time, but with some really good performances & silliness, the one's a celebrated failure. 'Hail, Caesar!' Synopsis: A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.'Hail, Caesar!' isn't engaging enough & that's its biggest minus. The Coen's have a fun story to tell, but it doesn't translate on-screen as this big-fat tribute to the Golden-Age of Hollywood. The Characters are amusing, so are some of the dialogue, but beyond a point, the narrative just doesn't hold. The Coen's Screenplay is surely underwhelming this time around. Even their Direction, though passion driven, isn't remotely among their best. 'Hail, Caesar!' has a tremendous cast & they all seem deliver. Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, the protagonist, is reliably solid, delivering an arresting performance as the Fixer. George Clooney has never been this funny. He doesn't have a lot of scenes, but whenever he does get on-screen, he puts on goofiness with flourish. Alden Ehrenreich is an actor to watch. He's fantastic! Among the many cameos, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Christopher Lambert are truly terrific. Wayne Knight is first-rate. On the whole, 'Hail, Caesar!' is a missed opportunity. But we all know the Coen's. They'll be back in no time.",5,0,2,18 April 2016

Peter Jackson & Team, give us a dark, yet bombastic action extravagant!'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' Synopsis: Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness.At a 144-minutes, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is filled with moments of drama & spectacular action-sequences. The Graphics are beyond awesome & the stunts are astounding. I was mesmerized by the film's second-hour, because once the action sets in, you can't move from your seat. Having said that, the first-hour of the film is a mighty bore! Slow & Dull, Jackson's third installment falls short on this count. A stronger, faster first-hour would have done no harm! Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro & Jackson's Adapted Screenplay lacks meat for the entire first-hour, but becomes heart-pounding later on. Jackson's Direction is eye-filling. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Graphics are simply awesome. Costume Design & Make-Up are good, too.Performance-Wise: The Wonderful Martin Freeman as the lovable Bilbo Baggins, scores yet again. Sir Ian McKellen is as gripping as ever as Gandalf. Richard Armitage gives a far more serious approach to Thorin this time around, but its an impressive one.

As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.'Arrival' is projected as a Sci-Fi Alien Invasion film, and it is, but that's only on the surface. At heart & soul, 'Arrival' is a story on motherhood, the gift of being special & how violence is not always the answer to fight an endangering third kind. 'Arrival' is as much an emotional drama, as it sticks to being a Sci-Fi visual dazzler.

","John Lee Hancock's 'The Blind Side' is an okay fare, with not much on it's side. I mean it based on a great, great, great true story. Michael Oher, has become a Icon. But as a film, it doesn't make the impact! Sandra Bullock delivers a astounding performance, but filmmaker John Lee Hancock doesn't really deliver. Making a biopic on the early years of an icon is a great idea. Plus, the relationship between the Mother & her Newly-Born Child is beautiful. On the flip-side, 'The Blind Side' runs of a slow-pace, it hardly has a lively moment.I can't just write a sentence & insult Sandra Bullock's performance. I have been a die-hard fan of hers since I was kid. 'Speed', '28 Days', 'Pratical Magic', I've seen all those films a zillion times.

The Water Diviner," Pure Beauty!
","Loosely based on the book of the same name, written by Andrew Anastasios and Dr Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios, 'The Water Diviner' which marks the Directorial Debut of Russell Crowe, is a beautiful film, that tells a tale that's saddening & yet moving. Crowe calls the shots with conviction & his performance in the central role, is beyond amazing!'The Water Diviner' Synopsis: An Australian man travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli to try and locate his three missing sons.'The Water Diviner' is a story of pure beauty & depth. I was moved & engrossed by the people I saw in this film. Especially the protagonist, played by Crowe. Its a character thats entirely tragic & yet engaging. I wanted him to find his missing sons & also get some redemption. 'The Water Diviner' has one minus point though, and that's its pace. The slow-pacing in the first-hour acts a bit as a deterrent. But that's not much, since its a very superior tale otherwise.Andrew Knight's Adapted Screenplay is emotionally charged & takes a look back at the tragedy that happened in the battle of Gallipoli. Crowe's Direction is very well-done. He has handled the film with conviction & that's commendable by all measures. Cinematography is lavishly done. Editing is sharp, more-so towards the second-hour. Art & Costume Design are perfect. War-Scenes are graphically shot. David Hirschfelder's Score is good.Performance-Wise: Crowe commands the screen with a solid central performance. He enacts a complex part with amazing understanding. Its a winning performance by the master actor, yet again! Olga Kurylenko is wonderfully restrained. Yılmaz Erdoğan is alright. Jai Courtney leaves a mark.On the whole, 'The Water Diviner' is a tale well told! Recommended!",7,4,9,28 May 2015
Wonder Woman," All Hail Gal Gadot!
","Gal Gadot has charisma. A rare one. She pulls you inside her world of 'Wonder Woman' & doesn't let you go. Donning the superwoman role for the 2nd time, starting with the forgettable Batman V. Superman, Gadot brings energy, command & a whole new level to the word Sexy! She's irresistible.Having said that, 'Wonder Woman' is never as strong as her leading-lady. While she soars, the Writing never allows the narrative to remain consistently strong. Its entertaining, but far from amazing.'Wonder Women' Synopsis: Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny.'Wonder Woman' begins grippingly & holds well until our strong leading-lady comes to London with her Leading-Man (A Likable, Earnest Chris Pine) . But, soon after, the pace drops & gets sluggish. Also, despite some excellent action set-pieces, the film never Wow's you, as the Writing gets lazy. What starts off as an engaging origin story, suddenly becomes a regular Good versus Evil Fight. The villains lack the punch, so its all about upto the wondrous superwoman to keep it going.And Gadot does it with spectacular success. I was mesmerized by Gadot's heroic turn, that is sure to send the audiences into a high. Gadot is a Star & is certainly here to stay. I can't wait to see her in the Justice League Movie, which opens later this year.Allan Heinberg's Screenplay is super initially, but settles for regular stuff in its second-hour. Patty Jenkins's Direction is well-done. Graphics, expectedly, are extraordinary. And special mentions for the nicely done Cinematography by Matthew Jensen & the wonderfully done art & costume design. The Editing needed to be crisper. On the whole, 'Wonder Woman' is a Gal Gadot show all the way. Watch it for her & you'll be rewarded!",6,7,28,2 June 2017

For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge. Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific.

Mother!," MAMI Film Fest Review. Mother!.
","Biblical, Shocking, Violence & Unsettling, Darren Aronofsky's 'Mother!' is a difficult but confounding film, that's likely to leave you either enthralled or unimpressed. I fall into the category of those 'who loved it'. And here's why: How many films can shock you & raise questions with such ferocity? I don't remember the last time it happened. And that's exactly why 'Mother!' is such big winner. It swept me off my feat.'Mother!' Synopsis: A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.'Mother!' is about us & how one is responsible for the surroundings we get. Mother Nature is all we have & we mustn't enrage or disrespect her, as she is our goddess now and forever. Aronofsky has made a film, that begins subtly, but turns into a nightmarish, violent tale of a Mother. And its all done skillfully. Aronofsky's relentless approach to this unsettling tale is of top order. His Screenplay, entirely biblical, builds up slowly, but grows on ferociously & ends on a highly intense note. Aronofsky's Direction is, as usual, effective. Weather its The claustrophobic setting or the shocking violence, Aronofsky's commitment to the subject remains highly commendable. Matthew Libatique's Cinematography captures the carnage, magnificently. Andrew Weisblum's Editing is mostly sharp. Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. The Background Score, also, is fabulous & adds to the intense proceedings.Performance-Wise: Jennifer Lawrence is in top-form, yet again! As Mother, the Oscar-Winner expresses fright, shock & rage, with rare conviction. Its a terrific performance! Javier Bardem as her Husband, is effective. Ed Harris & Michelle Pfeiffer do some of their best work here, especially Pfeiffer, who leaves a strong impact in a small role. Domhnall Gleeson is appropriately creepy as Pfeiffer & Harris's troubled son. Kristen Wiig stands out in a scary cameo. On the whole, 'Mother!' is a winner all the way. Its truly something to be experienced. Strongly Recommended!",9,0,7,19 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Zack Snyder, Really?
","Two Of The BIGGEST Superheroes Batman & Superman - come together in a magnum-opus, that is anything but entertaining. My only question to Zack Snyder, how in the world did you get this wrong? Synder's previous Superman adventure was good fun, but he ruins this once-in-a-lifetime cinematic moment, by delivering a film that fails on almost every level. Lacking soul & rush, This Biggie is one disappointment!'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' Synopsis: Fearing the actions of Superman are left unchecked, Batman takes on the man of steel, while the world wrestles with what kind of a hero it really needs. With Batman and Superman fighting each other, a new threat, Doomsday, is created by Lex Luthor. It's up to Superman and Batman to set aside their differences along with Wonder Woman to stop Lex Luthor and Doomsday from destroying Metropolis.The biggest problem with 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is its weak Screenplay. Chris Terrio & David S. Goyer's Writing just doesn't excite or entice. I mean, come on! You've got the caped crusader & the man of steel battling it out & you're in 2016, graphics aren't new anymore nor can action-sequences hold beyond a point. You have to pen an engaging story. In those never-ending 160-minutes, this crowded superhero flick, barely offers anything remarkable. While the first-hour tries to develop an enmity between its heroes, while introduction some important supporting characters, the second-hour sees them fighting it out in a listless 5-minute battle, with an overblown culmination. I didn't bother for Clark Kent, but Bruce Wayne seemed a bit more darker. The Writing is definitely the biggest flaw here!And now coming to Synder. Were you even a fan of the idea of the heroes colliding? Visually, Synder has nailed each & every frame. But, he fails to give any soul to the narrative. The film goes on for long, but there is nothing spectacular even for once on display in terms of drama. This is Synder's least appealing hour. Cinematography, Editing & Graphics are amazing, no doubt. 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is technically marvelous. Music by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL, is absolutely brilliant. Now Coming To The Performances! Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman, has done quite well. Of course we shouldn't compare him to any of the previous Batman's, as every actor brings a newer edge & looking at Affleck's interpretation alone, he's convincing as the haunted Bruce Wayne & absolutely Tough as the legendary superhero. Henry Cavill as Clark Kent / Superman, is blank. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, is hot & a delight in her brief bit. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, is an eyesore. Seriously, Mr.Eisenberg? Of the supporting cast, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Holly Hunter as Finch, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White & Diane Lane as Martha Kent, lend adequate support. On the whole, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is a huge disappointment.",4,54,110,24 March 2016
Blade Runner," A Major Letdown...
","Ridley Scott is a legendary filmmaker, his body of work is exception. 'Blade Runner', which is now known to be a Cult Classic by many, in my opinion, is Scott's weakest effort. 'Blade Runner' is based on a epic battle between genetically engineered beings called replicants & and a semi-retired blade runner. It takes place in 2019, 9 years from now, well it seems like a boring future. Let's not forget the that 'Blade Runner' was a box office disaster when originally released. Some films are lucky to earn Cult Status, & this sci-fi flick is surely one of them. Scott's direction is not up-to the mark, mainly because the script is filled with loose ends. Cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth is worth a mention, his work is great. In the acting department, Harrison Ford has always been a competent actor, and his performance here proves that fact yet again. Rutger Hauer is okay. Others are plain average.All said n done from this writer, 'Blade Runner' is a overrated classic. A debacle, compared to it's hype. Thumbs Down!",3,15,32,10 February 2010

One fine day, the Almighty appears, played by Morgan Freeman. He gives his powers to him see if he can do a better job.'Bruce Almighty' is a film that I've loved ever since it's release. I remember watching it in L.A., Universal City Walk. I was awed by it, it's such a touching & moving cinematic experience. It has it's share of hilarious moments, but its the penultimate 30-minutes, when the goings-on get serious, those are the portions that leave a strong impression. You weep in your seat and you exit the auditorium in glee.Steve Oedekerk, Steve Koren & Mark O'Keefe's Screenplay is legendary. Tom Shadyac's execution to the genius Screenplay is completely justified. Dean Semler's Cinematography is super.In the acting department, Jim Carrey proves his caliber, yet again. He becomes Bruce from scene A itself. He is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman as God, is wonderfully relaxed. Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's Lady-Love is remarkable. This truly ranks amongst her best performances! Steve Carell fumbles beautifully. Catherine Bell looks ravishing! Her performance is just right.On the whole, One of the Finest Films of 2003.

","I remember watching 'Toy Story' a couple of times... I was in school that time. way back in 1995... the film had become a rage amongst us. I and my pals use to plan to watch 'Toy Story' every weekend and enact a scene from the cult-classic. I was Woody and my best friend was Buzz... oh boy, what memories and what fun! I am emotionally connected to 'Toy Story', I loved the second installment as well. A decade later, one of my all-time favorite's are back in 'Toy Story 3', the final installment. What Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios achieve in 'Toy Story 3' is something extra-ordinary.Some films entertain and some films enlighten, but 'Toy Story 3' is a combination of both.

He is screaming in every frame, 'Drugs Are No Good'! His message is noble. But the writing and the direction, are so abstract, dark and brutal, that one fails to grasp the goings-on, at least I failed to understand it. Danny Boyle has been better, and I am sure about that!Performance-Wise: Ewan McGregor does well, while Robert Carlyle hams to the hilt. Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller & Kevin McKidd are compelling. Kelly Macdonald stands out, with a fantastic performance. Others lend able support.On the whole, A weird Cult classic, in each and every aspect.

Deadpool," So Freakin' Cool!
","Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, 'Deadpool' is pure bad-ass entertainment! Despite being a 'SUPERHERO' flick, this one's crass, non family-friendly, gruesome/graphic & relentless. But, thats its trump card. Its a trend-setter, in many ways!'Deadpool' Synopsis: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.'Deadpool' is a knockout. I loved Ant-Man & 'Deadpool' is equally engaging on all Marvel levels. The pace is Crisp, the Action-Sequences are Spectacular & the Protagonist is to die for. Played Magnficently by Ryan Reynolds, he as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, is wickedly fun & addictive. His unassuming charm, his crass language, his manic personality & his fighting-chops, all hold tremendous appeal. He's so unlike a regular Superhero & yet he's a Hero. Thats where 'Deadpool' scores enormously, its different & unabashed in its approach.Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese's Screenplay moves a brisk pace & offers enough scope for crazy humour & brilliant action. The Writing is tight all through. Tim Miller's Direction is top-notch. He has handled he film with command. Ken Seng's Cinematography is perfect. Julian Clarke's Editing is razor-sharp. Make-Up merits a special mention. Art & Costume Design are terrific. Graphics are WOW! Tom Holkenborg's Score is decent.Performance-Wise: Reynolds is a complete scene-stealer. He nails each & every punch of Deadpool, displaying tremendous flair for comedy & great intensity while breaking into a fight. Its a career-making performance & we finally, can move over Green Lantern. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, is perfect as the hero's lady-love. T.J. Miller as Weasel, is funny. Ed Skrein as Francis Freema /Ajax, is a super villain & scores in the action bits. Gina Carano as Angel Dust, is sexy. Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead & Stefan Kapičić as Peter Rasputi/Colossus (motion-capture), are just right.On the whole, 'Deadpool' is a B-L-O-C-K-B-U-S-T-E-R!

Get Him to the Greek," Non-Stop Madness!
","Nicholas Stoller's 'Get Him To The Greek' is a film that never promised path-breaking Cinema, so it's non-stop madness, doesn't really gulp in a bad taste. It's a stupid film, with idiotic moments, but one can't deny that you laugh in some of the portions, at the right time! 'Get Him To The Greek' is about a rock-star, who's in the dumps. Entry, a low-level talent scout at Pinnacle Records, who makes the appointed rock-star come back in the day.Some jokes are truly hilarious. The funniest is the one, where Jonah Hill is forced by Brand to put up drugs in his bum! At the same time, some moments are absurd and very unfunny. The Threesome Sequence is horrible and fails to evoke a inch of smile. What made them to even think a sequence like that?? Nicholas Stoller's direction is fair. His writing, is flawed. Robert Yeoman's Cinematography is average. Acting wise, Jonah Hill is fantastic. He handles himself wonderfully even the most absurd situations. Russell Brand is bland. For him, making morbid faces and expressions is humor! Elisabeth Moss is flawless. A true talent! Rose Byrne is perfect.On the whole, Watch this one if must. Not really recommended!",4,1,4,30 September 2010

No, the long running-time isn't the problem, but the writing, at times, is. Out of the many stories, some appeal entirely, some appeal in bits. My Personal Favourite was the one Set In 2144. It has a strong story & astounding visual effects! 'Cloud Atlas', despite its flaws, cannot be missed. I was astonished by the execution & the creativity involved into it. Its been made on an Epic Scale & it carries a Grand Look all through. Its stunning to look at. Lana & Andy Wachowski & Tom Tykwer's Writing isn't power-packed, but has its share of amazement too.

Easy A," Good 1....
","'Easy A' is a good flick, in fact it's amongst the better films to come out of Hollywood this year. Director Will Gluck, succeeds by making an ideal teen flick, which has potential to gain a cult following in the coming time. What also stands tall in this flick, is it's Leading Star, Emma Stone, who delivers a fantastic performance from start to end.'Easy A' tells the story of a clean-cut high school student who relies on the school's rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing. Her journey is filled of lies, entertainment and liveliness.If there is an glitch in the film, is it's culmination. Mediocre and truly been-there-done-that, done with it stuff. The Screenplay which is so innovative and interesting, suddenly takes a summer-salt, which in turn spoils the climax. Writer Bert V. Royal, could've truly worked on it. Nonetheless, his writing is spot-on. Will Gluck's direction is good.Emma Stone is the life of 'Easy A'. She delivers exactly or more than the Screenplays demand, and as mentioned, is fantastic throughout. She truly deserves some awards for her performance in here. Among other performers, the ever likable Stanley Tucci, delivers wonderfully.On the whole, though not a A+ plus, a well-done 'check this out' flick. Even if the film doesn't entirely entertain, it's leading lady does, very throughly.",6,1,3,10 December 2010

An Outstanding War Film, that boasts a stellar cast & mind-bending direction by the under-rated genius.'The Thin Red Line' is a fictionalized version of the Battle of Mount Austen, which was part of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It portrays soldiers of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. 'The Thin Red Line' is about human-spirit & patriotism. Its also spiritual, meaningful & insightful. The Protagonist, played by Jim Caviezel, is in search for answers. His question is simple: If we can love, why is there war? Why is there injustice? Why is there division? A haunted character leads this masterpiece, with a sense of torment & courage. 'The Thin Red Line' runs for over a 171-minutes, but not for a minute, does the momentum go down.

Malick also deserves a pat on his back for bringing in an ensemble cast as mammoth as this & more-so, for writing such powerful, emotional characters.Malick is a genius & 'The Thin Red Line' is a shining example of that fact.

Green Book," A Charming and Well-Acted Film!
","Based on the lives Don Shirley (A Pianist) and and Tony Vallelonga (A Bouncer), 'Green Book' is a surprisingly pleasant effort by Writer-Director Peter Farrelly, who delivers his most sensitive film to date. Farrelly known for madcap comedies, takes a different route this time, and delivers a road-film, that explores friendship and racism, with heart.'Green Book' Synopsis: A working-class Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen in a showy performance) becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist (Mahershala Ali, mastering in subtlety) on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.'Green Book' works because this is a truly heartening story of diversely different people who formed a bond, despite their differences. And Farrelly, along-with Co-Writers Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son) and Brian Hayes Currie, makes sure the ride is memorable. Though the film does get monotonous at times and also feels about 15-minutes longer than should've been, 'Green Book' is a charming road-film, that is, in equal measure, humorous and serious.Tony and Don's relationship is nicely captured, as it begins from awkwardness to true friendship as the story progresses. The entire ark of its characters is well-done, like Tony's racial attitude towards Don initially and how their friendship forms, to Don realizing the power of being himself, deserves credit. Even the entire backdrop of Racism subjected toward Don, offers some hair-rising moments, that definitely leave you angered. The Writing, though imperfect, is well-aware of the times the story is set in (1960's) and presents a story that appears authentic, rather than frothy and artificial.Farrelly's Direction is competent. It's good to see the otherwise zany director, explore his subtler side here. Sean Porter's Cinematography is excellent. Patrick J. Don Vito's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper.Performance-Wise: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are in fine form, yet again. Viggo, nailing the Italian accent and gulping down food like a true foodie, has a blast playing Tony, and it shows in every frame. Ali, on the other-hand, portrays the subdued Don, with grace and restraint. And the on-screen camaraderie between the two, is infectious. Of the supporting cast, Linda Cardellini as Tony's Wife, is extraordinary.On the whole, 'Green Book' charms. Make time for it.",7,5,8,17 January 2019

I won't give away all any spoilers here, as this is a film, that needs to be viewed with all its might. Also, considering the amount of themes & ideas 'Annihilation' has to offer, everyone viewing this film, just like me, will have his/her own ideology of the film.

'Annihilation' isn't an easy film to write or direct, but Garland takes the challenge & delivers one of the strongest Sci-Fi Films of recent memory.

Rockstar," A Well-Made Film! Ranbir is Oustanding!
","Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar' is A Good Attempt, that deserves a viewing. I just loved the way Imtiaz executed the first-hour, but, I felt, the second-hour, was not as effective as compared to the first-hour. But, Ranbir's outstanding performance manages to hold you even in the second-hour. He delivers the performance of his life!'Rockstar' tells the story how a timid Janardhan Jakhar, transforms into Jordan, a Rockstar. During the course of his career, he falls in love with Heer, who plays a major part in his life. It's a tale of love, passion & destruction. 'Rockstar' begins wonderfully and the journey of Janardhan Jakhar, a timid budding artist, and his romance with Heer, is simply superb. Imtiaz has handled the first-hour beautifully and he executes the light-moments, with greatness. However, the second-hour, isn't as effective. Also, I thought, the final 30-minutes, to be depressing. But you just can't overlook 'Rockstar' because of some minuses, over-here, luckily, the pluses manage to overshadow the minuses. Sure, the writing material could've been tighter & lighter in the second-hour, but there's no denying that Imtiaz has made a well-made film in all respects, and he deserves immense praise for making a film he believed in. Music by A.R Rahman, like always, is spell-binding. All the Songs are wonderful & memorable. Cinematography by Anil Mehta is excellent. Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Ranbir delivers the performance of his life. His transformation from a timid nobody to a youth sensation, is simply remarkable. He stands out from scene A to Z.

While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.'Spectre' isn't as good as Skyfall. And yes, that kinda disappoints. But, luckily & worthily, 'Spectre' never slows down in terms of pace or excitement. Sure, there are some flaws here. For one, The Villain (played by Two-Time Oscar-Winner Christoph Waltz) needed to be stronger & meaner. The Writing also needed to be crisper, especially towards the final portions. But otherwise, barring these few lows, 'Spectre' is undeniably entertaining.John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & Jez Butterworth's Screenplay is well-done, offering appropriate scope for action & thrills. But, as I mentioned earlier, The Villain should've been explored more. Sam Mendes's Direction is Grand. He's made a helluva of a good-looking film! Hoyte van Hoytema's Cinematography is marvelous.

You can't connect to its protagonist or any other character here. Reason? The dull writing. David O. Russell's Screenplay is surprisingly motionless, offering close to no highs in the goings-on. You watch the story unfold, but all you get is an unsatisfying narrative. David O. Russell's Direction, also, lacks the bite. In short, The Writer-Director fails to deliver this time.'Joy' is saved & remains watchable due to its fine cast, who manage to deliver. Jennifer Lawrence is sincere in her portrayal of Joy, giving her character some power, despite it being under-written.

True Romance," Nuts and Loving it!
","Stealing, Cheating, Killing. Who said romance is dead? 'True Romance' is a nut case film, in fact, it loves to be one. Quentin Tarantino, who is the official writer of this film, and Tony Scott, who has officially directed this film, were on one trip while making this flick! 'True Romance' is about a newly married couple who screw up big time and get involved with the very wrong guys. The film begins very well, the first 30-40 minutes are interesting and absorbing. But! As soon as the film shows it's real colors, it falls on it's face. Also, the goings-on get too violent and gory, which puts you off completely. More over, the culmination is also a downer. The impact clearly seems missing! Quentin Tarantino is my favorite filmmaker, I am a huge fan of his. But, I have no option here, but to say this popular faze: When The Mighty Fell! Same goes for Tony Scott.In the acting department, 'True Romance' gets an ensemble cast, and there are some note-worthy performances. Christian Slater is excellent. Patricia Arquette looks each bit of the character and performs well. Michael Rapaport hams. Christopher Walken & Gary Oldman prove their caliber, yet again. James Gandolfini is fantastic. Late Dennis Hopper is first-rate. Brad Pitt is royally sidelined, and same goes for Val Kilmer.On the whole, 'True Romance' is a major letdown.",4,3,9,29 September 2010

Its not an innovative story & even the sequences, minus action, though barely any, aren't engaging. In terms of Screenplay, which has been Written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy & Nico Lathouris, isn't foolproof. It completely relies on action to deliver & luckily that department, is super-strong! Miller deserves an ovation for his sheer imagination & for the execution of the film. He has envisioned an all new Mad Max Legend ingeniously. Visually, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is simply spectacular. I was engrossed & mesmerized by the action-sequences, which undoubtedly, are incredible. The fight between the Good & the Bad, is superbly done. I have never seen a film as action-packed as 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. John Seale's Cinematography deserves a special mention. Each & Every Frame has been captured with utter brilliance. Margaret Sixel's Editing is sharp, although the first-hour, is slightly slow. Junkie XL's Score adds more madness to the narrative. Though I thought I would never accept anyone but Mel Gibson as Mad Max, Tom Hardy dons the part, most engagingly. Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, is in true bad-ass mode. She kicks ass & how! Nicholas Hoult as Nux, is outstanding. His best work to date. Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, is terrifying & mean as hell! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad & Zoë Kravitz as Toast the Knowing, leave a mark.On the whole, despite its thin plot, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' offers visual dazzle, like you've never seen before.

'Valkyrie' catches you attention from the word GO and continues to spell its magic till its end. Pluses of the film: Bryan Singer, the captain of the ship is the true hero here, he has directed the film like a pro. Camera-work by Newton Thomas Sigel is simply astounding, background score is spell-bounding and superb production value. Performances are perfect: Tom Cruise is superb, he plays his part with ease and style. Bill Nighy is outstanding, he's simply superb in the penultimate 15 minutes. Tom Wilkinson is in form,once again. Terence Stamp is effective. Kenneth Branagh is excellent. David Bamber, as Adolf Hitler is good.Minuses: The films length could've been trimmed by 5-10 minutes.on the whole 'Valkyrie' is an excellent film, a complete sweeper. Bravo!",8,11,20,22 May 2009

The Martian," A Solid Watch!
","Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel by the same name, 'The Martian' is an Epic Sci-Fi Adventure, that offers solid entertainment. Its a gripping film, about about survival & hope. Legendary Director Sir Ridley Scott & Actors Matt Damon & Jeff Daniels are at their finest!'The Martian' Synopsis: During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew.

Its a challenging, inspiring & throughly entertaining Story, that hardly misses a beat. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Sir Ridley Scott's Direction is exemplary.

Pietro Scalia's Editing is razor-crisp, despite a running-time of over 140-minutes! Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics & 3D Effects are top-class. Harry Gregson-Williams's Score is soulful.

Of the rest, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, a NASA mission director, Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, NASA spokesperson, Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, Ares III commander, Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, an astronaut & Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson, a NASA mission director, leave a strong impression.On the whole, 'The Martian' is a ride that needs to be experienced!

The Fighter," A Knockout!
","David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' is among those films, that leave a lasting impression on it's viewer. Based on the life of professional boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund, this story is awesomely executed on Screen.David O. Russell's understanding on this true-story, is nearly exemplary. He directs each frame with proper detail, and never lets the drama go down. His Oscar-Nomination was so justified & meant to happen. The Screenplay is high-packed & offers memorable dialogue. Cinematography is picture-perfect.Another major reason why 'The Fighter' works, is because of it's Performances. Christian Bale is flawless in an Oscar-winning role. He lives his part throughout. Mark Wahlberg as Micky, isn't as effective, but makes his presence felt nonetheless.

Others support well.On the whole, A Knockout! Strongly Recommended! Two Thumbs Up!",9,0,3,1 March 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," A Disappointment...
","F.Gary Gray's 'Law Abiding Citizen' disappoints. Reason: The Idea is is interesting, but the writing isn't. The film starts off really well, but becomes a mess later on.Thrillers, according to me, are the best movie genre ever! It has the potential 'If Wirtten Well' to keep you hooked. Some thrillers become iconic, while some end-up being one-time watchers. 'Law Abiding Citizen' is one of those thrillers, which you forget right after it's done. Kurt Wimmer is surely the culprit here, his writing in the final 30-minutes falls flat & how! Gray's direction is not up-to the mark. He's not in from. Performance wise, Jamie Foxx is okay. Gerard Butler gets a powerful & he does full justice to it. He's in terrific form. Viola Davis is wasted. Leslie Bibb is passable. Regina Hall gets no scope. Others are adequate.All said n done, 'Law Abiding Citizen' isn't half as good as it's box office returns.",4,5,9,2 February 2010

Lisa Bonet & Sara Gilbert leave a mark, as well.On the whole, A Must Watch! Strongly Recommended!",7,0,1,4 November 2010

Vin Diesel is tough, as ever. Dwayne Johnson, surprisingly, is reduced into a cameo here. He's brilliant nevertheless. Michelle Rodriguez is efficient. Ludicrous & Tyrese Gibson bring the house down, with hilarious turns. Jason Statham, as the antagonist, plays it straight. Ditto for Djimon Hounsou. Ali Fazal leaves a mark.

The Godfather," Does Power Always Get It Right ?
","'The Godfather' left me in many emotions. Lucky to witnessed such cinema? Yes, but my summary says my current expression. Does Power Always Get It Right ? 'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect.",10,1,4,27 September 2010
