Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Series needs some help
","Farbeit for me to agree with critics, but I think most of them are dead-on. While not a terrible movie, this film has no redeeming value outside its effects and future story points.After watching the original film and American Grafitti, and even seeing the Lucas-written Raiders of the Lost Ark, I expected more, especially in the writing and directing.  This script was horrible.  I have not seen a worse script in some time.  The characters were stock--I've seen them all.  They may look different but they are the same nonetheless.  (i.e. the comedic sidekick, the stoic master, the little boy with a heart of gold, the crooked slave trader, etc.)  And Lucas proves that he values his effects much more than his direction of actors.  Even Jar-Jar was a more prevalent character than some of the majors, especially the disappointing Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.First, let me say that both Neeson and McGregor are great actors.  I especially like Neeson from his work from the nineties best film, Schindler's List, but in TPM he is bland, with no acting stretches at all. McGregor, on the other hand, seems to be just there to fill in Obi-Wan's shoes.  Besides saying what the audience is thinking merely to qualify what is happening on screen, he is background.  I hope episode 2 lets him act a bit more.The best of the human actors in the film is Natalie Portman, by far, and Pernilla August as Anakin's mother.  August's performance is not perfect, but adequate with the material she's given.  It's a shame that Liam Neeson couldn't explore the character more.The effects, though, are amazing.  While Jabba looks better than he did in Star Wars, he still hasn't looked as good as he did in Jedi.  The view of Coruscant is absolutely amazing, and although the underwater city was average compared to other effects, the underwater journey with the sea creatures was spectacular.The Phantom Menace is NOT the best film of 1999 so far, it's not even the best film I've SEEN this year.  Surprisingly, that distinction goes to Election and The Matrix.  Disappointing, yes.  But not a total waste of time.  Here's hoping that Lucas writes a much better episode 2 and finds someone competent to direct.",Null,0,1,7 June 1999
No Man's Land," Best Screenplay Winner at Cannes?
","This is a story that begs to be told--a good representation of what has been a mysterious war halfway around the world--in Yugoslavia.  It is an immensely interesting film, dominated by the relationship between the Serb and Bosnian, and even more, their two sides.  The workings of the UN peacekeepers were also well-represented and very interesting.The problem I had with the film, ironically, was with the script, which won Best Screenplay at Cannes.  The byplay between the Serb and Croat was great, and the portrayal of the several different nationalities of the UN (of which English is the only common language) is well represented.Unfortunately, the film does dwell into cliches when introducing the media--the dialogue on the news reports is stale and uninvolving, I heard the same words in Three Kings.  Of course, one is limited when portraying live news reports, but there is always an opportunity to make it fresh--unfortunately, the screenwriter chose not to do that here.But all in all, a pretty good film.",8,0,1,16 August 2001
