Lucky Number Slevin," So script and logic are no more issues in film-making
","Slevin sets a new landmark in tasteless film-making, being a foolish mix of tones and genres which actually leads nowhere. Within the frame of a tragic bloody revenge, the movies gives us a pointless love story, ultraviolent pulpfiction-like gangsters, corrupted cops, an ironic international killer who is eventually discovered to be happy at playing the father figure. The story starts as a tragedy, the climax scene (which is not the real end, of course: plenty of endings in this movie) ends it as a tragedy. In the middle we have all the above and maybe more, without a choice of style and taste. I rated it 3, but it is hard to rate a movie which is completely wrong.",3,45,94,29 August 2006
G.I. Jane," Beyond good and evil
","One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Surely,the worst war-military movie. It is very difficult to have an opinion about a movie that appears to be completely void, really beyond nice and ugly, good and evil. Everything is conventional, the plot (if any) is as interesting as a porn movie plot (and the story might be porn-some as well: one sole girl in a military base). Embarrassing acting completes the disaster, not to mention the famous 'suck my @@@@', which seems to be the distinctive note of the movie. It is probably what any spectator said while leaving the theater.Luckily, I watched it on tv for free. Needless to say, rated 1 (zero is not available).",1,18,37,20 November 2001
The Fifth Element," plastic plastic everywhere...
","Plastic plastic everywhere. Why most of the people working at a SF movie has such a miserable opinion of SF fans? This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen: the story is poor, no ideas, bad acting. Besson has forgotten the courage shown in Subway (even Lambert seemed an actor...) and steers boldly towards the Land of 1000 Colours, Lights, Magic (and a lot of Industrial interests too, if you see what I mean). And a pretty face does NOT make an actress. And why did the great Gary Oldman get trapped in such a mess? Even a stupid 'new-age-like' ending. I rated this foolish film 3, and now, please, help me find my Blade Runner vhs.",2,6,14,5 June 1999
The Dark Knight," One scene may tell it all
","A lot of users have given (and will give) a general comment to this movie. I would then focus on a scene that particularly hit me and that may be considered the perfect example that shows how far this great movie stands from the usual bang!-and-pow! superhero flicks. Stop here if you haven't seen it yet - well you should already now since there is a warning over here... Two ships with explosive charges and each detonator is in the hands of the crew of the other ship. The Joker offers them a choice: the first who presses the button will survive. Incidentally, by killing all the people on the other vessel. One ship is full of prisoners of the Gotham City Jail, the other is full of common (and supposedly honest and decent) people. In both ships the detonators are in the hands of the 'constituted power' (i.e. the Police). In the 'good ship' the power cannot handle the responsibility and let the people vote. The common people vote in favor of the slaughter (so long to any principle of respect of human life, whatsoever human life). In the 'bad ship' the power cannot face a probable rebellion of the scum and let the prisoners take over the situation (i.e. the detonator). Time is running out. A decision shall be taken. Considered the development of the movie so far, I expected another piece of tragedy to be added. But. Here comes the extremely subtle work of the writers. The prisoner in the bad ship takes the detonator and throws it in the water. In the 'good ship', after the vote, one man declares to be willing to press the button if no one else does, takes the detonator but cannot eventually complete the task, sits back and waits. The Power cannot face its responsibilities, voting may not be the solution, civilized and decent people may consider murder as an option, lifers do the unexpected. To me, much more scary than the Joker's smile.",9,2,12,21 August 2008
The Hurricane," Great acting in an under-average movie
","I had great expectations for this movie, which eventually have been disappointed. A lot of fictitious characters have been added for no apparent reason. The evil and racist policeman (Della Pesca) who prosecutes Carter even since he was a 6 years old child is one of the most silly and useless (if not detrimental) characters I ever saw in a 'based on a true story' movie. The three good Canadian Samaritans literally come from nowhere and the script should give us some ideas about them. Apparently, they succeed, as amateur detectives/lawyers, where dozens of others had failed, just because they are guided by peace love and unity. The scene in the isolation cell-block, where three different 'Hurricanes' deal one with each other to symbolize the different sides of the character's personality is a mere clichÃ¨ and, frankly, the similar scene involving Gollum in the Ring's saga had a more realistic touch (enough said, I guess). What remains, in the end: an outstanding performance of Denzel Washington, whose personal involvement in the project can be clearly perceived in his acting. Not enough to me, unfortunately. For a 'boxe&prison' movie, one could find a lot more intensity and truth in Walter Hill's 'Undisputed'.",5,0,2,17 August 2006
The Untouchables," Overrated and false as it can be
","The first time I saw this movie I felt a bit confused. It was all perfect, like a big present under the xmas tree, with the snow outside the window and a xmas carol on the background. But when I attempted to look inside the box, it was empty. This movie is definitely a lie, a well-built, very well told lie. And please, can anyone tell me when (or in which planet)policemen started wearing Armani? De Niro at its worst, always exaggerating his playing, and Costner in his favourite role: the average man who saves of the universe. If looking for a gangster movie, please refer to Once upon a time in America, save time and (if you are renting the movie) even money.",6,6,14,26 November 1999
The Matrix," A lot of running but the blade is not that sharp
","I must admit that Matrix is very amazing as a show of pure images. A lot of fx make this movie really impressive. But the basic idea (what you see is not true) is not so new. Even the idea of a bunch of freedom-seeking hackers has been often used in cyberpunk literature. The biggest limit of Matrix is the lack of courage: whenever the directors are about to cross the line of a scifi movie to enter the world of big cinema, they choose the easier way (gunfights, a bit of Bruce Lee 20 years after). And one last thing, the guy resurrected by the princess' kiss: so miserable... They tried to turn an average story into a new Blade Runner, but I'm afraid it turned out as a Luxury edition of Johnny Mnemonic. Rated 7 (to me) but Matrix does not go beyond the limit of a genre movie.",7,1,1,26 August 1999
