Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as i remembered
",It was actually very enjoyable and fun to watch. Lightsaber fights were fun and soundtracks were awesome. Yes it does have some cringe but it doesnt bother that much,7,3,3,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not that great
",Being one of the worst movie of the star wars franchise doesnt mean its bad. Without the cringe romance it would have gotten an 8. It has good action and good cgi for the time.,7,0,5,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One of the best
",A great movie overall. I really dont understand the hate this movie gets. Soundtrack is spot on like with every other star wars movie. Fight scenes are out of this world. And the dialogue isnt as cringy like with menace or attack of the clones.,9,12,13,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic movie
","An amazing classic movie everyone knows. Arguably the best sci-fi movie there is.
It changed the face of cinema forever. If you havent seen it you are missing on alot. Truly a masterpiece!!!!",9,2,3,18 November 2019
