","Million Dollar Arm By Jordon WrightIf you are looking for a sports movie that's funny and inspiring, then million-dollar arm is for you! This movie contains all the great things a movie should have, comedy, plot/background, and it's a true story. This movie is entertaining weather you know anything about sports or not.

Its very inspiration to everyone that watches this movie, which is based on a true story. The way that the characters' progress in this film is astonishing and the progress they make in baseball blows your mind how fast they do it. The main characters came from nothing one was a truck driver that worked for his dad and the other one was just going to school in India. They both had never picked up a baseball or even seen one before. They just took a chance so they could possibly get out and start a new life. They gave up everything they had and hopped on a plane to the USA to try and start their baseball carriers. Leaving behind all their family and friends and all their valuables just to try and start a new life. It is a very inspiring towards the end when you get to see how they end up doing with what they have worked so hard at.All good movies have to have some humor to them, and throughout this entire film it will keep you laugh till the very end. The way the screenwriter integrate comedy into their film is truly great you will always have a smile on your face when watching this film. The humor involved in this film is in no way inappropriate to the younger generation so all ages can watch this movie and enjoy it.All in all, I would recommend this fantastic movie to you. It has the perfect background/plot to it. Plus, it's hilarious and will have you smiling to the end. You can watch this movie with anyone even if they know nothing of sports or is very young. It's truly a great movie, and it is a must see movie.",8,0,0,2 November 2016
