Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The finale to the opus of revenge...
","While this film is much different than the first part it resolves in great form. This second movement to Tarintino's opus is more plot driven than the first parts multiple fight scene, which in some cases last over twenty minutes. We learn the past of the bride and more about the circumstances of her apparent 'death'. This second part really shines in its story telling ability, the actors are faithfully able to show us the extent of their emotions without saying a word. This is by far one of Tarintino's best, while it is not 'Pulp Fiction' the quality of the acting and the quality of the script are all there. While this movie will most likely be snubbed at the Oscars because of its release date, I truly hope voters will look at this film as one of the 'truest' movie of 2004.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," How can it be?
","How can it be that a movie triolgy so well crafted, so well thought out and so well presented, be ended with one of the greatest singular films of all time? I will say that this movie is the best movie that i have ever se, best film of the 21st century as well as quite possibly the best epic story ever to be told and presented.Tolkin a master linguist turned lituraturist has been proceded by a great director which has seen the vision the master had in mind and made it come alive formillions that had not read the epic or heard the tales first hand. This is not really a review, rather a commentary for all to read, see this movie and cherish it. You will never see another one that can match it.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
