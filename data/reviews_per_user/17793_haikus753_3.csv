Black Swan," An Ambiguous Drama Film
","Many call this a psychological thriller, sometimes even a horror film. I believe it is those two, but it is mainly a psychological drama film at heart. A psychological drama with abundant symbolism and ambiguity. It is one of the most artful and beautiful films I have ever watched, and it has honestly blown me away.Natalie Portman plays her role to sweet perfection, as do the rest of the actors and actresses. They all, especially Portman, seem to actually become the characters, and lose themselves in their roles.The direction is spotless, and the camera-work is stunning. The colors and visuals are breathtaking, and the story is quite the marvel. Not everything is fully explained throughout the film; one must interpret it. The merging of the story of the film and the story of Swan Lake was flawlessly done. Also, contrary to popular belief, the film is not actually about ballet; it is about diving into the depths of insanity in order to produce perfection. The result is not pretty, but depicted very adeptly. A second viewing is recommendable.A passionate film, it can be very unsettling and at times goes into horror territory, but this is just one of the things that makes this film such a delicious piece of mysterious, ambivalent, and intelligent art. Again, it is a psychological thriller, but one should look past the scary scenes and become immersed into the beauty and the message that lies beneath the surface.The message that lies deep inside the water, that becomes warped and blurred, and can be read in many different ways in time. The message is still there, but not clear. Yet that makes this film so fascinating and charming.Definitely 10/10 stars",10,2,5,13 October 2013
The Exorcist," Creepy, but good!
","First off, this movie was excellent. It was marvelous! It is one of the only horror films that has actually scared me. This movie is very slow, but it is well-told. And the scariest scenes were not only frightening, but some were full of impact. The acting was very believable, and the story was absolutely magnificent. This movie was not much for gore and blood, but rather for the psychological impact the viewer would receive from some scenes. Those are the main reasons on why I like this film so much. I will not go any further. I will not reveal anything from this film. I am leaving it up to the reader to decide whether or not to watch this film, and will let the reader find out for him or herself what this movie has in store for him/her. Overall, this film was excellent! 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,12 December 2010
Now You See Me," A Good Movie
","'Now You See Me' is a good movie and is definitely entertaining. There is not a whole lot else to this, though, other than those two things. I do believe this film has substance, but not too much. It is mostly just an entertaining crime thriller with some comedy and romance mixed into the equation, which spells out 'fun' for me.I like this movie, but it is not the best. Sometimes, the movie felt somewhat contrived, trying to be really smart and unique, when it really does things that have been done hundreds of times before. Now, this movie does it all fairly well, but like I said, it feels a tad bit forced sometimes. The ending had a huge twist which I sort of saw coming, because as I have said, it has been done before. It could have been done a little better, I must say. Also, I do think the film might have been more interesting had it been a more science-fantasy-like film, although that is just my opinion. The film presents an interesting concept, but the twist ending tramples on that concept a bit. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high, but whatever the case is, it is a fine flick that is great for watching with family or friends.'Now You See Me' has a great cast, consisting of mainly big-name actors and actresses. I enjoyed their acting very much. Plus, the film's special effects were superbly done, and some of the more action-like moments were very thrilling and kept you close to the screen, wanting to see what happens next. That is saying a whole bunch, considering I am not even a fan of action at all.Maybe a second viewing will change my perspective of this film, but for now, it is a solid 7 out of 10.
