Mission: Impossible III," Lost in MI:3
","MI:3, the most successful combination of commercial & action--breathe-taking and satisfying experience for more than 2 hours under the spell of the silver screen. Tom Cruise is surely use his charisma as the leading actor, but Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is the main key of the highlights. As a successful commercial trilogy, MI:3 can ensure you a exciting and worthwhile movie experience, if you are not a picky movie reader.The whole plot is a simple one. No outstanding and original ideas. Typical good-guy v.s. bad-guy action, the final reverse is also predictable. It's more touching only because for the total dark evil of the Owen Davian. The audience share the same fear with Tom Cruise while the whole movie. We are also the victims of the MI:3, and lost in the spell of J.J. Abrams.",7,1,3,26 May 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Prejudice Makes Love
","Personal favorite this year so far. Not just because I was a big fan of Jane Austin, but the delicacy and vividness within the film. A female tone with sensitivity to express the relationships among family, friends, acquaintances, and man-to-woman.One of the most memorable shots was the one when Lizzy sitting on the wheel(or tire), just wondering what's wrong that happening to her so far. Family welfare never occurred to her as an important issue, since she was a independent and mind-free woman. Somehow when she was circling and watching the world around her, her world was falling down. The well-established philosophy of her own was corrupting. Her best friend, Charlotte, came toward her as a intruder of her very mind. The bomb exploded, but still cannot help her free herself from her own stubbornness.The second shock was when Darcy told her about all the feelings for her. The scene was raining and she was in a deserted house. Darcy found her, and she was shocked by all his truths of her state. Never been so offended by such a pride man. Angry filled with her mind. She fought back with a sudden pose and meanest words to him. After his leaving, Elizabeth sighed and found herself lonelier than ever.The highlight was arranged in the end of the film. When Betsy was questioned by Lady Catherine in the middle of the night, her sleepless made her walking in the field. Different from the original story, her frankness toward Darcy occurred on the most romantic moment--dawn with glimmering and radiance of the sun. When he asked her again, she just kissed his hand, and said 'your hands are cold.' A final relief for the audience, we could see the happy ending in the end of the film. Elizabeth Bannet's prejudice made herself complete in life.",9,3,7,7 June 2006
