Sucker Punch," Action Fodder for Male generation
",Went to see this film with my girlfriend who to be honest she wasn't looking forward to it. I had seen trailer and thought it looked excellent and being a fan of Zak Snyder was expecting a lot from it. On entering cinema and taking our seats I did notice two old men sitting in front of us (you can guess what they where there to see). It did deliver with an orgy of action which was pleasing to the eye especially with an all female cast rather than the usual male dominated action flicks. The problem is I could see why some people might find the story hard to follow with most if not all the action being played out in the mind of the lead girl Baby doll. It also had the look of a computer game at times with added slow-mo which I find appealing as effects and CGI can be hard to make out when moving fast (Spider man 3 shame on you).Overall I would recommend this film not to anyone (girl friend fell asleep) but mostly men and young teens looking for some eye candy and tons of action. I look forward now with confidence for Zak Snyders version of Superman Man Of Steel,5,10,21,20 April 2011
Thor," Return To Form For Marvel
","An absolute breathtaking movie a true blockbuster. I opted to see this in the 2D version and it did not disappoint. I was slightly weary of Kenneth Branagh directing, there is a lot to get through as Thor is an actual god with awe-inspiring powers and a rich back story. This is the sort of material that has to be handled with care and Branagh does it justice and more.This is by far the biggest thing Marvel has attempted, its fantasy on a cosmic scale. With a pre-credit stint in New Mexico to a 30 minute sequence in Asgard where we meet all the major players Thor, his brother Loki and their father Odin (a superb Anthony Hopkins). With vast tracking shots through the stunning Asgardian landscapes and unbelievable battle sequences with a race of Frost Giants, its hard to see any other super hero film match this.Chris Hemsworth plays Thor amazingly, once banished to Earth this is when he comes into his own. Adding new layers of humility and humour to his blustering God of Thunder, the fish out of water works like a charm. Hemsworth emerges a true star, adept at action and good with comedy.The film leaves you with intrigue at seeing Hemsworth on screen with Downey Jr. and Chris Evans in next years The Avengers. On that note I would say watch after the end credits for a cameo tie-in to The Avengers.I recommend this to anyone and dare you not to like it kids and adults alike. Everyone has to see this spectacle.",8,1,10,26 April 2011
