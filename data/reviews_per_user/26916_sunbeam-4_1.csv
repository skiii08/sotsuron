The Blair Witch Project," Where the F___ do I start?
","Dear Blair Witch Producers, Writers, Actors, etc. - How do I Hate Thee - Let me count the ways.Lets just put it this way...Anyone who was really scared by this so-called movie needs some help, and it ain't physical.Maybe by leaving out all the F'ing language, it would seem a little bit scary, but the stupid adolescent language actually made the thing funny. Turned it into a comedy of sorts. And then the actors getting hysterical at every little occurrence didn't help make it believable. Just F'ing childish. To borrow a word from the script. I was thinking of playing the thing back and just counting the F's and S's used. Might be fun. Sorry I couldn't rate it higher, but my 1 was the most popular vote given... I don't feel alone. Would I watch it over again...yeah...If you paid me. A loyal IMDb fan.",1,1,4,29 December 2004
