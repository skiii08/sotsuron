The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," waste of time and money
","This is my first review ever, just because the movie was so terribly lousy that i had an urge to write something... There are hundreds of movies where you have to suppress the tears just by hearing some cello, or some emotional acting. In this one...even they try soooo hard... there is absolutely nothing... no emotions at all, no sparks nothing... just never ending meaningless conversations. (Sadly not even the music can fix that) It really is nothing more than a preview for Part 2, which I certainly won't go to watch it... I wonder how it can get so many positive reviews.... are people really that easy to satisfy, or am i asking to much of a good movie",2,56,98,20 November 2014
