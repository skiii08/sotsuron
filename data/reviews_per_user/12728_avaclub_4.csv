The Avengers," The Avengers ∞ Synonyms to Iron Man 3 ∞
","The First question- Does 'The Avengers' is a film of six superheroes? Answer is NO. The movie is heavily based on the power and skills of IRON MAN and later followed by Hulk; all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember. Since Captain America, Hawkeye & Natasha don't have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as avengers is concerned. Even the possibility of emotional connects between Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Natasha was missing. Also Steve Rogers(Captain America) was struggling to make a presence with other super powers.If one has to term The Avengers as Ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax it's he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues (some of them are really cool). The auto removal of his iron-suit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where Loki pushed him from the heights, the way his Iron suit came, auto activated and became his body-suit was awesome. Thou Hulk was entertaining but he came into his 'Smashing Avatar' only after half the way movie has past. The way he beaten up the 'Loki' after his comments of being a God was really enjoyable But Joss Whedon, the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes. Also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes; it's only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level. When we talk about visual effects, cinematography, production value, 3D version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising. Regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with Ironman which makes you smile followed by Hulk. Tom Hiddlestone as Loki and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha were impressive. Rest all were limited in role to mention.Overall it's a good weekend watch especially for Ironman and Hulk Fans but may not live up to the hype created. Walt Disney is gradually learning to tap South-Asian markets by pre releasing the movies here after the debacle of John Carter(thou a good movie) ;Hope this will worked out.Thanks & Regards AVA TheCritiqueLab.com",7,5,12,30 April 2012
Skyfall," SKYFALL +++ Zero Zero Zero not 007 +++
","SKYFALL – A James Bond brand new chapter where many lessons of bond series seems to be partially written or forgotten like the quintessential '3S' elements of Bond series –SPEED ,STYLE & STORY.Skyfall opens with an extraordinary adventure sequence in Turkey followed by a brilliantly picturised track song by Adele. But further movie FALL like an apple from SKY and collapsed with few Jumps in Between.SKYFALL is extremely slow in terms of narration, expect the first 15 minutes it fails to keep the same pace to the rest of the movie. Its background score impresses you at places and at places it fails to generate the high octane excitement of Bond Sam Mendes, the Director of the SKYFALL seems to be work hard to make the classic adventure as dark as it used to be but the screenplay is such a weak part of the movie that it doesn't return what you have expected. For e.g. : Bond get shot twice in the beginning one at the right shoulder during initial chase and the second when Eve shot him accidentally, but surprisingly in the next scene of the movie he is perfectly all right lying in bed with lady and wine. Also one would think why the movie name is titled as SKYFALL, thou in the end audience gets the hint but it was funny at least not justifiable for a spy movie.Cinematography –Yeah this one area which scores 10/10, Roger Deakins has done incredibly an outstanding Job. Visual Effects by the team is also impressing. Overall, in SKYFALL has some colors of rainbow bright, few are shady and rest are invisible. For the Hardcore Bond series Lover this could be a treat without toppings.READ FULL REVIEW ON www.thecritiquelab.com",2,6,13,2 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Best reinvented Superhero franchisee
","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) who is exploring himself in his childhood and teenage came across the old leather case of his father which unveiled the world of his anxiety for genetic science and possibility of cross breeds .His anxiety led him to meet Dr.Curt Connors at Oscorp who is working on regeneration serum. His experiment is expected to bring out revolution in the health science but one missing equation stops him to achieve his dream which becomes a cause of worry for his project sponsor Dr. Ratha (Irfan Khan) who is continuously pressuring Dr Connors (Rhys Ifans) to complete the project as soon as possible. Peter Parker being curious followed Dr. Ratha to his secret chambers where he find his destiny i.e. the classic spider bite  . Meanwhile Peter shared the missing equation of the experiment with Dr Connors which he learnt from his father white papers that could decide the future of cross breed and organ regeneration and the reason for which Peter Parker has to transform as SPIDERMAN.No doubt James Vanderbilt & his team worked extraordinarily in terms of story and screenplay to reboot & revitalize the Spiderman series. What worked in the amazing Spiderman is the innocence of the characters whether it's the Spiderman, Gwen Stacy, Mr. & Mrs. Parker and even the main villain of the movie, the Lizard. All characters remain true to their core without being dramatize, there is pure humane feeling while watching the characters as they feel & sense the same as we. The events seem to be more realistic and possible in nature.Dr.Marc Webb has done incredibly good job to relive the stale franchisee into a fresh storyline with the apt combination of humor, emotions, romance, adventure and very important more practical treatment of characters and story. For this movie audience has to clear that the first part of the amazing Spiderman has lot of layers to be opened in the forthcoming sequels like the character Dr. Ratha and the secrets of Peter Parker Parents. First part is more of an introduction to establish the baseline for the future stories. Overall The Amazing Spiderman gives you the perfect summer adventurous treat for kids & families alike, this one you should not miss it!For complete review please visit www.thecritiquelab.comThanks & Regards Yours AVA Thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome",9,1,4,3 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises - May Long Live the Legend !
","A man in his dark chambers living under the blanket of guilt from the last eight years find it hard to face the light (truth) of his existence, the purpose for which he spent his life to ensure the smiles of Gotham City's Citizens, the purpose for which he fought and the purpose for which he will rise again from the dark- The Batman or I Must say Christopher Nolan's BatmanThe canvas of the movie is larger than you expected and has truly made this trilogy larger than life experience. This is one movie which proudly and successfully mocks at 3D Movies because the cinematic experience of the dark knight rises has truly been class apart. The first half of the movie is a bit slow on ride thou making the platform for Bruce Wayne to introspect himself regarding the purpose and need of his life for Gotham City but once he is in his suits , the ride has no stops, no traffic signals what left behind was Just excitement and Wow Factor.How far one's imagination and hard work could go to make a superhero movie , truly a superhero movie than Nolan scores perfectly 10/10. He made us believe that superhero could be human and anyone could be a Batman with an intention of doing right & kind from the soul. The same are villains –real world criminals-no monsters, no aliens, no robots or computer generated devils. The character sketch of each actor has been defined clearly and perfectly executed.The difference between a hero and a superhero is very thin and that demarcation has been clearly and cleverly been drafter out by Nolan's (Both Brothers). The technology and science made felt real the way it has been transformed on screen whether it's a Batman motoride or flying plane or the nuclear machine without being too futuristic.This is one movie which scores a perfect 10 on background score(Hans Zimmer) which echoes even after you left theatres( esp. the prisoners' anthem ) and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is simply outstanding.Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises is one of the perfect conclusions of a superhero Trilogy and with its extraordinary climax it makes sure the death of Bruce Wayne but ensures the Rise of the Legend(s).
