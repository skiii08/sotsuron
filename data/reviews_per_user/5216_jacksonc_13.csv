The Blair Witch Project," Overly hyped pile of horse manure
","Some observations:Anyone who thinks this movie is scary has lived a sheltered life, indeed.Those who gave this dreck anything higher than a '5' probably bought pet rocks when they were on the market.This flick will go down in history as another 'Billy Jack.' (Remember it was getting high ratings for the first few years.)As far as one of the producers saying he noticed people vomiting after having seen the movie, they were probably made physically ill at having thought of being ripped off like they had been.This flick sucks beyond words....",1,74,136,25 June 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Absolute waste of time and money (yours, not theirs)
","The fact that this rancid pile of fetid dog feces has managed to fool as many people as it has is proof (yet again) that P.T. Barnum was right.
A previous reviewer nailed it when he said that there were no professional performers and no plot. Nothing else need be said - well just one thing. Check out the difference between the arithmetic mean and the weighted average on IMDb. This will tell you how many people were incensed enough to pan this debacle of a movie over and over...",1,18,36,10 March 2001
The Blair Witch Project," no plot, no sex, no violence, no nothing...
","The fact that over 50% of the respondents gave this foul pile ofsteaming bovine feces six  or higher proves that the drug problem(in  the USA as well as other places) is worse than commonlybelieved. The thirteen people on the IMDb staff who gave it an average of 7.2may need to be randomly tested...Oh, there is nothing wrong with the movie; the only trouble is, thereis nothing right with it, either. There is NOTHING there. And spareme the comments about 'using your imagination.' This thing is a waste of time and money...",1,8,14,28 July 2002
The Blair Witch Project," a complete waste of time and money
","How this puerile piece of putrid dog manure came to be rated as highly as it has been is still more proof that P.T. Barnum was right (about there being a sucker born every minute). Only now, with more population, it is probably more like every few seconds.However, the principals will get rich from it, which offers still further proof that life is not fair. If, as I did, you get 'persuaded' into watching it by your significant other, be advised that the first twenty minutes are all you need to watch. The rest of this opus merely repeats the first twenty minutes over and over and over and over and over....",1,2,4,14 December 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Some compare this dreck to Deliverance (?!?)
","I have noticed that some people have compared this to Deliverance. I suppose that there is some room for that. For example:In Deliverance, Ned Beatty's character is physically sodomized.In Blair Witch Project, we (the viewers) are monetarily and chronologically sodomized.",1,1,3,28 May 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Less there than meets the eye...
","There seems to be as many people who like this flick as there are those who don't. Therefore, I have created the following probable profile of those who like it:            1. They read a certain men's magazine for the articles.            2. They prefer that most things be left to the imagination.3. They believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus.4. P. T. Barnum would have loved them all.Here is my probable profile of those who don't like it:1. They believe little they hear and about half of what they see.2. Some people would call them cynical. They believe that all people's actions are motivated by self interest.3. They do not want to be standing downwind of whatever a certain satellite provider's reviewer must have been smoking when he/she gave the Blair Witch Project three and a half stars...4. P.T. Barnum would not have liked them very much...",1,1,3,25 December 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Beware of your satellite provider's rating...
","Over 2,000 people so far have seen fit to take the time to comment on this film. Most of you do not have the time to read even a few, let alone all, of them. So you rely on some other reviewer(s). Be warned: my satellite rating system has given the annoying, time wasting 'ooga-booga' 1.5 hours of nonsense a 3 and a half star rating. Do not be deceived. This thing aspirates (that's a p.c. term for sucks)...",1,1,3,25 December 1999
The English Patient," Watching it is punishment - a root canal, etc.
","Watching this thing is punishment, pure and simple. It doesn't do anything and it takes a long time not doing it. If prison inmates were made to watch this, it would be an 8th amendment violation.Yes, I notice that my favorite movie critic gave it four stars and I notice that IMDb's 'weighted average' is 7.2. That just proves that Lincoln was right when he said you can fool some of the people all the time (and all of the people some of the time). Or is it just me? No, surely not!I'd rather watch Starship Troopers three times than this thing once, whatever that says about me...",1,17,34,19 December 1999
Full Metal Jacket," The best movie about boot camp EVER
","A few people complained about the language. THAT IS HOW A Drill Instructor TALKS (OR TALKED). Many complain about the second half of the film. There's some justification there. I did, however, know at least one man like the helicopter gunner. To sum up, you may notice that most of the people who comment about the movie were Marines. Regarding the overall veracity of this movie, that should tell you all you need to know....",10,0,0,9 January 1999
American Beauty," one of the all time greats - see it if you can.
","To paraphrase football coach Bum Phillips, this movie may not be in a class by itself, but it doesn't take long to call the roll.Criticized by some, perhaps justifiably, as glorifying drug use and sex, it is nevertheless thought provoking on several levels. See it if you can...",10,0,0,15 December 1999
Where Eagles Dare," Worth watching more than once
","This is a good one; indeed, one of the best. It also has many good one-liners. One of the absolute best (I won't give away the context) occurs when Burton (after one of the villains says that his spy trial would be 'painful') says, 'Yes, almost as painful as that long drop to the end of the rope.'",Null,1,1,28 June 1999
The Wizard of Oz," an immortal, eternal classic...
","What can I say about this one that has not already been said?'I'll get you, my pretty, you and your little dog, too.''How about a little fire, scarecrow?''We won't kill them just yet. We'll let them think about it a while.'Okay, so there are nit picking things wrong with it - like the scarecrow getting the Pythagorean theorem wrong. So what? It is still one of the defining greats, an unqualified masterpiece.By the way, does anyone know any details about the satirical nature of Baum's story? I have heard that Dorothy was supposed to be the voting public, etc. I'd love to know who the witches were supposed to have represented... (email jacksonc@tstar.net)",10,1,2,16 September 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Definitely worth watching...
","Despite several errors of continuity and so forth (it makes no pretense of being a documentary), this is worth one's time and money.Regarding people who are offended at one thing or another about this movie (and there is something for just about everyone in this regard if you want to dwell on them), they need to (a) get a life and/or (b) stop sweating the small stuff...",10,1,1,13 March 2001
