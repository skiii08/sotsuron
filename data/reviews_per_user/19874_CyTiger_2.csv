Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It ROCKS!
","The entire Star Wars saga are the most anticipated series of movies of all time. I went to see the movie in Burlington, VT. The theatre has the movie on 2 screens. I saw the second show on the second screen at 10:30 AM on the opening day. The movie was totally awesome. George Lucas really did come up with all the stuff in the movie exactly how he wanted it when he couldn't before with the original trilogy. (Not including the Special Edition trilogy) Lucas has made the whole movie very interesting for all ages to see. There were a lot of computer animation in the movie which were very realistic. I agree that Jar Jar Binks is  whiny , however he wasn't as whiny as C-3PO was in the original trilogy. I was totally amazed at how Lucasfilm, Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound put together all the special effects and sound effects together in the movie. I'm amazed how they all blend together. I'm NOT disappointed with Lucas' work in 'The Phantom Menace' as I totally disgree with the movie critics. I say that this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Driven," CART fans are disappointed with the flick!
","Just caught a Matinee on 4/30/01 at 1 PM, only three other people were in the theatre with me. Too bad I'm not 13 anymore because that's how old I would have had to be to really enjoy it. Most of my complaints are similar to other CART racing fans. My favorte gaffes: The street scene, no I'm not going to bother complaining about it being in the film, but I just wonder who started the cars? Champ cars don't have starters. You have to have someone start the car from behind the car with a starter.Champ Cars as Lawn Darts while crashing and flying into the air.I think they meant to make a golfong film due to the abundance of water hazards. Champ cars run on methanol. Methanol doesn't burn in water!You don't need to clutch these cars.CART Driving 101 cars fitting in with the real cars as seemlessly as one side of the Grand Canyon fits with the other.That Alex Barron spin at the end looked sooooooooo fake.He's passing Michael Andretti in the #20 Visteon car! Well I guess they couldn't have said Memo Moreno was passing Roberto Moreno without explanations. The coin scene. What did they do, coat the tires with a fast drying epoxy? That scene was bulls***. Anyhow, no one was expecting next year's Oscar winning Best Picture, were they? At $5.75, I didn't feel ripped off. As for Box office success, Look who they beat: 1. Driven 2. Bridget Jones's Diary 3. Spy Kids 4. Along Came a Spider 5. Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles 6. Blow 7. Town and Country 8. The Forsaken 9. Joe Dirt 10. Freddy Got Fingered Nobody. The real test for a movie so heavily promoted, opening against zero competition, is to see what happens the second weekend after people tell their friends about it. Jean Alesi had a cameo apperace, shaking Stallone's hand before he got into the car. I spotted Jacques Villeneuve though. Overall, I agree with all the movie critics that this movie is a dud!",3,1,2,6 May 2001
