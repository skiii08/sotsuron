Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What a great film, irony and satire in abundance
","Firstly, I think it's important to point out that the actor/comedian starring in this film is in fact Jewish himself. I know several members of the Jewish community who have seen this film and couldn't stop laughing from start to finish! If people choose to take this as a 'real' documentary, then that is where the problems of viewing pleasure will start. If however, the viewing public accept that this is a film that discovers the raw heart of American views towards the rest of the world, then the film is one to be enjoyed over and over again! I won't name scenes (no spoilers remember!), but Sascha had the nerve and audacity to follow through some scenes which are very (very) close to the knuckle, yet managed to entertain throughout. However, I imagine the American viewing public will have problems watching certain aspects of this film, as it eats away at foreign policy and views on the rest of the world. 9/10 for me!!!!",9,0,4,14 November 2007
