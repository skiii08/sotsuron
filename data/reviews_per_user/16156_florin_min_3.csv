Ford v Ferrari," Sometimes the Man is just a boy
","Who cares about history? Dracula is not real he is just a fiction. So Ford vs Ferrari is something to feel good, to think you are a man but you are just a boy. Cars, intrigues, money, transactions, Ford, Ferrari you have everything in the same pool. You are not happy? Leave us! Good to see 'Tano Caridi' after many years. Overall a very good movie.",10,1,2,27 November 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," I cried in 1991 and I Cried today
","During and after the movie the life is beautiful. There is Queen and others. Always. When I will die I want to have singing the Bohemian Rhapsody. The movie is brilliant. The actors, well are they actors or The real Queen? Day of my life believe me.",10,4,6,4 November 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Good to be back on track
","Probably the 2nd best after the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Good story, very well 2 new characters implemented with a bonus for young actress, glad to be back Will Turner. The visual effects on spot.The end after many viewers where already gone was on Jones. But overall the story was close to ideal. Hope to see no. 6 soon.",10,4,12,28 May 2017
