The Blair Witch Project," Definitely Worth Seeing
","My wife and I saw this movie recently and both agreed that it was certainly an effective and eerie movie. While it will not 'scare' adults (does anything scare adults?) it does manage to make one remember the childhood feeling of being scared of something one cannot see. The idea is a very good one and the execution is flawless. Viewers of this movie seem to be split into two camps: those who love it and those who just 'don't get it.' I think the problem for the latter group is that they cannot let themselves get involved in a movie to the degree required by this movie or have never really been alone in the woods for an extended period of time. I camp in the woods quite regularly and appreciate both the awe and fear that nature can inspire. To enjoy this movie, one only need appreciate that every Hollywood cliche has been studiously avoided, appreciate the method acting, and enjoy the unexpected ending. The ending is scary because you're expecting (dying, actually, by that time) to see something, but what you finally see is scarier than what you thought you were going to see. This is one of the few movies in a long time to end EXACTLY where it should. It will be interesting to see if the Academy remembers this enjoyable and extremely effective exercise in fear when it is time to hand out awards!",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
