The Avengers," Review - The Avengers
","I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, 'The Avengers kicks ass.' I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the 'prequels' mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)",9,30,56,1 July 2012
Men in Black 3," Review - Men in Black III
","It's been fifteen years since the entertaining first Men in Black film, and ten years since the flawed yet still slightly enjoyable sequel Men in Black II. Now comes the third installment in the series, Men in Black III. Of course, this sequel, like any sequel of this kind, especially having been made a decade after its last predecessor, gave me a few doubts before watching it. However, I finally saw it in the theater today, and I enjoyed it. Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have returned to the screen, and they deliver some nice and witty entertainment.The film starts out on a prison on the moon, called Lunarmax (which is next to the original lander and American flag from the Apollo mission), from which the antagonist, Boris the Animal, escapes. In 1969, Boris encountered Agent K, who shot his arm off and had him arrested, and also set up some sort of defense system to protect the earth from any invasions by Boris' alien race. Boris, having escaped from prison, travels back in time to this incident and kills K, altering the MIB agency and putting earth in danger (the protection system no longer exists - Boris stopped it from getting set up in the past). So now, in the present, Agent J must travel back in time to prevent Boris from causing all this and restore the real timeline. There's more to the story, but I won't spoil it.Luckily, Men in Black III isn't just a typical modern generic blockbuster. I even had a feeling that the movie was going to try and skate by with great effects but a thin story, but luckily it didn't. Yes, it is a blockbuster, but it does retain the imaginatively and wit of the original Men in Black. The movie has a lot of the tone that the original MIB films had, and some things haven't changed, and a lot of things have. For example, the character Zed has recently died, and female Agent O has taken his place. Even Danny Elfman's music is a bit different, although it does retain the main themes of the series. The special effects are better than ever, and we even have a few new things of technology, such as interesting and awesome single-wheeled vehicles (as seen in the still above), and (obviously) the time travel technology. And best of all are the characters and their relationships and interaction, which is where the real magic, and humor, of the movie is. In his journey in this movie, J meets the younger K of 1969 (played by Josh Brolin). Another character that I like is Griff, an alien who is able to see 4-dimensionally, and can see the many possible timelines that the future can follow. We even have a brief scene at the end of the film that adds a new and somewhat emotional dimension to the relationship of J and K, but I won't spoil it.Like I said in my review of The Avengers, I'm now going to the theater more often. I started of my summer with The Avengers, and now I've seen my second film for this summer. Men in Black III does have a few flaws, but they're not worth discussing, and they really didn't bother me. The 106 running length of the movie pretty much flew by. The film is not great or anything (it's definitely only a three-star film, in my opinion), it's only okay, but it's pretty entertaining. Performances are good, and the actors really bring out their characters. Danny Elfman's music score is good. And, like I said before, the special effects are great, and they contribute effectively to the story and the film overall. The technology in the film is nice, and the aliens and monsters, especially the villain, were well designed and excellently goofy and bizarre, like they're supposed to be. And yes the film is a comedy, and it lives up to that name - the humor is good and smart. As for the time travel, it's not completely accurate, but that's typical in this movie, and it can be forgiven because of it's wit and likable characters, among other things. This sequel is unnecessary, yes, and it could have been disappointing, but luckily it wasn't.It may sound like I loved the movie, but I didn't. I just though it was okay. But still, it's funny, goofy, entertaining, witty, and, in my opinion, just as good as the first Men in Black movie. I'm glad I saw it in the theater.My Rating: *** (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",7,0,2,2 July 2012
Unbreakable," Review - Unbreakable
","A year after the hit success of The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan re-casts Bruce Willis and re-applies his unique film formula for Unbreakable. He succeeds in providing a second demonstration of the very unique suspenseful and emotional dramatic mystery thrillers he had become known for. He sets an excellent balance between supernaturality and the real world while also focusing heavily on character and family dynamics. In several ways, besides the casting of Bruce Willis, the film is very similar to The Sixth Sense â€“ for example, the plot follows a very similar formula with similar types of plot points, and both movies take place in Philadelphia. But the formula is applied to a different genre. Also, Bruce Willis is not the only star. He is starring along with Samuel L. Jackson, whom he also starred with in Die Hard 3.Bruce Willis is now bald, and his character, David Dunn, a stadium security guard, is not a walking dead person, like Malcolm Crowe in Sixth Sense. David is very much alive, even following a lethal train wreck at the inciting incident near the beginning, in which all the passengers die except for him. What's more, he was completely unbroken not a single scratch, let alone any injuries. Soon after, he finds a note on his windshield asking him a question which really starts him thinking about his seemingly lucky survival, especially after he meets the writer of the note, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson).Elijah is a gallery owner who loves, and finds importance in, comic books, especially those about superheroes. He even finds connections between comic book stories and real life, and is a firm believer in it. All his life, Elijah has had a disorder in which his bones are extremely weak, easily breakable, for which he was called 'Mr. Glass' by other kids while growing up. He wonders that if he is at one end of the spectrum, where his bones break easily, couldn't there be somebody at the other end of the spectrum, who never gets sick, never gets hurt, is practically unbreakable? This is why he seeks out David, and finally meets him about half an hour into the film, after learning the details of his survival from the train wreck. After this, the story begins to pick up speed and venture more into the concept of the film: superheroes, comic books, and possible unbreakablilty (David). The movie does contain a few elements from comic book stories (but not in written boxes), all mixed with Shyamalan's formula, reality, suspense, and other elements. It's a cool story.I have to say, I kind of like M. Night Shyamalan's type of films. I don't really love any of his films, but they are worth watching, especially Signs. He has a very unique way of storytelling, and he provides the correct type balance between character, emotion, suspense, reality, supernaturality, and all other aspects. He knows what mysteries to answer or to leave hanging. He knows how to make something or some event believable even though it would never happen in real life (en example in Unbreakable is when David's son, Josepsh, has his father's gun and wants to shoot him â€“ which he doesn't â€“ to prove that he is unbreakable). He knows the best time to reveal little bits of important information, adding to the suspense, and he is great at placing important plot points and symbolic things within seemingly everyday appearance, dialogue, and description.The concept, which is prying into reality, is not always or totally noticed believed amongst the characters and their families, but it is evident, and it really reflects in their emotions and behaviors. And resolutions are also strong and clearly reflected and evident emotionally in character and family dynamics. Shyamalan is an expert at this. And his formula can probably be used for almost any subject matter, even things in plain real life. I know he's gone downhill lately, especially with Airbender, but he has been successful in the past, and I'm betting he's still got potential now. I think he should really use his potential and get back up to where he was, and that people should stop pounding and avoiding him and just give him a chance, and acknowledgment for his four best films (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village).",8,0,0,9 July 2012
Citizen Kane," Review - Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane has been lauded the best film ever made by many people. Do I particularly agree? No. But nonetheless, I think it is a great movie. It has some of the dated characteristics of cinema of it's period, the 1940's, but a lot of it's characteristics are still strong nowadays. I understand that the plot has some parallels to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst, but I don't know all that much about him, so I'm going to talk about only the film, which is great itself. The film is an important figure in the history of cinema, technologically and in terms of storytelling.The story is really not all that complicated, but the way it unfolds is great and engaging, and almost makes it seem complex, and it's told from a number of perspectives. The film opens up with the death of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the owner of the Inquirer, a New York newspaper. Just before dying, Kane utters the word 'Rosebud'. Then an approximately ten minute long newsreel summarizes the story of Kane, representing the public's view of him, and an overview of the story. Then, for the rest of the film, we are shown more details and depth of the story via flashbacks as news reporters go around and obtain information about Kane and his life.For those of you who haven't seen the film, I won't fully spoil it for you. I'll just give an overview. Kane achieved success and rose to power, but eventually suffered a major blow to his reputation, and he crashed. Along the way, he even gets married and divorced twice. With the aid of his closest friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Kane starts builds a nationwide newspaper empire. He is ruthless as he achieves this, yet generous at the same time in a few ways, such as being willing to lose a million dollars a year to gain more newspaper circulation. Eventually, he runs for a political position, but his success to this is lost as his rival uncovers his affair with a 'singer', and after this, his reputation is destroyed and his life's success declines. There is more to the story, but, like I said, I'm only giving a summary; I'm not giving the full story away, for those of you who haven't seen the film.All the while, we, the audience, and the reporters in the film, wonder who Kane really was, not just the story of the events of his life, from his rise to his fall, but who he really was underneath. They believe that a key to finding this out lies in his dying word, 'Rosebud'. At one point in the film, a reporter, Thompson, says, about the word, 'Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost.' At another point, someone (I don't remember who) says, 'I don't think one word can describe one man's life'. The entire movie is a puzzle, a puzzle of Kane's life, and not just that, but of who he really was (for lack of a better, deeper term). 'Rosebud' is just one piece, a missing piece, of that puzzle, but it may be an important piece. Although, then again, maybe not. We do eventually find out what the word represents and what its origin is, and it represents one of the important messages of the movie, but I won't spoil it for, again, those of you who haven't seen the film.The film is great in terms of its storytelling. In addition to its storytelling, the film is also an important point in cinema in terms of a few other factors, such as cinematography. One of the most striking of the cinematographic effects is this stark contrast between brightness and darkness. Also notable are the camera angles - which create many unique shots throughout the film - and the use of deep focus, enabling images both in the back ground and the foreground to stay clear in focus. I also liked the music score. Bernard Herrmann, who also composed the score for Psycho (1960), created an effective score with very good combinations and uses of harmony, orchestration, melody, and other musical elements, and really supports the drama and moods of the film.So, in summary, while I personally don't think Citizen Kane is the best film ever made, I did find it to be great. Watching it was a very good experience for me. It's great in terms of storytelling and technical aspects, and, overall, like I've said, it's a great piece of cinema, and an important landmark in cinema history.My Rating: **** (out of ****)",10,4,6,2 July 2012
Tangled," Review - Tangled
","I loved Disney when I was a kid. After the blue and white Disney logo (which has been changed since then), I would sit back and enjoy adventure, fantasy, castles, romance, sword fights, songs, magic spells, talking animals, and...well, you get the idea! I used to watch and re-watch several of their animated films. I have to admit, even now that I'm no longer a Disney lover, I still have to admit that I still consider many of their old animated films (including the ones I've listed above) to be good. In fact, I've given many of these films either three, three-and-a-half, or four star ratings. Nowadays, the only animated Disney films I've really been interested in have been Pixar films. But I have to admit, I really enjoyed Tangled, which I saw for the first time last week.At the beginning, a queen is gravely ill, but is cured by the powers of a magic flower. Soon afterward, she bears a baby girl, Rapunzel, who actually inherits the magic flower's powers. However, baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel, who wants to stay young via the magic healing powers within Rapunzel's hair, so she raises Rapunzel in a tower. Now a teenager, Rapunzel's hair is extremely long, and she has spent her entire life in the tower, and is curious about the outside world. One day, a thief named Flynn Rider, who is on the run, scales the tower and hides inside, and is taken captive by Rapunzel. She hides the tiara he has recently stolen and agrees to give it back only if he takes her to the place where the floating lights appear on her birthday each year. On this journey, she truly discovers the outside world, and, eventually, who she really is.The story isn't original, and it's a bit predictable, but that's not a problem at all. Besides, this is true for many of Disney's animated films. But it's a good story, and Disney takes it and applies unique and memorable elements and charm to it, and some songs too. Disney even draws ideas and elements from some of its previous films. I think it's safe to say that Tangled is a mix of past and present in terms of Disney. It contains a lot of old Disney-type elements, formats, and methods of storytelling among other things, but with the application of modern CGI animation, and some other modern elements.I was expecting this film to be geared more towards kids, but it's actually a good film for anyone. It is very much a family movie. Sure, there are some kid-oriented elements, and some slapstick humor that the kids would enjoy, but there are also things that adults would appreciate; even the more childish elements I just mentioned are not so extreme, and are perfectly enjoyable for adults. The film has a lot of good humor, but it also has a good sense of character, story, depth, and emotion. The characters are not flat, but are actually very good, and so are the relationships between them. The characters are truly lovable, especially Flynn and Rapunzel (and of these two, especially the latter), and offer genuine emotion. Their attitudes and personalities contain both older and modern elements. There are even a couple of hilarious sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and a horse named Maximus (my favorite of which was the latter).CGI technology and effects have progressed even further since this film came out, but still, the animation in this film is beautiful. Everything is well designed, and with great detail and scope - the characters, the scenery, Rapunzel's hair...everything. And this animation is not just eye candy - it's used wisely, and it actually works well with the script and helps with the emotion and narrative, like it's supposed to. The film offers some very memorable things (characters, scenes, images, and much more) including a truly unforgettable, visually beautiful, and emotionally powerful scene involving floating lanterns.The voice actors all put on good performances, especially Mandy Moore as Rapunzel. They all really bring their characters to life. The music in this film is good, both the songs and the standard underscore. The songs could have been better, but they are pretty good and perfectly enjoyable as they are, especially 'When Will My Life Begin?' (sung by Rapunzel about five minutes into the film) and 'I See the Light' (sung by Rapunzel and Flynn during the lantern scene I mentioned in the last paragraph). I really have to give the filmmakers a major thumbs up for Rapunzel herself. She is very well designed (especially her hair), and is absolutely beautiful. And not only that, she is hot. Her personality and liveliness are very attractive as well, and she really captures the heart. She and Flynn are great together, and their romantic relationship is handled very well - it's not corny, it's actually charming and emotional (and, yes, with bits of humor here and there).The film is good as it is, but it still could have been better. The one criticism I do have is that there are some things about the story and characters, especially in the third act, that I think could have been handled better and given more depth, and should have involved more character complexity. However, despite this, the film works, and it does have a pretty good sense of depth, character, humor, and emotion as it is. It combines and balances all of its elements pretty well. You laugh when you're supposed to, cry when you're supposed to, etc.Overall, Tangled isn't great, but it's good, and, in my opinion, one of the best Disney animated features in years. It's funny, charming, clever, witty, solid, and full of heart and soul, and I'm actually considering buying the DVD.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of****)",9,1,3,31 August 2012
District 9," Review - District 9
","Personally, I am a bit of a science fiction lover. I have seen tons of sic-fi films, from fun and lighthearted popcorn flicks to deep and emotional ones. I've seen clichÃ©d and basic-formula ones, and ones that have a distinct uniqueness about them - new worlds, unique scientific concepts, memorable scientific technology and what not, and much more; and, best of all, unique twists on stories. District 9 is one such unique science fiction film. It has several obvious clichÃ©d and borrowed aspects, but overall it's a somewhat creative film, and pretty memorable, too. I didn't see it when it came out, and, in fact, I had never even heard of it until sometime last year. So, after reading a bit about the film, yet still not knowing much about it, I decided to give it a try in May (yes, this year), and I'm glad I did.District 9 eludes many expectations of a sic-fi audience. The film is set in an alternate timeline, where, in 1982, a spaceship appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa (instead of a usual sci-fi setting). The aliens on board, instead of being evil and strong with an urge do kill, are helpless and in weak condition. The aliens, unable to operate the ship anymore, are taken to a temporary camp on the ground underneath where the ship is hovering. Unfortunately, due to the the high population of these aliens, and to typical political flaws, over the years, the temporary camp eventually turns into a giant slum segregated from the rest of Johannesburg. Also, the initial welcome wears off, and humans begin to discriminate against the aliens, nicknamed 'prawns' due to their ugly appearance. Finally, in 2010, the Multi-National United munitions corporation is sent to evict these prawns from the slum, with Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In the process, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical, at which point his personal nightmare begins and everything changes drastically for him, and the story really starts to get going and unfold. I won't give anything else away about the story after this last thing: along the way, Wikus befriends an alien, and his small son.District 9 combines dosages of the man-befriends-other-race-and-turns-against-his-own-people theme, the don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover moral, political elements, elements of racism, segregation, and discrimination, and a bit of E. T. and some other themes. It uses its running time wisely and tells its story very effectively. Some of the film is in documentary-style, and part of it is in regular style, and there are even some shots seen here and there from security cameras, and things like that. Visually, the film has a gritty, ugly look about it, adds brilliantly to the tone of the film, and gives it a bit of a more realistic feel to it. Even the aliens themselves are pretty ugly, but they are very well portrayed with top-notch CGI. In fact, all of the special effects in the film are very good. Clinton Shorter composed a very effective score for this film. It's not a great score or anything, but it does help bring out the tone and emotion of the film, just like the special effects do.There is not a single actor in the film whom I have heard of before seeing this film. However, the actors' performances are pretty good. The actors really bring out their characters very well. I liked the characters. They are strong and dynamic. Wikus is a good protagonist, and I really cared about him while watching the film. I also came to like the aliens he befriends - they may be ugly, but I really felt true emotion for them and their inner characters, who they really are inside, especially the big one (the father). I know hardly anything about director Neil Blomkamp, but he did a very good job with this film. There are definitely some things that he could have done better, and the overall film was not great, but Blomkamp did a good job overall, and gave us a pretty good film.So, overall, while District 9 is, in my opinion, not quite an iconic or classic science fiction film, it's still pretty unique, and it has some pretty memorable things about it. It's not really something I might remember immediately many years from now as a classic film or anything, but, like I said before, it's pretty memorable. It's a smart, emotional, and entertaining science fiction film, and it's definitely worth seeing at least once.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",9,2,3,26 September 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Not as good as the first, but still a worthy sequel
","My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)I missed the theatrical release of the first How to Train Your Dragon film in 2010, but I eventually saw it on DVD, and I loved it. It has since become one of my favorite animated films, and one of my all-time favorite films in general, and, in my opinion, it is a completely flawless film. So, naturally, I was a bit apprehensive when I found out that they were going to make a sequel. Not so surprisingly, I didn't think How to Train Your Dragon 2 was as good as its predecessor, but it is still a good movie.The film is set five years after the events of the first film. Instead of killing dragons, the Vikings of Berk now welcome dragons into their village. The chief, Stoick the Vast, plans to retire soon and have his son, Hiccup (now twenty years old), take his place as chief, and even Hiccup's girlfriend, Astrid, thinks he has great potential for the jobÂ­. Hiccup, however, prefers flying around with his dragon Toothless and mapping new lands, and is rather averse to his father's wishes. One day while out exploring, Hiccup comes across a group of dragon catchers, who work for an evil warlord, Drago, who wants to assemble a dragon army. Hiccup, against his fathers orders, sets off to try and peacefully reason with Drago, but is waylaid by the mysterious Dragon Rider, Valka (voiced by Cate Blanchett), who turns out to be Hiccup's thought-to-be-long-dead mother.How to Train Your Dragon 2 is, for the most part, an example of a sequel done right. It further develops and expands upon its universe and underlying themes, and it actually takes the story in a new direction rather than essentially repeating that of the first film. Also, while it's still fun, endearing, and family-friendly like the first film, it's also darker and more mature, and a bit more complex. It doesn't shy away from some dark themes, such as war and death, and it doesn't have that feeling that everything is inevitably going turn out alright in the end. There are even few good twists in the film's third act (which I found to be the most emotionally powerful part of the film).The first HTTYD film was a simple and straightforward but extremely touching story about friendship, loyalty, acceptance, and family. Its emotional core consisted of the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. This relationship is still crucial to the story in HTTYD 2, but it takes a back seat until the film's third act. The primary core of this film consists of a couple different elements. One of them is the reuniting of Hiccup's family. The other, more important element is the coming of age element. Yes, more than anything else, HTTYD 2 is a coming of age film for Hiccup.The animation in this film, as expected, is spectacular. The characters, dragons, and scenery are excellently designed and visually pleasing, and the flying and aerial battle scenes are very good as well. John Powell, who composed the fantastic soundtrack for the first film, has returned and composed it for this film as well, and he still did a very good job. The soundtrack even contains a very good song that ais worth mentioning: 'Where No One Goes'. Also, the voice acting is very well done, especially Jay Baruchel as Hiccup.Unfortunately, while I thought the first film was flawless, I cannot say the same about this film. This film has some pacing and plotting issues, a few contrived moments, a one-dimensional villain, and some underdeveloped supporting characters (the main characters are well developed, though, especially Hiccup). Additionally, the film is a bit weaker than the first film in terms of comedy, and a few of the comedic moments fall flat. Nonetheless, the film does have several humorous moments that do work.Despite its slightly messy pacing and plotting, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is, in my opinion, a good sequel, and a good film for anybody of any age, and I'm glad I got to see it in the theater (twice â€“ and I actually liked it a little better the second time). It is emotional, heartfelt, and humorous in areas, with some strong messages about family, friendship, forgiveness, loyalty, coming of age, and living to one's potential. Kids will enjoy it as long as they can handle some of the darker and more mature content. There is also plenty of content in the film for adults to enjoy. HTTYD 2 is one of my favorite films of the year so far, and it may very well end up being my favorite animated film of 2014 â€“ if nothing else, I hope it receives a nomination for Best Animated Feature.",9,3,8,10 July 2014
Frozen," Overrated, but good nonetheless
","My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Frozen opens up with rhythmic chanting through the Disney and WDAS logos and the opening title. This is immediately followed by a scene involving a group of ice harvesters slicing ice from a frozen lake and singing about ice, fear, and frozen hearts. This opening sets the right tone and foreshadows some of the film's underlying themes. It also has something of an ambitious feel to it, as if this film were daring to aim for the level of Beauty and the Beast and some of Disney's other best films. In my opinion, Frozen is not as good as these films, and it is not a masterpiece by any means; and frankly I think it's overrated. But I still found it to be a good movie.Frozen is the story of sisters Anna and Elsa, the princesses of Arendelle. Elsa has magical powers to create ice and snow. These sisters were very close when they were little, until an incident where Elsa almost kills her younger sister with her powers. Their parents take Anna to some trolls who save her and erase her memories of Elsa's powers. After this, the sisters are separated and grow apart over the years. Years later, their parents die at sea, and three years after this, Elsa reaches the age at which she can become Queen. On coronation day, Anna meets Hans, a prince of another kingdom. She falls in love with him and wants to get engaged â€“ that same day. In the ensuing argument with Elsa, Elsa inadvertently releases her powers. She then flees, unintentionally leaving the kingdom in a magically induced winter. Anna goes after her, along the way acquiring the help of an ice harvester, Kristoff, and his reindeer, Sven.Despite the immense hype surrounding this film, some negative reviewers have claimed that the film is shallow, simplistic, messy, and empty. In my opinion, however, not only is it not, but it's also heavy with subtleties, symbolism, and subtext; and I found it to be relatable and thought provoking to a considerable degree. I will admit that the storyline itself is fairly simple and predictable. But overall, I found the story to be decent and effective, with some valuable morals including, but not limited to, the true meaning of love, overcoming one's fears, and accepting people for who they are.The primary factor that makes the story work is the characters. The relationship between Anna and Elsa is what constitutes the film's emotional core. I was able to relate to both both of these characters, and Kristoff, to some degree. The animators really took the time to craft these three characters, giving them well-rounded, well-nuanced personalities, genuine emotional depth, and excellent physical appearances; not to mention the superlative voice performances by the cast. The animators even paid excellent attention to all of their mannerisms, tics, facial expression, and other details (even very small ones). These three characters felt to me like real people, and not two dimensional stereotypes.Another strength of the film is the music. Christophe Beck did a good job composing the score; and Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez did a good job writing the songs, my favorites of which are 'For the First Time in Forever,' 'Let It Go,' 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman,' and 'Frozen Heart.' The songs are not excellent, but they are pretty good, and they help develop the characters and move the story along pretty well.Some modern filmmakers, especially Michael Bay, could really learn a thing or two from movies like Frozen. I cannot deny that the animation in Frozen is very good, and the film would not have worked without it. Fortunately, however, directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee actually care about other things as well: character development, relationships, heart, storytelling, and so forth. The film actually has a warm, genuine heart of its own under all of that digital snow and ice. Also, instead of just serving as a flashy distraction, the animation is actually used to service the script (not the other way around).Now, again, I honestly think the film is good, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. In addition to myriad missed opportunities, this film has its flaws. I found the film's second act to be a bit insipid and a little too heavy in comedy. Sure, it was funny, but it occasionally upset the comedy/drama balance, thereby preventing the second act from having the same emotional punch that the first and third acts have. Also, I felt that the story was slightly rushed and compressed. In fact, the film contains enough material for a TV miniseries. The film is solid and coherent as it is, but I still think a slightly longer running length would have done it a lot of good. Oh, and the villain is pretty weak - contrived and paper-thin (yes, there is a villain, but he is secondary to the primary conflict).Personally I think Frozen is the best of the five Disney Revival films so far, beating out Tangled by a whisker. Disney has successfully moved into the 21st century. For the most part, they have succeeded in combining their older elements with modern ones.Frozen is now the highest grossing animated film to date. At the same time, it's also receiving the harsh backlash that films this successful often receive. I personally think Frozen is overrated, but it's still good â€“ charming, heartfelt, humorous, emotional, and overall entertaining - and it's one of my favorite films of 2013. Disney may not have the charisma they used to have, but at least they still know how to make a good movie.For more reviews, and my full review of Frozen (what you have just read is a truncated version of it): visit my blog: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",9,8,15,20 May 2014
Lincoln," Review - Lincoln
","Anybody searching for a biography film about Abraham Lincoln's full life and 'major' events will have to look elsewhere. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln (which I saw in the theater over Thanksgiving weekend) has a brief battle scene at the beginning, and a few scenes near the end taking place around (and during) the time of the assassination, but most of the film (and the meat of the film) is confined to January 1865, and is about Lincoln striving to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution (banning slavery) passed.If you ask me, limiting the time frame of the film like this was a very smart decision. Showing all the major events of his life is not necessary; this film, with its shorter time frame, does a great job at it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it does a better job of it than a traditional bio-pic would. The film doesn't really want to show his life, but rather paint a true portrait of the man himself; who was he, really, as a person, president, etc.? The film is restricted mostly (although not entirely) to offices, courtrooms, Capitol chambers, and places like that, but it still does a very good job at portraying the time period, visually, politically, and in every other way, and with good detail. In fact, while I generally don't find politics interesting or appealing, I actually found the political aspect of this film somewhat interesting.Another major factor that makes the film work so well is the acting. Daniel Day-Lewis put on an excellent performance as Abraham Lincoln; deep, dynamic, powerful, and very convincing. In fact, his performance is what I liked best about the entire film. He didn't just portray Lincoln, he practically was Lincoln. He was pretty convincing in terms of physical appearance, but more importantly, he was almost perfect in terms of his character (in other words, becoming Lincoln). In short, Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln is great and unforgettable, and completely Oscar-worthy (and he may actually win). All of the other actors (including Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) also put their best foot forward and deliver very good and convincing performances. They slip right into and bring out their characters.Steven Spielberg has delivered again. He has directed several films that I like, some of them nostalgic favorites. He has made many different types of films, all across the genre spectrum; sci-fi, adventure, war, fantasy, history, serious films, fun films, etc etc. He's not perfect, and not all of his films are good, but, again, a lot of them are, and Lincoln is one such film, and one in which he again proves that he can make just about any type of film. In my opinion it's still not as good as some of his best films, like Schindler's List and War Horse, but it's still great. And once again, Spielberg has teamed up with score composer John Williams. Williams's score isn't anywhere near as good or memorable as a lot of his previous works, but it's still pretty good and it fits the film very well.All in all, the film is not perfect, and it actually only scraped a full 10 from me by a little bit. It could have been better in some aspects, even some of its better aspects, but it's still a great film. Great performances, great historical portrayal, etc. In fact, if I had to label one film about Lincoln the definitive film about him, it would probably this one. The film brought me closer to the real-life figure of Lincoln than I have ever been before (literature, pictures, documentaries, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up being used in school and college history courses.Lincoln is compelling and moving, and a film truly worthy of its title; it paints an excellent portrait of America's sixteenth president.My Rating: **** (out of ****)For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",10,3,9,28 November 2012
Brave," Review - Brave
","My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Over its years, Pixar has brought its magic of high quality animation and good storytelling to the screen. Some of their films are better than others, but I've at least liked, or even loved, all of their films to date. I even found Cars 2 to be okay, even though it's my least favorite Pixar film. This summer I went to theater to see Brave, Pixar's thirteenth major feature film. I was a bit worried due to a lot of the negative criticism surrounding the film, but I ended up enjoying it. I also saw it again recently on DVD. I've already written a review for this film, but I've decided to re-write it now that I've had a couple additional viewings of the film.Brave is the story of Merida, a young red-haired princess and aspiring archer who is unhappy with her controlled and restricted life. When she is asked by her mother, Queen Elinor, to choose between three possible suitors from three other clans, she is even more upset, and, after a spat with her mother, she eventually flees into the woods, and soon comes upon a cottage (led there by magical blue willo-the-wisps), where she meets a witch. She begs for a magic spell to change her mother's mind, but it doesn't exactly go according to how Merida wants it...and problems ensue...I was a bit worried that I would like the movie on DVD less than I did on the big screen, but I ended up enjoying it just as much as I did before, and I still stand by my three-and-a-half (out of four) star rating. Brave is not without problems, but I can tell that the filmmakers really put in a good amount of effort to try and make the film work for what it's worth. The film's flaws are mostly forgivable and, while they do hold the film back from living up to its potential, they do not spoil the film.The story is not original or creative, and it's somewhat clichÃ©d and predictable in areas. But the film does contain a lot of uniqueness, both visually and story-wise. What I liked most about the film was Merida herself, whom I found to be an interesting, complex, and charismatic character. She may be a princess, and yes, in a Disney movie, but she's not your average Disney princess. She's not the kind of princess who falls in love with a prince on a white steed. She is spunky, strong-willed, and independent, and she has bright, wild red hair that matches her personality. I fell in love with her, and I genuinely cared about her and even related to her a bit, and I stuck with her and got emotionally involved throughout the film. I even thought she was cute in terms of physical appearance, especially her hair. And Kelly MacDonald further helps to bring this feisty lass to life with a great voice performance with a cute Scottish accent.I enjoyed the dynamic relationship between her and her mother, and the bonding they undergo. Again, this is not a romance film. Instead, it concerns more personal and more relatable themes (in my opinion); family values and relationships, personal decisions, controlling one's own fate (deciding your own path in life), admitting one's mistakes, and some other valuable and life lessons. I especially liked the mother-daughter aspect. I myself am a 20 year old guy, but I still related to Merida and her relationship with her mother. While it may not be a romance film, it's definitely a film about love.The animation in this film is stunningly beautiful and helps bring the film to life. The Scottish landscape, the characters, Merida's hair, the wisps, and everything else in the film is all excellently animated. Sound-wise the film is very good too, both music and other effects. Composer Patrick Doyle, who was responsible for the score in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, composed a great score for this film. I think the film could have used some more (and better) humor, but it did have its humorous moments as it is. It also handles its more emotional areas well, if you ask me.I feel that there are some things in the film that are meant to be felt rather than explained, and a few of these are meant to be a bit mysterious and open-ended. The film somewhat succeeds at these, but unfortunately it stumbles a bit here. I feel that the filmmakers overreached a bit in these areas. As a result some of these things didn't have the full effect they were supposed to have, and some of them felt a bit out of place. Yes, the movie felt a bit uneven and unpolished in some areas, and even bit compressed and rushed in a few.I honestly think the film could have benefited from a longer running length, with which the film could have improved some things, including, but not limited to, fleshing out the characters more, explaining some things better, and polishing up some plot elements. Also, it would have allowed the mysterious and open-ended feeling be established properly, with an appropriate balance between the things that are explained and those that are meant to be felt. Another criticism (more minor, though) I have is that the film could have used a bit more thought towards character development; the characters are all effective, and some of them memorable (especially Merida), but except for Merida and Elinor, the characters are a bit underdeveloped.However, despite these shortcomings, and a few more, I enjoyed the movie; I thought it was handled pretty well, even the weaker areas. Brave is a bit flawed, and it's definitely not Pixar's best, but I found it be a good movie overall; it's cute, charming, heartwarming, funny in areas, visually stunning, and undeserving of the negativity it receives.",9,3,6,15 December 2012
Avatar," Review - Avatar
","I missed the initial theatrical release of Avatar in Devember of 2009, but I got the DVD the following July and watched the movie on my television at home, and I was quite blown away. My liking for it has decreased. How I feel about the story, characters, and everything else about the movie is pretty much exactly the same, but to a lesser degree; I think it's okay.The story is set in the year 2154, and it involves an RDA mission to an earth-sized moon called Pandora. We enter this new world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who goes on this mission on short notice. For a while, the humans had some success in interacting with the Na'vi via 'avatars', remote-controlled bodies. However, relations between the natives and the human have turned bad, and all interactions between them stopped. However, Jake eventually meets the local native tribe, falls in love with them and the new world, and ends up fighting against the RDA in defense of the new people and world he now considers his home.Let's get the obvious out of the way: the CGI is visually stunning and almost flawless, and with extreme detail. In fact, the movie goes beyond having great visuals. It introduces a wonderful new world. It has a lot of earth-like characteristics, but it also has a lot of new and exotic characteristics (and even some uniqueness in the familiar characteristics) the combination of which is a beautiful world. Overall, the world is something we've all seen before, yet never seen before at the same time; simultaneously old and new. And it's all portrayed excellently with brilliant scope and spectacle. The same is true about the natives and the avatars. Like the new world, they are portrayed excellently with the CGI with utmost detail. The natives are humanoids, but they're ten to twelve feet tall, blue-skinned, and golden-eyed, and they even have tails. They are an interesting blend of human, alien, and feline. The same is true about the avatars. The Na'vi were well designed, especially Neytiri, who is beautiful. I found Jake and Neytiri to be very likable, and a great couple, and their combined physical appearance and personalities give them a likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything about the film is perfect. The story is extremely basic, derivative, clichÃ©d, and predictable, and a bit corny. The characters, aside from Jake, Neytiri, and Grace, are pretty shallow, especially the villains, who are very one-dimensional (but effective). Also, the dialogue is very clichÃ©d and a bit corny, almost like something out of a kids movie. However, despite these flaws, the movie works. The story clichÃ©d, predictable, etc., but it's coherent, well-structured, well-paced, solid, and consistent, and it flows. The characters, although lacking a bit in development, are effective. The three protagonists Jake, Neytiri, and Grace, should have been better in terms of development, but they are effective and I was able to have a sufficient emotional attachment to them and their relationships. Even the dialogue, weak as it is, gets its job done.We've seen this story a million times, but never like this. The story could be considered a sci-fi version of Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, set in a new fantasy world. Just like in original Star Wars trilogy, Avatar brings some new life into old clichÃ©s. In my opinion, the original Star Wars trilogy does a much better job at this, but Avatar does an okay job at it. The story combines elements of Pocahontas, Titanic, Braveheart, Star Wars, and even The Matrix.James Cameron also borrows from some of his own films, including Aliens (military/technology) and Titanic (the love story, and the way the movie is structured).Also, the new world isn't simply in the movie to look nice. In my opinion, it actually feels alive, and it's very much a character itself in the film. I want to make it clear that I was not duped or blinded by the visuals. I felt that Cameron actually used the visuals and new world to evoke emotion, and also used them as part of the story itself. In terms of the script, the storytelling is basic, by the numbers, but I also felt that a lot of the storytelling was within these great visuals and the world, and in the way it was combined into the story. The effects helped me get immersed into the new world and helped me care about the characters and the story. Also, the film has great sound - quality, effects, editing, etc. These sound aspects also added a bit to the emotion and immersing effects of the story. I also liked James Horner's score, which, in my opinion, is some of the best work of Horner's career.I felt that a lot of what made the story enjoyable was within the simplicity, and in the details. And, in my opinion, while the film doesn't have much intelligence, it does have a little bit, which very few other movies like this have. It's actually a halfway decent blockbuster, and it does not contain the obnoxiousness and imbecility of films like Michael Bay's films. Unlike those films, Avatar actually has some heart and soul, and characters that the audience can care about. There are definitely several things that can be criticized - the simple and derivative story, the clichÃ©s, the hammy dialogue, and the one-dimensional villains - but a lot can be said in defense of the movie's story aspects (and it has a lot of Cameron elements in it). Besides, these flaws are typical of blockbusters.I thought the movie was okay. I found it sufficiently emotional, memorable, and entertaining, and it's nice family entertainment. However, the movie that changes movies?? No way.My Rating: *** (out of ****)For more reviews, and my complete review of Avatar, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",7,1,3,8 July 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," Review - How to Train Your Dragon
","I never saw How to Train Your Dragon in the theater. However, I did watch it when it came out on DVD. Having not heard much about the film and not knowing anything about its story or any of that, I didn't have any expectations prior to watching it. However, I ended up loving it. In fact, in my opinion, DreamWorks has surpassed Pixar with this film.The story is very simple, predictable, derivative, and clichÃ©d, and it's a total retread of basic cinema clichÃ©s, but it works, and I found it entertaining and immersive. There is not much depth, story development, or character development, but it's still pretty effective as it is. Also, the wonderful animation helps contribute to the emotion and energy of the story. So, overall, to sum this up, this film works in many of the same ways that James Cameron's Avatar worked, and in fact it works much better. They both consist of simple, predictable, and clichÃ©d stories. They don't have much depth, story development, or character development (like I just said above). However, the stories are sufficient, well-structured, well-paced, and coherent, and they flow and make sense.The characters are not developed much, but they are sufficient and very likable. Also, both use brilliant visuals and keen detail to tell their stories and bring emotion into them. Although I do have to admit that HTTYD has a somewhat better script and better dialogue. Also, like Avatar, HTTYD doesn't go much into the depth and backgrounds of the characters, or much into any of that stuff, but a lot of that stuff - character background, personality, relationships, etc. - are evident in the detail. So, given all of this, I think it would be safe to say that, in many ways, HTTYD is the Avatar of 2010.Now, HTTYD doesn't have a new world, like Pandora, but it does have beautiful scenery all the same. Also, it has the lovable dragon Toothless, who is a full character in the film. He was excellently designed, and is very cute and lovable. In addition to excellent physical design, has a great personality, is smart, and has an excellent balance between that of a person and that of an animal. He is a great character, and, in fact, the most memorable character in the film. The voice actors all put on good performances, and they really help bring out their characters with their voice. Jay Baruchel did a very good job as Hiccup. A lot of people say that his voice is annoying, but I personally disagree. I actually kind of like his voice, and it's just right for the character in the movie, Hiccup, who is very likable. The other voice actors did an equally good job with their characters too, such as Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast, America Ferrera as the likable and beautiful Astrid (Hiccup's love interest), Jonah Hill as Snotlout, and some others.Like I said before, the animation is absolutely beautiful. John Powell composed and excellent music score for the film. As for the target audience: everyone - in many ways, it's like a kids movie, but in others it's pretty mature. Also, being a good comedy, it has some good humor. But it doesn't let the humor get too abundant. The humor is spaced out throughout the film and given at appropriate intervals, and is balanced excellently with the story, drama, emotion, and moral messages, much like The Iron Giant was. In fact, the film has a lot of similarities to The Iron Giant, and it works for many of the same reasons that movie works. Everything about the movie is very well balanced.Overall, I love this movie. It's a great family film, it's very entertaining, touching, good- hearted, and visually beautiful. It combines elements of The Iron Giant and Avatar, and breathes new life into old, exhausted clichÃ©s. Also, it has great staying power - it's one of those movies, like Ghostbusters, that never really gets old on repeated viewings. Unfortunately, DreamWorks plans to make a sequel to it. Wow, way to go, DreamWorks, ruining the best film you've ever made. Please don't make that sequel. This is the type of movie that's just best left alone. Leave a good thing alone.One final note: I've only seen this movie in 2-D. I've never seen it in 3-D, and guess what? I don't want to. Aside from the usual fact that 3-D is unnecessary, this movie is so awesome that it doesn't need 3-D.My Rating: **** (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",10,0,0,1 July 2012
Titanic," Review - Titanic
","James Cameron's Titanic is proof that a movie doesn't have to be original to be good. I'm not saying that originality is bad; I like it, it's good, but it's a minor factor in how good a movie/story is. The story doesn't necessarily have to be original, but it has to be compelling to people; has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout. Titanic does just that. It captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end (it did for many people, anyway, including me).Titanic combines fiction with non-fiction, the more important of which is probably the non- fiction aspect: the tragic sinking of the luxury cruiser R. M. S. Titanic in 1912. There have been a few films that portrayed the tragic event (such as Titanic in 1953 and A Night To Remember in 1958). Then, in 1997, along came James Cameron, who, despite some weaknesses with script and dialogue, is good at storytelling, and always pushes the advancement of visual and special effects, and uses them to his advantage. Therefore, a film about the Titanic was a perfect project for him. The recreation of the ship is great, with excellent detail and scope. Except for a few brief moments here and there when something doesn't look quite real, it's it looks spellbindingly realistic, and, while watching it, it felt almost like I was really there. James Cameron really spent his $200 million budget wisely.Some of that money also went into filming some footage of the actual wreck at the bottom of the ocean. This footage is seen in a scene at the beginning of the movie, shot via a remote- controlled underwater camera. As Roger Ebert says, 'These shots strike precisely the right note; the ship calls from its grave for its story to be told.' However, instead of only telling a story of only the real event, he also weaves a fictional story ingeniously into it, specifically an almost Romeo and Juliet-like story of forbidden love. In modern times (actually, during the time the film was made), a fictitious survivor of the Titanic sinking, old Rose DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart), tells the story via flashback, and tells about her brief yet intense forbidden love affair with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).Seventeen-year-old Rose (Kate Winslett), from a wealthy upper-class background, is betrothed to a rich snob, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). She hates this, and is extremely miserable. Meanwhile, Jack is basically poor, and he wins a ticket to the Titanic in a lucky win in a card game. He eventually finds Rose, who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship, and he saves her life. What follows is the development of their forbidden love story, which is told in such a way that shows off different parts of the magnificent cruise ship. It's a simple, predictable, and clichÃ©d story, but it's still very compelling, especially since we know how that the ship is going to sink eventually and cause heartbreaking results on their romance (predictability is actually good here).Meanwhile, there is the subplot regarding the actual historical events leading up to the sinking - the arrogance of the builders and the people who ran the ship (they thought the ship was unsinkable). At the midpoint of the movie, the ship hits the iceberg, and the second half of the movie begins, and develops into a thrilling yet tense and dramatic race for survival. The entire movie, from start to finish, is handled extremely well in terms of story, and is completely full of heart and soul; it's all very strong in emotion. And yes, it's predictable, but in this case it actually adds to the power of the movie. But it's not completely predictable. There are a lot of things that are not fully given away, like exactly who dies (besides Jack) and who lives (besides Rose), and some other things along the way, too.Some people would definitely argue that the love story between Jack and Rose is completely unnecessary, but it actually helps the movie. It adds more emotion to the story and makes it that much more compelling. It also provides more structure to the story and the showing-off of the ship, and even allows the audience to really connect with the passengers on the ship (innocent people whose lives are ultimately ruined or permanently altered as a result of the builders' arrogance and ignorance â€“ unsinkable, yeah right). And the special effects also made the film work well, too. However, despite having great special effects in his film, James Cameron did not lose sight of what's truly important â€“ story, characters, emotion, etc. The movie does not rely on special effects. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well without them, but they are not the main driving force of the film.If I had to criticize one thing about the film, it would be the length. In my opinion, it's too long, at three hours and fifteen minutes. However, it still works brilliantly as it is. Every moment of the story serves a great and important contribution to the story, the drama, the emotion, and everything else. The performances by the actors were very good, the pacing of the film is great (if a bit lengthy at times), and the tone of the film is great. James Horner's score is fantastic, very memorable, absolutely beautiful, and perfect for the film. And, despite having a good deal of fiction in it, the movie excellently portrays the historical tragic sinking of the Titanic, and captures the horror and tragedy brilliantly. With lots of heart, suspense, drama, and great historical portrayal combined with fiction and stunningly realistic visual and special effects, James Cameron's Titanic is arguably the best film of 1997.My Rating: **** (out of ****)Fore more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",10,2,4,2 July 2012
Thor," Review - Thor
","Thor is one of the 'prequels' to The Avengers - the 'prequels' are Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk. I still have yet to see The Incredible Hulk, but I have seen the other four films. I personally think that Thor is the worst of them. However, despite it's ultimate shortcomings, it does have its positive aspects.The story is about Thor of Asgard. This arrogant Thor recklessly travels to another world called Jotunheim with Loki and some other Asgardian warriors and attacks the Frost Giants there, stirring up tension and possible war between Jotunheim and Asgard. As a result, Odin, Thor's father, strips Thor of his powers, and his mighty hammer, and banishes him to Earth.On earth, in New Mexico, astrophysicist Jane Foster is researching a phenomenon in the desert (which turns out to be associated with Asgard-related activity, in this case Thor's banishment). Thor arrives and is discovered by Jane and her partners, and pretty soon he begins to learn the error of his arrogant ways, and he even falls in love with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki has taken over the Throne of Asgard, and he plans to send the Destroyer to earth to kill Thor, and Thor must retrieve his hammer and his powers to save both earth and Asgard.The film has both its ups and downs. I'll start out by talking about the effects. The visual effects are pretty good. The mythical words are pretty well designed, and the actions scenes are good. As for the script, it does have its flaws, but it's an acceptable script. The story isn't the best, and it's a bit bland and formulaic, but again, it's acceptable. It even has some creativity in it. Unfortunately, however, despite its creativity, it's a bit bland and formulaic. The first act of the film (the first half hour) is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the film, and it felt to me that the movie was relying a bit too much on effects, but it does establish the characters and basis necessary for the story. It's also where most of the film's creativity is.Weak as the first act is, I did find some things a bit interesting, and some things were introduced that had a lot of potential to get even better and more interesting and creative. But unfortunately, at the end of the first act, right after Thor arrives on earth, the movie abandons a lot of its creativity and resorts to a formula. Some of the things in the first act (which had a lot of creative and interesting potential) are even abandoned and not brought up again in the film. This, and the film's bland-ness, and a few other flaws, are the main reason why I only gave this film two and a half stars instead of three or higher (it almost got three, but it just missed it). Also, I felt that the Thor/Jane romance was a bit rushed.However, despite this, the film does get going a little bit more after Thor's banishment. This is where the heart and characters begin to shine. That brings up what I liked most about the film: the characters. I found them somewhat likable and interesting. The film even has a surprisingly good sense of humor; there are a lot of good comedy moments. These things are not strong enough to bring the film up to a higher rating, but they are still somewhat enjoyable. I especially liked Loki, even though he's the villain, and I was glad to see him and Thor return for The Avengers.So, overall, I think Thor is a so-so movie. It is a bit bland and formulaic, and could have used a better story, but it has enjoyable characters, humor, and action, and is not bad overall. It's a bit meh, but it's a bit entertaining, although it's not something I'd want to watch more than once.My Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",6,1,4,31 October 2012
Psycho," Review - Psycho (1960)
","Psycho is a good, memorable film. I don't love it, but I do like it; it's a good piece of cinema and is notable for many things. First of all, the black-and-white cinematography is good, and it really contributes to the tone and mood of the film. There are several great camera shots and sequences. The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds. There are a lot of aspects of the movie that are not so special, and ones that have been used again and again over the years. There are some things about the movie that seem clichÃ©, and possibly a bit cheesy. However, despite all this, after all these years, Psycho still has a uniqueness that is memorable and ultimately not copied to this day. Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good. I found it to be a very good movie experience. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do.",9,0,0,1 July 2012
12 Years a Slave," Powerful and harrowing
","Alright, imagine if you are living an ordinary day; and then the next suddenly you find your life torn away from you, and you are thrown into a different life, full of misery, despair, oppression, and brutality, possibly for many years. Well, this is exactly what happened to Solomon Northup, a free black man who, in 1841, was kidnapped, beaten, and sold into slavery. And he remained in slavery for twelve years, until he has rescued in 1853 from a plantation he was working on in Louisiana. In fact, Northup only one of the numerous people to whom this actually happened, but he was one of the only ones who regained their freedom.Shortly after regaining his freedom, he published his story in a book titled 12 Years a Slave, which I read prior to seeing the film, and which director Steve McQueen has now adapted into said film, with the same title. Many reviewers have already summarized essentially how I personally feel about this film, so I apologize if this review feels redundant to you readers. Rather than just trying to grab money and capitalize on the market, McQueen brings to the screen an honest, accurate portrayal of the harsh conditions and life of slavery. And it old through the eyes of a man who was not born and raised as a slave, but a free end educated man who ended up having experience in both the slave and free worlds. As for the cruelty and brutality, the film doesn't tone any of it down. In fact, some scenes were difficult to watch, they were so disturbing. This film actually allowed me, to a considerable extent, to experience a bit of antebellum Southern United States slavery as it actually was. IT could also be argued that the film offers a strong view of how cruel and evil humans can be, and have been at times in the past.The performances in this film are excellent. The script doesn't give Northup much 'development,' but Chiwetel Ejiofor gives his character depth and humanity through his powerful, superlative performance. He reached out grabbed by emotions strongly, pulling me into his experiences, from a free man, to his abduction, and through his experience as a slave, during which he kept the fact of his freedom mostly silent but nevertheless remained determined to someday get it back. I especially liked the way he conveyed so much emotion though facial expressions, and especially through his eyes. I predict an Oscar nomination for Ejiofor.All of the other performances were highly commendable as well. Not all of the white people portrayed in the film, however, are cruel. A counter example is William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). Cumberbatch's character in the film is a 180 turn around from his performance as the evil and menacing Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness. His character, Ford, while blinded by the social and cultural mores of the antebellum South, treats Northup with unexpected kindness (and I look forward to future performances by Cumberbatch). Another such counterexample to the common white cruelty of the time is Bass (Brad Pitt), who eventually helps Northup to escape. As for the not-so-kind people, there are two who reflect the general beliefs and unpleasantness of many southern whites. They are Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a plantation owner and one of Northup's owners, and John Tibeats (Paul Dano), a worker for Ford. And yes, Fassbender and Dano's performed well.While scenery is certainly not the primary draw of the film, I want to give a thumbs up for the film's cinematography and visual aspects, and Hans Zimmer's music score, which helped enhance the experience. As for the screenplay, John Ridley did a good job adapting the book into a screenplay. He did make a few minor tweaks and condensed the story a bit - in fact, there are one or two particular scenes that I think should have been included in the film, and I think that they would have made the film even better - but other than that the film is true to the book and the events.If I were to criticize anything about the film, it would be that I really think that the feeling of twelve years passing, while effective, should have been stronger. In fact, while I liked the film and the way everything was handled in it, I felt that everything could still have been stronger - more intense, more vivid, more horrifying, more suspenseful, more gut-wrenching, more emotionally powerful, etc. But again, all of these aspects, and more, were still pretty strong in the film.So, overall, 12 Years a Slave wasn't great like I wanted it to be, but it was good, and one of the best films of 2013; and it is an experience that I will not be forgetting anytime soon. Solomon Northup himself would have been proud of this film.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)",9,4,7,26 November 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Review - The Shawshank Redemption
","The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and there's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it truly touches the heart and soul.I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience.",10,2,3,18 July 2012
Prometheus," Review - Prometheus
","Ridley Scott has returned to the science fiction genre and the Alien universe with Prometheus, which I finally saw in the theater recently.Most of the story takes place during the final weeks of the year 2093. The space vessel Prometheus is traveling through space to a planet in a system that was pointed at by several archaeological findings, which may be a clue to the origin of mankind. The ship is very near it's destination, and the crew awakens from hypersleep, except for an android named David who has been awake. They arrive at the planet they are heading to. It appears to be desolate, but then they find a big structure. Much of the movie takes place in this structure, and on the Prometheus ship.The ship lands, and some of the crew are sent to check out the structure. Inside it, they find a series of tunnels, some of them underground. While exploring, it initially seems that there is nothing alive. However, this soon changes. Complications arise, the plot thickens, discoveries are made, etc... There's quite a bit that goes on in Prometheus, much more to the story than I've already given. However, I don't want to give anything more away. In fact, I've probably already given a little too much away.Prometheus is set in the Alien universe, and it it's a prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien. And it has several obvious connections to it, which I won't reveal in my review. However, Prometheus also works very well as a stand-alone. It obviously leads on to the Alien movies, and does get things where they need to be for the events of the Alien movies. Yet it also has its own story and it goes in its own directions. Scott's 1979 Alien was strong on suspense, and it was essentially a sci-fi haunted house story, and very scary. Prometheus does have horror elements, and some similar elements to that of Alien, but unlike that movie, this movie also contains some other elements. It doesn't lean more towards suspense, action, etc. It has a mixture that balances these elements. Also, and best of all, the movie is intellectually stimulating. The movie contains many mysteries and questions. As the movie progresses, some of these questions are answered, and some are left unanswered and open-ended.That's not to say that Prometheus is perfect. It does contain flaws. Most of them concern the characters, which are pretty flat. None of them are truly round characters, or even interesting. I didn't really care much for them. That's not to say that I didn't feel anything for the characters. I did feel a little bit, but it was marginal. None of the characters are particularly memorable. Then again, the first Alien movie had the same type of characters (in terms of depth, etc.), but it did have Ellen Ripley, who is somewhat memorable. Noomi Rapace's character, Elizabeth Shaw, like the other Prometheus characters, is somewhat flat and underdeveloped, but she's the most rounded and best character in the film, in my opinion.There were even a few flawed lines of dialogue here and there. Also, the movie is not very good in terms of acting and reacting; the actors' performances are not very good, and the characters make a lot of stupid decisions. There are also some mystery-elements and other things in the story that should have been better, and the movie did feel a bit clumsy and a bit ridiculous in a few areas; some things here and there were a bit poorly paid off, etc. The majority of the flaws, in my opinion, occur in the the third act of the film. I might have given the film a three-and-a-half-star rating, or even a four-star rating, but unfortunately the flaws did drag it down somewhat.However, despite these flaws, the movie, while not great or anything, is okay overall, in my opinion. This film is not about character arcs or relationships, or a story arc, but rather the mysteries, which, to say the least, are quite interesting, and there are a few memorable images and concepts. The visual and special effects are good, and they actually contribute somewhat to the overall tone and atmosphere of the film. I saw this film in 2-D, but I can tell that it would have been a good experience in 3-D as well. There is some pretty good interesting technology in the film. And not just the technology, it has a lot of good sci-fi elements. And of course, best of all, is the mystery and the questions, and the cleverly-left- incomplete story. That's what really makes the movie worth watching. It could have been better with better character development and more emotional involvement, but it's effective as it is.Prometheus is an okay movie overall. It has several flaws, and it's a bit stupid in areas, but it's pretty interesting and thought-provoking. And it's a good film to be seen in the theater, on the big screen. Also, the conclusion of the movie actually invites a sequel to be made. It doesn't necessarily need one, as it's okay left as it is, but it would not be a bad idea at all.My Rating: *** (out of ****)For more reviews, and my complete review of Prometheus, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",7,0,9,2 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","Of the three Dark Knight movies directed by Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight rises is the only one I have seen in the theater, an experience I quite enjoyed. Now, to be honest, if I were to just look at this film all on its own and disregard the previous two films, I would only have found it to be decent, or just good at best. It does have some flaws, and it's my least favorite of the three installments. But when I take into account the previous two films, this film becomes immensely entertaining for me.At the end of The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne, guised as Batman, took the rap for Harvey Dent's crimes. This film picks up eight years later, where Bruce has since hung up the cape and now stays mainly shut up in his mansion. Meanwhile, Gotham has improved (at least on the surfaceÂ…). However, a new villain, Bane, comes to town, forcing Bruce back into action despite his tarnished Batman reputation.I felt that the weakest part of the film was the first forty-five minutes; I found this part of the film to be a bit slow and uneven. But after this, the film got significantly better, and continued to get better and better as the story progressed (with a few twists) until the ending, which I loved. Admittedly the storyline is a bit of a retread of Batman Begins, and there are some frankly big gaps in logic. This film is more dreamlike and less cerebral than the previous two films, and it's a bit too long. Not to mention we don't see much Batman. However, I did feel that this film was a slight step up emotionally from the previous two. And the running length didn't bother me all that much; in fact, I would say that a director's cut would be completely justified.The actors all put on good performances. There is Christian Bale, of course, who has brought charisma to Bruce Wayne/Batman since the beginning of Nolan's series. The other actors do a good job too. Michael Caine returns as Alfred, who has less screen time in this film than he had before, but is no less powerful. Gary Oldman returns as Commissioner Gordon, and even Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, who provides Bruce with a new, aerial form of transportation (and yes, it does come in black).We also have some new characters, all (or at least most) of who make worthy additions to the franchise. There is the badass and utterly terrifying villain, Bane. Tom Hardy pulls off a worthy performance of this masked menace, masterful and merciless. Anne Hathaway and Marion Cottilard play Selina Kyle and Miranda Tate, respectively, the latter of whom with whom Bruce even sleeps; but this doesn't develop into anything more than just a brief, shallow affair; Bruce's romantic interests pretty much ended with Rachel's death in the previous film. I even want to give a thumbs-up to Joseph Gordon Levitt; and we learn something special about his character at the end of the film.Again, I think the film is just decent, or good at best, on its own, but I love it as a chapter in the overall series (although, again, it is my least favorite film of the trilogy). While I can enjoy Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises as stand-alones as well as parts of a series, I feel that my appreciation for this one is extremely dependent on the basis established by the previous two installments. That brings me to my next point: the highlight of the film for me is the continuation of the overall story of the series. If you ask me, this film brings Bruce Wayne's story to an excellent conclusion. As for the lack of Batman, I would have liked to see more of him, but his absence did not bother me much as this is really more of a Bruce Wayne movie rather than a Batman movie.This film has some connections and references to the first film. For me, the most powerful of these is the reference to the theme of learning to pick ourselves back up after we fall. This theme is introduced in the first film as Bruce falls into the well and his father helps him out. The reference to this theme in TDKR (which also reflects the film's title) is a highly symbolic one that involves an underground prison that Bruce has to climb out of, while the prisoners watching him chant a very catchy and memorable chant. His father helped him out of that well as a kid, and now he has to climb out of this prison himself. He now has to learn to pick himself back up, both literally and symbolically. This scene also excellently symbolizes Bruce's overall, underlying journey to rise back up and re-discover the will to live.Overall, this is one of my favorite film trilogies. In addition to having great action sequences and effects, it also has a great, relatable underlying story. It has great moral messages, such consequences for one's actions, and much more. This trilogy contains a lot of life's lessons. And it doesn't exactly hurt that it works as pure blockbuster entertainment as well.Before I close, I want to mention the music score. Hans Zimmer returns to work his musical magic on this film just like he did on BB and TDK. Especially noteworthy is that recurring two-note motif that has appeared repeatedly throughout the entire series. Whenever this motif is heard, it never completely resolves, always posing some questions. Just like the motif, even at the points where the story resolves, it never quite resolves completely, always posing some questions and uncertainties as to what is to come in the future, among other things. In fact, it is this two-note motif with which the film, and the series, ends.",9,3,5,25 April 2013
The Croods," A pleasant surprise
","I found The Croods to be a pleasant surprise. It exceeded any expectations I had prior to seeing it. Twentieth Century Fox has teamed up with the studio behind How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek, put How to Train Your Dragon director Chris Sanders on the helm along with Kirk De Micco, and come out with this lively, rousing, and highly entertaining work. It doesn't quite rise up the level of Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon (the latter of which is my favorite DreamWorks animated film), but it's definitely one of DreamWorks's better films. It certainly contains the studio's style, and some elements from (and a few references to) a few of its previous films, including the aforementioned Shrek and HTTYD.The Croods tells the story of a caveman family, (yes, you've guessed it) the Croods, the last surviving family in the region in which they live. They live by hiding in their cave most of the time, only going out to hunt. They always play it safe and live in fear, especially of anything new; as the father, Gurg (Nicolas Cage) says, 'Never not be afraid.'The exception to this is Grug's teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone), who, instead of wanting to play it safe all the time, is willing to take risks and learn new things. Because of this, she is a bit distant from her family. One night she ventures out of the cave and meets a young man named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the world is about to end. Sure enough, an earthquake occurs soon afterward, destroying the Croods' cave (but this is just the beginning). This sends the family on a journey with Guy across an incredible land that they have never experienced, full of fantastic creatures and more, while heading to a mountain where they will supposedly be safe.I honestly cannot think of much to criticize about the film, except maybe a little bit of the plotting, but that's about it. Again, it doesn't live up to How to Train Your Dragon, but it's still good (and it is admittedly a bit better in terms of character development). It is full of clever humor, wit, and energy. The humor is neither too childish nor too adult. The film also contains true emotion and good, valuable morals. And it is absolutely full of heart. The animation is excellent; colorful, lively, and dazzling. And I want to give a major thumbs-up to Alan Silvestri for the score, which is lively and rousing, just like everything else about the film.Another especially noteworthy aspect of the film is Eep. Strong female protagonists seem to be fairly popular these days, and Eep is no exception. All of the characters shine, not completely dominating any of the others, but she does shine a bit more than the others. Her appearance brought to mind Fiona from Shrek (which is not surprising, as the same studio is behind them both). She is strong, bold, daring, and rebellious, and her personality recalls that of the aforementioned Fiona, Astrid from HTTYD, and even a bit of Merida from Brave. And yes, there is definitely a bit of Astrid in her; just look at the way she treats Guy when she first meets him. However, they do eventually develop some feelings for each other (which Grug is not too happy about). Eep and all of the other character of the film are lovable, as are the interactions and family values, dynamics, and bonding. The voice performances are good too.From beginning to end, there was not a single moment anywhere in the entire film where I was bored. Again, it's not great, but it is good. It is a clever, witty, humorous, energetic, rousing, heartwarming delight, and I hope it gets nominated for the Best Animated Film Oscar. I will not be surprised if it becomes a childhood classic for future generations. I even stayed for the credits. And its primary moral message is one that anybody can relate to: don't let your life get stale â€“ go out and learn and experience new things, live up to your potential, and really live your life and dreams.",9,1,2,13 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Review - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","The tagline for 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is 'It all ends.' That's right, the ending has finally come to the movie series that started ten years before this movie, the movie adaptation of the classic Harry Potter book series. Like Roger Ebert wrote in his review of this film, we have a big class reunion here, and a great, epic, dark, dramatic one, too. I remember when I first saw the (comparatively) light and innocent Sorcerer's Stone. I was nine years old at the time. Here I am, eighteen, and writing the review for the last film, which I saw on Wednesday. I watched over the years as the movies got progressively deeper, more emotional, more mature, and darker, to the level of darkness at which this film is (tone-wise, and light-wise, in certain scenes). The movie picks up where the last movie left off, and covers the last third of the seventh book. This movie continues with the excellent balance of action, suspense, mystery, character and story development, tone, emotion, etc., and excellent special effects, only it has even more action.When we last left off, Harry had left the Malfoy Manor, and Dobby had been killed. Now he continues his quest to hunt for the final horcruxes and kill Lord Voldemort once and for all. His quest eventually takes him back to Hogwarts for some epic action and showdown. The film, meanwhile, takes us on a roller coaster ride through thrills, excitements, excellent suspense, and dark magical fantasy, thoroughly entertaining throughout. Although the film is over two hours long, it doesn't fee that long â€“ it seems to zip by relatively quickly. And the film ends well, not just for is film, but for the entire series as well. It was a very well handled, well wrapped-up, strong, and emotional ending, almost as strong as it was in the book.An epic final installment to a series such as Harry Potter, which requires such a finale, is hard to achieve, and requires a lot of hard work, talent, writing, effort, and thinking. David Yates handled it very well. Granted, it's not perfect and he could have done several things to make it even better, but he does very well nonetheless. Some of the acting could've been better, too, but it was alright, especially since the main actors have gradually improved their performances as the series progressed. I even enjoyed the musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, especially in the parts where he references back to the themes from John Williams' old score for the first three films. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is one of the better installments in the Harry Potter franchise. It all ends, and it ends well, very good ending to the series. Harry Potter goes out at full speed and with all wands blazing.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",9,2,4,2 July 2012
Rear Window," Review - Rear Window
","As of right now, I have only seen three of Alfred Hitchcock's films: Psycho, Vertigo, and now Rear Window. I have to say, I already like the way Hitchcok creates suspense, and also his methods of storytelling and tampering with narrative elements. A number of people, including film critic James Berardinelli, consider Rear Window to be Hitchcock's best film. As of right now, I personally agree; I've only seen three of his films, but Rear Window is my favorite of the three.Rear Window is appropriately named. The protagonist, L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart), is a professional photographer with a broken leg, and is therefore confined to his apartment in New York. He spends the time watching his neighbors from his rear window (see, I told you the film was appropriately named). Soon, however, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors might have murdered his wife, and he becomes obsessed with this mystery, and eventually he even gets his girlfriend to help him investigate.What I loved most about the film was the way the story is told. Just like Vertigo and Psycho, Rear Window has a strong and unmatched uniqueness and, even though elements of the film have almost certainly been used in films between then and now. What I really found interesting is the 'restriction' of the film; except for a brief spot near the end, the film is entirely restricted to inside Jefferies's apartment and his view from his rear window. The events of the story that happen outside of the apartment are either only mentioned in the dialogue or seen from the window.However, despite this restriction to voyeurism, it's actually somewhat interesting watching going-ons outside in the courtyard and through the windows of other people's apartments, even though we are watching these things from a distance instead of having the scenes be set in those actual areas. Even in real life, a lot can often be learned even just by watching, and it can be quite interesting. Also, the suspense in the film handled very well. And I should also point out that, like in Psycho and Vertigo, the the story is not entirely predictable; Hitchcock cleverly throws in some things that flout the audience's expectations.In addition to all of this, the actors, especially James Stewart, put on good performances. They are likable and believable. Jefferies is a semi-interesting character, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Lisa, is handled pretty well. The other performances are good too. Overall, the performances in this movie are another factor that make the film great, and they are especially useful given the 'containment' of the film's story.Overall, I think Rear Window is a great movie, with interesting storytelling, good characters, good acting, and strong suspense, among other things. I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in film.My Rating: **** (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",10,0,1,23 October 2012
