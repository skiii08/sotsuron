The Rock," general review
","Maybe the best movie ever made about Alcatraz, again Sean Connery shows his talent at his best, unfortunately not being the main actor ( NC can only reach his toes, maybe ). Very good production, the movie is super realistic, you don't get those weird technology devices shown in other pictures just to blow you away, the equipment is what the marines and seals actually use on their daily job. The suspense is backed up by the music the kind that was also used in movies like Under Siege and Gladiator. A must see and a must have, is the only one I actually have on DVD.",10,3,3,30 May 2002
