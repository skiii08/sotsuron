Ford v Ferrari," Excellent Movie - Take the whole family to see this one!
","One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Drama, action, comedy, sick racing scenes. Loved the relationship between the father and his son as well as his wife. The movie kept me interested the entire time.
Christian Bale played his part so well. Matt Damon was awesome as well. In fact, the entire cast was great.
This is one movie that you will want to take the family to see it on the big screen.
My 12 year old said it was the best movie he has seen in a long time. That is something special coming from a kid his age.
Thank you Hollywood for coming out for a great movie that breaks your heart and cheers your heart.",10,5,17,13 November 2019
