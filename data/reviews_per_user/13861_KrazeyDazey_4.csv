The Devil's Advocate," Skip it!
","The main problem is Keanu Reeves just can't act.  Even paired up with someone like Al Pacino couldn't save this movie. The plot also acts like it doesn't know where it wants to go. Does it want to be a drama or a horror movie....or the first part drama the last half horror. Who knows...and honestly, you don't care. Rating: 2",2,7,18,19 February 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Just so-so.
","This had good acting over all--mostly from Ellen Burstyn. Kinda redundant, but a good attempt at what it was trying to do. I have seen more powerful films on the subject though. Speaking of which the story is really weak...they could have made it 30 minutes long and still got their point across. At then end, I mostly felt like I had my time wasted. Watch maybe Drugstore Cowboy instead.",2,3,7,15 February 2002
L.A. Confidential," Don't waste your time!
","A lax, uninteresting film. Of course, what else can be expected from Kim Basinger.  Kevin Spacey fans will be disappointed. There were times when I didn't think I would even make it through it. I am in the minority though according to IMDb's user rating. I give it a 2 at best.  Watch Primal Fear instead.",2,10,43,19 February 2002
The Usual Suspects," Rent it!
","Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey fans will love it. I thought the story was actually a little predictable, but of the people I know that watched it...I am the only one. It is a twisty and intense film. I think it is worth the time and also the money. Rating: 7",7,0,1,19 February 2002
