The Sound of Music," The hills are truly alive with this classic for all ages.
","This is one film that everyone should see.  It's a colorful musical, a beautiful love story, and, above all, a testimony in support of standing up for your convictions and to the ability of music to move the soul and change lives. Julie Andrews is at her best, both as an actress and a singer.  To think that if she had gotten the lead in My Fair Lady, like she deserved, she probably would have never played Maria!  Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the stern, but big-hearted Captain von Trapp. There's no one I love to hate more than Eleanor Parker's scheming, snobbish Baroness.  Plus, the talent of Mother Abbess and all the children never fail to amaze me: 'Climb Every Mountain' gives me goose bumps and I always love watching the children perform 'Do-re-mi'.  Finally, the two main Sisters and their 'sin' brings a clever touch of humor to a serious scene. All in all, this film has rightly become a cherished part of American cinema.  A true feel-good movie that no household should be without.",Null,0,5,24 April 2000
A Bug's Life," An all-star cast of voices contributes to this wonderful animated film!
","This is one film that everyone in the family or in the dorm can agree on seeing.  If the cast of voices (Julia Louis- Dreyfuss, Kevin Spacey, Phyllis Diller, David Hyde-Pierce, John Ratzenberger, and more) doesn't attract you, the amazing computer animation surely will.Not only are the animation and voices great, but the writing is too.Ironically, my favorite part of the film comes after the end credits with the hilarious computer-generated out takes.  So don't hit rewind as soon as THE END pops up!  You'll miss a real treat!In conclusion, this film does exactly what Flik hopes to do, makes a difference, that is, in cinematic comedy.",Null,0,0,24 April 2000
