The Avengers," THE AVENGERS (9.5 out of 10)
","As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.Speaking of the muscles in the film. 'Cap' appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent 'Maria Hill' appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from 'How I met your mother' fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.The 'one on one' battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again.. Check it out!",10,19,37,1 May 2012
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games (a let down, even though knew it)
","To start with, I can't really say this movie was disappointingly bad. Because I'd already read numerous reviews from friends who had told me how sh*t it was.So instead, I went into this movie trying to see the good in it..Sadly, there wasn't much.The execution is just poor. Whoever directed this should not be put in charge of any sequels if they hope to engage any further.. Edit: oh, it's the Pleasantville guy, well that must be his once off! The acting also is not much better, some of it very forced!This is.. a survival movie, based apparently on a book (part 1 of a trilogy) but at no stage did it really give a sense of urgency, or real fear for one's existence. There was no feel of attachment to any of the characters, including the main pair who made Anakin and Padme's wooden romantic engagement in Star Wars look positively the greatest of all time (please note sarcasm)Some actors of T.H.G, read like a cast list from Marvel movies: Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class) who by the way, acts almost identical in both movies as an outsider.. Liam Hemsworth (ok, not Marvel, but brother of THOR) ;) The two German scientists from Captain America: Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones (the latter, I don't think utters a single word!)A redeeming face amongst the latter cast is Woody Harrelson. I actually sat up and started to take notice somewhat of what was going on, til I realised he wasn't going to get much more.. Another highlight is: Amandla Stenberg.. who plays Rue. Her only other appearance of note so far, being the young 'Cataleya' in Columbiana. In both she doesn't have enough screen time!The rest are pretty much, no names or TV actors. The guy who played the pervert son in American Beauty, the mother of the Cyclon in Battlestar: Caprica. Oh, Donald Sutherland is in this.. but he's such a by product of the film, that he's out of place, or out of touch with what is going on, muttering through his scenes as his wades through the greenery doing nothing much.. Equally, there's Elizabeth Banks who just looks and plays a ghastly personality.The bloodshed truly feels PG, and the NYPD Blue (showing my age) camera work is so disconcerting.. Used to cover up (in latter Transformers it was lazy CGI) but in this film horrific killings, that were most of the time unseen, and barely heard. Apparently this film is banned in Vietnam due to the violent scenes (wtf?!)IF you want to see real survivor films. These are the ones to see: THE TOURNAMENT, PREDATORS (PREDATOR is on a whole other level) and the ultimate school Japanese thriller: BATTLE ROYALE.Please just read the book, and perhaps wait til someone accidentally hires the movie (acquires it) and you're caught out watching it. Or let your youngin's watch it, as it really is, I guess made for them, and I can see why. Poor Jennifer Lawrence, actually RICH Jennifer.. This film was a BOX OFFICE smash??p.s What the hell is Lenny Kravitz doing in a movie?",6,1,4,1 May 2012
Dark Shadows," Perfect, then it's all thrown away..
","Dark Shadows 7 out of 10This movie really had great potential.. The sad thing is, that they: Burton, Depp and Carter.. had it so close.. like, 70% perfect!!! But alas, after a great soundtrack (it's opening song a favourite of mine, and one I have planned for a film I've written of my own) and one of Depp's best performances in a long time.. Burton's art 'should' have succeeded, but instead, fell suddenly flat..Amongst the cast: Michelle Pfeiffer (another ex cast member of Burton's) looked amazing for her age (perhaps just good makeup of course) Helena Bonham Carter (that I've never been a fan of) played her part as well as expected knowing the inner workings of her hubby's mind.. Even Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance along with Alice who well, I'm not sure has changed in the past 50 years..Tim Burton is a master of the Gothic scene. His architecture in time, place, setting and sculpture is without equal. From the early success of Edward Scissorhands to his latter great Sleepy Hollow. He once again brings this uncanny, quirky and foreboding ability to entice audiences into his escapism with Dark Shadows, and he so nearly pulls it off masterly once more, but unfortunately where the film goes, where it entices us to be, instead stops in it's tracks and starts to drag.. then with quick explanation or none at all comes to a close and leaves you behind with quite a dull feeling of.. what was that all about? is that it? So I guess now, it's over.I soooo wanted it to be more, but with such strong character development and premise from the get go, you expected more of the same from start to finish, but instead it rushes what it should have developed, and throws what could have been to the winds..The film may leave you with questions, but perhaps they are not even worth knowing the answer to, other than perhaps, why?",7,2,9,15 May 2012
Prometheus," A wonder to behold and worth waiting every second...
","Prometheus ~ 9.5 out of 10Breathtaking....... all that I could have wanted and more!Truly a brilliant masterpiece, as much as you'd expect from the original 'Alien' director himself... Though, who better to seam his film together!! It's even on par or better than Avatar in 3D beauty.Michael Fassbender is outstanding, and the original Dragon with the Tattoo actress Noomi Rapace a very respectable protagonist. Charlize Theron is stunning and Guy Pearce, well.. his acting was great, can't say he is looking much like himself in this one..The pace is just right, and there are scenes that will shock you and actually it's the first film that has given me a fair bit of a fright since, perhaps the originals themselves when I was but a child.It's total picturesque and gorgeous scenery, no doubt contributed to high production value and eye for detail incorporated with seamless CGI and 3D integration (which is quite rare these days). From it's opening to the final shots of the film.. Truly eye opening.I loved it so much, I have issue with one part of it (where I shall minus the .5 from my total score) but that is to do with either how they will proceed, as it relates to the latter films.. if it is indeed meant to proceed along into their path at all..I will be seeing this film again and again.. For the true Alien fan out there it will be greatly appreciated, and a definite viewing!!p.s Those who work out the opening scene straight up.. Let me know.. I only surprising worked it out thinking about it after seeing the film.. Very enlightening and wonderfully done.. Answers a few questions too :)",10,29,54,6 June 2012
