Mission: Impossible III," A movie that the average drooling American will love
","First of all I must say that i'd be pressed to find a more unrealistic film. All of the gadgets, the stunts, practically anything shown in the movie is picked for its coolness factor to mindless drooling American males 18-35. The classic James Bond movies were far better at this genre. Second, Tom Cruise is not a good actor in my book, for the first 5 minutes of the movie he wears a ridiculous grin in his 'happy' expression, throughout the rest of the movie he wears either his 'pained' expression or his 'scared' expression and thats it. It might have been cheaper if they cast him out of plaster. Finally, The plot is full of holes and doesn't follow a straight path.The first MI film was half-decent, the second was horrible, and the third is just above that. The only mildly amusing parts of the movie are when Ethan Hunt's close friends die. Less torture to go through for all of us. And its not that I hate Americans, I am American, its just the4 sad sad truth.",2,2,4,9 October 2006
