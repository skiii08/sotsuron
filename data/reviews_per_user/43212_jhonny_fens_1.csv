It," Not the hype worth
","6 Stars: I think the movie is a little bit disappointing. Not for the fact that the movie is great made, but more because of the overrated hype. Heard that it was a real horror movie, with scary parts in it, unfortunately it wasn't. The thing I like about IT was the role of Pennywise played by Bill Skarsgård. This, for me, unknown actor showed some great acting skills. Think we will hear about him in the future! Because of the acting skills of Bill Skarsgård and the feeling from the old IT I gave a 6. If I needed to give it stars only for the script and production I would give it a 5.",6,0,1,20 October 2017
