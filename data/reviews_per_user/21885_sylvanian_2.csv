The Lobster," Just a poor movie
","The movie has some good ideas and intentions, but it is just a poorly done boring movie. You could have ideas AND shoot a great movie at the same time, this is not the case.",3,2,3,22 September 2019
The Expendables 2," Chain of fighting scenes with little else
","An amazingly empty movie. A primitive and naive plot seems to be created with one goal - to chain a number of fighting and shooting scenes. The scenes are realistic in the sense of blood and gore, but completely unrealistic in the number of bad guys easily shot with no wounds for the protagonists. The rest is rather a a not-so-logical action it in a hard-to-believe context.The lack of belief is in everything from the main line to details. Take for the start the escape of the team in the starting scene where they rappel along the electric wire easily passing many poles on the way as if they go along a cable line. Or their complete unprofessional behavior when they fall in a trap... Or loads of plutonium in a mine in Albania. The creators did little to make everything at least a little believable like good action movies do.In its bare-action approach, it reminds me some old Chuck Norris movies.. well and Chuck Norris is, of course, in the movie too. And this is the only thing in this film that justifies watching - all macho heroes or Hollywood, together in one movie, cracking jokes and their usual phrases like I will be back. This turns some part of the movie into a parody and make it bearable. Having it all more like a parody would be a winning move, but most of the movie is to serious and doesn't look like a parody, so it doesn't work.",5,0,0,23 November 2012
