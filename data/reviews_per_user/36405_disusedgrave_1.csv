Marie Antoinette," Nothing to do with history
","Everyone has given this movie such a bad rep, stating that it totally goes against history. This may be true, but what we are watching is not history, we are watching a very young girl thrown into a life where she is expected to be something she isn't, I don't care what people think I believe Marie Antoinette regardless of her extreme spending while commoners were suffering, was just a very confused girl, I believe this was another amazing movie by Sofia Coppola and that when watching it, don't look at the history, look at the beauty and divine quality of the film, the costume design and music is amazing, if you want history watch the history channel, if you want a divine and tasteful story, watch Marie Antoinette.",9,1,5,25 February 2007
