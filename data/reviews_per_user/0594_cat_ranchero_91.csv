Moneyball," Good... Liked this one!...
","Very well made with some nice visuals, I particularly liked the use of actual sports coverage and news reports, it gave the story a sense of realism. All the performances were very good; Brad Pitt, who also produced, did a great job as Billy Beane. Jonah Hill was also excellent as Peter Brand; he added some nice comic touches too. The coach, Art Howe was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I felt was a little underused. I will give honourable mentions to; Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg and Stephen Bishop as David Justice.Quite a slow pace to this one gives the audience time to get to know the major players and figure out just what Beane and Brand are doing. To me, the fact they didn't include the coach in their plans was a major flaw; he's the first one you have to convince! Putting that aside, I did find myself rooting for the team as the season came to its conclusion and that's testament to the writers and the filmmakers. If you can get a foreigner who knows very little about the sport to become emotionally involved then you're doing a good job in my book. Over all though, despite its flaws I did enjoy this one and I'm happy to give it my seal of approval.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,1,9 September 2012
The Avengers," Over all... EXCELLENT!...
","I first have to say I saw the film in 2D (none of this 3D nonsense for me) and even so I did find some of the scenes very dark. Also, the aspect ratio at 1.78:1 seemed totally wrong to me, most films these days are shot in a ratio of 2.35:1 and I can't see why this one had to be different (it may be a 3D thing, but it niggled me slightly). As far as performances go, well everyone did a great job but I particularly liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Of course there are plot holes here, as there are in all superhero films and I'm not going to chime on about them now, I'm sure there are many out there that are better qualified than me so I'll leave it to them. What I took away from it was a very entertaining film with a lot of (sometimes subtle) humour and I really enjoyed it. The narrative did seem to get a little stuck in a couple of places though, like when Thor arrived and ended up having a fight with Iron Man, but I can forgive these because as a whole it all worked pretty well. I was a little disappointed with the back-story to Black Widow and Hawkeye, it was only alluded to quite briefly and, I guess because they are more minor characters, I wanted to know a little more about them. But over all I must say it's well worth the admission fee!...

Men in Black 3," Brolin steals the show...
","It's very well made, very slick and everything we've come to expect from an MIB movie. It has been said that Tommy Lee Jones plays the part like he really didn't want to be there and I can see what they mean; he seems to be just going through the motions in many of his scenes. I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as the young Agent K and Will Smith played Agent J with his usual panache. I did feel they went for a few too many cheap laughs, but it was good to hear 'Pictures of Matchstick Men' by Status Quo in the Andy Warhol party scene. Maybe not as good as the first one; about on a par with the second Worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise; otherwise, I'd give it a miss.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just)My score: 6.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,0,1,24 March 2013
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Second viewing... Even better!...
","Lots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go together to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however there is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story involving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi Rapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough believability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very thrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,30 December 2012
Sucker Punch," Great visuals but sadly lacking in substance (IMO)
","There is some really spectacular CGI in this film and the fighting sequences are all very well done. It's a shame the narrative couldn't live up to the visuals though. I finished watching this film with the feeling that I had just watched a bunch of music video's patched together with a very flimsy storyline. Admittedly, they were very spectacular music videos with some spectacular effects, but I didn't feel it made for a film. There was no way I could form any connection to any of the characters because there was no time. The action comes thick and fast and, although there's a lot of talking in between, little of it serves to explain what's happening or even why. Over all, great to look at, but with little substance I guess those that get their kicks from watching scantily clad young women with big guns will like it, but it really didn't do a great deal for me I'm afraid.My Score: 5.7/10IMDb Score: 6.1/10 (based on 99,643 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 33/100: (Based on 29 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 23/100 (based on 196 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 47/100 (based on 83,935 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,0,0,15 April 2012
Source Code," Worth a look!...
","This is a very well made film with lots of attention to detail, everything fits and everything works pretty well. There are overtones of Groundhog Day (1993), in that a time period is repeated, but I found this one very different. Although not as good as 'Moon', IMO, I really liked this film and I'm glad I gave it a second look. It's nicely paced, there's a pretty good soundtrack, although it's quite subdued and at ninety three minutes, it's not too long. Over all, it's a well written, nicely paced piece of science fiction with quite a nice twist at the end. Comparisons have been made with 'Inception' but I'm not even going to go there, they are totally different. I didn't score it quite as highly as first time around because I felt it didn't have quite the impact it did on the big screen. Still a very enjoyable watch though.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,1,16 February 2013
Skyfall," Excellent!... We're back!...
","A film that brings Bond back to its roots with many old characters re- stated by the end; I'm certain it will please many long-standing fans like myself. The story does have quite a lot of emotional depth both for Bond and for M as they are forced to face their past. A highly enjoyable film that stretches all the emotions; everything from laughter to despair; I loved it! Well worth a look – It has my seal of approval, which, coming from a man who, if he used his middle name and mother's maiden name would be called James Bond Think on.SteelMonster's verdict: VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,5,20,28 October 2012
Iron Man 3," A fitting end to the trilogy...
","A very well made film with the kind of top-notch special effects as we've come to expect from these guys. I'm not going to get into the 2D vs. 3D debate but I have to say I did watch it in 2D and I can't really see how 3D would have improved it. All the performances were excellent as usual with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow taking top plaudits (for me anyway). I also have to mention the young Ty Simpkins who plays a kid, Harley Keener, who befriends Tony when he's 'dead'. He played his part very well and we can only hope it leads to bigger things for the young man. I did enjoy this one though despite a rather complicated plot and the usual over-the-top fight sequence towards the end it's definitely worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,7,5 May 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still spellbinding...
","The thing that struck me as I sat down to watch this film was, although I've seen it several times before, I never realised just how good the musical score, by John Williams, was. I'm not just talking about the well known themes, it goes without saying that these are epic, I'm on about the much quieter themes, particularly at the beginning of the film, they are very subtle, but fit the on-screen action perfectly.It's not a film with any great performances, although everyone did a pretty good job; Henry Thomas as Elliott was pretty annoying at times, but it has to be said, he was also pretty good at the emotional stuff. Dee Wallace as Mary, the mother, did a pretty good job, as did Robert MacNaughton as Michael. Also worthy of note was Peter Coyote as the government agent, Keys; although he didn't have an awful lot to do he did it pretty well. For me, the star of the show was a very young Drew Barrymore, who was quite adorable as Gertie.I said earlier there were a few flaws which, for me anyway, prevented this film getting a higher score. One of these was the design of E.T.; yes I know he's quite iconic now but I always felt it looked like a small man in a plastic suit. He's also far too cute. The other thing that lets it down a bit is the CGI, I know it's only really used in a couple of scenes and the technology was in its infancy back then, but I'm afraid modern equipment does show it's limitations. As far as the story, the production and the direction of the film goes, all top notch and well worthy of all the praise it's got over the years. And even with these 'flaws', as I've called them it's still well worth the couple of hours it takes to watch!...

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Disappointing...
","Now, Timur Bekmambetov is well known for the effects he uses in his movies and this is no exception. There is blood and gore all over the screen as death is meted out in many and varied ways, all in glorious slow motion. The trouble is we've already seen that kind of stuff before; there's nothing new or particularly innovative here. Yes, it's very well done; the effects guys did an excellent job; but I would have liked to have seen something different. The plot; again disappointing, it just followed well documented events in Lincoln's life and added a narrative that meant he had to do this or that to thwart the vampire hordes. Not exactly groundbreaking either. The performances were all pretty good although nobody really stood out and nobody looked like they were really stretched either. Over all I found it pretty disappointing; not quite as bad as 'Jonah Hex' (2010), but heading that way.SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (Unless you're a die-hard vampire fan)My score: 4.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",5,0,1,8 June 2013
In Bruges," Gets better each time I see it!...
","There are a lot of comic moments in this film, mainly in the form of the things Ray says and does. Few films make me laugh out loud, but this one did in more than a couple of places. The drama comes mainly in the final third and I found this put a much darker complexion on the comedic scenes that preceded it. I liked the ending; it seemed quite poetic in a way (sorry, no clues). Over all, a very enjoyable film with some laughs, excellent cinematography and some great performancesSteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,4,24 December 2012
As Good as It Gets," Excellent!... But too long...
","Very well scripted with some really great one-liners; mostly delivered by Jack Nicholson; although there is one point where Greg Kinnear does a rather good impression. Both Jack and Helen Hunt put in great performances that were worthy of praise. My main niggle is that it is way too long; it could have easily been shortened by at least 20 minutes and that would have maybe given it a little more punch. Not that I was bored you understand, far from it, I just felt it would have benefited from being a little shorter. Enough of that; it's a very well made film with some excellent performances and a touching, well written, script. Well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,1,24 July 2013
Coraline," Another gem from the director of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' I loved it!...
","I really enjoyed this film; it may be a bit quirky for some, but I really liked the animation and the storytelling. This, combined with some great characters, makes for a very pleasurable experience. I was trying to think what it reminded me of, and the only thing I could think of was 'Pans Labyrinth', but only in a very superficial way. If you liked 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' then I'm sure you'll love this!...

The Hunger Games," An entertaining film which (I'm sure) will be a hit
","This is a very well made film with some nice CGI in places, although I did feel it was a little over-used in a couple of scenes. There are so many similarities (in part) to other films it's hard to know where to start. I guess 'Battle Royalle' is a pretty good start, although I could see influences from; 'The Truman Show', 'Rollerball' (the original one) and 'The Running Man' in there too. I did get the impression that there is a lot more explained in the book than there was time for on the screen because I did feel I had missed out on a few plot points here and there. These particularly surrounded the relationship between Katniss and Peeta; I won't discuss it here as I don't want to go putting down spoilers. Over all though, the 142 minute running time seemed to pass quite quickly (always a good sign) and so I'm happy to deem this one Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 56,220 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 239 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 87/100 (based on 84,278 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,2,9,31 March 2012
Mississippi Burning," Thought-provoking and powerful...
","Although based on real events, the filmmakers go to great lengths to make it clear that this is a work of fiction. As such it works very well; it is a very powerful drama that puts the fight for civil rights to the fore. I must say I found it quite thought provoking, very well made and really well shot. The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell. I also have to mention a couple of small roles; it was nice to see both Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley and R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman; I know they didn't have an awful lot to do, but they were both quality. Over all, an interesting drama that kept me interested all the way through – a definite 'must' for any cinephile.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,2,2,25 July 2013
Argo," Inspiring!...
","Beautifully made with all everything from the costumes to the technology accurate to a tee. I loved the way the film was intercut with archive news footage of the time; this really gave the audience a sense of the world at that juncture. All the performances were excellent with Ben Affleck taking centre stage, but I really enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin as a Hollywood producer; he stole it for me! There was real tension towards the end of the film; it slowly builds for quite a long time and I found that quite masterful. It's something that has been missing from many Hollywood films for a long time now but Affleck seems to have rediscovered the art. Because it's a film based in real events, there's little time for character development and I think it suffers slightly because of it. Other than that, it has some interesting songs on the soundtrack and it's well worth a look!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,1,6 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Liked it a lot!...
","There is a welcome return for all of the favourites from the first film; Spok (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), who I think is brilliant in this part by the way, Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho). Plus we have the addition of Admiral Marcus's daughter, Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), who manages to bluff her way onto the ship. Everyone did a great job, although I wasn't too sure about Scotty's accent, with Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Peter Weller taking top honours (for me anyway).Beautifully shot with much of the trademark lens flaring that is becoming synonymous with the films of J.J. Abrams. It really doesn't bother me as much as it seems to others. I'm really glad I saw it on the big screen (in 2D by the way) because it's one of those that definitely benefits from it. I can't imagine it having anything like the impact on a small screen. It's an epic plot that draws on elements from earlier iterations of these characters but totally turned on its head. I enjoyed it a very much and I'm already looking forward to the next one!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,7,30,11 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Better than expected!...
","I actually found it quite engaging eventually; it was a little hard to get into at first but when the narrative began to settle down I could see a structure there that had potential. Brief summary: When Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces to her husband Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce, his world collapses around him. She had slept with another man, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and Cal finds that hard to take since they had been together since high school. He takes to going to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) who shows him how to dress, behave and (most importantly) how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful (eventually) but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhile there are a couple of other sub-plots going on. One involves Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), who has become infatuated with his babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). She, meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal With me so far?... Also, there is law student, Hannah (Emma Stone) who Jacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him (I can't really say any more about her without giving too much away, so here I'll stop). All these threads eventually tie together in what (at times) appears like a French farce, but which does ultimately have a very valid point.All the performances were very good with Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore taking centre stage. I thought Kevin Bacon was slightly underused, and more could have been made of Emma Stone's character. Over all, it's pretty well made but the narrative does tend to wander in places. An endearing film that does have quite a strong message about love and about soul mates. I freely admit this old romantic found it quite relatable.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,17,20,11 November 2012
Ted," Didn't work for me...
","So, was it worth my while investing 106 minutes of my life on this one? I have to say, on balance; not really. Yes there are some wonderfully comic moments and smart one-liners in there but I did find it drifted far too much from the sublime to the ridiculous. Also, one minute Ted is 'Brian' for Family Guy and the next he turns into 'Peter Griffin' from the same show (despite his denials). I thought both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis did a good job; both of their characters were quite believable. Ultimately though I did find it lacked the one thing it so desperately needed; heart. Still, I'm sure the many devotees of 'Family Guy' will love this one but for me, sadly, it's a bit of a dud.SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (unless you're a really big fan of Family Guy, in which case why haven't you seen it yet!)My score: 5.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",5,16,29,6 May 2013
About Time," An interesting take on the time travel/Rom-com... I liked it!...
","I have to admit I enjoyed this one; yes, they do make certain rules about time travel and then immediately break them, but that's not what the story is about. And yes, it is about well off white people, but again, if I wanted a film that was politically correct and socially aware I don't think I'd have Richard Curtis write it. No, this was pure escapism for me and I happily went along for the ride. Great performances all round, but the stand-out for me was Bill Nighy; he really nailed the part of the dad for me. I have to say I liked the soundtrack as well with many contemporary tunes littered along the way. So it made me laugh and I even shed a tear towards the end and there's not many films can do that. I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for the occasional Rom-Com and this one had just the right ingredients for me.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,7,14,5 October 2013
Midnight in Paris," Allen back on form...
","We begin with shots of Paris (yes, some of them in the rain) and I think I'm looking at a travelogue; but I'm wrong. Once it gets going this film is very witty and even whimsical at times, and I really enjoyed it. Woody Allen's writing is spot on here with some great dialogue and some marvellous characters. The plot has just the right amount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important points about living your life in the past. All the performances were excellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from me.

The Adventures of Tintin," Good in parts...
","It's all very well made with state of the art animation and motion capture to the fore. All the performances were very good with Andy Serkis standing out as Captain Haddock. It did, however, feel like a series of set pieces stitched together by a rather flimsy adventure story. Far too much is left to coincidence for anything to be credible I'm afraid, which is probably why I wasn't really a fan of the Tintin stories in the first place. Over all, it didn't quite work for me; however, I would be interested to see what they do with the next instalment.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)My score: 6.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,0,0,27 December 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Darkly satirical... I loved it!...
","Although the effects are not of the quality we expect today, a pretty good job was done considering the technology in the early 1960's. The film was all very well shot, Kubrick had a great eye and I can see the early echoes of the latter scenes in 'Full Metal Jacket' in certain scenes here.Darkly satirical throughout, I really love the way this film never lets up and portrays the military as the bad guys. Surprisingly the politicians, the President in particular, comes off pretty well in the end. One slight niggle (for me) was that the film was shot in a 4:3 ratio and I'm afraid that did make it look a little dated. I can forgive the fact that it was made in black & white given where, and when, it was made. Over all though, a genuinely entertaining film that has several highs and one that have absolutely no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 9.4/10IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 196,848 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 96/100: (Based on 11 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 60 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 94/100 (based on 117,100 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,2,14 April 2012
The Way Back," An inspiring tale!...
","A really well made film about an epic journey; Peter Weir is good at this kind of thing and this is a good example of his work. A nice musical score by Burkhard von Dallwitz complements the visuals with quite anthemic themes, particularly towards the end. All the performances were very good; particularly Jim Sturgess as Janusz, Colin Farrell as Valka, Ed Harris as Mr. Smith, Saoirse Ronan as Irena and Mark Strong as Khabarov. Honourable mentions must go to; Gustaf Skarsgård as Voss, Alexandru Potocean as Tomasz, Sebastian Urzendowsky as Kazik and Dragos Bucur as Zoran.There is a bit of a spoiler at the beginning of the film where the audience is told how many make it to India which does take a little of the impact away from the film. You find yourself wondering just when various cast members might either meet their demise or decide to take another path. It's a distraction I could have done without. The film is a bit too long and there is a lot of time spent in just getting out of Russia which, I felt, could have been better spent in crossing the Himalayas (just my personal preference). Over all though I did find it quite inspiring that such a journey could be made and I felt quite elated at the end. I may not watch it again, but I'm glad I gave it at least one viewing.

Alien," A classic!... need I say more?...
","From the very first scene to the very last this film both looks and sounds quite menacing. The design and the music are all superb and the performances, although a little chaotic at times are all excellent. Of course the stand-out performance comes from, the quite young at the time, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. In a role she was to make her own she was a little raw, but you could see the quality there. Next up (for me) was Ian Holm as Ash; he played what must have been a difficult part very well. Yaphet Kotto as Parker and Harry Dean Stanton as Brett played the blue collar grunts very well, and also provided some much needed comic relief here and there. Tom Skerritt did OK as Dallas, although I felt it wasn't a particularly demanding role. Veronica Cartwright did a decent job as Lambert and John Hurt, who has one of the most iconic scenes in sci-fi film history, played it with great aplomb. Finally a word for Jones the ship's cat (uncredited) Some great cat acting from that kitty.The film has quite a slow pace that slowly builds to an almost frenetic conclusion. I must admit that having seen the follow-up 'Aliens' (1986), directed by James Cameron, I lost a little of the love I had for this one. You'll be pleased to know I've grown up a bit since then and can now see the merits of both films. There is a certain quality to every scene in this film, whether it's the sound design, the music or just the sets themselves, it looks and sounds quite brilliant. It's creepy as hell and I believe Ridley Scott has learned the art of allowing the audience enough of a glimpse for them to make up the rest of the monster in their own minds. This is (of course) where all the best monsters lurk It's not perfect though, there are a few rough edges here and there, but even so well worth a look!...

Underworld Awakening," Great!... (for fans of the franchise)...
","The effects, the fight scenes and the stunt-work is all of a very high quality and I can't fault the filmmakers for that. All the performances are very good, although the audience is left in no doubt who the star of the show is. I did find it hard to connect with any of the main characters though; I guess as what a vampire would consider food; I found it hard to have much sympathy with them being wiped out. Eventually though I did become enwrapped and found myself rooting for the 'good guys' towards the end. Even so, I can't say it's a particularly good film; much relies on the audience being familiar with the world in which the franchise exists and so I guess, unless you're a fan it won't make an awful lot of sense (spectacular CGI and fight scenes apart).SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDEDMy score: 4.8/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",5,1,3,5 January 2013
Life of Pi," Stunning!...
","First off, it looks stunning; every shot has been meticulously worked out and executed with a high degree of skill and care. The VFX are quite amazing (I have to say for the record that I watched it in 2D). For me the film is in three parts, the story of Pi before he leaves India, the story on the ocean and the story when he makes it to land. It's the middle section I found the most compelling; every time there's a cut- away from the boat I couldn't wait to get back. A very metered pace to proceedings allows the audience to become enwrapped in this tale. Ang Lee is very good at this kind of filmmaking and I have to applaud him for this particular effort. Over all, visually stunning and beautifully made; I thought the young actor Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi on the boat was truly excellent in the role. It may not be to everyone's taste (too few explosions for some I suspect), but I certainly enjoyed it – it's well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,3,29 December 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good but not great...
","As with all of these films the effects are first rate, I particularly like the way the character of Steve was made to look really weak and scrawny in the early scenes. All the performances were pretty good; Chris Evans did a decent job as Captain America/Steve Rogers, as did Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. I really enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine and Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola. I'm afraid I was a little disappointed by Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, but I think that had more to do with the character than his performance. Also worthy of note were; Sebastian Stan as James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (doing a great impression of Howard Hughes by the way), Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and last but not least, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.Although I did enjoy this film up to a point, I did find the focus on America a little off-putting. Yes I know they did try to make it look a little international by drawing in a team made up from other nations that were also involved in WWII, but that didn't quite cut it for me. The bad guy didn't work either I'm afraid; he didn't offer enough threat and so turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. Now I know this is just another stepping stone towards the 'Avengers' movie, but I expected a lot better.My Score: 6.7/10IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 131,716 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 66/100: (Based on 36 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 79/100 (based on 216 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 75/100 (based on 126,843 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,0,1,28 April 2012
10 Things I Hate About You," Great!...
","This film works because the audience are given a group of well rounded characters; many of which are quite likable, which helps. These are then put into a sequence of situations that resolve themselves into a satisfactory conclusion. Of course we are taken on quite a journey before this conclusion and I can see how some may find the plot a little hard to follow. Fortunately I have read the Shakespeare play and even seen it performed and so am familiar with all its twists and turns. I love the way it's written with allusions to the original text, for instance calling the school 'Padua' was a very nice touch. All the performances were excellent with both Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona and Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford taking the plaudits. I must also give a nod to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford, David Krumholtz as Michael and Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner. Oh, and look out for a nice comic turn from Allison Janney as Ms. Perky; very funny.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed this film and have every time I've seen it! I know it got few plaudits from the critics when it came out, but it certainly speaks to me. It's surprising just how many people 'love that movie' when I bring it up; but so few can tell me what it's about. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it and if you have, give it another look sometime; it's well worthy of a second look. Watch right to the end of the credits as well for some amusing outtakes.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.5/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,1,25 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic!... Well worth a look...
","The word 'Epic' seems insufficient to describe the scope of this production; it is truly mind-blowing. I also have to mention the original music by Howard Shore; a truly magical score that I will seek out just to listen to (it's really that good). As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Sean Bean as Boromir. Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian Holm as Bilbo and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum (more from him in the next two instalments).This is the second time I have seen this cut of the movie and, although it is very long, I must say I have seldom enjoyed a film as much. I will not try to compare the book with the film; I'm sure there are many out there that could do a far more eloquent job than me. Needless to say, there are differences, and I can see the reasons for them. Just daring to bring such an epic tale to the screen would be enough for many, but to also do it justice is beyond imagining. Hats off to Mr. Jackson and all those involved; you did a tremendous job! I know it's not to everyone's taste and I really feel sorry for those that can't appreciate the imagination and effort that goes into an undertaking like this. All this praise and I only give it a 9.4? Well, let's say I've seen the other two films and I'm leaving a little room for improvement.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.4/10IMDb Score: 8.8/10 (based on 592,380 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 92/100: (Based on 34 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 92/100 (based on 209 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 92/100 'Liked it' (based on 1,219,515 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,0,25 August 2012
Man of Steel," Great... Just one niggle...
","The opening sequence on Krypton is quite spectacular with some truly stunning CGI and some great dialogue. It sets the scene for the entire story and I think it was just about as perfect a beginning we could possibly have had. We then come down to earth (literally) where we find Clark Kent discovering who he is and coming to terms with his powers and what a responsibility that places on his shoulders. Much of this is told in flashback with some great fatherly advice from Kevin Costner. It's a section of the film that may have lost some (probably due to the lack of explosions) but I really enjoyed it as it gives us a chance to get to know what motivates Clark/Superman, and just what makes him a superhero. The third act, however, is where I had the most trouble. The plot wasn't hard to follow and the acting was great, particularly Michael Shannon, no, all that was great. The problem was with the fight scenes; why is it necessary to topple skyscrapers and destroy entire city blocks. It put me in mind of climactic battle in 'The Avengers' movie; I had the distinct impression I had seen it all before. Yes, it was quite a spectacle but I would have liked something a little more original. But don't let that distract from the fact it is still a very good film and one I would happily watch again. Top performances, well everybody really but Michael Shannon really does stand out; definitely worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,15 June 2013
Cast Away," Wiiillllssssonnnn!!!!...
",I found this a totally absorbing film; one of those that make the time pass much more quickly than you expect. You very quickly get involved in the story and you find that you actually care about this man stranded on this island. You really want him to survive and get back to the woman he loves; and you feel his pain when things don't go quite right. It's quite emotional and can be quite harrowing in places. Some people don't like the ending but I really did; it leaves the audience to decide just what he'll do next Loved this one.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.,9,2,3,6 October 2012
Trouble with the Curve," Engaging with some excellent performances...
","Well made with many baseball references that went well over my head but that didn't matter. The film isn't about that, it's about relationships and as such I found it an engaging watch. Both Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams were excellent in this; I admire them both as actors and they didn't disappoint. Justin Timberlake gets better each time I see him, I just wish he'd stop making those awful records! (It's a joke folks). Also worthy of note were Matthew Lillard as Phillip Sanderson, Robert Patrick as Vince and John Goodman as Pete Klein. It's not a tear-jerker or a heart rending tale but I found it did strike an emotional chord with me. If, like me, you admire Eastwood and Adams then it's well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,2,15 September 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," An entertaining animation...
","This film has a well written plot with likable characters and some excellent gags along the way (it easily passed the 'six laugh test'). I also liked the musical score by John Powell and Hans Zimmer, some nice themes that go well with the visuals. One or two of the gags didn't quite come off (for me) but I can forgive that for a very well put together entertaining film Recommended.My score: 7.5/10IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 62,521 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 67: (Based on 31 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 81/100 (based on 161 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 79/100 (based on 90,056 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,1,7 May 2012
American Psycho," Excellence from Bale...
","First off, Christian Bale is totally excellent in this part; because I've seen all the Batman films before seeing this, it came as a bit of a culture shock to see him in this particular role. But he carries it off brilliantly! I love the way his character's narration overlay's the images and the musical references are worked in so well. It's a really well made film too with a pretentious cuisine and big chunky telephones taking us back to the 80's. Having not read the book I did find some of it a little hard to follow, but I'll add it to the reading list and give this one another look afterwards. Definitely worth a look though, if just for Bale's performance.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,3 March 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the best road-trip movies I've seen!...
","Now I'm not usually a fan of comedies, but the humour in this one is so dark that I actually enjoyed it! Very well made with some great dialogue and some characters that I could actually relate to (makes a change!). As road trip movies go, I must say that this is the best one I've seen in quite a long time. The mix of characters and the way they interact works pretty well and I found the film quite engaging (I even laughed a few times!). Yes, some of the situations they got themselves into were a tad far-fetched, but I can forgive that (this time) because the characters actually had some substance. Would I watch it again? Yes I would and so I have no problem in deeming this one Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 7.9/10 (based on 194,846 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 91/100 (based on 205 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 90/100 (based on 379,546 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,9 April 2012
Over the Hedge," Not so good second time around?...
","There were some decent jokes but I couldn't help but feel it wasn't all that original. There were a lot of writers involved in this project and I'm sorry to say it shows. By the end it looked very much like they were running out of ideas. It's not all bad though, the film does move along a quite a nice pace although it does get a little baggy in the middle. There are some fun characters and even some funny gags here and there also the traditional 'homage's' to classic films that filmmakers always seem to put in these days.

Silver Linings Playbook," Worth a punt!...
","I found it a little hard to get into at first with Bradley Cooper over- acting in places, which was beginning to put me off. The introduction of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) though changed all that and the narrative began to make more sense. All the performances were excellent with (for me) Jennifer Lawrence standing out. Yes, I know De Niro is there but he's really not a major character although he does play his part very well. Bradley Cooper was good, but no better really than I have seen him before. The action is littered with an awful lot of music, some I was familiar with and some not so much; all of it fitted the visuals well though and it made for a welcome enhancement to the entertainment. Over all I found it a well rounded romantic comedy (with some drama thrown in for good measure) and just a twist of quirkiness. It even touched me on an emotional level (a rare thing these days) so it gets a pretty high recommendation from me.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.3/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,2,22 September 2013
Dark City," Very Dark and well worth a look!...
","This review refers to the Director's Cut version available on DVD.This film is extremely dark, and I'm not just talking about the way it's lit. Everything about it is dark. Yes there are things that people may find a little bit too freaky, flying men for a start, but I can overlook this 'silliness' because the story is so good. It slowly unfolds like a 1930's detective novel, but with a very dark twist. I must admit that even on its third viewing I was still finding little nuances in there that just make it a little better each time.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Worth a look?...
","I found it quite hard to look at this film without drawing parallels with Sam Raimi's 2002 film Spider-Man. The two are very similar in many ways although this one did try to stay a little more grounded. As far as performances go, well everyone did a decent job; Andrew Garfield coped well with the dual role of Spider-Man and Peter Parker and Emma Stone did a decent job as Gwen Stacey. I thought Rhys Ifans did a very decent job as The Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was fine as the cop Captain Stacey (Gwen's dad). But I must give a special mention for Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as Aunt May; a masterful piece of casting; both were perfect (IMO).Comparing the two films (it's hard not to), I felt that this one didn't really add anything that the original did. Yes, it's a slightly different take on it, but essentially the same. There are long periods spent setting up dramatic plot points that don't always pay off and I also felt it was far too long. The CGI is all very well done and the fight sequences are also well executed but I did have the nagging feeling I had seen it all before. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but (IMO) not different enough from Sam Raimi's effort to be a great film. Even soÂ… Recommended, especially if you haven't seen the original 2002 movie.My score: 6.8/10IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 29,271 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 66/100: (Based on 42 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 228 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 84/100 'Liked it' (based on 291,053 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,3,7 July 2012
Control," Liked it...
","Shot entirely in black and white I found this film very atmospheric and it also had a gritty realism about it. I thought all the performances were excellent with both Sam Riley and Samantha Morton taking top honours. I also have to give a mention to Toby Kebbell who totally stole a couple of scenes with some great over-the-top one-liners. The story is primarily told from Debbie's point of view and as such we get a very interesting look at the life of this enigmatic soul. This film inspired me to go out and buy a Joy Division greatest hits CD and it's music that's always been close to my heart. I should mention that all the live performances portrayed in the film were performed by the actors and so hat's off to them for making it real. Whether you were a fan of the band or not I'm sure you'll get something out of this one. Be warned though, it's quite a tough watch, even when you do know the outcome.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,1,25 May 2013
The Exorcist," Iconic!...
","A very slow deliberate pace may not be to everyone's taste, but it gradually picks up and this gives more impact to the actual exorcism scene. Although I did find there were scenes in the movie that didn't make an awful lot of sense, I still found it quite a compelling watch. I'm not a religious man but I can understand how certain scenes may not be welcomed by some of those that are. I really liked the pacing of the film and the way several threads were woven together at the end. The only thing that was missing (for me) was a little more background on Father Merrin. Over all though, an excellent piece of work and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.9/10IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 156,543 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 82/100: (Based on 24 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 47 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 'Liked It' (based on 308,690 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,3,27 May 2012
Quantum of Solace," Not as good as 'Casino Royalle' but still worth a look...
","Production wise, I couldn't fault it, shot very well both on location and at Pinewood with, as usual, an excellent soundtrack. On the down side, the fight sequences did remind me of the 'Jason Bourne' films a little bit too much, I expected something a little more original. Over all, just what we've come to expect from a modern Bond movie, it just lacked a little humour to lighten it up a bit, apart from that, pretty enjoyable if a little over complicated.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,0,4,14 October 2012
Batman Begins," Epic!... Well worth a look...
","Beautifully shot with some stunning CGI; chiefly used for the cityscapes of Gotham, and they look great. The sets and locations all blur seamlessly together and make for a visual treat; Nolan certainly has an eye for this kind of thing. All the performances were excellent; especially Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he really nailed it. I must also give praise to Michael Caine as Alfred; a role he could have been born to play, I thought he was perfect. Katie Holmes was also very good as Rachel Dawes, as were Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. I will give honourable mentions to; Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone, Rutger Hauer as Earle and Ken Watanabe as Ra's Al Ghul. Oh, and if you look carefully you might spot a young Jack Gleeson (currently on TV's 'A Game of Thrones') in a minor role.I'm sure that many people saw 'The Dark Knight', the sequel to this film, and wet back to re-watch this one. I have, of course, seen both but decided to re-watch them in order so I can get some perspective before the third instalment is released in a couple of weeks. I had forgotten just how epic this film was and how it manages to hold your attention virtually all the way through. All the characters are quite believable (despite being based on a fantasy comic book) and their motivations are made clear. Something that many filmmakers forget but something that is vitally important when it comes to keeping the attention of the audience. For me, one of the best origin story movies I've seen and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 414,263 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 70/100: (Based on 41 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 261 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 90/100 'Liked it' (based on 969,838 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,0,8 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Good without being great... But it DID pass my 'Six Laughs Test'...
","Very well made and yes, it did pass the 'six laugh test' – If a comedy doesn't get more than six laughs from me it ain't no comedy! As for performances, well, everyone was very good; Kristen Wiig as Annie Walker, Maya Rudolph as Lillian and Rose Byrne as Helen all did great jobs. I loved Melissa McCarthy as Megan, she really made me laugh and (of course) Chris O'Dowd as Rhodes; I know him from the TV show 'The IT Crowd' here in the UK. Also worthy of note were; Rebel Wilson as Brynn, Matt Lucas as Gil, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Rita and Ellie Kemper as Becca. Oh, and look out for Jon Hamm (uncredited) as Ted.A story about popularity, friendship, love, relationships all kinds of stuff really; I was kind of struggling to keep up by the end! There is a trend in comedies (of late) of putting people in awkward, uncomfortable, often embarrassing situations and I must say I'm afraid don't find it funny. You are made to care about a particular character and then laugh at them as they squirm in an uncomfortable situation. Sorry people, it just doesn't do anything for me. As far as this film goes, yes there were some of those moments, but there were also some truly comic moments, mostly supplied by the wonderful Melissa McCarthy, it has to be said; although Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd did raise a titter or two. The surprise for me though, was the performance of Rose Byrne, she did really well in a genre I wouldn't particularly associate with her. Over all, I must say, despite a couple of misgivings, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I expected to Recommended.My score: 7.1/10IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 93,096 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 75/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 232 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 'Liked It' (based on 87,373 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,2,16 June 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Different...
","The things that struck me about it were one, it's very long, and it's very long because; two, the pacing is pretty slow for the most part. Yes, there are some spectacular set-pieces (the rock giant fight being my favourite), but there is an awful lot of stuff in-between these gems. But then I guess that's Jackson's adopted style for these films. Did I enjoy it? Yes Would I buy it when it comes out on DVD? Again, yes Am I looking forward to the next instalment? Hell yes!...

The Princess Bride," An all-time favourite!...
","So why do I love this film so much? Well, for me it has everything; pirates, a giant, great swordplay, a damsel in distress, an evil bad guy, revenge, an awful lot of humour and not least a happy ending. There is quite a modern feel to it all but with the traditional values of chivalry along with a little dastardly play. Of course, some magic; how could you have a fairytale without magic? But over all, I love it because it doesn't pretend to be anything more or less than it is; a great adventure. If I ever need cheering up or I need to restore my faith in human nature I can escape into this film and when I come out the other side I know I'll feel better. No, it's not perfect, but I'd watch it in preference to many modern films any day.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,0,30 September 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Good!...
","A film that takes the audience from Budapest to Moscow to Dubai to India and maybe a few other international destinations in-between! There is some spectacular looking stunt work and some cracking effects; hats off to those guys! All the performances were very good with Tom Cruise playing Ethan Hunt with his usual aplomb. It was nice to see a little comic relief provided by the inclusion of Simon Pegg; the comedic two- and-fro between him and Jeremy Renner was particularly amusing. Maybe the plot might have been a little over-complicated, but over all I found it a pretty enjoyable watch.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,2,23 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Second viewing: Still great!...
","The CGI in this film is truly stunning, and although you know most of it is computer generated, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. As far as performances go, well, for me, the star was definitely Andy Serkis who did the vast majority of the motion-capture work for Caesar, a really stunning performance. As far as the humans go, well, James Franco did a decent job as Will Rodman, as did Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha, although I felt her character was never fully developed and consequently she was woefully underused. John Lithgow was excellent as Will's father, Charles and Brian Cox was suitably sleazy as John Landon. Tom Felton did a good job as the evil handler, Dodge Landon and David Oyelowo was Will's boss, Steven Jacobs.I loved every minute of this film and I really hope any sequels that are made keep to the same standard. If I have one criticism, it's that the human characters are not particularly well developed. I can forgive that to a large extent because it forces the audience to see things from Caesar's perspective. There are plenty of references and nods to the original 1968 film starring Charlton Heston (something to look out for). Certainly one of my favourite films of 2011 and I see nothing here to change my view. I have given it a slightly lower score than after my first viewing, mainly because the film does loose a little of its impact when scaled down for the small screen. Even so, well worth a look for any fan of the 'Apes' films and even those that haven't seen them.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.8/10IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 176,850 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 68/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 83/100 (based on 240 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 87/100 'Liked it' (based on 85,827 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,2,4,29 August 2012
Drive," Quite brilliant!...
","An interesting mix of tunes and the back streets of LA form a rather interesting backdrop to this tale. Nicely made with a few nice stunts thrown in for good measure (well there had to be really, didn't there).A very slow paced film, almost noir in the look and feel to it, the tension slowly builds. There are, at times, some scenes of extreme violence that are by no means out of place here. One scene in an elevator (if you've seen it, you'll know which one I mean) is an almost perfect moment of cinema. No dialogue, just a perfect scene (IMO). I did have just one gripe though, and that was the casting of Carey Mulligan; I couldn't get my head around how someone like her could end up with the guy she was with. Or maybe I'm just reading it wrong, I don't know. But other than that it's quite an eye-opening film and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 185,406 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 79/100: (Based on 40 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 92/100 (based on 225 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 78/100 'Liked it' (based on 72,813 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,4,5 June 2012
Good Will Hunting," Worthy of its praise...
","Well made with some nice musical numbers thrown into the mix. Nothing particularly different in the cinematography but still well put together. On the performance front, Matt Damon did an excellent job as Will Hunting, as did Robin Williams as Sean Maguire. I also thought Stellan Skarsgård did a very good job as Prof. Gerald Lambeau, also Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan and Minnie Driver as Skylar. Also worthy of note were Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser as Will's friends Morgan O'Mally and Billy McBride.Although I thought the film was very good and the performances were all excellent I didn't quite get the relationship between Will and Skylar. I didn't feel enough time was spent with them for the relationship to become as strong as it was portrayed. Other than that I was with it one hundred percent; I believed in the characters and I found no problem in following their motivations. There's also some great dialogue that gives this one an edge, I really enjoyed that aspect. Over all, a decent drama with maybe slight problem or two, but still RECOMMENDED.My Score 8.5/10IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 250,891 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 70/100: (Based on 28 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 68 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 92/100 'Liked It' (based on 318,354 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,1,3,16 July 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Brilliant!... (again)...
","Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. It's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,1,24 September 2012
The Elephant Man," Excellent!...
","Filmed entirely in black and white I found this quite an interesting take on John Merrick's story. Of course a lot of poetic license is used, but the essence of the man and his story are there. I have to admit I love John Hurt's performance; I can't imagine anyone else getting that much emotion through so many prosthetics! Of the other performers, I thought Freddie Jones as the side-show entrepreneur was excellent also. Over all, although it does have its faults, I did enjoy this one; it's quite poignant in places and you find yourself really touched by John Merrick; a little over-long, but well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,2,23 March 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," Didn't quite work (for me)...
","Quite a daring film for its day, showing events almost exclusively from the point of view of the robbers. There seems to be a little Stockholm Syndrome going on where the hostages begin to identify with their captors, but this isn't explored too closely. All the performances are very good with Pacino doing some of his very best scenery chewing with Cazale consequently playing it down and very understated (I liked that). It didn't work for me though because I never bought into the stories we learn about Sonny; it's him the film concentrates on mostly. He seems quite savvy when it comes to banks and police/FBI procedures and yet still panics when the police first arrive. I never had any connection with for either of the robbers and so found it quite a bumpy road to go down. Having said that I thought it was well made but certain scenes came across like a bit of an improvised scene in an acting class. I doubt I'd watch it again, but at least it's another I can cross off 'The List'.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just)My score: 6.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,9,16,16 December 2012
Kick-Ass," Still excellent on my third viewing!...
","I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy is excellent, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (also superb), Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year, just to see how it should be done!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,4,5,22 November 2012
Unknown," Does what it says on the tin...
","Very well made with some very slick editing keeping the pace pretty high all the way through. It did feel a little like a travelogue in parts, giving us all the iconic views of Berlin whenever the plot brings the action outside. To be fair though, there are a few seedier parts of the city shown as well. All the main cast played their parts well with Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger standing out. I also enjoyed the performance of Bruno Ganz as the ageing former Stazi agent and it was nice to see Frank Langella as Martin's old colleague, Rodney Cole. Over all, a decent watch that doesn't really break any new ground but does what it says on the tin (and I can't knock it for that).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.0/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,2,20 January 2013
Brave," Good!...
","I first have to praise the animators at Pixar, the film really does look quite stunning, as we've come to expect. I will put aside the many historical inaccuracies or I could be here all day; needless to say, a lot of poetic license has been used. There were some really comic moments which I found quite refreshing, but the general narrative was skewed towards a female audience (I felt). Not that that's a bad thing; I still found myself wrapped up in the story as much as I would have been if it had been a more male orientated work. Over all, it's very enjoyable with some great comic moments. Definitely one for mothers and daughters rather than fathers and sons, but still worth a look if you have the inclination.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,3,30 March 2013
The Dark Knight," Awesome!... Very Highly Recommended!...
","Beautifully made with an excellent score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer that really sets the tone and carries themes over from the first film 'Batman Begins'. Lots of physical stunts used although there was some CGI in evidence; both were excellently done. Performance-wise, well star billing has to go to Heath Ledger as the Joker; I doubt I'll ever see a bad guy quite like that again, he was awesome! Of course, Christian Bale did his usual excellent work as Batman/Bruce Wayne, as did Michael Caine as Alfred. Aaron Eckhart was much better than I remembered (from first viewing) as Harvey Dent/Two-Face and Maggie Gyllenhaal did a decent job as Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox complete the starring line-up and both were excellent as ever.I usually find, when watching a film of this length, that there is always a passage where your mind wanders and you find yourself drifting away from what's on the screen. Not so with this film; Nolan keeps your attention all the way through, whether it's with stunning action sequences or with the dialogue or just with the interaction between the characters that (by then) you've become invested in. He really is a master of his art and I can only hope he goes on to make even better films in the future. As for 'The Dark Knight' well I knocked a couple of points off for the 'tidy-up form Batman Begins' sequence at the beginning; I didn't think it was necessary. Other than that it was near- perfect VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.7/10IMDb Score: 8.9/10 (based on 726,635 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 82/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 281 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 96/100 'Liked it' (based on 1,167,671 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",10,2,5,14 July 2012
Puss in Boots," Has kitty got claws?...
","Well animated with a nice musical score by Henry Jackman; the quality of the picture is great as well (no 3D here). Performance wise; well it wouldn't be Puss in Boots without the voice of Antonio Banderas in the starring role, and he really nailed it again here! Salma Hayek did a very decent job as Kitty Softpaws and Zach Galifianakis was adequate as Humpty Dumpty (more on him later). Honourable mentions go to; Billy Bob Thornton as Jack, Amy Sedaris as Jill, Constance Marie as Imelda and Guillermo del Toro as Moustache Man/Comandate.Although, in parts it was pretty funny and there were some nice one- liners and the usual subtle references to other movies; I felt there was something missing (apart from Shrek and Donkeyetc). At the end of the day I put it down to the fact that I didn't find the character of Humpty Dumpty very convincing. His motivations seemed very vague for the amount of effort he put in. This aside, it's well made, pretty enjoyable and it's got Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots! Could have been better though.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just).My Score 6.4/10IMDb Score: 6.7/10 (based on 49,821 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 65/100: (Based on 24 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 83/100 (based on 136 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 70/100 'Liked It' (based on 66,712 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,0,2,17 August 2012
Once Upon a Time in America," Epic!...
","I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,3,23 February 2013
Avatar," Doesn't deserve some of the bad press its attracted (IMO)
","This is the second time I've seen this film and so a lot of press has been written about it since its release; some of it is referred to here:'Pocahontas in Space', 'Fern Gully meets Terminator', these are just two of the comments I've heard about this film since its release. I can see why it has attracted such 'derisory' comments, but I can also see (from a second viewing) just what Cameron was trying to do. Yes, the story is predictable and, for the most part, we've seen it all before in another guise. But there is an underlying message about greed that seems to get missed my many reviewers. It is all a bit too 'touchy, feely' for some, but personally I didn't mind it all that much. At the end of the day I did find it entertaining (if a little schmaltzy in places), but even so, still well worth a look Still Recommended (if with a slightly lower score).My score: 7.9/10IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 423,897 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 83/100 (based on 283 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 92/100 (based on 622,949 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,2,1 April 2012
The Artist," Excellent!...
","I found this film a breath of fresh air; it took me back to Saturday morning TV when they used to show the odd silent movie. A simple love story with some great acting and a brilliant musical score really hit the mark. I did find, though, that George's decline went on a little too long, just when you thought he'd hit bottom there was a little further to go. But that's the only criticism I have, it's beautifully made in the style of the time and, although it may not be for everyone. A marginally lower score this time around; I guess it didn't quite have the same impact it did on the big screen Still well worth a look though!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,2,4,17 February 2013
Super 8," Even better second time around...
","A very well made film with likable characters, some neat CGI and some very clever effects. As I've already said, I can see what J.J. Abrams was aiming at, and that is the Spielberg films of the late 70's to the early 80's. Films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and even the Spielberg-produced, The Goonies (1985). Unfortunately this doesn't have the warmth or the magic of those films, but it is still a worthy effort. Going back to the middle third of the film, I referred to it at the beginning; J.J.Abrams uses this section to give the film a lot of emotional depth. This is something I hadn't noticed on my initial viewing, but I can now see just what he was trying to do. Unfortunately it doesn't quite come off here but even so, by the end I could see its place and it made for a really quite enjoyable film. Some great music, both the original soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and the songs of the period that were chosen. As far as the cinematography goes, I've read a lot of comment about 'flaring'; this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I like that they show the film the kids were making while the end credits are rolling It's pretty neat.

Rio," Fun, but didn't quite hit the mark...
","A film clearly made for 3D (I saw it in 2D) and so the animation is very well done with pin sharp images. I can't say the film was groundbreaking at all, but I guess the filmmakers were happy enough as I see a sequel is already in the pipeline.Although I found it a little formulaic and a tad too predictable I found I did engage with the characters eventually. To be honest, I found the human characters more interesting than the animals. The songs were not to my taste, but I will say they fitted the mood of the piece pretty well. I guess at the end of the day the film will be entertaining enough for the younger audience but I can't see it being stuck in the DVD player too many times.My score: 6.4/10IMDb Score: 7.0/10 (based on 58,702 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 63/100: (Based on 29 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 141 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 72/100 'Liked It' (based on 73,872 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,3,4,1 June 2012
Jack Reacher," Good but failed to impress...
","The film starts off very stylish, looking every bit the classic cop movies of the 70's and 80's. Sadly it does not keep this early promise and soon slips into the usual cliché's that have haunted many more recent cop films. I found it very hard to connect with any of the characters, although all the performances were very good. I did particularly like Werner Herzog as The Zec, a particularly shady character; other than that it was pretty mundane.

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Mad bad and highly entertaining!...
","Mad bad and highly entertaining, I really enjoyed this film. I particularly liked the fact that when things got particularly violent the camera wasn't pointed directly at the action. We were aware of what was going on but there was no Tarantino-esq splatter-fest. This may well have been for budgetary reasons, but I'd prefer to fill in the blanks myself anyway. The plot does get a little over-complicated in places but is all neatly resolved in the end just about. Everything from the sharp, witty dialogue to the locations was done with that kind of British style you'd never see in a Hollywood production. It always hits the mark for me!...

In Time," On the line?...
","On the performance front, I thought Cillian Murphy and Amanda Seyfried stood out with Justin Timberlake lacking the required screen presence to carry it off (IMO). I thought Michael William Freeman who had a small role as bad guy Nardin did a good job of playing a very believable loathsome thug. With virtually everyone on screen being around the same age (25), barring the occasional kid, I found this one quite odd to look at (even a bit ageist! – just a joke, honest). It's pretty well made with some great ideas behind the plot and even some great dialogue thrown in here and there but at the end of the day it just failed to get over that mark. It's not that it's a bad film, the problem is, it's just not the great film it deserved to be.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED just.My score: 6.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,0,2,20 November 2012

","All the performance are excellent, I think Sean Connery got an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone. I thought Robert De Niro was particularly good as Capone and Kevin Costner did a very decent job as Ness. I hadn't realised that the score was written by Ennio Morricone, and now I know that I also know why I like it so much. The film itself is very well made with some quite memorable set pieces and some nicely phrased dialogue. It's quite an adventure although I'm not entirely sure about its historical accuracy.

The Fountain," Underrated IMO...
","Beautifully shot with some stunning images. I wasn't sure about the muted tones used at first but as the film went on it grew on me. The musical score by Clint Mansell was both beautiful and inspired; I will be tracking it down. The performances of the two central characters; Hugh Jackman as Tomas / Tommy / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Isabel / Izzi Creo were stunning; Aronofsky certainly knows how to get a performance and they didn't let him down. I also have to give honourable mentions to; Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Mark Margolis as Father Avila, Stephen McHattie as Grand Inquisitor Silecio and Fernando Hernandez as Lord of Xibalba.I have to admit this is the second time I've seen this one and it's one of those that gets better each time you see it. There are so many nuances and plot devices that it can be quite a hard one to get a handle on first time around. That's probably one of the reasons it has divided opinion so much. The three threads of the story seem so remote at first but as you watch it all gradually pulls together. For me it is just the right length, any longer and it might have become a little tedious. I know there are many out there that didn't like if first time around; to you I say; give it another chance try to watch it with an open mind. It is slow-paced deliberately to allow the audience time to assimilate the story. If you're watching it for the first time on my recommendation, then be prepared to give it a second viewing; you may not get it all first time around.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,3,29 September 2012
Enemy at the Gates," A little too long but still worth a look...
","A film with some great set piece battle scenes involving hundreds of extras; it does look quite epic in places. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen, I'm sure it was quite impressive. The music was pretty good; mainly relying on great sweeping themes throughout it did put me in mind of another epic war film set in Russia. All the performances were very good with Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris standing out for me. It was one of those films that was good, with ambitions of being great but never quite getting there. Sadly I felt that the love triangle got in the way, a bit, of a decent war film. I say 'sadly' because I thought Rachel Weisz was particularly good in this one. Over all though, I found it a bit too long but still quit a decent watch.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.3/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,2,4 August 2013
Psycho," Masterful...
","A truly excellent piece of filmmaking; yes, it's a bit 'wordy' in places, but that was the style back then. There are equally many scenes in which there is no dialogue at all and these are even better in my book. Hitchcock knew just how much to show the audience to intrigue them and I so wish there were more filmmakers around today who were as adept as he was. The performances were all excellent; particularly Janet Leigh as the conflicted felon and Anthony Perkins as the mentally tortured motel owner. The only thing I felt let it down was the very long explanation towards the end; where every nuance of the condition afflicting Bates is exposed. I didn't feel that much detail was needed; but I could be nit-picking a bit here. It's a great piece of filmmaking and one every fan of the movies should see at least once.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 9.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,0,10 February 2013
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Time to call it a day?...
","As is the fashion these days with these films there is a lot of moralising going on and a lot about the importance of family. I don't usually have a problem with this, but in this film it was so 'in your face' that I felt it got in the way of the story. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the other 'Ice Age' films, probably because it has lost all the charm the characters had in the earlier films. On the plus side, Peter Dinklage did make for a very intimidating and threatening advocacy. I guess it wasn't until about the last 20 minutes that I began to warm to any of the characters, but by then it was far too late. Time to put the franchise to rest guys. I've probably been a tad to generous with my score, it's because Sid does make me laugh!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)My score: 5.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,0,0,5 August 2013
The Green Mile," Excellent and emotional!...
","Very well made with a beautifully understated musical score by Thomas Newman, it underpins the action perfectly and works very well. All the performances were great; particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who fully deserved his 2000 Oscar nomination for his portrayal of John Coffey. As usual, Tom Hanks puts in a flawless performance as Paul Edgecomb (the younger version of course). Also worthy of note were; David Morse as Brutus 'Brutal' Howell, Bonnie Hunt as Edgecomb's wife, Jan, James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores, Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, Graham Greene as Arlen Bitterbuck, Doug Hutchison as Percey Wetmore, Sam Rockwell as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, Barry Pepper as Dean Stanton and Jeffrey DeMunn as Harry Terwilliger. Oh and not forgetting the mouse (or mice) who appeared as 'Mr Jingles'.The film has quite a slow pace that allows the audience to become familiar with the characters and the comings and goings on 'The Mile'. With most of the action taking place in the one location I thought the director did a good job of using different angles and even the odd special effect to keep it visually interesting. Because you become so invested in the characters, it is three hours long after all; it does tend to get a bit emotional towards the end. This is probably one of the reasons I love this film so much. Stephen King does write such well rounded and interesting characters and Frank Darabont has the knack of being able to translate them to the screen. In my book this is one of the very best adaptations of King's work and one that will stay with me for a very long time.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,1,21 October 2012
Prometheus," Interesting...
","First off, the film looks stunning, Ridley Scott has a great eye and all of his films look fantastic. I saw the film in 2D and I still thought it looked great (I won't join in the 3D debate here).There has been a lot of debate about whether this is a prequel to Ridley Scott's film 'Alien' (1979). Well, I have it on good authority that it pre-dates that film and the planet they land on is not the one depicted in that film. In fact, I've heard Scott say in interview that there's enough material for two more films to bring us up to the point where 'Alien' starts. But I digress, personally, I found the film quite engrossing and some of the ideas about the origins of life on Earth very interesting. Yes, there are parallels to be drawn between this as 'Alien', but even so, I found the faster pace and the visuals did just enough to make up for any weaknesses in the plot. You have to remember that its fantasy and its entertainment, as soon as you start to take it too seriously you're probably going to be disappointed. I was prepared to go with it and consequently very much enjoyed the experience. Would I watch it again, hell yes!...

Taken 2," Generic but entertaining...
","A well shot film making full use of its surroundings, Istanbul in this case. Well paced with the level action keeping the adrenalin pumping almost from the start. The performances were all very good although I felt nobody was particularly stretched. Liam Neeson was his usual self as Bryan Mills, Maggie Grace was good as daughter Kim, as was Famke Janssen as wife Lenore. Also worthy of note was Rade Serbedzija as major bad guy, Murad Krasniqi. It was OK as a piece of entertainment but I felt it didn't do anything the first film didn't. You usually expect a sequel to expand on the story of the first but this one virtually told the same story but with a couple of alterations. It seemed like the studio (Fox) were just out to cash in on the success of the first one. I'm just glad I didn't go and watch it in a cinema but still, if you want entertainment that won't stretch the little grey cells to much, then this is the one for you.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)My score: 6.3/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6,1,1,8 September 2013
X-Men: First Class," Excellent!... Recommended...
","A really well made film with, at its' heart a really enthralling, well thought-out storyline. As we have come to expect from these films, the special effects are of the highest quality. Fortunately this does not distract from the excellent plot that gives so much more depth to the main characters. There is a fair amount of humour as well, look out for a very brief appearance from Wolverine (very funny). Over all, an exceedingly well made film that I hope becomes a big hit. It's intelligent without ever talking down to the audience and I really enjoyed it. I would be happy to see it again and it's still pencilled in to be added to by DVD collection Recommended.My Score 8.2/10IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 195,866 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 65/100: (Based on 38 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 87/100 (based on 239 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 88/100 'Liked It' (based on 115,264 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,1,29 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Epic!... Well worth a look...
","And so we come to the final chapter in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and I must say it was well worth the wait. Everything from the opening sequence to the credits at the end had me gripped (even two boys arguing in the next row half way through didn't spoil my enjoyment – I may have spoiled theirs though!). For a change I won't do a summary as I know there are many out there not wanting to know any of the plot and so I'll respect that and keep my comments as spoiler-free as I can. I'll save it for when I review the DVD at a later date.Many new characters are introduced in this instalment, the most important of which is Bane, The Dark Knight's new nemesis. We are introduced to him in an action sequence that could have come straight from my favourite Nolan film, Inception. He is an echo from Bruce Wayne's past; one that will resonate deeply for him. The renowned thief Catwoman (a.k.a. Selina Kyle) also makes an appearance; she can either help or hinder the Batman; I won't tell you which. A young police officer, Blake, will also have a part to play; like Bruce Wayne, he's also an orphan and this could shape his future. Miranda Tate is an investor who wants Bruce Wayne to help her with her charity work; she could be the key to saving Wayne Enterprises. Of course, returning characters, Commissioner Gordon, Alfred and Lucius Fox all have their parts to play in this quite extraordinary tale. The more I think about it the more I want to see it again! Yes, it's THAT good.The cinematography by Director of Photography, Wally Pfister, was once again truly epic! How he got some of those shots, I will never know, it's a great piece of work for which he should be congratulated. The musical score by Hans Zimmer, again a great piece of work with themes that fit the visuals perfectly. And so we come to the performances; for an actor playing the same role for the third time, I thought Christian Bale gave his best performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman here. You really felt his pain and conflict and when we get to the end well, I guess I'd better not tell you that bit. Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon was excellent as usual; given more to do in a slightly more demanding role this time, I thought he did a great job. Now to Bane, played with great aplomb by Tom Hardy, a tough part to play due to the restrictions of his costume; I thought he did it really well and I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a good choice for the part of Blake; still young enough to play a role that could evolve if the franchise is continued (I can't say any more). Anne Hathaway played Catwoman/Selina Kyle and I thought did a pretty excellent job (even without a skin-tight costume). Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate; her role really surprised me and she played it with great composure (no more clues). Finally I must say that both Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred were both as excellent as ever.With set-piece action sequences that are truly epic and an intelligent plot that has many a twist to keep the audience interested; for me it was one of the best films I'll see this year! I listened to Christopher Nolan in an interview before I saw the film and he was saying that although CGI is used in places, there's always a physical effect at the heart of it, and it shows. All the effects are expertly done with some great stunt-work behind many of them (hats off to those guys). Some may find the slow build-up to the ultimate conclusion a little tedious but, for me, it made the ending all the more poignant and all the more effective!...

Blade Runner," Final Cut... Still great!...
","Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.This is the second time I have seen this particular cut of the film and I have to say I like it just as much as the 1992 Director's cut even though Ridley Scott didn't have an awful lot to do with that version.A very introspective film with all the action focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then, although it has been used to enhance certain things in this cut, and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean. A truly excellent film that, for its day, has never been equalled.SteelMonster's verdict: VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 9.5/10IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 263,718 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 88/100: (Based on 10 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 92/100 (based on 104 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 'Liked it' (based on 288,583 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",10,1,4,27 August 2012
Casino Royale," Craig gives Bond some much-needed edge...
","There is quite a lot of action before things focus on the Casino; all of this is well done and features much of the stunt work in the film. I have to say it does appear to get a little lost once the main focus of the film is established. Once we do get there the scenes in and around the Casino are quite compelling and it is here that we actually get a feeling for how Daniel Craig portrays Bond. He has vulnerabilities that make him appear more human and this in turn gives the audience a chance to understand his motivations. I must admit I really enjoyed Craig's portrayal and am looking forward to more of the same. As for the film as a whole; I very much enjoyed it. Very entertaining with everything we've come to expect from a Bond film, and more.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,2,5,7 October 2012
Toy Story 3," Seen it 3 times & I still love it!...
","As we have come to expect from Pixar, this is an exceptionally well made film with a great plot, endearing characters, lots of adventure, comedy and one or two tear-jerking moments along the way. I also have to give a mention to Randy Newman whose songs throughout the series have been tremendous, always fitting the mood perfectly, there's even a Spanish number this time around!There are some great moments, like when Ken met Barbie for the first time, Mr. Potato Head as a tortilla and Buzz Lightyear in Spanish mode has to be seen to be believed! I really enjoyed this film, I really engaged with the characters I know so well for the previous two films and found myself quite choked at the end. All three films have been tremendous and I really hope they don't make a fourth, finish on a high guys! Over all, highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 205,628 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 92/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 99/100 (based on 253 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 91/100 (based on 286,431 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,1,29 April 2012
Before Sunrise," Interesting...
","I have to admit that, on the face of it, this film really didn't have much going for it from my point of view. But, as usual, I went into it with a very open mind and found I was quite pleasantly surprised. I don't know it was because the film touched those parts of the human psyche that relate to the interaction of the sexes; but I did find their conversations quite enthralling at times whilst at the same time quite entertaining. I guess it's like eavesdropping on a conversation, you know it's wrong but you just can't help it. I thought it was well made, using Vienna very well without becoming a kind of travelogue. I guess it did its job because I'm keen to know what happens next!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,0,29 June 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Quirky and fun!...
","I love the look and feel of this film; yes, it's got a lot of quirkiness, but that's not allowed to overrun the narrative too much. The soundtrack also adds to the enjoyment in a way; it becomes part of the world these people inhabit. The very black and white sensibilities of children are explored here; everything it taken as a matter of fact and accepted without question. I found it quite refreshing in a way; it made a nice change from the brainless comedies I'm usually subjected to. All the performances were excellent with my top awards going to the two youngsters; Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman. Well worth a look if you haven't seen it and (probably) well worth a re-watch if you have!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,3,6 April 2013
RED," Entertaining stuff!...
","I must say this film does exactly what it says on the tin; it's brash, explosive and it also has some humour splattered about in there. I did like Bruce Willis in this one; some of his wise cracks put me in mind of his character David Addison in 'Moonlighting' (an old TV show for those too young to remember it). I loved John Malkovich as the, almost paranoid, member of the team; he added some great comic moments. Helen Mirren was great (as ever), as was Richard Dreyfuss as the bad guy and Brian Cox. Also a mention fro Karl Urban who played his role with great aplomb; he'll go far I'm sure. As to the film; well I enjoyed many aspects of it although I did find the age difference between Willis and Parker a tad creepy. Other than that, bring on the sequel! I found it a lot of fun and everything 'The Expendables' isn't; well worth the price of the disc.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,3,4,10 March 2013
Flight," Good!...
","Although I liked this film I did find it a little too long; in fact I have to admit that I watched it in two halves. From a totally stunning sequence at the start I felt it lost momentum for a while, that was until I became embroiled in the drama of Whip Whitaker's story. It's quite a tale and an excellent performance from Denzel Washington holds it all together quite brilliantly. I also thought Kelly Reilly did a pretty good job as well. But back to the opening sequence for a moment, for me it ranks as one of the best special effects driven sequences I've seen in a very long time and hats off to all involved. Taken as a whole, the film does take the audience on quite a journey and I know for some it couldn't quite live up to that crash sequence. For me I thought it held together pretty well, mainly thanks to the acting skills of Mr Washington. Over all, definitely worth a watch but don't get blown away by the crash sequence, there's a lot more depth to it than that.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,1,2,5 October 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An epic ending to the trilogy!...
","The book could very easily have been made into two films; there is such a lot that happens and so many twists in the plot that it might have benefited if that were the case. But we're not here to speculate I guess; although it does depart from the book in many respects, I did find that most of the important bases were covered. A film which has some tremendous scenes of epic battles but also some very tender and thought-provoking moments as well. For me the most powerful scene was where Denethor has sent his son, Faramir, to his doom and is eating a meal while Pippin sings a haunting ballad. The intercutting of the images of battle with Denethor and Pippin safe in Minas Tirith and the haunting melody over the top makes for a scene that has stayed with me since I first saw it back in 2003. I did find it did tend to drag a bit towards the end, but other than that a very fine film that is a fitting end to a great trilogy.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9,0,1,13 October 2012
Munich," WAY too long, but worth a look...
","Very well made with all the attention to detail you'd expect from a film made by Steven Spielberg. Original music by John Williams was excellent also. Although it's very well made with some excellent performances, it has two things that I found were not in its favour. Firstly, it's far too long and secondly, the pacing of it is very slow and this, combined with the length does not make for an overly enjoyable viewing experience. Don't get me wrong, aspects of the film are quite compelling and the action sequences are as exciting as you'd find anywhere else, I just found it a little slow and far too long. Even so, I still think it's worth a look.My score: 7.1/10IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 110,104 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 74/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 78/100 (based on 198 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 78/100 (based on 304,565 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7,1,2,13 May 2012
Looper," Good movie...
","A very well made film with many practical effects used instead of relying on CGI all the time; hats off to the filmmakers for taking that route. Performance-wise, everyone did a great job with Joseph Gordon- Lovett and Bruce Willis getting that majority of the screen time. I also liked Emily Blunt as Sara, Jeff Daniels as Abe and the young Pierce Gagnon as Cid. Although it did many things right I did feel it was a little unevenly paced in places. It seemed to get a little bogged down in the dialogue which slowed it down a little too much a couple of times. Other than that I found it quite enthralling and one I'd happily watch again sometime.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,3,23 June 2013
Cube," Still good!...
","I love the ideas behind this film; a mystery combined with some sci-fi and more than a touch of horror is right up my street. Unfortunately the execution just fails to pay off sufficiently for me to call it brilliant. I think the dialogue comes over as a little dated and that does let it down somewhat. Also the twist at the end was a tad predictable. Even so, I can't help but like this film; I think it appeals to the mathematician in me (don't let that put you off by the way). You'll know what I mean if you've seen it. Over all; a decent enough film that's maybe becoming slightly dated, but still has the edge over many a high budget blockbuster or two.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,0,1,29 December 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Big Top fun!...
","I seldom laugh out loud whilst watching a film, but this one easily passed the '6 laugh test'. There are some delightfully funny sight gags and some really subtle dialogue that, I'm guessing, was deliberately put in for the adults. All of the performances were great, as far as voice- only performances can be. The stand-out for me was Francis McDormand; she really got into the part! It's a film that was never going to win any awards, but, you know, it did exactly what it was meant to do, and that's entertain. Aside from a couple of annoying musical numbers (which are probably featured in the trailer) I found it quite a surprising delight. Definitely recommended for both young and old alike.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,8,13,16 June 2013
Moon," Can't fault it!...
",There is much to admire in this film; everything from Sam Rockwell's tremendous performance to the special effects on the lunar surface (all done with miniatures). The musical score by Clint Mansell is also excellent; slowly building until the end where it really cuts loose. I thought it was good back in 2009 when I had a 30 mile round-trip to see it; but it was even better this time around. I don't know whether it's because I've seen so many other films in the mean time or what; but it really struck a chord with me this time! If you love your sci-fi then it's one I can heartily recommend.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.6/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.,10,5,9,31 December 2012
The Great Gatsby," Stylish!...
","A film with some great set pieces; I found the party scenes particularly spectacular. It's beautifully shot and I'm quite glad I saw it in 2D as I couldn't see how 3D would have enhanced it much. I found the music interesting with the big set pieces being handed over to rapper Jay-Z (also an Executive Producer), but it was the original music by Craig Armstrong that I found most enthralling. There are several well known themes subtly placed in the soundtrack and I found both refreshing and interesting. All the performances were great with DiCaprio and Mulligan getting top billing; but I thought Tobey Maguire was equally good. I guess I'll have to read the book to be able to decide just how good an adaptation this is; but for now I found it quite a satisfying watch with plenty of drama to keep me entertained. If I was to be super critical I would have to say I found the character of Gatsby a little one- dimensional, but having said that it's still well worth a look if you get the chance.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8,2,5,3 June 2013
