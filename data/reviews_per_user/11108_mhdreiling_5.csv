Blade Runner 2049," A personal favorite
","I found it mesmerizing since the very first frame. It's a movie whose lone images and scenes and characters even now, almost a year after I watched it, I continously recall. For me, it was a nearly perfect companion piece to the first movie.
And I loved Luv.",10,4,11,20 September 2018
Captain Marvel," So...
","... I wanted to like this but it's such a step back for the MCU that I have to rate it 5/10. Over the years I've loved the MCU's characters and the build up towards something that felt like a unity, like a team of flawed, hard working heroes who overcame themselves for something greater, for something good. I can't find that insight, that spirit of humbling shared experience, in this movie, no matter how hard the movie aims to that, and no matter how hard I really tried to give it a pass. Obviously there are some highlights (Ben Mendelsohn, Samuel L. Jackson, the 90s setting) but the elephant in the room is triple headed: uninteresting combo of script and direction, Brie Larson is awfully miscast here (she's been insanely good in other movies, but she really gets on everyone's nerves with that squeaky voice and blank look in her face), and a general landscape of been here, seen this, done that.
Over the years the quality and consistency of the MCU has built a huge amount of goodwill among the general audiences. I really hope that this one sadly mediocre and pivotal movie doesn't make people start forgetting about that.",5,1,5,10 March 2019
Aquaman," A good piece of entertaining cinema
","It's a movie whose sole reason of existence is entertainment. And I loved it for that, despite it's many flaws.
Nice visuals and action pieces. Heard, Wilson and Kidman are great. I didn't like the music and the script could've been polished a lot better.",6,1,4,17 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Painful to watch
","I'm still in awe of what I watched. I can't believe that somehow someone managed to make a SW movie this bad. Don't get me wrong: I know this movies are tailor made for our entertainment only, that they're intended to be fun, popular, escapist machinery. But this one is just plain bad. A dull exercise of nonsense.",4,10,16,5 May 2020
The Shape of Water," Unbelievable
","I just can't believe this won a few Oscars. I mean, it's not 'bad' but... Best Picture Oscar winner??",5,3,7,18 November 2018
