Child 44," Good movie from Eastern Europeans
","Unfortunately you have to be from former eastern block to understand this film. Probably USA viewers could not understand why was too difficult to travel in former USSR, even now its impossible to live in Moscow if do not have a Moscow citizenship. In 50's if do not have visa its was impossible to buy train ticket between two Russians cities. Second why they did not catch the murderer it was so simple a few people could travel across the country.The director failed to explained this to USA and western Europe viewers. You need a history major to comprehend this film if you not from Eastern Europe. Otherwise Tom Hardy was brilliant his accent was really unique. The rest of actors were very good as well.",8,3,7,2 August 2015
