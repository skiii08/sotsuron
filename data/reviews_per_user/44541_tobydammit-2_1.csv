First Man," Superfluous bummer that adds nothing to the genre
","Anyone who has seen and enjoyed 'The Right Stuff' and 'Apollo 13' is going to think very little of this dark, joyless film that reveals nothing we haven't already seen and portrays Neal Armstrong as a thuddingly dull nerd you would not want to meet. Veronica Cartwright's performance as Betty Grissom in The Right Stuff effortlessly blows away all the domestic pseudo verite of this movie. I wanted to like this film, but it is disappointingly superfluous, adding nothing to the genre. It goes to prove Ebert's eternal point that remaking good movies usually results in making lesser films, whereas remaking bad movies might produce something better. Do NOT waste your time on this cynical proctologist's view of the NASA space program.",2,60,104,15 October 2018
