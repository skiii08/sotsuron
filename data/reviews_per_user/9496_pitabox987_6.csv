Men in Black 3," My Favorite Men in Black movie.
","Writing from the perspective of someone who's seen and enjoyed the first two Men in Black movies, I'd have to say this is easily my favorite of the three.I noted that a lot of reviews criticize this movie for breaking the mold of being a straight comedy film, but I honestly think it's broken that mold very well, whilst still maintaining plenty of funny scenes. It also tells us more about the shared histories of the two main characters Jay and Kay over the the entire MiB time-line, going right back too Jay's childhood. It also has an interesting villain in Boris the Animal and great supporting characters such as Griffin.Overall it's story is very well portrayed and the way it ties into historic world events is very well done as well. It makes it a movie I will easily watch it again.",10,0,3,22 April 2017
It Chapter Two," I was hoping for an improvement after Part 1, I didn't get it...
","The title of this review says enough.Part 2 was pretty hopeless as a continuation of the story from Part 1; the first part was marginally better than this one.A set of movies that rely almost entirely on jump scares and the worst story I've seen in a long time. - The book was enjoyable, but this is a disgrace to both the book and Stephen King himself, that he was involved in it's production doesn't say much either.As many reviews say, the film relies too heavily on CGI, particularly the zombies during the film, and the 'Pennywise spider' bit toward the end, that wasn't even scary at all; it got overly repetitive, I almost felt like turning the film off...I rated Part 1 two stars, but this film barely even deserves one star! (If if I could rate it a zero, I would, and it's been a while since I've seen a film worthy of that!)Watch if you must, but honestly it's a waste of time, not even a good Halloween style movie.",1,1,1,30 December 2019
Godzilla," If you can watch this movie in one sitting you're doing well.
","OK, let me begin, this is by far one of the stupidest movies I've seen in years; even some of the poorly made b-movies I've seen in the intervening time are more interesting.While I try to watch this movie because I'm a fan of Godzilla, this is just a joke, the so called 'king' of the monsters gets less screen time than average ad break on television - instead we focus on a bunch of pointless characters running around trying to figure out what Godzilla and those creepy Pok√©mon hybrid things are doing, while Godzilla is supposedly the 'saviour' of humanity he fails horribly only defeating the hybrids by mere luck.While the hybrid things seem less concerned with Godzilla or humanity and more concerned with finding nuclear material to rub up against so they can reproduce, the idea that these things are from an ancient time when the earth was a dozen times more radioactive barely fills the plot hole of how they survived in eons past, the problem is the earth has never been that radioactive at any point in it's geological history.It simply serves to make the Americans and Japanese look like complete idiots, it makes the 1998 American reboot a pleasure to watch as well - it worries me that whoever commissioned this 'thing' to be produced wants to make a trilogy of it. (Who knows, at least it might drive them to bankruptcy so they can never create such an abomination again...)As a final note, this is one of the only movies I have ever been so disgusted with that I have actually tossed it into the trash, mainly to save space and so I won't be watching it, ever again...",1,1,2,11 August 2015
Spectre," Quite simply it a Bond film, and not as bad as some of the reviews say...
","I was surprised by all the bad reviews and ratings I've read about this film, and there seem to be quite a lot, I enjoyed it.Like any film nowadays it wasn't perfect. It had had it's dull parts and at times the plot was a little predictable, but it also had some quite enjoyable action sequences and the story wasn't that overly boring.The characters were used well and were definitely not as flat and boring as some from previous bond films, and it revisited the character of Blofeld and his link to the character of James' younger years. It also delved a bit into the Spectre organization and it's attempts to infiltrate the governments of the world.So on the whole I thought it was a decent film, and for anyone deciding on this film, I'd recommend you see it as I think you'd enjoy it, it's one I will watch again...",8,3,5,2 April 2017
Jurassic Park," It was great twenty years ago, pretty mediocre by today's standards...
","As I said in the title of my review, it was a good movie for the early nineties, but by today's standards it's pretty bland.When I first saw Jurassic Park as a kid in the early nineties I gave it an 8/10, watching it again today and it's truly boring.The CGI has hardly stood the test of time, the dinosaurs look like animatronic children's toys, the only 'realistic' looking dinosaurs are the close up shots which are obviously models, not computer generated.I think I chuckled at a few one-liners in the entire movie, or when Dennis got eaten for his stupidity, probably why I gave it an extra star, but other than that I almost went to sleep.Still ok for kids or those who haven't seen many films to watch, but as an adult and someone who's seen a number of dino movies, it's a very bland film, particularly for Spielberg...",3,0,19,30 April 2019
The Martian," What an awesome movie about the human spirit of survival!
","First of all I don't get why there are so many bad reviews about this movie, I think the plot is sound with strong characters and performances all round! I found myself enjoying this movie from the opening sequence to the credits, it makes sense from a scientific and technical point of view whilst maintaining an engaging plot with likable characters, interesting story and even has a good mix of humor thrown in for flavor.Everything from the crew abandoning their crew mate after he is given up for dead and then the struggle of the lone survivor having to use the resources he has at hand to survive in a completely hostile environment really got me into this film; I found myself enjoying their successes and wondering what was going to happen at other times.I recommend this movie to anyone, it will entertain you while keeping your interest; I didn't really find myself at any time bored during this film.",10,0,2,10 July 2017
