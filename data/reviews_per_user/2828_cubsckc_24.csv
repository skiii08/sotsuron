Skyfall," A new Generation for James Bond
","One thing people should do is reflect back through the James Bond films a little. The plot of this new film revolves around 'M's' mistakes and failures as head of the 00 department. We see it a little in 'The World is Not Enough,' and 'Golden Eye.' Her continued mistakes on how she treats the 00's and certain cases in her department is further reflected in the opening scene of the movie. As a result the movie shows how her mistakes have taken a toll against her and her department.I told myself I would not give out any spoilers, however I will say that the movie reasonably produces a new series for James Bond. And in the end you see the new players that will be making the new movies of the series. I actually think they gave the end justice, by producing a new cast for future James Bond films.This movie was pretty awesome and did meet my expectations. I still feel it is missing something of the older James Bond Movies. I'm not sure what it is, but perhaps the older James Bond Films Villain's seem a bit more evil and more world devastating than the new James Bond Villains. I suppose its because they are trying to be more realistic with their scenarios and plots. As far as the actual characters they used for bad guys... awesome, awesome job. This guy was scary as hell. What is even more scary is that he probably is the calmest villain I have seen throughout the entire James Bond Series. I stick with my review and will also say that contrary to the people who really dismiss the James Bond films, this James Bond film has a completely different style, which I will say is gloomy and eerie at the same time being action packed. Throughout the film James Bond's 'style' is not dismissed. So I'm glad to say that the directors, screen writers, and etc, haven't completely gotten rid of James Bond's tradition.",9,1,11,28 November 2012
World War Z," A Good Watch... but Suffers From Major Plot Flaws
","I originally gave this film a really high grade. I mean, it is the latest zombie film, and the camera, special effects, and violence are truly monumental to any other zombie film. However, as I watched it a second and third time, I noticed myself getting irritated by plot holes and conveniences. I really liked the violence in the film, however many times the effects were so greatly exaggerated that it actually can bother someone and even get in the way of enjoying the movie. The zombies in the is film are completely revolutionized into superhuman zombies that can run and jump at super human speed much like those in I am Legend. I think that this created problems because it made things impossible and at times made you roll your eyes. It starts to bother one when you think about the fact that these zombies aren't actually eating anyone and replenishing their nutrition. It doesn't explain how their muscles and bones seem to defy the laws of nature. I think where I really started being bothered by the plots is when they reach Jerusalem and the heavily defended and fortified city falls within a matter of minutes. Like LITERALLY! All this because zombies can all of a sudden get aroused when they hear people singing over the wall. And then they rush up this huge wall and sack the city. This is definitely one of the top 100 stupidest moments in film history. There essentially was no point to show this except to show a city overrun.. which they already did, and the way this city got taken was just stupid. Next scene... they jump on a plane and try going to a scientific place to find or make a vaccine. And there is a zombie hiding quietly amongst the crew. This was also something really stupid. Economic class silently gets infected while the rest of the plane doesn't hear a thing. And guess. what? Brad Pitt throws a grenade on an airplane... do you understand what actually happened? He threw a fricken grenade on a plane and survived... They did this and so happenly arrived a mile or two away from his destination. DUMB.It is obvious that there was a different type of zombie style to this film and I think it was just completely stupid. I liked the idea of how the actual infected seemed to ignore those that were already infected with another disease... but damn... this Moses parting through the red sea was stupid as well. Its actually really hard to grade this film, and as I said before, I actually liked the film, because it had many monumental features. And yet, they really went stupid on how they tried to go about the plot. They said they were going to make a second film, and I just don't see how they could with all the damage they committed with the actual capabilities they gave their zombies as well as the forced plot coincidence they put. It is actually very telling how this film is rated compared to most horror films. I believe most horror films are harshly criticized, but this one gets what it deserves which is more than it needs.",6,3,6,2 July 2013
Alexander," Good but Lacking
","I don't want to alienate anyone, because essentially there are many components to the movie that people on both sides of the spectrum disagree with. It took me 10 years to watch it again and really see something worth liking. And as such, I actually started to appreciate some parts of the movie. However, one must admit that some parts and components really take away from the focus of the film. To be honest I watched it only once in 2004 and didn't watch it until it came on HBO. One thing that really turned me off was the homosexual part of the film. It wasn't because I hate gays, but because the warriors of the film were presented as girly men. I have no problem with a gay story as long as the story is realistic. I thought Colin Ferrel did okay... But one must think of the age they are in, in which these are actual rough warriors and not cute stars that know how to fight in combat more. I view the type of warrior I was looking for as something resembling 300 or Troy. But the characters were not realistic and completely flamboyant for veteran/rough warriors. The gay component actually had an interesting part to the story because it was referred and compared to Achilles in The Iliad. And as such, reflects differently as a show to demonstrate passion guided by selfishness or that of brotherhood. The Aeneid also tried to compare the differences, which I thought was interesting to point out on this film. I also think this is the main reason why people dislike this movie. There are many gay movies before this that have been rated better, but its the fact that we have hardcore warriors who are girly men. So in that sense, there was a bad selection of characters.Another thing that took away from the main point was Angelina Jolie as his mother and Van Kilmer as his father being relived in his memory to explain his actions as a leader. Frankly, I thought the acting was poorly acted and most of the time unnecessary. I thought that this was a key reason along with the flamboyancy of the characters to distract from the main themes. There were some neat parts to the film. The budget can be seen with the accuracy of the make up and designs, along with the battle scenes. The battle scenes were definitely better than I remember and relatively accurate. The only problem is that at times it was kind of confusing to tell what was going on. The relations between Alexander and Hephaistus along with Achilles and Patriclus is also something pretty neat to explain the difference between how a great warrior can self defeat himself with is own passions as well as contrary where they can rule the world. The props and customs through the film are very accurate and realistic, and the only thing that prevents this form being noticed and appreciated is the acting and distraction from the major points in the film. I don't like acting single minded, however it does seem like this was a film that showed the biggest problem and yet folly of Oliver Stones career. With a great story available to him and a large budget, it shows that his creativity is to disorganized. I went from grading it originally from a 4 to an 8 because I really appreciated the military conquest more as well as the comparison with mythology. I also like the realistic approach to how his soldiers felt about over conquest and intermingling with other peoples. This is where the story really shines. However, for me the difference between a 7 and an 8 is usually opinion, which I fear may have reflected in my new decision. As such, I put it as a seven. It deserves over a 5 because it is entertaining, and even if you dislike the film, it still makes you watch at times. But there is also a good story there somewhere that was underdeveloped and deserved the 7.",7,0,1,8 July 2014
The Hateful Eight," Creative but Limited Plot
","The plot is well outlined if you have seen the trailers for the movie. A blizzard keeps 8 dangerous characters in a cabin together during a Blizzard. All the characters have something in common which is their interest in a prisoner. The way it is filmed was quite remarkable. The scenery along with the props was well shot out.Quentin Tarantino really shows his skills at making a story in which every character has a purpose and every cause and effect makes sense. Just watch for the little things in the movie that the camera focuses on. Its one of those movies where every color and shot has a purpose. I guess the only issue I had with the film was that it was a three hour movie in a cabin with a very limited plot. There's only so many places that the plot could eventually turn. I'm not going to lie, though I had many interesting facial expressions while watching the movie, I was not impressed at the ending. My wife did not like the movie, and she gave me a dirty look every time there was a racial slur or guts getting blown apart everywhere. Though there may have been a lot of it, it didn't deter me from the artistic values of the film. Trust me, there is lot more violence and swearing in this film than any other film he has directed.",7,2,19,26 December 2015
Ant-Man," Surprisingly Done Well... but...
","I'll tell you what, the first time I saw this movie in trailers, I expected it to completely fail. A dude in an Ant custom that can shrink and kick people's butts? Sounds a bit stupid. The good thing though is that the film was able to focus on the different parties involved in the movie's plot. What helped the film a lot was the infiltration part that of the Ant Man, that for me at least demonstrated his biggest strength. I hope you guys like my review, and appreciate what I like and am worried about in future Marvel Films which include Ant Man. You have this guy who is a criminal and given a second chance in life due to his skills which are tested by the older Ant Man. Of course, the older guy is basically retired and has a daughter while at the same time having his apprentice turn against him and take away his company and weapons to sell to hydra. Though the main conflict was the fact that Hydra was about to get this new Ant Man weaponry, they were briefly shown and mentioned. Which I think was a good thing, because it gives Ant Man its own spirit as a film. One is drawn to the characters because you see their loses and what they are fighting for. The new Ant Man for example has a daughter and a second chance to live up to, while the older Ant Man and his daughter have a way of rekindling their relationship over the very thing that broke them apart. All in all, great film. Its hard not to like the characters and the plot. What I did have a problem with was the scene were Ant Man gets into a fight with Falcon from the new Avengers. The fight was kind of stupid and what I was afraid the whole movie was going to be about. I appreciate this film as a separate identity from the rest of Marvel. Are we going to see this dude fighting powerful and almost immortal beings when we get into the rest of the Marvel Universe? It is a bit worrying because the first Avengers was very different from the second in the sense that it worked a bit better.",8,9,23,31 July 2015
American Hustle," Good Watch
","Overall, good movie. Honorable mentions to Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They did a fantastic job with the props as well as acting (everybody). The story itself was pretty descent up to the resolution in my opinion. I had a problem with the overall ending and thought it was unrealistic, but thats my take. I think it still is a pretty good watch for the big screen and I would not be surprised if any of the actors win academy awards for their performance. The movie was enriched with a good plot. I thought that the way that corruption is played was very realistic in that sense. The movie also had shades of grey that depict how fighting against crime isn't as black and white as many of the gangster movies have tried to do. But this movie definitely makes you feel for all of the characters at some point.",8,8,18,20 December 2013
Ender's Game," Cheese
","Plot and acting were pathetic. Its a film that does make you cringe over the fate of humanity and then makes you question it. The amount of responsibility they show they can give children makes me sick and the authors and directors are pretty gay for doing that. I rate things on how I would react to them when they come on Starz and I have an opportunity to see them again. Was there something about this movie that would be cool to see again? Well.. it wasn't 'horrible...' however, there isn't much I'd like to see again, especially if you consider the most exciting parts of the movie are a bunch of children playing laser tag and being jerks. Snore... snore... I'd probably change the channel. If there wasn't anything else on, I'd leave it on and pay attention to something else.",4,2,6,14 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Good Story, Average Execution
","I think the movie was pretty good, however I feel that my appreciate of the film is completely different from most people's. As such, I explain why it is imperative that I give my review of the film from a bias position, simply stating the facts of what the movie was trying to portray and what it actually portrayed, as well as the minor film details. Lets look at the minor details first. The effects weren't something I didn't see before, and the acting was very basic. In fact I would say the acting was very mediocre. Even though Jennifer was supposed to have a really big part with her Mystique role, she didn't really shine. As much as I missed the old X-Men, they didn't have a lot of screen time either. Surprisingly, it was Wolverine who had the most screen time and for some reason he was less rugged then he usually is. Within his over 200 years of existence he has changed a lot in the last 5. I don't think this was done well. The plot of the film definitely had a 'Inception' type feel to it. However the idea of changing the past for the future is such a tricky thing to deal with that it gets irritating when looking at the context of the universe. The fact that the past is being messed with, indicates the fact that everything else that happened in the X-Men series did not happen. It almost adds a pointless element that I could overlook. However, they incorporated so much lore in one movie that its hard to look at the rest of the X-Men films and visualize that they actually happened considering the events that are about to unfold because of Mystique. One would also question the relationship between Magneto and Mystique that we have seen throughout every X-Men series after this movie. The one key thing that I had problems with is the fact that film did not specifically state how the sentinels create the future they are in when the person responsible for their creation was not able to because of the events that led up to his demise of the uncorrected past. Its the small key points that makes a big hit from a great hit. I feel this was so essential to explain the rest of the series. Especially considering we don't see the government showing any signs of dealing with the mutants in such an extreme way. It was obviously an underground group and I feel they hinted to it very vaguely like a girl that looks at you once and expects you to ask her out. One another key element that should have been elaborated on is the fact that the past effecting the future had a few different types of theorems. In one hand the idea that you could change the future if you went back into the past and the other that no matter what you did the future was inevitable. We see at the end all the good guys... but no bad guys all at the School smiling and having a good time. There should have been a point settled in here because no one actually pays attention to this fact. Did they really change the future or did they prolong it? But I feel I am making the movie more interesting than what it actually did. Did you come out of the movie thinking this? Also what happened to Stryker? He is the key antagonist of the films.A movie can have awesome concepts, however, its the films job to really portray them effectively enough. When I see all these ratings of 10 stars, I say to myself, 'give me a break.' It was a decent movie, but people depend on you to give an accurate and fair analysis of the film. Why did people grade it really high? Well for one thing this was the closest X-Men story to directly come from the comic books. Is that really enough to give it extremely high grades? They spent millions making the move, I'd expect an extraordinary story, and I feel people came from the film thinking how finite the time travel continuum really is when the story isn't really about that at all. Only comic book nerds would understand this. Except... nobody else read them and because of the ending they actually need to spoon fed. I also think the dark X- Men look of the future X-Men was completely awesome. It is definitely a new, modern, look that will inspire our current generation to appreciate. As such, though I didn't give it a harsh rating, I am actually skeptical what grade to give it. The film's entire message didn't come out as should have, even though it had an awesome plot already created for it. Many movies have really awesome concepts to them but aren't expressed. I feel like I'm back in high school where a student speaker did all his research and knows what he should say in his speech but for some reason can't get it out. I am also very sad that the real X-Men nerds when all out in the ratings, like a bunch of kids that rated a film high because they saw a nude girl. Because it's the closest thing they've wanted to see they rated it ridiculously. I also know a few friends that went to the college computers and started rating it just to boost the score. Not cool. It's troubling considering their are potential stories that could possibly not be shown in all their glory because the direction of the film and script aren't able to show the important parts.",7,1,2,1 June 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fun Flick, More of an Introductory Film Into Another Harry Potter Series
","Movie captures the glamour and mystery that many other Harry Potter films have done. Like many of the Harry Potter films, it was able to introduce new lore into the film. Newt, the main character in the film goes to the United States with a brief case that contains a collection of mysterious creatures. He introduces a new wizard world of the United States that seems to operate separately and independently from the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts and the rest of the European Wizard World. You can hear comparisons between how the wizard world in the United States governs as well as how good their Wizard Schools are. If and when they decide to expand the Harry Potter Universe there is a lot of potential settings and plots that they can create. The film seems to try to venture a new route that stems away from a more traditional, European, feel. The real connection between the movie and the book is going to be Grindlewald. In fact, the plot in the film stems around his influence. As such, this creates another window and direction for the film to go to. For those fans who know, his history actually has a lot of dark vibes and connections with characters that are important to the franchise. As far as I can tell, this film creates potential for a lot in the series. I actually think this film acts as an experiment with a different setting, different time period, and different type of characters for the franchise. Now for the important part... WHAT ABOUT THE FANTASTICAL BEASTS... saved this for last because I'm afraid the film didn't really hit a home run on this one. I guess you care more if you really read the books and know a bit about them already about the creatures and history of the Harry Potter world. The film focuses on a few of the creatures. You briefly see a few beasts when he enters his briefcase, which is essentially a beast haven where they live together peacefully... An attempt here to not scare children I assume. If you look at the creatures in the actual book its quite a bit darker. You have a brief view of this world for a few minutes. After that there are like three creatures that escape his briefcase that he needs to put back in. The main creature that we have an issue with in his film is the Obscurus, which is essentially an wizard to develops a dark side that is uncontrollable. Not really a fantastic beast because it pretty much behaves like a possessed human being except its something the wizard creates. The film definitely fails to show the magic of the actual book. The movie portrays something more resemblant to zoo animals and fails to show the more interesting creatures. No dragons.... really? Again, the movie does some nice and interesting things for the rest of the series. Overall, a fun flick. If you are a hardcore fan who is expecting that really looks into the creatures of the Harry Potter world, then you might be disappointed. I feel Goblet of Fire actually did a lot better job showing it's worlds creatures. Besides that though, I think the film does a good job at giving you several ways it can expand. As such, it gives you hope considering there was so much lore... history... and plots in the Harry Potter universe that it was a shame it was thought to have ended with its last film.",7,1,3,24 November 2016
Wreck-It Ralph," Finally! An Unpredictable Disney Movie!
","This movie, from all the movies I've watched this year really made its mark. Its the first Disney Movie since Toy Story in which I was just completely blown away and was left completely in suspense. The advertising does show exactly how Wretch-It Ralph feels about his place in the world. I think it actually is a very relatable theme that many people can relate to. Essentially his game and the pressure from the system is forcing Ralph to be the big bad and unlovable person that he was created to be. Ralph shows them off by his heroic actions in the film. Besides from the theme the rest of the movie is completely unpredictable, and even more so, because of the games and plots that conjoin throughout the movie. Without giving spoilers, Wretch-It Ralph finally finds two things that he was looking for. One is what he was originally looking for, and the second which is what he found on his journey while looking for the first. The question for him is which of them really give him the value he is looking for.",9,2,3,28 November 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Another Bad Sequel
","I understand that sequels have a tendency of trying to present a moral and I feel like the plot and conflicts were hard to comprehend. Because the trailers are everywhere its fair to say that we all know that the main character's mom left her family to go live with the dragons and make her family and people think she has been dead for 20 years. I have a major problem with this plot. Firstly, she isn't even protecting the dragons. As in the first film, there is a big dragon that's defending the nest. She simply gone to live with the dragons with a stupid outfit. Secondly, I found it amazing how cool the father and son where to see her. Like, okay thats completely understandable to abandon your people and family to go spend your life playing with dragons. There is a villain, and like the first movie, the main character with an annoying voice ignores his father's stance on him and disobeys him to go tell him that everyone can hold hands and sing songs over a fire ... His father just told him a story about how he pretty much killed everybody in his tribe. But older people are just stupid so its okay to go out and disobey them because their old. Someone important dies because of this idiot's stupidity. This is the first time Disney made me sigh during one of their movies. Because of how fast we skim over the villain's background; who I must add is the most interesting person in this whole movie, on purpose so that we just view him as a bad guy. I thought it was interesting that in one instance, they actually say something along the lines, 'There are no bad dragons. Just bad people.' That fact is actually disproven in the first movie as well as the second. In fact the bad dragons never get a chance to become good. In both films they must and are defeated. So, I thought that was interesting. You are supposed to just look at this one bad guy and say, 'he is the reason for all this commotion...' Of course you probably forgot his back story. But whatever, right?When you watch the film its also interesting that the important part is to ignore the negligence of both the main character, Hiccup, and his stupid, good for nothing mother who are responsible for a major character's death as well as the destruction of their city and many other people's deaths. But they saved the dragons so its okay. I look at it in two perspectives. Firstly, I'm like 25 years old, so I'm not to young and not to old. It was a stupid movie to watch as a youth. I'm married and hope to have kids, and in that light... the movie was much more stupid. Kids absorb things from movies, and the rubbish portrayed in this film made me want to vomit. But also, I feel like I should watch movies alone before taking my family to one of these. Seriously, lets think about it as a parent. You tell your kid not to do something because you have had experience and they go do it and get someone killed. That's actually a very realistic scenario. The movie kind of makes it okay for stupid kids to go do something like this and then when they are done with the deed you pretty much have to say something like, 'oh its not your fault, now let me clean the doo doo on your behind.' Not sure what to think about the mother in this movie. Was it suppose to represent women can do what they want... okay, I guess. You can get a job, become a leader, do what hiccup did and make a difference. You don't have to be a dead beat mom. But hey if that's your cup of tea then go ahead. I hate dads that leave their families to go to the bars and completely ignore them as well. Also, the amount of destruction created by the idiots in this movie is amazing. There is a carefree sense being shown to our youth. I have never had a problem with Disney films in my life. I'm not a film Nazi. But what the heck was that? Hiccup does something in the film that constantly puts him in his dragon into danger. They discover a way to continue to do it, but that with the negligence and destruction left in their wake, it gives this careless vibe. This film has an idiotic plot and a bad message to people. I could have been happy with one of the two. I graded the first an 8 out of 10. It is interesting how you would view this one compared to many others that have posted. I really don't see the hype. Maybe their is a stereotypical villain and its much easier to absorb. However, he isn't a complete stereotypical villain. The way the villain gets defeated is idiotic as well. Just watch it and ask yourself what the heck was going on. Just to explain my ratings a bit. Anything 5 and up, I could watch again if it was a rainy day and there was nothing else on. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because there was a couple good actors voices. HICCUP sounded like a whinny little girl. Thats another thing! I wouldn't want my son thinking its cool to talk like that. The art and background of the story was pretty spectacular. But then again... I find it interesting how fanatical people can be by posting extremely good review. Thats why I don't feel ashamed to be the odd ball out. I am not hardcore about ratings.",4,14,43,20 June 2014
Across the Universe," Absolute Rape of a Legendary Band
","Phonie acting, emotion, and rape of classic works of art by a legendary band. I watched it once in the theaters when it first came out, and one more time recently. It rarely happens that my conception of a film remains the same or gets worse.In this case, it definitely got worse. I feel that being more interested in art in movies as I've gotten older, really demonstrates how bad this film really is. Before it was simply a dislike of the horrible way the actors were trying to sing the music differently for my younger generation. It was just absolutely disgusting and pathetic. They tried really hard to change it to stay in tune for this younger generation that they warped the music and took away its meaning. I mean, you can't say those Beatles songs mean the same thing in this movie. AT ALL. The songs held meaning for a decade in history, and in this movie, though they tried to add it, it focused on a stupid and phone love story. The acting was so horrible, I think you'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think about rolling your eyes at least a couple times during this film. I'll get back on it a little later. But these are just surface things about the movies. Back to the songs though. JUDE! LUCY? Strawberry fields? You've got to have a stupid sense of imagination if your eyes didn't roll right to the back of your heads. Did people seriously sit there and go... 'HOW CLEVER!' Its absolutely pathetic because this film's only support is that of songs from a legendary band. Rewatching it, I definitely disliked the film more for destroying the classical and true meanings of the songs. Perhaps more so because the characters were played pathetically. If you think about it, Jude's story feels forced into the film simply to be clever and play 'Hey Jude' and have some (if any) connection to the roots of the music by having a character from Liverpool. His character doesn't really fit in the movie though. He really has no emotion, real drive, reason for thinking the way that he does. If you think about it, every other character has a stronger sense of feeling or doing what they do because they have a stronger back story. Jude is as useless as Prudence if you think about it. Prudence's only reason for being in the film is to add Dear Prudence song. And to prove it, she's gone the rest of the film until the end. You have all these random songs being played because they are good songs, and the film tries to put them by adding a random character or scenario and having these random plot strings that kind of trail off and die. As far as actually filming, the acting is terrible, but I've said that a couple times by now. Why are Jude and Lucy in love? They met at a bowling place, and she shared a simple story with him about her boyfriend dying. Next thing you know she goes all the way to New York and sleeps with him. That'll do it I guess. I'm not sure Jude makes Lucy feel special enough for the connection to transfer to this longing for one another at the end. To be fair, Bane/Mad Max who is pretty much Lucy's boss and secret lover in reality, had a stronger connection with her than Jude. I'm really surprised at the lack of connection. This moves to the camera angles, art, and color added to make scenes look better in the film. The film did use color correctly and even had good concepts of film angling, but it was done totally inappropriately. We can sense a lack of connection with Jude and Lucy really... in my opinion when they get on the bus and find the circus. The reason being because the story is bringing about the decade more in its revolution. Where Jude is having fun, Lucy is living a revolution. I get the love part in the water with the blue and green color, but again, inappropriate, considering the plot has moved on. We continuously see a lack of connection, and all of a sudden we have Jude and the use of love with red in the Strawberry painting. How random, and also convenient to have a Strawberry Fields concept thrown in there. We see how the film has separated the two characters. Lucy is in revolution due to personal losses, but then the film also artificially keeps Jude in his own bubble. The only explanation is he stays in the apartment all day doing mediocre art. There are no real camera angles that depict the true meaning and plot of the film, except when they are all drugged up. Thats all fine and dandy, but all of a sudden Lucy and Jude are to be taken seriously.All in all, bad film. Bad acting, along with a plot that is all over the place due to the fact it is trying to be clever with famous Beatle songs makes it completely pathetic.",1,1,2,24 May 2015
Lincoln," Best Movie... Seriously?
","Looking at the reviews, I wanted to be completely blown away by this movie when I went to see it. I saw the new James Bond film and Twilight, and to my surprise they actually exceeded my expectations. The movie Lincoln started off very interestingly. I would say that they really had some good actors, and as far as an Abraham Lincoln... damn did they do a mighty good job. We are all taught as kids that the Civil War is about slavery, though that is pretty inaccurate, I think anyone can play along. But this movie really was depicted inaccurately, that in a way I find it insulting. As a historian, one of the wars that got me into learning about History was the Civil War and how devastating it was for both sides. This movie took away from that and basically just made it a war about slavery. I also thought the acting was so cheesy. You have the big bad southerners who's speech is so unattractive, mean, nasty. Then you have the smart northerners who are just so smart at saying what they are saying, they even make the audience snicker. The Blacks were all dressed in expensive nice looking clothing. Seriously? And now for some reason they all turned out to live in the streets of New York and Chicago. About 80% of the union soldiers were black. If you do a little more research you'll find they were for the most part immigrants. The lines everyone said in this film were all stereotypical, made up, and cheesy. It was like everyone was trying to be poetic every single time they spoke. Lincoln and his wife are fighting and they are basically just arguing poetically. SOOOO CHEEESY! A few other things I didn't like were how cold Lincoln was made to appear. He actually wanted to end the war and preserve the Union. I also think this movie was pretty long. It was too long. The Gettysburg movie showed a better depiction between north and south and clearly showed how devastating and cruel the war brought one another. It did it in about the same amount of time. What's even sadder is that you only see Lincoln's last few months as President. It hardly gives you a good picture of what he was as a leader. So in other words, you have a long movie that is historically inaccurate, really unnecessarly poetic and cheesy. WHY DID YOU GUYS SAY IT WAS AN 8 OUT OF 10?!!! Bad taste in movies guys. I will never watch this movie again. I can tell you what, I will watch most movies that aren't so good or even bad for the sake of spending ones time. But this movie really was too extreme to sit through again. I watched Lord of the Rings SO many times. EVEN THOSE MOVIES DON'T DRAG ALONG LIKE THIS ONE!Best movie of the year? Seriously? Biggest disappointment of the decade! You had wonderful actors, an awesome director, and the story plot was already written out with history books. You also had the best president in the last century. NO WAY THE BEST MOVIE. What the heck is wrong with you guys? My only hope is there will be enough people after twilight that will put this rating at the right rate.",5,12,26,21 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Surprised Me
","WOW! I'll tell you. I was quite skeptical about this movie. Its funny because during the trailer up to maybe the first five minutes of the movie I kept a pretty straight face on while the rest of audience laughed it up like a bunch of babies at Disney world. I was like... seriously? Its all giggles and smiles for you people. I really thought this movie was going to blow, and for a second I really thought this was a movie that would simply appeal to lame people. Seeing the trailers and such, I thought they were forcing more than necessary comedy for the movie and I thought it was going to be absolutely ridiculous. I guess what made me go watch it was the reviews. I always read the bad reviews to see whether or not the movie is going to be good. I was quite surprised at the limited bad reviews, because honestly we live in an age where there are simply a lot of haters, and if you don't want to waste money they actually give you an excuse not to. Many times I have disagreed with them, but hey, they have actually helped me at times too. But there weren't that many reviews and after a couple days it was a ridiculous average of 9/10 stars! I was like whoa! I had to watch it... not because I knew it was going to be good, but because there was probably something really stupid in the movie that a group of people would really like and inflate the reviews.But honestly, I go in, and after the first five minutes I am like okay... not terrible. And we slowly see a development of the characters. The story arc is very good and appeals to a huge range of audiences because it has a neutral tone which doesn't force any ideology. In many ways the story arc is actually pretty innocent and away from politics. So in that sense it was very appealing. The main character gets taken from aliens right after his mother dies and is raised as a merchant and hire for money. The main focal point is there is an orb which actually connects the entire Marvel Universe together. So besides for the Story Arc, the 'fluff' or universe is expanded and makes more sense if you watched Thor 1 &2 as well as The Avengers with these stones of power. There is one in here, and you see familiar enemies from those movies. It gives you a better view of whats going on with Marvel and future films. Back to the story arc, not knowing what it is, Star Lord takes it and connects with other Merchants who have their own agenda's to fulfill while being tracked a monstrous alien race who wants nothing more than to destroy all life in the galaxy. We see how they actually relate to one another and become friends on a quest to defeat an enemy who simply wants to destroy worlds. The Marvel Film Industry has done a fantastic job making the villains look freaky as hell. We have gone from Frost Giants to Dark Elves to these dark mysterious dudes who maybe related to those in The Avengers. WOW! Good story, comedy adds a bit more character to the characters in the film without being ridiculous and wow to the special effects and creativity as always. Maybe the top Marvel Performance yet... I'm still deciding. Some interesting things we see, are the Collector from the end of the credits in Thor II, as well as a glimpse of Ultron. CREDITS SUCK! Stupid ending, don't waste your time, its just a stupid joke, unless they are really going to make a Howard the Duck movies.",10,8,14,2 August 2014
Jurassic World," Same Plot Like Every Other
","In the end, I wasn't surprised the movie was a disaster, and to tell you what, I heard about the script years ago about genetically modified dinosaurs and Steven trying to make dinosaurs man's friend. So its, not like I was thrown a curved ball of garbage. Movie starts out excellent. Your given a world that you've never seen before. In fact its just as beautiful and new as the old movie. So yes, you are blown back. You see some of the trained dinosaurs. It wasn't totally lame, and it was somewhat unbelievable. We move to the genetically enhanced dinosaur and the roller coaster ride starts immediately. I think it was quite lazy if you ask me. Like they ran out of imagination and just started the movie way to fast. Before that, you do see some similarities to the old movie. You see the same genetic scientist from the first movie who Dr. Grant was talking to about the raptors being made on the island and Malcom was debating about life finding away. You also see that someone else took over that old dude's dream of making a park. Anyhow, you see like in every movie that there is evil people trying to control nature. It worked well in the first film, but it really fell apart after that. You'd think they'd get the point. Spielberg likes to push this idea of people not being able to control nature. But its done so many times before that its pretty dumb now. I can't believe the security on the island decided to battle the dinosaur hybrid with raptors for crying out loud. Its pretty dumb. The genetics guy gets taken off the island before the end by the remaining security and makes it possible for another Jurasic failure. Throughout the movie you are given way to many impossible scenarios so that Spielberg's message can be scene. The two major problems with the film is that one, its the same story plot as every other Jurassic film. Seriously, its kind of boring and lame, and shows lack of imagination. Secondly, the film becomes a confusing type of film. Is it a dinosaur film? Is it a science fiction freak film? The film was violent. But except for the beginning you don't feel that dinosaur aspect. You feel more of a freak/horror film science film feel afterwards. Its not a good film, but like myself, I really needed to see it for myself because I really didn't know what to expect. I think it makes you to curious. But pretty much, your getting exactly what your thinking before you go in to watch it.",3,4,11,12 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Movie Tries to Hard
","Overall an okay flick. I wouldn't mind watching it a couple more times in the future. But already, I feel that this one will be the one everyone dreads to watch when doing a Marvel marathon. Differences between the Avengers becomes exploited when the Avengers finally destroy Hydra's headquarters and face off these two new characters that have joined the series. I actually thought it was too bad that Hydra got exterminated so quickly, I felt that Hydra always provided a great plot for the marvel heroes. Oh well. As such, Mr. Stark designs his and the world's doom by creating what is in his mind the ultimate defense for the world. Ultron, brings this 'Terminator' series idea back in where technology fights its own designers. So alright, we have this concept brought back up. Its not terrible, and I guess its an alright attempt to make the Ultron plot. It really should have been assumed way before watching what the plot was going to be, given the main villain was going to be a robot. With the Avengers being manipulated and harassed by these new mutant marvel characters, they must find the courage to hold hands and fight together... should I go on? Kind of lame. It frankly felt like a waste of time to be honest. The actual Ultron character was pretty cool. Perhaps the coolest character in the movie, which is too bad because I'm a Thorn, Captain America fan. But wow! What a wimpy conflict to throw at the characters. They seriously go through an Emo phase for about an hour because Scarlet casts a spell on them. And then of course, they just had to add the Hulk getting mad at something stupid and waste a bunch of other time. The film tries to be emotional and build attachment... but it tries way too hard. I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that I see a concept within the Marvel/Avenger series to create heroes that are completely perfect. Captain America, you see how he questions the tactics in which SHIELD gets its information and to what extent it goes to securing the people. You see it pushed here a little where literally an entire city is ripped from the earth and dropped back to the planet. Well, the movie makes it positively clear that the Avengers rescued every single civilian before the whole city crumbles into nothingness, while of course at the same time trying to eliminate hundreds of thousands of Ultron copies. It really was kind of stupid. If Marvel is really afraid of showing something like that then don't show it. Don't make it look very cheesy and completely impossible. The Marvel heroes somehow get the SHIELD club back together to help people escape a city being dropped from midair. You get an interesting ending, like most Marvel movies, including a bit more about the infinity stones. But very vague, boring, and essentially, nothing new. Its the second Avengers film, and I find it the worse second film of the franchise. They really tried to hard in virtually every area. Just watch it and you'll know what I mean. From the beginning they are trying to be really funny with their hohohohehehe attitude where they are slaying Hydra's minions without breaking a sweat. The emotions, character development, and plot was all pretty bad. It was worth it just to see Ultron being evil.",6,7,17,19 May 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Pretty Good
","I'm quite surprised at the reviews. A couple weeks ago, this movie was around 8.5. Now its ranked really low. I am not a fan of the Twilight Series, but I have seen all of them. I thought quite a few of them were a waste of time to be honest. However, in this one, I thought in some ways justice was made. The bad vampires finally make a scene which they pretty much haven't even though they really should have been a bigger focus. The bad vampires get what they deserve in a metaphoric sense. Especially since many of these vampire characters really annoyed me. I am really surprised people graded it bad, and I don't understand why they rated it bad. Because it didn't represent the literature well? Seriously? I'm not defending this movie by any stretch of the word, because I think the series is joke. But the first movie was horrible! It did not give the book series justice at all. And every movie except for this one in my opinion progressively got worse. So I don't understand the logic behind the reviews at all. All the girl things that were used like the Edward and Jacob thing being lovers of the same girl (any American Girls Dream) were done with this movie a long time ago. So why critics feel like they should whine and moan about its disappearance is a mystery to me.",8,5,11,28 November 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Good... but What Happened to Jackson's Skills?
","I understand fans that fanatically liked or disliked the film. The film carried some new good stuff, and yet lacked so much greatness and potential that Peter Jackson has always put in his films. WHAT HAPPENED?I had read reviews thinking that people were being picky about the movie, yet as a person that still enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but ask, did Peter Jackson stop caring during the film? It had all the tools as well as help from some good cast. If your going to put romance then you really have to establish the connection. I felt like Fili and Tauriel were dating for sometime right when they started throwing at each other. The screen time between the battles and unnecessary Wilfred scenes kind of make me cringe. What a waste. Fili and Kili's deaths were sad but they weren't as emotional as they should have been. Peter Jackson failed to make these characters death momentus. Boromir's death was able to look tragic despite being an unlikable character throughout 95 percent of the film. Yet his death was 10 times more important and tragic than Kili and Fili. And I say that regrettably. During serious moments, I really felt Peter Jackson was either hesitant to set the mood or just didn't bother caring. The sad scenes and dramatic scenes had terrible background tunes. It made the audience unsympathetic to these scenes. Even though the battle scenes were pretty good, they still seemed to lack... a lot... and its noticeable. The beginning of the battle is the biggest scene really. After that there's very few good battle scenes. It brings up the question of whether Peter Jackson decided to cut funding. The final battle between Thorin and Agog isn't very dramatic. It was okay, but with all the tragic deaths of Lord of the Rings, this did not come close. We had Boromir's Death, and Theoden's that had their sad and honorable endings, and as a king Thorin really should have had that moment better. No funeral? Very interesting. Again, with the duel between Thorin and Azog and the lack of a true ending for the characters we have been on a journey with for three movies, you wonder if they looked at their bank account and just said... heck with it. Okay movie, but you have to ask with the lack of, whether Peter Jackson made the movie in such a way to just kill the series. Its very tragic as especially with the movies this year, it could have really made a big noise in the Academy Awards.",8,3,6,15 January 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Who Cares?
","I had to watch this movie because of all the hype and nominations and just couldn't wait to see something that looked interesting. Don't get caught up by my rating though, I will say there are some nice things about this movie. Firstly, the acting was really great. Keaton and the other actors had very realistic emotions and acting. They are truly believable actors. Keaton, a washed up actor who played a fictional movie hero 'Birdman,' tries to evolve from an action packed star into art and theater, trying to find true emotion and symbolism. He puts everything into directing this play including ignoring his already distant family and giving up everything he owns to pay for its production. The viewer sees as the movie progresses that the main actor is slowly losing his grip in reality. As opening day comes he realizes more and more, how more impossible his dream is becoming. This is where the viewer must focus on the mood, the thoughts, and even the meaning of the background sounds/tunes. What do these mean? And how should you apply them to the ending?Was it artistic? Yes, it was very artistic and interesting. However, the plot just seemed so boring. I applaud anyone who went through the first 20 minutes and still had patience. The plot really isn't anything new. Keaton plays a dad who made it big and lost sight of the things that mattered like his family and true loved ones. Alright, alright, same story played differently. I know the play was supposed to look mediocre, but just the added screen time devoted to showing it made the movie even more boring. Seeing these parts over and over again. The movie is simply a dead beat washed up father who stubbornly chooses to go down with the ship. Some movies you just know whats going to happen and you hate those, well... this one is kind of the opposite but its kind of dreadful. The artistic aspect was alright. Its not something we haven't seen before like Shutter Island, Inception, or other films where you really have to pay attention and figure out what the real ending implies. After, you go wow, that was interesting, and then look back at the plot, I really don't understand how you go, wow! Awesome movie! Its more like... so what? It was good acting, but I didn't feel any connection to the characters. Who cares?I'd watch it again in passing but wouldn't pay attention much. Movie is quite slow and at times obnoxious. Art in movies is awesome, but it is completely lacking in the passion of the viewer towards the characters and the plot.",6,9,22,22 February 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Nearly Perfect!
","I heard a lot of good things before the movie came out, and it did not leave me with regret. Definitely a must watch film. A few things that I felt failed its justice I'm not sure could have been made better without making it a Lord of the Rings film. Firstly, I'm not sure the Dark Elves had enough screen time. They were awesome, and I think they chose some good actors for the part. I just feel they could have used their skills more. Secondly, they could have spent more time on the story about their past. It was good but they could have really highlighted this scenario to expand their fan base and create a cult of nerds. Again not sure if they could have been fixed, but as fiction fan who appreciates lore I have to express that. Lastly, not a big fan of the comedy, but I'm not a fun guy. Everyone else had a good time in the theaters. The acting was pretty good and I believe you felt the drama and emotion between Thor's family. To me that was the highlight of the movie. The custom, props and effects were great. That much said, I believe this movie makes you want to know more about the Marvel Universe and the scene after the credits leaves you handing.",9,4,9,8 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Hope Retold Again with Better Graphics
","By no means did I dislike the movie. However, the truth is the truth and the whole movie of the new Star Wars was pretty much a retelling of 'A New Hope.' Just too many similarities. The only problem though is considering this a bad or a good thing. I will reserve judgment with that because of the other new Star Wars (Episode 1-3) where they really went to our minds like a wrecking ball. This similarity in plot could mean a good thing for the next two Star Wars. Like it or not, this Star Wars was definitely 'true to the roots.' 'History repeats itself.' That could definitely be the case in the world where the light and dark sides of the force are constantly trying to get balance each other out. The trouble I found with the 'New Order' was understanding how it was able to maintain itself. Its obviously what the remnants of the Empire turn to. However, they seem to have a pretty expensive military considering they don't really control populations which they can tax. They pretty much exterminate opposition which is interesting because not even the Nazis annihilated all their enemies. Just a common sense thing in order to tax. So the bad guys don't make that much sense. I like their new look, and I think the new Sith and commanders are pretty cool. It would be interesting to see how complex they make the characters as well. Because the Episodes 4-6 didn't really go into much depth because they were essentially just the order, 'The Empire' and were simply preserving it, it would be interesting to know more about why the new Sith joined. More power is too simplistic, even Anakin chose to to join the Dark Side because he felt that the democratic government had grown weak and corrupt, and we see that through some exchanges with Padame. I was also impressed by the new good guys. Most notably Finn and Poe. They seemed very true and independent characters. Finn's character arc is very new and I would say probably the best thing in the new Star Wars. He represents very much how the Force can operate. He transforms from a Storm Trooper into someone trying to fight for whats right because choice and opportunity stumble upon his life. The scene that shows this seemed to have good symbolism.",8,1,9,19 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Descent Depiction of the Second Novel
","The movie overall was pretty entertaining, but to me missed the 'wow' factor. I must admit, I have read the books but I am not considered a hard core fan of the lore. I think they did a descent job of trying to adapt a lot of detail in one book. I feel however, they went through the game too fast. The original game was much more complex and entertaining. It was probably due to not straining time that they skipped some of those parts. Unlike the first movie, this is really about the depiction of the Hunger Games universe with the showing of the districts and how the government works. The actual game that is depicted towards the end of the movie is simply the result in every sense of the word to the events of the first half of the movie. Pretty good movie... ending actually did give a surprise. I think its because it happened faster than i thought it would. I wish Thad from Blue Mountain State had a cooler part though.",8,2,20,23 November 2013
Cloud Atlas," Why Intelligent People Would Dislike This Movie
","I think you had three people who went to this movie. The people who really like it, consider it a work of art. A movie that highlights a novel excellently. Then you have people who came to this movie, really enjoyed the effects, the scenery, and props. Would probably rate this movie between a 5-7. There was nothing here they thought was done absolutely horribly and based on things done in this movie, would call this a very unique movie.Then you have the negative Nancy's. This is where I come in. I will say, that the actors they put in the movie have done good previous works. The special effects were good. The way they jumped between stories was a very unique technique, and one I would have really supported had I enjoyed the overall theme of the movie and plot. However, the plot was not done so well. An intelligent person who went to this movie knowing what actors were in it, would have known right away that this movie's main intent was to push a liberal message. I hate politics in movies! What the heck? I want to watch my movies and sports without actors or sport stars trying to push a liberal theme to its audience. It was a 3 hour message, involving Atheism, and depicting the Corporations and Energy Companies as mean inhuman threats to society. I am writing this review contrary to the opposite of my title. Because of the Liberal Message being forced through the movie I think that many of the smaller stories were mutilated. The story about the two homosexuals for example, was completely buried by the overall themes of this movie. That story in itself could have provided a wonderful movie. The Armagedon scenario was also another interesting story.The acting by the way... even though they had wonderful actors... absolutely dreadful. What the heck is up with the fake accents? Any emotional attempts in the stories were absolutely unconvincing. The only convincing love story, or story of sorrow was the story of the two gay men. Why the need for the same actors? Were they trying to save money? The actors were clearly not the only indication for the reincarnation theme. As sometimes the birth mark was the indication. Some really stupid attempts at trying to pass this off between the stories was trying to make the white actors look Asian. That was completely racist and horrible. It was like the old movie planet of the apes. They didn't even look Asian? They just looked like mutated freaks with shave eye brows. Then they also attempted to make the Asian girl a white girl. I would also say, that any average review of this movie should be highlighted as people trying to say there were many great things in the movie THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. But guess what.... they weren't. And they should rate the movie the correct way. Would you buy this movie for twenty bucks and put it in your DVD collection as one of your favorites? Hell no. I'll save a long movie like that for Lord of the Rings.",4,7,17,21 November 2012
Windtalkers," Stupid Movie
","Believe it or not, I watched it a couple times a few years ago, but I watched it again today, and it was absolutely a stupid movie. First scene tells you the whole movie. The guy in charge gets people killed because he is following orders. He must learn to break the rules to save lives. He's tasked to defend a position and everyone dies except him and its pushed in your face for the rest of the movie with several instances of people dying. Nicholas Cage tells the last guy in the opening scene to jump from cover without giving him covering fire. STUPID! He says god damn you, because he was begging Cage to abandon their position. And go where exactly? They're surrounded in a swamp with high bushes with the enemy charging and firing in every position. The idiots that make this movie always think they are so morally higher than everybody else. With messages like... 'disobey you chain of command because only you know the right answers that lie within your heart and true justice in the world.' Yeah, let the Code guys get captured and suffer a horrible death because of the great and well known Japanese tactics they implement when torturing their captures, and while your at it, let the the secret code go out in enemy hands. Seriously?",1,0,2,8 June 2015
