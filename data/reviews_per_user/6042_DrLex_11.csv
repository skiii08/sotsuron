The Hangover," Entertaining, but overrated
","I'm surprised to see that this movie rates 8.0 at the time I'm writing this. Not surprising is that 'Aged under 18' gave the highest scores, because that's the perfect target group for this kind of movie. If you haven't seen a whole lot of good comedies in your life yet, this will be funny. However, if you've seen more movies, it will be all too obvious that the main ingredients of this movie are derivative and/or cheap.The 'doctor/dentist' gag comes straight out of Wild Hogs for instance, and many of the other situations come from other movies which in most cases did a better job at it. For someone who has watched 'Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas', it feels like the makers of this movie wanted to duplicate the hotel suite scene but were too chicken (pun intended) to do actual damage to their film set. When the humor isn't derivative, it often stoops down to puerile level instead.This is a 'trailer movie': the best parts are in the trailer and the rest is mostly filler. Don't get me wrong: it's not terrible as a whole. As a kind of remix of existing movies it was entertaining enough not to get me bored. It just doesn't deserve the 10 or even 8 stars many people give it. 6/10 seems much more reasonable.",6,0,3,4 December 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Entertaining but mostly forgettable
","I just finished watching the entire Alien saga from the first to the last film, and this is the run-down: Alien: 10; Aliens: 10; Alien³: 7; Alien Resurrection: 7.Alien is a horror movie that introduces the ingenious concept of the alien species and then ramps up the terror right until the final scene. I almost forgot how scared I could get from watching a film, but re-watching Alien reminded me how un-scary most recent 'horror' films are.Aliens also has horror, but focuses on action. It also ramps up this action steadily in such a brilliant way that every second of the film is thrilling. Watching Aliens again was just as thrilling as the first time. Films that can do that are rare, and certainly worth a score of 10.Alien³ is a mess. It's way too obvious that there have been problems with the script and the directors, and the fact that they obviously got rid of most of the characters that survived from Aliens is jarring, but in the end Alien³ is not awful. It has a unique atmosphere and some memorable scenes. One of the biggest problems is that it has almost no characters to care about except Ripley. The only other interesting character is abruptly killed half-way the film.Alien: Resurrection is also a mess but in a different way. Of course, the whole 'resurrection' concept is ridiculous but I could forgive the writers because there was no other way to continue the saga with Ripley included. What struck me the most is how little I remembered from A:R, even though my previous viewing was more recent than the other films. In fact, it has about three or maybe four memorable scenes and about two memorable characters. The rest is forgettable, albeit still entertaining.While Alien³ still had some thrilling scenes, A:R relies mostly on gore in an attempt to be scary. Because all 'horror' films from the last decade followed this trend, I got used to seeing CGI monsters, horribly deformed mutants and people being ripped to shreds in all details. The original Alien is still scary because so little is shown and so much is implied. Seeing a dark corridor and knowing there's something horrible in there without actually seeing it, never gets old. Seeing a monster again and again, no matter how meticulously crafted it is to look hideous, does get old.Overall, the last two films are OK and good enough to keep the Alien fan in me entertained, but you won't hear me protest at all if a director steps up and makes a *real* sequel to Aliens without even acknowledging the existence of A³ or A:R.",7,1,1,6 November 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," As if they hollowed out someone's head and put popcorn inside
","This will not be a review that pinpoints all kinds of technical details that this film violates regarding the original franchise. I will not require spoilers to explain what is wrong with Star Trek Into Darkness. I am not a Trekkie by far. Only very recently I watched through the original series. It was an interesting experience. Many episodes were obviously outdated but it was surprising to see how modern some of the ideas and how well- written the scripts were. The series managed to be interesting with a low budget and a spartan look.Star Trek Into Darkness is the opposite. It is a complete overload of special effects and visual design, wrapped around a simple story filled with clichés and predictability, and devoid of any depth. Every scene is filled with over-designed crap all the time. There is too much stuff on the screen, really. There is so much to look at that nothing stands out. Any good director will focus attention on what is truly important by toning down redundant details in the rest of the image. This film however is 90% redundant details and 10% relevance. The duration of the end credits (I estimate some 12 minutes) illustrates this. Of course they had to include every person who made one of the gazillion 3D models featured in this film.Imagine someone smart. Someone who is famous for being thoughtful, intelligent, maybe boring at times but always interesting in the end. That is the original Star Trek.Now imagine opening up this person's skull, scooping out the brains, and putting popcorn in place. Then seal it back up, apply loads of extra cosmetic surgery, and polish it up real good. That is Star Trek Into Darkness.They took a franchise and mimicked all its superficial appearances like the names, characters, and some plot devices. But they removed all the substance. They even tried hard to find actors who look like plausible young versions of their counterparts in the original series (especially Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are right on the spot). But that is where the similarities end. This is a staple of many a contemporary 'reboot' or 'remake': focus on superficial similarities with the original, and total disregard for the essence. Why even bother trying to disguise it as a remake of something old? They should have given it a new name so nobody is being fooled.In the end, STID is just a bog standard contemporary action movie with a whiff of Star Trek flavor. If you long for two hours of visual effects, explosions, and noise, then by all means indulge yourself. But if you want to watch something that has any of the depth that was characteristic for the Star Trek TV series, stay away.",5,5,7,15 October 2013
Knowing," Pretty good if you stop watching at 01:40:00
","There's little new I can tell you in this review, as my criticism is exactly the same as what has been repeated countless times. What I can tell you is how to watch this movie in a way that won't let itself ruin your experience.It starts out really well, with a good build-up of suspense and some impressive disaster scenes. But at a certain point it suddenly gets completely ridiculous, as if the director got an aneurysm and his kids had to finish it. Because this movie is all about numbers, here are some of my own. That disastrous point is at 01:40:00 on the DVD if you're watching the NTSC version (at PAL frame-rate it should be about 01:35:54). Just hit the stop button and assume Cage crashes his car into a tree at lethal speed and the credits start rolling. That's a silly ending but believe me, perfectly acceptable compared to the real thing. The actual ending reeks of propaganda for a certain 'religion', although the director nor any of the main actors seem to have any connections to it, so it probably wasn't intentional. It may just have been a case of 'hey, we've created an awesome build-up but we forgot to come up with a good finale, so let's summon a Deus Ex Machina and lots of CGI.'Well, now you're probably too curious to skip the ending anyway, so go ahead and let yourself be disappointed. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.",6,56,100,27 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Redundant
","I watched this movie, knowing that after T2 the only possibility to make a sequel would be to break with the existing storyline somehow and come up with something as 'Hollywood-plausible' as the trick used to justify 'Alien: resurrection'. So I expected nothing more than an action movie, probably combining elements from the two previous movies, using more special effects, more spectacular explosions, and contemporarily adding the obligatory woman beating up men. And I was kind of right. The one-liners were there, the spectacular chases, the CGI effects, the explosions, and a female terminator sowing death and destruction and grabbing Arnie in the crotch. *WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!* I won't go into detail about all the holes in the plot, because this has been done in countless reviews before. Something I haven't read during a sampling of the thousands of reviews, is that at the end, Connor says something like the Terminator has tricked them into the nuclear shelter. This would fit with the dialog right after the chase in the funeral car, when the Terminator at first didn't seem to want to change its objective of leading Connor and Brewster to a safe place in Mexico. Maybe it knew about the Crystal Peak shelter and tricked them into believing they could take out Skynet, but actually lead them to that shelter. However, the only reason why they went there, is that Brewster's dad said the Skynet mainframe is located there. Or maybe I was so confused about all the other plot holes that I got this wrong, whatever. One thing I don't understand about many of the reviews here is that people find it so obvious that this movie ought to have a T4 sequel. Maybe they didn't catch Arnie's last phrase 'We'll meet again' which IMHO only refers to the fact that Connor will be killed by this very terminator in the future, as explained during the conversation in the van. Actually I believe this movie has literally blown up every chance for an interesting sequel which still has something in common with the Terminator movies as we know them. The earth is nuked, which only leaves an opportunity to make a movie which is one long battle scene in a post-apocalyptic world, the kind we saw a few of in the first two movies as flash-forwards - or flash-backs if you want. In other words, this would be something like Mad Max but then with dimmed lights and robots, which are so numerous and strong that it'll require loads of 'Hollywood-plausibility' to avoid the only real plausible outcome, being the eradication of humanity. There is no room for anything of the stuff that made the first movies interesting. But apparently, many people want to see robots beating the crap out of humans during two hours until they are all dead. Well, I don't. Not even Cameron would be able to make an interesting movie out of that. Overall, I found this a redundant addition to the two existing excellent movies. It didn't work as a sequel, nor as a tribute, nor as a parody, only as an action movie to pass the time on an otherwise boring evening.",6,1,2,30 March 2005
Event Horizon," More close to 'Doom' than its own movie adaptation
","People who were disappointed about the movie adaptation of the computer game 'Doom 3', should take a look at 'Event Horizon'. It has exactly what was left out of the 'Doom' movie, being the core concept of the game's story. For the rest it's completely different, but the atmosphere is there, and of course the scares.For people who have no idea what 'Doom' is or don't care about it, 'Event Horizon' is just a good sci-fi horror movie. It borrows from many other movies to end up with an original and quite successful result. In fact, the parts where classics like Alien(s), The Shining and even '2001' can be recognized, are so obvious that they should rather be considered homages than rip-offs. As usual, some people complain about the 'science' in this movie, but if you've read the plot outline it should be pretty obvious that the goal of the makers was not to show us a documentary on physics. To enjoy this movie optimally, watch it in a dark room with either a good surround system or headphones. The soundtrack does a perfect job of setting the mood without being distracting. Visual effects are quite good for their time, and still look good today. The bottom line: a good mix of sci-fi and horror, nothing groundbreaking but nevertheless entertaining.",8,1,3,29 April 2007
Die Hard," Die Hard, in every way
","I have seen this movie 4 times, or was it 5, 6? I have lost the count. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I could watch it again and still enjoy it as much as I've did the first time. Talk about die hard!This is without any doubt one of the best action movies of all times. Action is delivered in perfect doses, not too little, not too much. The special effects have stood the test of time. And the main character is just one of the best anti-heroes ever. He really is the right man at the most wrong place and time that could ever be conceived, and this produces a set of awe- inspiring fireworks. And he is a man of flesh and blood, not some invulnerable superhero. We can feel his pain as he gets battered and bruised, but still struggles on. There's some friendship, some love (and lots of hate), but not in such amounts that it distracts or becomes unrealistic. It's all just so well dosed that it seems like the perfect entertainment treatment.",10,1,3,20 November 2007
Signs," Beware: major pitfall ahead!
","Minor spoilers below. But you probably read through 20 spoiler comments anyway to reach this one.It's surprising that the highest rated comments on this movie are all 'hated it' comments. Or maybe it's not that surprising after all. As you can see, all these comments tell the same thing (which makes me wonder why even the 10th one is still rated 'useful'). The conclusion: 'this is a very bad sci-fi movie about incredibly stupid aliens (and a stupid dog too).'They're right, as a sci-fi movie this is not quite it. The plot holes are bigger than the crop circles. However, all these people are somehow missing the point, but they can't be blamed. Why is this? Well, the problem with this movie is that from the time it was announced on, people thought it would be a sci-fi movie revolving about an alien invasion and nothing else. It isn't, but this is never obvious enough.Some reviewers get it right: this movie is actually about belief. The alien story is just a vehicle. This is why everyone expecting an alien movie will be heavily disappointed at the end. It's a typical Shyamalan film in that it tries to set you on the wrong track, but it's atypical in that it's poorly executed.I think Shyamalan's biggest mistake was to eventually resort to showing more of the aliens than just some shadows and indirect hints, or even making it so obvious that there were aliens after all, and what their intentions were. There's no better way to ruin a whole suspenseful build-up based on concealment, than to show the evil in all its CGI glory and having a TV set telling what its plans are. The fact that at some point in this movie an alien is shown in its entirety, has helped to feed the misunderstanding that it's just a bad alien movie. For the conclusion of the story as it is, showing the alien was almost inevitable. But the same kind of story could have been told without having to lift the veil of mystery around the aliens. All the gigantic plot holes that so many people have fallen into, would have been avoided if we never knew what -- and who -- exactly was behind those crop circles. People could have made up their own explanations, and as everyone knows, in the absence of ready-made (CGI) answers, people come up with much more captivating ideas on their own. People would have left the theater, still wondering about the mysteries. But instead, we are spoon-fed with a pretty weak sci-fi story which at some point made me remember the movie 'Independence Day'. That's IMHO not a bad movie, but this one being associated with it, is.My conclusion: the first part is really good. The build-up of suspense works well and there are some truly scary moments. But soon, the first holes in this build-up begin to appear, and eventually it all crumbles. The finale is embarrassing.Considering Shyamalan's track record, it probably was intentional to make people believe they're watching an alien movie, and then shatter this belief and reveal the true identity of the movie. But the belief is never shattered because it _is_ an alien movie after all, and not a good one at that. All that remains, is disbelief why it was such a bad alien movie, and the actual point of the story is forgotten. Compared to the rest of the movie, the parts about the actual story even seem (pun intended)... alien.",6,1,3,9 September 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Classic non-stop die hard action
","I'm not going to spend too many words on this because most other reviews (like AdnanZ's) pretty much nail down all I've wanted to say. In short, this really is a rare example of a sequel (the fourth one even) which stays true to what made the original so good, even if the plot is very different. Even though the scale of the attack which forms the core of the movie is a multitude larger (the entire USA), we still get the same kind of feeling about it as in the original Die Hard, where all the action was confined to a single building. That really is impressive and a sure sign that the director has made his homework.Even though the movie is pure hardcore action, the plot is still quite solid. It does even raise some valid concerns, without standing in the way of the non-stop action. The action itself is perfectly executed, I suppose there are loads of CGI effects in this movie but they are so well executed that they will stand the test of time.The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the few way too impossible things that happen. These do take the viewer out of the immersion a bit, making it too obvious that they're watching a movie. I know, it is an action blockbuster where you're not supposed to think, but seeing a crashing car being flung in the air as if it has jet engines mounted on it, just triggers my disbelief-detector, no matter how sedated it is by the previous awesome action scenes.",8,1,3,20 November 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," Too predictable at times
","The main problems I have with this film is:1. It had the longest scene in it I ever watched in a film, that I could predict entirely. The culprit is an entirely redundant shot with a CGI eagle at the start of the film. Who thought it would be a good idea to put that in?2. There are many other scenes that gave me a similar feeling of wasted time by making me think: 'yes, I get the point, this refers to a famous horror movie, please move on to the rest of the story.'3. The actual premise of the film, the stuff that could make it interesting, is compressed into the quite short ending and was mostly predictable from the start.'The Cabin in the Woods' gives away too many hints from the start on. Drop those hints and it would become more interesting, at the condition that the viewer didn't already pick up the hints elsewhere like in the trailer, a short summary, or reviews. If you don't know anything yet about the film and this is the first review you read, stop reading if you plan to watch it. The less you know about it, the higher the chance that it will be interesting.Overall, the film was entertaining enough that I would give it a 6/10, but it was far from the great and original experience I expected it to be from other reviews.",6,5,8,6 October 2012
Spectre," Like many contemporary blockbusters, no attempt to think outside the box
","Watching 'Spectre' feels familiar. In fact, at times it is all too familiar. When the credits rolled, my overall impression was that I had been served a 'Best of Bond' compilation. Every scene, with the exception of just a few, reminded of a classic Bond film, the script reminded of classic Bond films, the villain, the gadgets, the cars You get my drift. The result is well-made and entertaining, but no more than that. There are no surprises and there are only few memorable moments.I cannot give this more than a 7 because I base my scores on how often I would like to watch a movie again. Since this already felt like I had seen it all before during its first viewing, I can only give it a score that means 'I would only want to watch this again maybe once or twice'.Spectre seems to suffer from the same problem of creative stagnation as many a contemporary blockbuster: it feels as if someone trained a large neural network by feeding it all the existing material, and then asked it to generate something similar. The result is merely a linear combination of what is already known. There is no attempt to break outside the established box. This is playing it safe, but it will never produce a 'wow' factor that makes people recommend the film as a must-see. If the next few films are made according to the same recipe, the public will lose interest in Bond films altogether.The bottom line is, if you want to watch a Bond film as you know it, Spectre will not disappoint. If you want to experience something new however, you will be disappointed.",7,1,6,17 February 2016
