Ford v Ferrari," Keeps You Alive Till The End!
","Ford V Ferrari this reminded me of how great are biographical movies are, i don't know where to start but in my views this doesn't lack in anything for me, the story of the movie gets us back to the life of many racers that wrote history, well i needed 30 minutes to get into the movies atmosphere till i know Who is who? What are they doing? When the structure was completely built, what i liked most is you don't get lost with the movie it can express itself easily such a well done editing the movie just kept me alive and i was linked to it really, there was really a tug of war between the two great characters (Matt Damon) and (Christian Bale) Christian really outshines Matt, i didn't know how i flew over time because a two and half hour movie is long, ending felt so sad to me situations really changed from first to last, i like cars but am not into racing cars but i am glad i got knowledge more on them how things are going on, highly recommended even if you are not into cars, 10/10⭐",10,1,3,10 March 2020
Source Code," Sci-Fi Fans Hands Up!
","Source Code i feel like this is a bit overrated not the greatest out there but it still feels good, it proofs a bit of a different story but it just doesn't amaze me, its not such a mystery thing to me, scripts such as this must have a bit of shocking moments, (Jake Gyllenhaal) he is really worth it to see him in movies, a forgettable good Sci-Fi movie, if you are up for a Sci-Fi put it on, 6/10⭐",6,0,1,26 January 2020
Deepwater Horizon," Amazing!
","Deep water horizon delivers what it was, the story based on the true events of deepwater horizon oil spill that exploded, well at first 30 mins was just getting into the story and building the characters i was waiting to reach the point when will the things were going to start, after all it got me into its atmosphere and catching up with the scenes, amazing cinematography with all those explosion and fires burning behind the scenes, discovering the life of those workers kinda gets hard to watch how people are dealing with those things, seeing people between life hope and survival, at the ending it was sad to see all those workers had lost their lifes, at last its well crafted, highly recommended if you like disaster types, 7.5/10⭐",7,0,0,13 December 2019
Train to Busan," First Korean Movie!
","Train To Busan (There are those that sacrafice their lives for others and Those that risk everyone for their lives), totally this was a whole new experience for me, my first korean movie opening a whole new world to korean movie universe, i watched this with a English subtitles didn't have any problems with it, the events of the movie is so well paced its going at the same rate one straight line, every character in the movie was worthy really loved the mains and other secondaries, feeling the atmosphere with the characters in an apocalyptic zombie world, having sadness,love,hope moments a great mix of it, every zombie movie fans should watch this, 8/10⭐",8,2,4,11 February 2020
Memento," Use Your Brain!
","Memento (So Where Are You), its just a normal story told in a way that anyone wouldnt think of it, the most interesting thing about this movie its the way how its told, like do you wanna watch a movie inversely Ex: from the ending to start, well that what makes you feel different from others, this how the director wanted it to be, this is a piece of unique material found in cinematic world, from the start you have the conclusion but you need to discover why why and why things went this way, every single scenes that appears makes you to ask yourself questions many and many questions till the end until the puzzle is solved even after seeing the puzzle as a solved thing you still have questions its really complicated in terms of how its made that makes the watcher confused, i wasn't rushed nor confused to see what the ending delivers i was just calm with it since everything i saw means something to find something, i truly believe this is a unique art of cinematic world, its told in away thats not original itself is a pure original, there could be many different theories from others prescriptive but its justified well as what it is, it leads the watcher to feel confused and uncertain about what they saw, i searched and read many things on the story about how it went on until i got the results that things were on point, at last its rare thats created by original ideas we might not see things like that again, highly recommended, 10/10⭐",10,1,2,19 January 2020
Captain Marvel," Enjoy The Story!
","Captain marvel too late on this but i will be short, so what does it deliver, the movie tells us the real story behind the things that just happend why wars went on, its the reactant for the (Marvel Cinematic Universe), its really a good introduction for whats behind the scene, building the charachter of Nick Fury its where all the things started here, there are some good laughable scenes, Obviously if you are a marvel fan you will enjoy this, 7.5/10⭐",8,3,6,20 January 2020
The Babadook," Worth The Budget!
","The Babadook i believe this wasn't my type i could skip it but still needed to watch it after seeing the hype, i didn't really like the villain of the story if it was supernatural it was way better than this thing, (Essie Davis) acting as the mad mom liked her but didn't like the kid (Noah Wiseman) i was disturbed when he was in the scenes, this is a success for a (Australian-Movies) that's made on a budget of (2 million dollars) but unfortunately it was not a commercial success, at last it's ok but not everyones choice as a horror, 6/10⭐",6,1,1,4 March 2020
Knives Out," One Investigator Is Enough!
","Knives Out Crime/Mystery movies are so entertaining for the viewer, it's a combination of 5 Genres that the movie tastes them all, at the early beginnings i was lost with the characters a bit so you need to keep your attention to them because it's your responsiblty to catch the murder, i do like those movies that we the viewers take prediction and keep our informations to know who did that this brings suspense to it, this is such a great thing to see Captain America (Chris Evans) in movies like that we need this guy to drop more on all other genre's and James Bond (Daniel Craig) is such awesome to see him agian on this both of them are fully talented, despite this movie being a great crime/mystery movie let's not forget the director/writer (Rian Johnson) well done we must all appreciate the guy and one more amazing news is that we will have Knives Out 2 for the future so lets wait and see what he is gonna do next, the ending well to be honest i wasn't suprised that much but things that were told were really on point, highly recommended this movie doesn't disappoint you, 8/10⭐",8,0,1,13 March 2020
The Irishman," Original Feels!
","The IrishMan (Trust can be gotten hard so just doesn't lose it easily), this will be my longest movie i have ever seen, so this is based on the true story of (I Heard You Paint Houses) by (Charles Brandt) surrounding the life of american mobster (Frank Sheeran), movies like this can't be done every year with this great adult characters i have the feeling we can't see this again, but it just needs the viewers attention and energy for it to keep you on the story it's a detailed story, i wish they could make this a 5 hour mini series or more because when you look at the 3 hour 29 minutes the viewer will feel energy less in a movie form, i liked it for the story i liked it for the character that is just amazing but i didn't like it for the runtime i finished it with two days, it's slow at times but it just really feels good to watch those guys, i completely liked the ending, a well crafted classic movie that is built on a huge budget of 159 million dollars, but it never really built my special atmosphere that much, am sure old guys will enjoy this movie so much, 7/10⭐",7,2,4,1 March 2020
Orphan," Creepy!
","Orphan If i watched this movie at 2009 back to it's release time i surely would enjoy it much more than now, whenever i looked at the poster of the movie i was disturbed and really liked to know what's behind the movie, i expected something like supernatural horror but no and i wasn't shocked what i got, Is it really that scary? It is creepy and more thriller but no horror, the remarkable thing of this movie is the unforgettable performance of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) she does her role much more than she is supposed to do and (Vera Farmiga) i personally like her and want to see her on the screen after what she has done in (The Conjuring Universe), the movie is 2 hours but it had a rushed ending that they cutted the ending to me there needed to be more of the ending than what we all had throughout the movie, i can't say this was something new for me but it was ok from what the story is, recommended if you like (Vera Farmiga), 6/10⭐",6,0,0,7 March 2020
Snatch," Collection Of Many Legends!
","Snatch dont have much to say on this, a mix of many advanced charachter in their occupation, with a easy consumed plot, a real fun of actings, laughable scenes, and a entertaining accent, (Brad Pitt)s accent was one of the enjoyable part of it acting as a gypsy, highly recommended, 8/10⭐",8,0,1,18 January 2020
The Thing," Read It Yourself And Decide!
","The Thing so this will be my oldest movie i have seen but i don't got any knowledge what old movies are like, a bit over hyped really but it's still fresh in the box, before watching it i thought it was a spiritual horror style but no, am not into Sci-fi but it does really have a taste with horror, so is (The Thing) really that good? Yes it's but no need to make it much bigger than itself, the plot is enjoyable but i didn't like the sad ending it had it didn't get to any real conclusion, no it's not that horrific it had just a simple feel with it, soundtrack was calming and what i noticed it was a quiet movie not so many dialogues, so 1.5$ million was spent on Rob Bottin's creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form yes the creature was well crafted but nothing to worry about, i can just recognize Kurt Russell from the cast he is so good there loved him acting the role, at last it's one of the classic Sci-fi movie i enjoyed recommended for the Sci-fi fans, 7.5/10⭐",8,0,0,29 February 2020
The Shining," Classic Horror!
","The Shining i am not shocked, i thought i will have real nightmares with it but no i was wrong, so with the story begins it's easy to go on with it but at the end of the road when the plot-twist comes you will be left with a bunch of questions, the character of (Jack Nicholson) no one can deny the greatness of him for the role because i just discovered this will be my top acted character i have ever seen i have never ever seen anyone like him before, a true legend discovered he is really the point of how great the movie was, the mom (Shelley Duvall) i believe i didn't like her that much but she just did her job and (Danny Lloyd) pretty awesome at that age,
as i read i do believe the fact the director (Stanley Kubrick) was very cautious with the movie he just wanted to keep the movie as good as he wanted in his stylish because many things were changed and missing according to (Stephen King)s novel obviously he was against it as he says: (Stephen King) was quite disappointed in the final film. While admitting that Stanley Kubrick's visuals were stunning, he said that was surface and not substance. He often described the film as 'A fancy car without an engine.'), so is the shining really that horrific? No it's not that horrific it's actually more psychological that really stresses the viewer with it's simple scenes i believe how much simple the movie was but it's really stressful good job it's not relying on any jumpscares, another thing i liked most the soundtrack that just doesn't let you feel safe, i enjoyed every scene and second of the movie till the last minute, by the way i watched the (119 minutes) version that a lot of scenes were taken out i watched the deleted and cutted scenes on youtube i wish they weren't cutted out because they were very detailed, perhaps my thoughts would have been different if i watched this movie at it's time, highly recommended for a classic horror movie, 9/10⭐",9,1,3,4 March 2020
Now You See Me," Now You Have To Watch This!
","Now you see me know this is worth your time, magician's have not been on my screen but this proofs to me they are worth it for my screen to surprise me what they can offer to me, i can describe this movie by a couple of words tricky surprising and shocking, well you will see how the magicians will trick you and you will be surprised by seeing how they are doing it the revealing part of the magic is so enjoyable, the only main word that this movie is playing around is entertainment this all what you need, the cast is so supportive for the movie, sometimes your logic might not work for the events that you are guessing what's gonna happen just wait and see how its burning, highly recommended if you are ready for some entertainment, 8/10⭐",8,0,0,25 January 2020
It Follows," Sex scenes ruined it
","It follows why why why this film based on sex scenes couldnt they find out something better to go on with the story the sex scenes really ruined the movie, the movie shows us its potential really, it was a decent movie and a decent plot, really great story and a new plot, they just feared me with their psychological type of horror no need of demons and kinda things really appreciate it, not a slow burning neither fast or rushed up, even until like 30 mins i didnt know what was happening, 3 points you need to know from this, 1st it had a interesting plot 2nd it had a calm atmosphere the movie was so quiet really loved it 3rd it aint rushed up the scenes are going one by one so calmly no need to hurry, and another thing bothered me why wasnt there explanation for what was happening it looked odd to me, acting ok with the teenagers, there were really plot holes if you think, were there parents that ignorant that they didnt know what was happening, all the teenagers were acting by their selves it was mainly focused on them, i really hate it when they cut out the ending why there wasnt a ending with a point probably there isnt gonna be because there wasnt explanation for what was happening, and it was made on a budget of 2 million dollars really accept it how they kept it simple, for me this was a decent and great plot but as i mentioned i had some serious compliments that could make this movie alot better, i enjoyed my calm quiet part really was great for me, 7/10⭐",7,0,3,10 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Special Movie For Special People!
","Once Upon a time... in Hollywood is a art to drama genre, i am not a fan of long movies but this was the one that kept me engaged till the end, yes at first i needed sometime to get into the movie atmosphere until then i was leashed till the end, i think there wasn't much of story as i know there was nearly like (2 hours) of the movie event happend in one day or more in a detailed way such good backstories and all things happen fast at the last 50 minutes but you won't be lost with it, when you hear names of (Leonardo DiCaprio) and (Brad Pitt) what greatness comes to your mind as long as Leonardo was great in the lead role Brad is also the same as the supporting actor but this remains to you who you liked more i personally liked Brad more such a powerful acting from the guy, the role of (Margot Robbie) that was added was such another beautiful thing we aren't focusing on such main character there are others too to care for, one of the point that i mainly liked the movie is the calmness the way the movie expresses itself there are movies that are long,boring and you don't understand anything but this was such a simple thing, it does return us to the (1960)s where it recovers the life of that times, setup for everything thing in the movie is classic it's the movie that fits detail to it's scenes colorfull and premium feels, so our two main characters were fictional at the ending i was waiting the real event to happen but it just didn't couldn't they deliver the realistic event? even if you have two main characters i think it would be such better but here's the point it's a movie so it's ok, i couldn't believe the fact how time flew didn't feel how it finished, am sure everyone doesn't enjoy this but every movie enthusiasts surely enjoys it, highly recommended if you have patience with movies, 9/10⭐",9,1,2,7 March 2020
Aladdin," Worth It!
","Aladdin this movie is fun to watch, the presence of this movie is needed to be out there giving back life to Aladdin animation movies, i don't care if this is precise to the story or not what i care i enjoy this movie as a Adventure/Fantasy movie, before watching it i thought all the leads were played by amateurish characters beside (Will Smith) but no every character has done their best, Why i liked it? Middle eastren culture setup and the soundtrack were good too, highly recommended if you enjoy folk tales, 7/10⭐",7,0,0,15 March 2020
The Imitation Game," Creative!
","The Imitation Game (Alan Turing): (Are you paying attention? Good. If you are not listening carefully, you will miss things. Important things. I will not pause, I will not repeat myself, and you will not interrupt me. You think that because you're sitting where you are, and I am sitting where I am, that you are in control of what is about to happen. You're mistaken. I am in control, because I know things that you do not know), one of the best biographical movies i have seen that leaves it's feelings to the viewer, so What Is The Movie? It's based on the life of (Alan Turing) the (English-Mathematician) and (Computer-Scientist) that solved the engima to break the code of german communication, i do like history i do like war i do like facts i do like what's behind everything! and this is one of them a true inspirational story, (Benedict Cumberbatch) is impressive taking the role i don't think there's anyone better than him for the role, the story of it is adopted really good directing is well done too, it does really have meaningful dialogues, at last i will end it with a couple of quotes, (Alan Turing)(Some people thought we were at war with the Germans. Incorrect. We were at war with the clock.), (Joan Clarke): (I think, that sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things no one... can imagine.), highly recommended if you like to discover untold stories, 8/10⭐",8,0,0,4 March 2020
Prisoners," Too long
","Wow and wow and why and why what a waste this was why did they made such a long movie why didnt they just cut it of made it shorter what was they doing and btw the original version was 3hrs😂 they cut it to 2.33, Slow burning i wasnt bored to be real but almost went crazy with the suspects not to confess it made the plot slower i didnt find this a mystery, from the beginning i waited for brilliant ideas and interesting things to happen in it but we didnt got any, i didnt fill loved with any charachter this is 100/100 overrated it also got fame just cuz hugh jackmen didnt now who he was till know that he is a DC character, and other guy and all the acting of hugh from beginning till end we saw him but we didnt really know what happened to him at end did he survive or no, Ye we got the plot we its kidnapping there are much better than this and before i watched this i thought it was about 2 guys escaping from prison on the cover found it really interesting but didnt got it. 6.5/10⭐",7,1,2,28 August 2019
Midsommar," Are You Ready To Discover a Cult!
","Midsommer this has to be 2019s most wonderful movie shot, i am not a fan of long movies the runtime on this is (2hr & 27mins) i didnt pause the movie for a second it kept me to my seat and watching till the end, when i first heard about this and after checking it i knew it was gonna be a strange and weird movie since its been produced by (A24 Films) after (Hereditary)s from 2018 same produced by them that felt some boring and wasnt much of a story what horror genre wants i felt nervous about this but i still wanted to see it and i am glad i watched it, this is categorized as a 4 genres Drama,Horror,Mystery,Thriller, it gave each genre a taste of it so its really a good combination, it might not give you a total horror but each a bit of it, still ain't horrific its more like a psychological horror, its slow burning yea but it didnt feel to me its not everyones choice to watch if you are a horror fan u might not consume this, one of the most important thing it had was its gorgeous cinematography the location of this movie was one of the main points that keeps you at the edge of your seat, it keeps you to be engaged and to be interested more and more of the nature you want to see and makes you calm with it, there isn't much of story it feels you are waiting for something interesting to happen but it doesn't lead to it completely, preformed well by the main roles good job, i truly believe this one of the intresting movies to watch nowdays and a great job from (A24 Films), i can define this movie as a emotionally disturbing that puts stress on the watcher, highly recommended for psychological horror fans, 9/10⭐",9,3,11,20 January 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Lots of watchers
","Drag me to hell obviously overrated, too much hype from critics and lot of watchers for the movie, fast fast fast 7 minutes your into the movie, you will be haunted by the old women, they just didnt let us relax with too many jumpscares every scenes it gotta be there, the old women was so weird with her vomiting, the story wasnt good enough for me and the main character just rushed up there act the scenes with some jumpscares and leave, wasnt long and wasnt bored, it had a great budget too 30 million dollars they could made something better than this, it doesnt lack of anything, it just lacks of story, acting wasnt that great it was average, at least the characters werent beginners, ending i was waiting for something to happen it just happened but that didnt excited me much, i wont say goodjob nor great movie, for me they just spent money on visuals of the demons, its ok wont recommend it to anyone if your a fan of jumpscares then give it a go, 6/10⭐",6,0,1,9 September 2019
Mystic River," Lives The Atmosphere!
","Mystic River everything is done here no lacking but i got a few issues with it, before watching it i just knew this movie was hyped well so this is why i was pushed to watch it, a (2hr&18min) movie that is unnecessary to me to be a slow burner i wasn't bored from it i totally enjoyed it till the end but the things needed to be done faster, this movie doesn't deliver it's surprising revealing at the ending that i waited for i had suspects but i just needed to see how things went on and when it does deliver it that i had a feeling that things would turn to another way and that it did i wasn't suprised at all, a special thing about it is it's remarkable acting of (Sean Penn), in total this is a plain Crime/Drama/Mystery that lives all the genre's, highly recommended if you are a fan of the genre's, 7/10⭐",7,0,0,20 March 2020
12 Years a Slave," Its good!
","12 years a slave first of all humanity, emotional and sadness in every aspect of the movie, its based on a true story, the life of solomon northup, the movie had a oldy atmosphere, the story was told on point it was told the way how it was in real, good job they made a biography of solomon northup, the story told us what Solomon went through because of slavery, under all circumstances he just survived, well human is not a toy to be played by others, thats what slavery does to others, imagine how people were before differentiating between colors, just because they are black or whatever that doesnt make them to live by others order, well we saw how slavery was before how people lived under orders of others how laws were before, gladly it has changed by now, well the main character wasnt there with his heart really he didnt feel that he was away from his family, he just acted as a slave he kinda wasnt fighting for his freedom, the dialogues werent that good i didnt feel powerful, i didnt feel energetic for what were they saying, i didnt feel their souls burning, but they showed us what was happening, the movie was slow burning wasnt bored from it but it felt long, at the ending were solomon returns to his family i dont feel any big or surprised impressions from others it lacked really, like after 12 years being away from others why wont the other characters cry, why they dont feel whats happening, and it showed us that this things happened in 12 years i felt it was like 12 days, we didnt notice any aging from Solomon, at last i wont recommend it to anyone unless your a hardcore movie watcher and want to discover about histories or biographies, btw this was my first slavery movie, i kinda discovered more what happened, though the movie was good but too many postive views on it from every side, a good adaptation of the story, NO TO SLAVERY, 7/10⭐",7,0,0,19 September 2019

Inception," Rare!
","Inception think of what you dreamt think of what you are dreaming think of what you are gonna dream deeper deeper and deeper and count time as the most precious thing, well thats what the movie was according to me, the story made up of brilliant genius confusing rushed dont know what was happening what was the point from what they were doing things come out at sudden it was a mess but delivered what it was, it was something beyond of what we think of, a rare movie with its complexity, characters thats a joke if we talk about characters because there is all what you need, Cillian Murphy was a star there liked him more than Leonardo, Tom Hardy added extra suspense, all the characters were 💎, the movie run time wasnt long its just like feed me more, ending Umm think twice before you decide what just happened, not recommended to all if you are looking for a strange movie and wanna use your mind or looking for tricks then hands up just run for it, 9/10⭐",9,0,0,27 September 2019
Parasite," Its Top For What It Really Is!
","Parasite first don't expect something beyond your thinking (Connection between human and money) this is top in drama category, Oscars Worthy? Hmm yes it is, what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn't lose it's value the original script that doesn't fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn't leave any real plot holes, showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting, emotional, and unexpected series of events from the three sides, surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings, wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes, if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category, every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie, highly recommended for drama fans, 9/10⭐",9,1,4,28 February 2020
Mother!," When You Define The Word (Philosophy)!
","Mother this the feeling when you feel something is wrong no i don't feel ok with what's happening but you just don't know what's really happening, from the beginning your strange feelings will build because the story is special and not ordinary the story doesn't know what it's clearly playing around i can feel the viewers feeling because i am sure the viewer is gonna be confused with it, the director didn't know what he was doing even if this movie means too much for him it was like he was planting something with out knowing it was a bomb, What's the main message from it? After god created humans humanity has gone! I don't know what's your real message from it, I was worried with the ending What conclusion am i gonna be left with? after what i saw because it didn't built anything infront of me, directing is a reason that makes it special i was a bit annoyed with the close up scenes but it was built on it, (Jennifer Lawrence) acted a superb performance like a completely new planet shines in the sky (Ed Harris) i like the guy i got more excited with him, let me make it clear surely everyone doesn't enjoy this either you will find it as a piece of art or you will hate it simple rule, this is something unusual i find this movie so rare and unusual maybe there aren't any like this one, i personally find it good in aspects because this is like the only and one type of diamond on earth, the same time i don't like it i have a feeling that i like it so i am in the middle it was a challenging movie for me it's sorta challenging for everybody, i won't say highly recommended this time it depends on your soul with it i can't recommend something that i don't know what's in your soul, 6.5/10⭐",7,0,5,20 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Wants To Be Both At One Time!
","Jojo Rabbit tries to introduce the scenes in a funny way but it's not comedy at all, after going 1 hour into the movie the last 30 minutes of the movie was the time i knew i liked the movie, at first it tries to be funny but then the events change to sadness, so here is the question would it have been better if the comedy was excluded? I can say yes if it was going on the drama line the story would been more emotional and sadness that would been more effective on our feelings what if no staying on what it is i appreciate how good it is but comedy is not there, The three main characters good job the kid Jojo (Roman Griffin) easily goes into our heart the girl Elsa (Thomasin Mckenzie) proofs her worthy and the mom Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) needs to drop more on drama genre and all others were greatly appreciated, the movie can keep you alive with it's colourful and great setup, the ending of it liked it after the character growth was done from first to last,
at the end it's like a (2 in 1) taste, highly recommended for drama fans, 8/10⭐",8,0,0,5 March 2020

","Midway it doesn't let the viewer to relax every gap and scene filled with war actions that's what we want, at the early beginning that i wasn't expecting to start out fast it did and keeps you leashed till the end of the road, it was good didn't need any extra introduction and knowing the characters just dropping on the scenes, (2hr & 18mins) of amazing colorful scenery visuals, keeps the viewer to be engaged in every moment won't let the viewer to sleep over it, top notch acting you will have 10 main amazing characters i can't count but (Ed Skrein) proofs his worth as the lead role and glad seeing (Patrick Wilson) really indescribable acting from all, everyone might not apperciate the (CGI) but it just suits it, generating a classic atmosphere with the beautiful setup, giving a history out there of WW2, entertaining for war movie fans that is really suspenseful, highly recommended, 8/10⭐",8,3,4,26 February 2020
Cube," Rubik Cube

The Social Network," Believing Is Seeing!
","The Social Network you know that (Mark Zuckerberg) is a billionaire but you don't know how! so this gets u back to the beginning, i don't find it as a inspirational movie but i find it as a imaginative movie, well obviously no one is a billionaire with out being a creative person so this shows our path of life we still need to go for something even if it means nothing for others, i can't deny that (Jesse Eisenberg) is a copy of Mark he always reminds me of Mark when i see him so no doubt he is the man of the role, What i liked about it? Is the pacing and a truly organized movie with the details for us you won't be lost with it so the directing and editing is a well done, i still imagine if things didn't went this way Would this guy still be a billionaire? This is unanswerable question i understand he was creative but What would the other path would lead? if it wasn't this way, i find biographical movies interesting so we need to take a look at this section because they always end up with a message for you, highly recommended if you want to experience others, 8/10⭐",8,0,1,22 March 2020

The answear must be no, well surely 100/100 money can't buy happiness but what this movie shows us is the happiness of goal reaching it's not about the money the guy gets happy with it's about the goal that he has set and reached it so that's why this movie relives our hard working feeling, lived happy and sad at the same moment i laughed a bit with it also but at the end i ended with the sadness and dialogues were really energetic, i don't know but i had this feeling that something was not there and i felt like the ending was a little bit rushed but i enjoyed it to fullest that was worth every moment, in total this a good lesson for everyone to watch it and experiencing the struggle with life, highly recommended for Drama genre this is the best out there, 9.5/10⭐",10,0,0,21 March 2020
