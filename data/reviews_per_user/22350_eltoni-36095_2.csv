3:10 to Yuma," Amazing
","Great western, the pace is great, generally the westerns have a slow pace, but in this one the pace is great. Bale is very good and Russel Crowe is outstanding, one of his best performances, Ben Wade is an enigma",10,2,3,20 April 2019
Black Panther," Awful
","Worst marvel movie that i have ever seen, and I am a marvel fanatic, but this one is really bad, can't believe that got nominated to best picture instead of infinity war, the Oscars are a joke",1,17,27,13 May 2019
