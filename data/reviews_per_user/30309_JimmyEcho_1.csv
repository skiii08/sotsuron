10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent
","The original Cloverfield film for me is a guilty pleasure. There are infinitely better monster films and marginally better found footage films, but I do quite enjoy the film for what it is. 10 Cloverfield Lane on the other hand is a terrific watch, John Goodman delivers an insane performance and I do like that it has it's tie in with the original, quite excited to see if this helps the franchise expand at all. This film came out of nowhere, I had no idea it had even been announced before it was already out in cinemas. I'd recommend not even watching a trailer before going into this one. Just so you're aware, I don't know much of film you'd probably be better checking out the other reviews for in-depth analysis.",8,1,2,29 August 2016
