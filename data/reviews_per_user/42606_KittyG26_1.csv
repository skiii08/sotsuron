Hereditary," Just the most awful rubbish
","Very, very slow, with no real build up of tension. I like subtlety in a horror film, but this was just dull. The story felt like they were making it up as they went along. You could have trimmed a good half hour off the running time with no loss.Annie's mother's grave is desecrated, and her corpse stolen, but no-one seems to care. Steve decides not to tell Annie 'so as not to worry her' but he does nothing about the vandalised grave at all. Surely any normal person would be hot-foot down to the cemetery, ringing the police department, etc? Surely.Then the 'Charlie with her head off' thing. Was the mother really so clueless that she would force her son (who was how old - 17, 18?) to take his 13 year old sister to a party? A thirteen year who acted like she was eight - making weird clucking noises all the time, while constantly fiddling with a pair of pliers and a doll? This kid needed therapy, not to go to a party. I also don't believe Peter wouldn't have made a lot more objection to taking her with him, either. Then Charlie decides to scoff some chocolate cake at the party, although she has a severe peanut allergy, and - naturally - doesn't carry her EpiPen with her. Cue anaphylaxis. Does Peter call emergency services, like, IMMEDIATELY? No, he decides to 'drive her to the hospital' from his friend's house, which seems to be located in the middle of nowhere. Does he even know where the nearest hospital is? The only good thing that came out of this piece of stupidity was that Charlie was a damn sight more interesting with her head off than she was with it on.After that, it's pretty much a downward slide, watching Toni Colette give one of the worst and most embarrassing performances I've ever seen, going off her rocker with grief, getting obsessed with the afterlife, etc, etc. I didn't realise that all you had to do to become a medium was light a candle and say a few words. Toni was so OTT that the people in the row in front of me started laughing every time she came on the screen, and I can't say I blamed them. Gabriel Byrne was just a lump - a lump who phoned in his performance; and Alex Wolff needs to get that mole removed - if it gets any bigger it'll need its own agent. It's even got whiskers sprouting out of it, for God's sake.I could go on, but I can't be bothered to spend any more time on this joke of a movie. Just the most awful rubbish. I'm so depressed I wasted my afternoon watching this. I'm mystified by the good reviews.",1,14,28,16 June 2018
