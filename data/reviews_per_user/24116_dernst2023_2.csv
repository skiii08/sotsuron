Your Name.," Not horrible, but didn't knock my socks off either
","I've seen quite a few Japanese movies. This one was just ok in my book. You know that feeling when you lose interest in a movie and wish it was over? That's how this movie was about 3/4 of the way through. It was compelling in some ways, but in the end it turned out to be mediocre. Think the 8.4 rating at this point is a bit high.",7,7,9,30 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," More leftovers.....
","I loved Rogue One. It has a freshness about it. This new edition was not as bad as The Force Awakens, but it was along the same vein. This is like going to grandmas for dinner and instead of a new meal she has reheated the meal from last week. This is what happens when a big studio takes over from the original creators. It is your typical big budget movie, made to play to the masses. Lots of catchy stuff but the true savor of the story is lost. Yes there were some cool parts to the movie, but it was not even close to a slam dunk. I won't be going to any more Star Wars movies until they come up with some new material that isn't simply capitalizing on the popularity of the original trilogy.",3,0,0,15 December 2017
