The Ring," FWIW, I liked it!
","I have to admit, watching the girls in the bedroom and listening to 'I hear there is a videotape that if you watch it, you die', made me slump down in my seat and prepare myself for a long, incredibly stupid movie. Before I knew it, I was swept in and couldn't stop watching. If you let go and don't over analyze it, you will enjoy it. It is after all only a movie.",Null,0,0,13 October 2002
