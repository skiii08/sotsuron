50 First Dates," Sandler's and Barrymore's best efforts to date!
","This may be one of the best most romantic perfect date movie ever made. Sandler and Barrymore give tour de force performances and two star crossed lovers.I felt this was an incredibly clever premise for a movie.  Henry Ross (Sandler) plays the ultimate playboy dawg in the history of the Hawaiian Islands, scamming and scoring on tourist women every chance he gets.  He works as the head vet at a sea life park.Lucy Whittmore (Barrymore) is a lovely, sweet, artistic woman with a slight personality flaw....she forgets everything that happens to her everytime she goes to sleep.  In her mind everyday, is her dad's (Marlin Whittmore, played impecibly by Blake Clark) birthday.  Her memory loss problem is the result of a car accident her and her dad were in on his birthday.Henry has to win Lucy's heart over again every day, somedays are better than others for them.I don't want to go more into the plot and spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet.The supporting cast of Blake Clark, Sean Astin and Rob Schneider fill out the movie and all deliver outstanding performances.On a scale of 10, I would give this an 11!  Guys, you want to impress your lady friend take her to see this one tonight, you won't regret it.",10,0,0,15 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas Recaptures Star Wars Magic
","As disappointing as Episode One was overall, Episode Two is that fantastic! From the Speeder chase through the skies of Courisant, to the eye dazzling final battle scene this movie had my heart pounding just like when I was 7 and saw Star Wars - A New Hope for the very first time.  Episode Two didn't suffer from the CGI overload that plagued it's predecessor.  The visual effects are an integral part of the story line, and almost take on the power of a lead actor or actress on the screen, without bludgeoning the audience into numbness.  Ewan McGregor seems very comfortable in his role as Master Kenobi, and steals the movie with an outstanding performance.  Despite Lucas's vision of this being the story of the raise and fall of Anakin, it is much more interesting to see Obi-Wan as a young man.  If you haven't seen this one yet, I would highly recommend it.  If you have seen it already, let me know next time you are going, I will chip in gas money.",8,0,0,15 July 2002
