Hereditary," If I could, I'd give it no stars.
","So slow! I I watched some of this on fast forward because it moved at a glacial pace. Actually glaciers seem pretty speedy compared to some of the scenes in this movie. I thought some of it had been filmed in slow motion,.Toni Collette gave a dreadful, over-acted hammy performance. Gabriel Byrne left me wondering why he had decided to be involved as both an actor and a producer.At least the exterior shots were good to look at. I can't say the same for the dreary interiors of the house - dirty, gloomy, dusty.Take my advice, give this one a miss, don't waste your time. At the very end, with the whole reason for this sad excuse for a movie revealed, I was sitting there thinking 'Youtook two hours to get to this?'.I believe there is a sequel just released. I won't bother.",1,2,6,4 September 2019
