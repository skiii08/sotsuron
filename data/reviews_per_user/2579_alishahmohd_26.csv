Airlift," A great movie which fantastically portrays the events of Kuwait Invasion
","Airlift is based on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in the year 1990, which resulted in the airlift of over 1 lac Indians, who were trapped in Kuwait because of the invasion. A rescue operation of this magnitude had never taken place before and may never take place again. And this entire movie perfectly portrays these events. We follow a business Tycoon named Katiyal, who at the start of a movie is a conniving individual, who will go to any lengths to earn a profit, he also thinks of himself in a league of own and does not really care about his subordinates or servants. Things change when the Invasion takes place, and the people start to get killed. Although the Iraqi soldiers were just killing the Kuwaitis, Indians and others were also being killed if their identities were not confirmed. Kaityal turns over a completely new leaf and now he is not only trying to escape Kuwait himself for the safety of his own family, but he is also trying to save more than 1 lac Indians who are trapped in Kuwait. And this does not just include his employees but other Indians trapped on Kuwait, who Katiyal does not even know. Katiyal goes to great lengths to get these Indians out of Kuwait, failing many times but never giving up hope. Although Katiyal could leave himself with his family, he simply refuses to abandon his people. Katiyal's character development throughout the movie is a huge high point, and Akshay Kumar plays his role perfectly. The other supporting characters in the movie who get screen time including Katiyal's wife and friends, Iraqi general, also stand out in their performances. the dialogue is also very well written, which leads to many memorable scenes. However, i do wish they could have explored a little bit more on how Kuwait was before the invasion, and a little more in-depth look into Katiyal's conniving businessman character. This would have made the movie and Katiyal's character development even better. Airlift is a fantastic, it is not your average Masala flick, but a more realistic movie based on a real life incident, with tremendous performances and acting by the cast, which will not only entertain you, but also inspire you and touch your heart.

Fight Club," Honestly did not enjoy this movie at all......
","Fight Club is regarded as a fantastic movie and it is currently rated in the IMDb top ten. I guess this was supposed to be a movie for a specific generation, or for the people who were actively watching films in 1999. I still to this day do not understand what all the fuss is about? Yes this film is different from the traditional action and drama films but just because its different, it doesn't mean its good let alone fantastic or a work of art. Now this movie is supposed to be a representation, imagination or fragmentation Edward Norton's character the unnamed narrator and the movie in almost its entirety is his imagination including all the characters you see appear in the film including Brad Pitt. So basically this movie follows the 'It was all a dream' concept where whatever you see is not real. I do not mind the idea if it is presented properly but this movie takes this concept to extremely ridiculous levels, where I have a hard time deciding if this film is supposed to be a drama film, an action film or fantasy.Fight Club has too many weird moments, unnecessary violence, Edward going bonkers and crippling and destroying another man during a fight for almost no reason at all. The film also has some disgusting scenes like the Fat guy with bigger chest than girls with implants that's disgusting, and made me want to turn off the film, not because there was a fat guy but I was disgusted how terrible this film portrays such people as if they are aliens. The plot is hardly a saving grace, it starts out promising, with people who are depressed are seeking help that could have been a good and interesting premise to base the film upon, but the more the plot progresses, the worse and the more ridiculous it gets. After the first 30 minutes this film was a torture to sit through. The ending was also nonsensical to me because I think the entire premise of this film is flawed from the start. The Narrator can't kill Tyler directly so he shoots himself so Tyler dies because Tyler was what Edward wanted to be. Whatever don't spend too much time thinking over that. The only saving grace is the acting of the lead actors Norton and Pitt. Edward Norton is really into the character at least he did the best he could with the script he was given to work with, despite all the ridiculous moments, Norton's good performance breathes some life into the movie. Brad Pitt also does a commendable job as Tyler although I did not like Tyler, I felt like Brad was at least trying. Never understood the love for this film, I have nothing against the people who like it I just don't understand where all the love comes from, in my personal opinion, Fight club is not a good film and is overrated.",5,6,15,18 November 2013
Memento," Amazing concept and execution.
","Memento has been out for over a decade, unfortunately I never to got to see this brilliant flick until a few months ago. I had no idea what I had been missing, I had read before about this movie and the concept seemed confusing to me and I had no idea how it would work. But when I actually got around to watching, I was absolutely mesmerized and I was glued to my seat from the beginning to the end. Part of me is glad that I watched this film so late because back in 2000 I was too young to understand what this film was trying to accomplish.Memento is an extremely unique film. When you watch a film you always are eager to see what happens next, you may have an idea about what may happen next, but you are still interested in seeing it. This film is the opposite, it makes you anticipate or interpret what had happened earlier. This movie moves in a reverse chronological order. It was done to make us see the movie from Leonard (Guy Pearce)'s perspective, as his character is suffering from Short Term Memory loss and has no idea what he is doing in a couple of minutes and has no idea what he did before. In normal films there is a room for interpretation because they are in a chronological order, this film however leaves you in a black hole and the further you get into the movie, the more you will be able to connect the missing movies.The film has two different sequences one sequence is thew story unfolding in reverse order, the other scenes are the black and white documentary scenes which are slow but give the film a realistic feel and make you understand what is in the mind of Leonard Shelby. And by the end both these sequences intersect.That is what is so brilliant about Memento, it makes you heavily think, invests you in the movie, makes you solve a puzzle, much like the puzzle the main character Leonard's is trying to solve. And by the end you will be able to join most of the missing pieces together. The movie also ends on a brilliant note as it leaves you thinking and leaves a lot of room for interpretation, about what happened. This will make you want to talk about this movie and thinking about it even after you have watched it. The replay value is also good, some scenes are so fantastic that you can watch again and again mainly the Teddy scenes which have excellent and funny dialog. The movie can also be watched from different perspectives, you can watch the movie in it's normal chronological order, which is not recommended because it ruins the fun. And you can also watch this movie based on the interpretation that Leonard's is trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle and that he is deluded person trying to escape reality. The storyline is not that amazing but it is the way it is told, like a puzzle is what makes it so great. The whole storyline remains a mystery till most of the movie unfolds. Acting wise this film is fantastic. Guy Pearce is fantastic in his role as Leonard Shellby, not only he is excellent to watch all the scenes, and he gets all the screen time and makes most of it. Leon's character was also brilliantly return how do you make a character with short term memory loss work, you give him notes photographs and tattoos to remember things so that he is not completely handicapped. Carrie Annie Moss gets little screen time but she does a great job in the amount of screen time she gets , many of her scenes with Pierce are actually fantastic. That leaves Joe Pantoliano who is fantastic in his role as teddy, his dialog delivery and humor is fantastic and he is extremely charismatic every-time he is on the screen he demands your attention. Some of his dialogs are the best in the entire movie. The soundtrack and the music also perfectly match the neo-noir atmosphere and environment of this filmThis is one of the older films of Christopher Nolan, and only shows how great his style is and how brilliant is direction. This movie which one of the earliest films Nolan made gives Nolan's other blockbuster films, the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception a great run for it's money. Do yourself a favor and watch Memento is a fantastic film and that will mesmerize, and once it is over you still be talking about and thinking about it fro a long time, that's how brilliant this film is.Overall Rating 10/10.",10,0,4,15 May 2014
The Others," A very good horror film with a spectacular conclusion
","When I first heard of The Others, I honestly was that not interested in watching it, it's premise seemed like a generic horror flick and the plot about a mother living with her photosensitive children alone in a large house or mansion sounded as generic as it gets. How many horror movies we have seen with families living in an abandoned Haunted mansion? The Others didn't seem that different even if the children were suffering from a rare illness or disease, it became hard for me to distinguish the Others from your average generic horror flick. All that was until I actually watched this great film was absolutely mesmerized with it.The film starts out slow, as you are introduced to the characters and the new servants are hired to work in the house and you are introduced to the children and find out about the rare disease they suffer from. As the plot unfolds and the film moves on, events start to unfold, some weird incidents and noises start to occur in the house making the mother, the children and the servants realize that they are not alone in the house, making them believe it is haunted. The plot keeps on unfolding when the unforeseen twist occurs in the end, which I honestly did not see coming at all. It was shocking and was so well handled and executed that it is in my opinion one of the best scenes in horror films even though the scene in retrospect is not that scary but it is the shock factor that makes that scene so great to watch.Performance wise, Nicole plays Grace, the mother of the two children perfectly, she is strict towards her children and tries to discipline them, but is also well protective of them and loves them deeply, she is also depressed about being cut off from the rest of the world due to her children's condition. Bertha Mills who plays the nanny does a fantastic job in her role as a kind old lady but there is something that always remains mysterious about her especially in the later part of the film where she behaves oddly and it seems like that she is up to something with the other servants.The boy who plays Nicolas was actually good in his role, a kid who is scared, and is a sort of a momma's boy who is deeply attached to his mother, and he is scared about the recent haunting in the house. That brings me to Alakina Mann the girl who play's Ann. She received nominations for her performance in this film and it is very well deserved. It is a one of best performances a child artist has done in a horror film, she can be funny, she can be mysterious and creepy, and can also play a serious role. All of which she does in this film. Ann's character was extremely deep and the actress who played her did her job as perfectly as she can. The rest of the cast also performs well and serve well in their roles.Overall, before the watched the Others, I was thinking about watching just another horror film but I was so wrong, this is a fantastic film, with several scary parts and creepy scenes, a slow but well developed plot and a spectacular twist which will leave you in awe and leave you talking about it for days, and make you watch the entire film entirely from a different perspective.Overall Rating: 9/10.",9,5,6,23 August 2014
The Prestige," Great movie with some flaws.
","First off, I want to say that when I was young, I used to visit circus a lot and a lot of events which showcased Magic Tricks, I was even enthralled and excited at such events being held at my school. I was also interested and learning Magic Tricks and showing them to my friends and parents. There is nothing to be ashamed about in this case, a lot of people watched Magic as kids. The basic premise of the Prestige is just perfect for my taste as it is about Magic Tricks and two Magicians.When I first heard about the Prestige, i thought it was some kind of a wizard movie with real magic, People having a reason for flying and transporting simple for no real reason other than it's REAL MAGIC. Luckily when I did more research I was glad that it was actually more realistic and based on Magic Tricks. This movie tells you about the life of Magicians back in the late 1800s, Magic meant everything to them they were obsessed with their tricks and they felt revealing their tricks would ruin them. Secrets were everything to them. The setting of the movie mind you in fantastic, the visuals, the areas, the clothes and even the *FUNNY* accents kind of suit the setting. A rivalry between two magicians which starts as a personal one turns more into a obsessive and professional one as one gets obsessed with the secret behind the other's trick and wants to prove he is the better magician.The plot is very good overall, but the movie can and will get confusing because the timeline is not depicted well, when you are watching the Long Past, the recent past or the present, things will get confusing and there is not text guiding you to understand which year you are in. This will cause the viewer to mix things up and he will lose attention. The story would have greatly benefited from a chronological order or at least a proper descriptions of the years. The plot also starts out extremely slow and drags out till the rivalry actually starts.Acting wise, the film is excellent, Hugh Jackman is awesome as Angier or the Great Danton, he is just natural in his acting, Christian Bale gives a great performance, many may find his character confusing and hard to understand at first but it will all come to ahead, his fake accent is not good though. Michael Caine is great and actually has a natural accent. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.I also feel like that an addition of such a Sci-Fi dimension kind of hurt the movie, not only it is not exactly believable if the time period is taken into consideration a more logical explanation would have worked better. The secrets of Bale and Angier serve as the twists of the movie. Angier's was disappointing whereas Bale's was something I saw coming a few minutes before it took place. After a second watch it is laughable how many clues were there, perhaps more analytic and deep thinkers would have seen it coming a mile away, and I won't be surprised if they actually did. The twists are not exactly a strong suit.The ending however had a good, clear and true message, we do not exactly always look for the secrets behind the tricks, because doing that ruins the trick and we won't want to see it anymore, that is exactly why the secrets are a magicians life. Few flaws aside prestige should see, any Nolan fan, Bale or Jackman, movie fans or even people who used to enjoy magic tricks at various shows should watch this great movie, few minor flaws aside, you are in for a great treat. Overall 8/10.",8,0,0,4 January 2014
American Hustle," Fantastic performances & settings carry an above average narrative
","American Hustle is a movie based in the 1970s and is about a real life operation called ABSCAM which took place during the same time period. And just like most films based on real life events this movie does not do everything in accordance to what happened in real life. For instance in the real event Bradley Cooper's character did not play such a role in the operation they were many other feds involved. Now what this film does is that it tries to be a black comedy while also trying to be a serious movie, for me it actually works, it will make you laugh at several scenes and the serious scenes will make you understand the seriousness off the situation and grasp your attention. The movie started out excellently, with a pretty funny scene between Bale and Cooper arguing and then playing a great song from it's fantastic soundtrack, while rolling the opening credits. The beginning was done so well, that it had me hooked to the rest of film, I probably wouldn't have been interested in the slow back-story scenes that followed, if it wasn't for this great start. After this the film does some comedy scenes, some serious scenes and many songs as a routine while carrying the plot at a very very slow pace. What is a huge negative is that the film moves at an extremely slow pace and this story, which is not that interesting could have been told in a much shorter time. While I was happy with the conclusion, the overall plot/narrative was not that great, its setting, atmosphere and most importantly the performances are what carried this film. Christian Bale, man I don't know what to say, he is extremely dedicated to any film he is in and any role he plays, he gained over 40 pounds and got a huge tummy for this movie, and this is the same guy who lost over 60 pounds for the Machinist and also lost weight for the fighter. And he is always completely into his characters. His performances in the sequels of Batman films were good but from what i have seen he has done so much better, his fans should do themselves a favor and watch his non Batman films to see how great of an actor he really is. I must say I liked his performance the best out of the cast.Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, I haven't seen her Hunger games film but she is extremely charismatic and keeps you interested and keeps you listening and pay attention every time she is on the screen. Amy Adams does a serviceable job, she looks good in this film and her dresses are hot, her acting and dialogs are OK, apart from some scenes where she actually is really good. Her English accent was kind of bad though but maybe that was on purpose. I never considered Bradley a good actor but he kind of impressed with his performance, some people call him a weak link, I think he did a good job, yes he acts all goofy and silly and he acts all naive sometimes, but he is playing a naive power hungry fed anyway. Plus he gives this film a good comic relief believe it or not, his facial expression at the end of the film was just hilarious. Jeremy Renner also did a good job. De Niro's was awesome in his short cameo wish he had a more expanded role. The minor characters did well.The film does a great job of recapturing the environment of the settings with it's awesome screenplay and setting, clothes, environments, everything is done so well. Apart from the performances I just love, love this film's soundtrack every song fits the scenes and they are all nice to listen, the soundtrack is one of the highlights of this movie, I absolutely loved the songs 'The Dirty Work', 'Horse With No Name' and 'Long Black Road'. Overall I enjoyed the American Hustle, it is a great film in my honest opinion. Does it deserve all the Oscars and praise it has gotten, debatable, but this was an enjoyable film and had the narrative been stronger, shorter and moved at a faster pace, it would have only made this film better than it already is.

American Psycho," Violence for the sake of violence
","American Psycho is highly regarded on IMDb, many have listed it in their favorite movies lists, this movie is based on the book by the same name. But I just don't understand what's so good about it. American Psycho is basically a story about a man who goes on a rampage killing everyone for no apparent reason, apparently he is a sociopath, a psychopath, a man who has mood disorders or multiple personality disorder or something else which is never made clear. One time before killing he has a sudden change of heart and chooses not to kill. He just doesn't kill but completely mutilates the bodies of the victims and cuts them to pieces and displays them in his second house which he uses for most of killings.Now I enjoy stories about serial killers, and Bateman shares many of their antics and method of operations, which is a plus point for me, I have also read stories and articles about serial killers and investigations, and also watched movies like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en which were both fantastic mind you. But while those films were very violent they had a meaning behind the killings, in this films there is no excuse or reason for Bateman's actions other than he is mentally unstable. Perhaps some therapy sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist could have been used to make all this seem clear and find out what is really in his head and what's going on in his mind. Many directors alter the stories in movies as compared to the book so why not? The main part which bothers me is the investigation part, Bateman kills so many people in the film but apparently the cops don't care about investigating the whereabouts, finding out what happened and find out who maybe involved, gather a list of suspects, perhaps try to find Bateman's house where many people went missing, other movies based on serial killers had this aspect but it is missing in American Psycho? It could have seriously made this film more fun to watch. Instead we have one detective who investigates the disappearance of Bateman's business rival but still finds nothing after his minor and very brief appearances.The cops in the climax come after Bateman in force and overpower forcing him to escape, take refuge and confess all killings to his lawyer, but the cops did not go after him because of all the murders but because he shot an old lady who saw him trying to kill a cat. Right!. Then we are left with a wonderful twist in the ending that the murders were all Bateman's imagination. Bateman's flat where he did the serial killing was empty up for sale and not even his, apparently he killed no one all this was in his head. Again the 'it was a dream' concept used to get rid of the cop investigation aspect. The director of the film said that she did not want the people to think it was all Bateman's imagination, but honestly that is the only way to analyze the ending otherwise the ending makes no sense to me at all. No matter how you analyze the ending, dream or no dream the film's overall plot is boring and the ending is nothing we haven't seen before. One way or the other this movie will confuse the hell out of you to decide what is real and what is Bateman's imagination. Bateman's conversations with the investigator were they real? Was his assistant being in his flat real or not? Bateman attempting to attack that homosexual businessman in the toilet was that also real or all in his head? Seriously this movie messes with your head. Movies like the Usual Suspects and even Fight Club which follow a similar concept, made it all perfectly clear by the end.Other than Bateman's serial killing the movie is filled with a lot of boring dialogue which is too cliché and almost painful to sit through, that dialogue bores me out of my mind and is not even a contributing factor to any of his killings apart from one perhaps, when he kills a businessman. The Investigator and Bateman's conversations are also nothing special. Bateman also spills out random threats for no reason but the people pretend they did not hear him as if he did not say anything, which ends up looking stupid. Christian Bale's performance in the only saving grace of this film as he is really into the Bateman character and is given almost all the screen time, the other's are honestly nothing special and only there to fill a gap. Obviously if you enjoy tons of violence in films and the gore you will also find it as a high point, I don't, I am fine with violence but not only this is too much, there is no real meaning behind it all but the ending makes it all meaningless. I don't understand why this film is so highly regarded. Maybe the book makes things more clear and may make an interesting read but this film was a chore to watch in my opinion.Overall: 4/10",4,0,1,20 November 2013
American Beauty," A work of art.
","I watched this movie a around 5 years ago for the first time, and after I finished watching it, after struggling for around 2 hours, I reached the verdict that it had a boring plot, and the idea of a married man with a teenage daughter wanting to get it on with a girl his daughter's age was disgusting. After recently re-watching American Beauty, I can't believe how wrong I was back then. I guess it's more of an age thing, this is one of those films that would grow on you with every viewing, the more you watch it the more you will appreciate it, this is not a simple movie, it requires a lot of thinking and touches on a lot of subjects. Subjects like homosexuality, midlife crisis, homophobic, smoking pot, disciple, work out, physical attraction, real state businessman & more. All these subjects are also shown in a more positive light. But most of all this film shows us how beautiful the world really is.The plot follows different characters who are involved in all these social subjects. The movie is also very well acted as if the actors portraying the characters are the characters themselves. Kevin Spacey is absolutely brilliant as Lester, he perfectly portrays a man who is going though a midlife crisis, a boring life like he is a prisoner & getting bossed around by his wife & he could be described as sexually frustrated. After he sees Angela, Jane's friend his desires awaken, he becomes a changed man and does not take orders from his wife anymore and tries to become physically attractive. By the end of the film when he finds out Angela is a Virgin, he sees her as his own daughter. What a perfect transformation & change of character. Mena Suvari portrays a teenage girl who wants to be extraordinary and the center of attention very well, and she is also beautiful on Screen. Thora Birch as Jane was fine in portraying the teenage girl who wanted freedom and also was being sort of a weird or mysterious character. At first you may find Ricky creepy but later you will feel sympathy for him and realize why he or his mother is this way and why Ricky records! Because he simply wants to capture the beauty of the world. He also wants the freedom to do what he wants without his father's interference which connects him to Jane. Chris Cooper naturally portrays the retired colonel who tries to flex his authority over his family through aggressive behavior towards them, perhaps a homophobic or a man afraid of his own sexuality. Annette Benning as Carolyn is also fantastic she is quite possibly the best portrayal of a real state business woman in a movie, she cannot accept defeat, occupies superior position in her house, bosses her husband around and values materials more than enjoying life. Then her life takes a turn after Lester stops taking orders from her and she becomes very frustrated and she was also decisively losing to a competitor named Buddy, after this she started an illegitimate relationship with buddy, & she started enjoying life again till her husband discovered her affair and she broke up with Buddy and felt broken again. It was not until her Husband's death she realized that she actually loved him. Again great transformation and character development. The minor characters also put on a commendable performance.All characters in this film are fantastic and well acted and the plot flows though really well because of it. The soundtrack is also fantastic and suits the feel of the movie. Some really memorable and funny scenes too, which you will feel like watching over and over again and enjoy. This film does try to tell its story but it doesn't remain serious it also tries to be funny. Thus it is a perfect blend of comedy, drama and social commentary. My only gripe with this movie would be its pacing because even the film just slightly over 2 hours long, the film feels like its longer , it moves at a very slow & methodical pace to deliver its message. The viewer would also be left deeply interpreting what he saw. This affects the film's replay value. Additionally the actors who played Jane and Ricky remained expression throughout most of the film, maybe it is a part of their characters but it really makes their performance not stand out compared to the rest of the cast, plus their scenes dragged on, apart from the scene with the flying Bag & the scene in which where Ricky tells her his real story. Lester's fantasies about Angela were also overdone in my opinion. But those are just minor issues of an otherwise absolutely brilliant film which is as close as a film can get to a work of art, this film absolutely worthy of the Oscar it received. The people who dislike this film or think it is overrated should actually try to re-watch it and see what they think of it now, because this is one of those films that you will appreciate and understand more, the more you watch it",9,2,4,18 November 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is easily one of the greatest Science Fiction films ever created. Almost everything about this film from top to bottom, from the start to it's finish it's perfect. The direction is fantastic and it is unbelievable that this film was shot in the 1990s when the technology was so redundant, the action scenes and affects in this film are almost unbelievable for 1991. All the scenes are shot well and are interesting to watch, and they are pinnacle for the all the Sci-Fi action films that came in the future. Many Action Sci-Fi films could learn to base their action scenes off of this movie because it's that good. The sound affects and the music is also perfect for the times when it is played and the sound effects are loud and well orchestrated.It is not just about the action and the direction when it comes to T2:JD, the storyline is also interesting and it will keep you on the edge of your seat and the storytelling is also top notch and you are always wondering what is going to happen next. The film is not based on mindless action it is intelligent storytelling at it's finest and the Perfect follow up to and a perfect continuation of the first terminator movie. I was always on the Edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. The dialog is also interesting at all times and all the actors are almost perfect in their roles. They are so perfect that I cannot even imagine anyone else playing their roles.Arnold is fantastic in his role as T-101 this time playing as the savior or the good guy unlike the first movie where he played the antagonist. If you thought he did a great job as an antagonist in the first film. You will be blown away here, he is even better as a protagonist and is acting and his voice and accent are almost perfect to play a cyborg, it just works so well. Edward Furlong who was only a teenager at the time is just fantastic in his role, his acting, facial expressions, emotions and dialog delivery are all top notch and his interactions with both Linda (Sarah Connor) and Arnold (Terminator) are fantastic and memorable scenes. Linda Hamilton plays a different role than she did in the first movie, in the first film she was an innocent person who was victimized this movie show how her character has developed and how she has grown tougher and stronger after the first film determined to protect John and prevent the end of the world from coming. This is perfect character development in a movie and Linda does a marvelous Job. Lastly Robert Patrick who does not talk much is a great antagonist, he is silent and mysterious and cold and calculated as that serious angry expression on his face most of the time which works so well, the action scenes between him and Arnold are just a thing of beauty and perfectly shot. the rest of the supporting cast including Doctor Silverman pare also great in their roles. Almost nothing bad I can say about the acting in this film.Overall Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest Action Sci-Fi films ever made, it is one of the best films ever, it is a perfect balance of good storyline and good action which is a rarity for Hollywood nowadays. Add to that the perfect direction and brilliant casting and performances from almost the entire cast. You have got a brilliant film a one you can watch again again. This is the perfect follow up to the first Terminator Movie, the sequels to T2:JD which were Terminator 3: Rise of Machines and Terminator Salvation were alright but they did not live up to the first 2 films and were honestly not needed. The first two films completed the story they wanted to tell.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,3,4,10 December 2014
The Conjuring 2," A mesmerizing horror flick that is one of the better movie sequels in recent memory
","The Conjuring came out in the year 2013. It was a supernatural horror movie based on a real life incident, set in the 1970s, and it focused on the efforts of the demonologists Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren to help a distressed family get rid of an evil spirit, which had possessed one of the family members. The movie had its scary moments and was fun to watch from the start to the finish. The Conjuring received rave reviews from both critics and fans alike and was a commercial success. This left the audience craving for a sequel, and after the release of the somewhat disappointing spin-off movie called 'Annabelle', the developers finally released the sequel called 'The Conjuring 2' this year in 2016.The Conjuring 2 is a very similar movie to the first movie and follows a similar plot line. The movie is set three years after the first Conjuring and once again a family in distress is haunted by an evil spirit in their place of residence in England. The family begs for help for Ed and Lorraine Warren to help them, after it is obvious that the local authorities or the priests could not control the situation. What separates this plot line from the first movie is that this particular job is more personal for Lorraine and Ed Warren.Much like the Conjuring, this movie is based on a real life case, although it has been glorified for theatrical and dramatic reasons to engross the audience. This movie actually comes off as more scary than the first movie, because the spirit or demon in this movie seems far more powerful and dangerous than the one the prequel and there is more focus on the horror sections as compared to the first movie. The first movie did very well due to its dramatic performances from the lead actors and comparatively was not that scary.Performance wise, the cast does really well. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are almost perfect for the role of Lorraine and Ed Warren respectively and give their best effort. Madison Wolfe who plays the possessed girl Janet, also performs very well in her role. Frances O'Connor who plays the role of the mother of the children, also does an excellent job of playing the role of a mother who is traumatized with what has happened. The rest of cast also gives a commendable effort.The sound effects of the movie are done remarkably well as they add to the horror element of the move and intensifies the scary moments in the movie to engage and gripe the audience, and this results in many nerve-racking moments throughout the entire movie. The movie is not heavy on special effects or gimmicks, the special effects are just on point and the creepy background and demonic voices only add to the horror element of the movie.My main problem with the movie would be with the length, the movie goes longer than 2 hours and somewhat drags by the time it reaches the climax. The movie drags on so long is because of the heavy involvement of the media in it, some people in the media were hell bent on proving that the family was faking the incident. This movie could have done without these sections.Overall the Conjuring 2 is a great supernatural horror movie and a great follow up to its predecessor. Nowadays, movie sequels hardly deliver and are more of a cash grab that is not the case with the Conjuring as the movie is arguably almost as good as or even better than the first movie, and in many instances also creepier than the first movie. This is a must watch for anyone who likes to watch horror movie, it would be a mesmerizing experience from the start to the finish.",8,0,0,21 October 2016
The Usual Suspects," Absolutely Brilliant.....
","I am a huge fan of the crime movies having watched classics like Reservoir Dogs, Heat, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather Part 1 and 2 and Scarface among others. I must say that The Usual Suspects is not only lives up to the names of these films but it is one the best films in the entire Genre.The plot is about an incident that takes place on a pier in California leaving all criminals dead, with only two survivors, one is an Hungarian who is badly injured and burned and the second person is a Cripple, Verbal Kint. Kint describes the events that led to the incident and what actually happened during it, to the Cops. There is a dangerous crime lord who maybe involved in the center of this incident. That's all I can say about the plot without spoiling.The plot starts out slow but picks up eventually & retains the viewer's interest in what will happen next. There are many many mysterious things which are revealed in the present about the pier incident as Verbal continues to tell the story which will also keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. The plot is rounded off by an absolutely brilliant twist and an awesome ending. The movie also tries its best to swerve the viewer and succeeds very well. The ending is not only brilliant and fantastic but it also leaves a lot of room for interpretations and discussions, which is clearly what the developers had in mind.The dialogue in The Usual Suspects is absolutely brilliant and it also has very funny and memorable scenes and the exchanges between the main characters are always interesting, even the brief heists that are shown have good action. And switching back and forth between past and present is a brilliant method of story telling. The music and sound effects are absolutely spot on and fit scenes naturally.The acting is top notch, Kevin Spacey who gets the majority of the screen time steals the show as Verbal Kint, Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as Dean Keaton, Chazz Palminteri actually fits really well in his role as Kujan and acts excellently, this role was offered to the likes of Christoper Walken & Robert De Niro but they turned it down, but Chazz took such a tough character and played it brilliantly. Peth Postlethwaite is just spot on with his lines and just feels natural as Kobayashi. Out of the other three criminals Stepehan Baldwin is fantastic as MacManus with the screen time he is given, whereas the actors who portrayed Hokeney and Fenster do not stand out compared to the others but they still did a decent job.The Usual Suspects is so entertaining to watch that you will feel like watching it again and again and still have a great time. Several scenes in the movie specially the ending sequence will just give you the chills and make you want to watch them again see how perfect the music, dialogue, the acting, the delivery everything perfectly fit the situation. The film is a masterpiece, and one of the very best in its genre, if you are a fan of crime or thriller, do yourself a favor and watch The Usual Suspects.Overall: 9.5/10",10,1,2,20 November 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Good action flick, better than it's predecessor.
","When the Spider-man movie franchise was rebooted, I was not in favor of it, I actually was among those people who enjoyed the Sam Raimi films, regardless of the fact that Spiderman 3 did not deliver. I was actually looking forward to Spider-man 4 till they decided they had to reboot the franchise. I thought the reboot was really unnecessary. Andrew Garfield does have the younger, college boy look, more so than Toby Maguire to be Spider-man like he is in the comics and the 1994 animated series. Plus they also added more believable elements, like he used gadgets to create webbing, just like in the comics, which was far more believable than the Sam Raimi's movies. Unfortunately the first film had too many mysteries too many secrets about Parker's parents which were not cleared up at all by the end, they also kind of ruined the tragic Uncle Ben scene and Garfield's acting in that situation was not good. Plus the first film dragged on and on till the lizard showed up which was too late in the film, and the love story was not developed well at all like it was in the Sam Raimi's films in my honest opinion. Plus Spiderman looked really weak in the entire film, he needed way to much help to stop the lizard. What I did like was Garfield's humorous jokes as Spiderman, specially his interactions with the lizard otherwise the movie failed to impress.The Amazing Spiderman 2 on the other hand does many things right, it first clears up what happened to Parker's parents, the reason for their sudden departure, much better scenes between Gwen and Parker. And honestly an overall interesting plot. Harry's family back-story and the Oscorp back-story is extremely interesting and I was deeply invested in his character. Jamie Fox was actually good after his TRANSFORMATION before that he just came off like an idiot or a goofy spider-man fan-boy. Electro came off as a tough and believable villain and his fight scenes against Spiderman were done very well. Unlike it's prequel the film keeps me interested for most of it's duration mainly the scenes involving Electro and Harry, the interactions between Parker/Spidey and Harry were also done excellently. The climax was also good but unfortunately for me the ending was ruined on the net before I watched the film. But I still think this film also ended on a high note and I am actually interested in the sequel, and that is not something that came to my mind after watching the first film. I also felt Garfield did better in the emotional scenes this time around. Emma Stone was pretty much the same like she was in the last film, Jamie Fox was great as the dangerous Electro and James De Haan was just awesome in his role. The supporting cast also did a good job. The film's overall plot is good, but it is not what carries it strong performances from the main cast, regardless of cliché dialogs, the film also uses great high-tech graphics and CGI those action scenes are fantastic even better than the last film, all fight and action scenes were done well and were all fun to watch. Unfortunately the serious dialogs scenes were boring and kind of dragged on, dragging this movie down for me.Overall this is a fun action that is a good watch for any Spiderman fan, but I still love the Animated Series the most.

The Dark Knight," Not only the Best Batman movie, but One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made.
","Christopher Nolan's retake on the Batman Movie franchise was met with positive response from both the critics and the comic book fans, Batman Begins was not only a great movie, a fantastic recreation of Batman but a great achievement from Nolan. It is amazing to see the series has so much depth and thought put into it, I am amazed it actually recovered from the abomination that was Batman and Robin. As great as Batman Begins was The Dark Knight takes everything that made that film great and makes it even better. This resulted in not only the greatest Batman movie ever made (in my opinion) and one of the best films ever made. Now there are people who have raised there grievances and voices against the Nolan trilogy and even the second entry in the series, they are entitled to their opinion, but I believe that the Nolan trilogy is a great achievement, well worthy of the Batman name and the second entry in the series 'The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them.This film has a different take from the first movie, Begins focused on the life of Bruce and how he became Batman, this movie focuses on the villain, The Joker and his mission to turn Gotham City into a madhouse proving that deep down everyone has evil inside them. The storyline is fantastic, and will keep you hooked to the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. The movie is entertaining to watch and almost everything will hold your attention. However the cliché and overdone dialogue, and there a lot of it in this movie, specially Bruce's dialogues, that kind of dialogue does indeed get annoying and slightly hurts the movie.Also while the first half of the film did have some unexplained points like how did Joker know that Dent was not Batman? How did Joker exactly set up for Dent and Rachel to be kidnapped after his arrest? If the viewer interprets them he can come up with a logical conclusion, however the second half has unanswered questions and plot holes which I cannot honestly draw a logical conclusion out of like How did Joker bypass Hospital Security and rigged it completely with bombs? How did Joker rig barrels in the boat with bombs, without anyone noticing? And the main question which confused me, why in the world would anyone sane want to work for someone as insane the Joker? A guy who burns money, several of his goons did seem sane in the films, like the members of the mob bosses gangs who switched sides. I understand the ending and have nothing against it, Batman taking all the blame was necessary for Harvey's legendary image to stay and influence Gotham to permanently take a stand against crime. Acting wise, this movie is Gold. Regardless of the cliché dialogue as Bruce, Christian Bale does an excellent job playing both Batman and Bruce Wayne and there is a fine balance of the two alter-egos in this movie, it is not like Rises where Batman takes like 45 minutes to make his first appearance in the film. I know people like to make fun of Bale's Batman voice, but he is trying to add a suitable and symbolic voice to Batman, Bale's voice as Bruce honestly would not work well IMO. Aaron does excellent as Harvery Dent, his character is well written, dialogue delivery is also off the charts, he is just natural in his role and his character shift in the second half is just brilliant. I might even say that Aaron even outshines Bale in this film. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman both plays their roles perfectly. However it is Heath Ledger who steals the show as Joker with his brilliant and magnificent performance, everything from his written character, facial expression, dialogue, dialogue delivery, make up, costume and even his mission during the film all of it is done almost perfectly heard Slater did a lot of research and hard work on this role and boy did he nail it, this is an Oscar worthy performance and arguably one of the best portrayal of a villain or antagonist in a movie ever. It is a tragedy that Ledger passed away during the end of the development of TDK, but his legend will live on forever and his legendary performance in this film will be remembered for a long long time. Music in the film is also good and fits all the scenes perfectly, there is also pure silence in scenes which do not need music and it adds to the mood. The small sound effects and the visual effects are also done well and not overused, they make the movie look good and add to the premise rather than being overused.Some minor plot holes aside, The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, the best Batman film ever made and one of the greatest movies ever, I have watched it multiple times and still feel like going back to watch because it is not only extremely fun and entertaining to watch but is just a brilliant movie. Overall 9.5/10.",9,1,2,7 January 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A fantastic, in-depth and though provoking film. One of the best romantic movies of the last decade.
","Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those films where you have to pay close attention to the scenes and dialog because even the smallest bit of dialog is important in this film. Because otherwise you will be confused in your initial viewing and will soon be asking yourself what in the world is going on. This film requires close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewings in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly is.The film is not your basic love story, it is unique and sort of bizarre at the same time, and while it is not a suspense movie, it is filled with several shocking moments and twists, which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigued by it. The narrative part of the love story is also told in a reverse chronological order, which starts from the moment the lovers broke up and ends when they first met. While the present scenes are told in a normal order, the film constantantly switches back and forth between the two which may create some confusion, another one of the reasons that this film requires close attention, at first you will probably be confused about what you are seeing is the present or the past, but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart. The way the Narrative is similar to Mememto which also followed a reverse chronological order of storytelling. The storytelling is clever and interesting and only makes the film better and it's twists more shocking and intriguing. Acting wise, Jim Carrey is in Truman Show mode, or probably the most serious he has ever been in a film, this is probably the most serious role he has ever done, and he shines in his role as Joel Barish and is completely into his character. Kate Winslet also performs excellently well, and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence is done extremely well. The supporting cast did not get that much screen time but they are performed their roles well, Kirsten Durst and Mark Ruffalo are good but the scenes between them in the apartment are kind of drawn out and I could have done without a few of them, but Elijah Wood is really great in his role as Patrick and scenes between him and Clementine are also interesting. The ending is also great because it leaves it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the events that led up to the ending were also very interesting and intriguing. The soundtrack is also great and suits most of the scenes it is being played in, the opening and closing credits song is also fantastic and also wonderfully portrays the relationship between Clementine and Joel. The ice setting was not something i was fond of before watching the film but it is handled extremely well here, with the scene of Clementine and Joel laying on ice being one of the most touching and memorable moments of this film.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a touching, in-depth and intriguing love story with such great plot, settings, performances and memorable moments that I can watch this film over and over again and never get bored. However you may need to watch this film multiple times to fully understand it's plot and the message it is trying to convey and appreciate it for what it truly is.Rating: 9.5/10",10,11,16,5 July 2014
Saw," Game Over!
","The year 2004 was a great year for Hollywood. As this year brought many brilliant, memorable and big budget movies to Hollywood which were both critically and commercially successful. Saw was one of those films which was actually the wild card. It was an independent film with a low budget and a new entry into the survival horror and suspense/thriller genre of movies, with so many movies of the genre already out during that during time period, Saw was the dark house and it was not known whether it would be successful or not. Saw turned out to be a such a big success that it spawned 6 sequels. I always wanted to watch this movie as I am a fan of genre, but what put me off was that there was a lot of gore in this movie. I can handle violence but after watching many films with so much pointless gore and bloodshed just for the sake of it, I did not get around to watching this movie until recently. The film puts you right into the action two men who don't know each other are trapped in a room together with a corpse, with no idea how they got there, they find out that some serial killer coin named the Jigsaw has trapped them there and wants them to play his Game to survive, than several events unfold with the two guys attempting to find out a way out, and also trying to get to know each other knowing that these maybe their final hours. The film also switches back and forth with flashback sequences of both guys that led them to that place which adds to the suspense of the film, we also get a flashback on some of the earlier Games played by the Jigsaw. There is also an interesting side story about a cop named Dupp who is obsessed with Jigsaw.The films starts out great and will have you hooked to your seats and it adds to the mystery that the film was not told in a chronological order but kept on switching back and forth between the present and past sequences this leaves rooms for more shocking twists and more mysteries to be revealed.Of course there was a twist at the end and I was not able to figure it out, I was actually shocked and the idea about it did not even cross my mind. But this twist leaves some ambiguity, interpretation and some suspension of disbelief. But the twist delivered in terms of shock value and many did not see it coming as I can tell from forums online. The film is well shot and well directed, and the violence and gore is there but not to the extreme levels I expected so I did not find it that bad. Acting is fine, Adam and Lawrance do act somewhat naturally for the situation they were put in, Lawrence's character development by the end was also handled well. The Jigsaw did not get screen time a whole a lot but his voice was just menacing and villainous, and the mystery about him just adds to his character makes the character more thrilling and scary. The actor who plays the former detective Tapp also did a fine job. Shawnee Smith as Amanda was great in her cameo she played her traumatized character very well. The acting is not Oscar worthy or anything like that but I thought it was fine and done well.Saw is an enjoyable horror/thriller film, It had me hooked from my seat from the beginning to the end and was extremely fun to watch. Although I am a fan of the genre there are films of this genre which I find tiresome and hard to sit through and mostly find myself skipping through the scenes , Saw was the complete opposite of such films it had me glued to my seat and I was anticipated to see what happens next. The end left me in shock and after the ending I am still thinking about this movie and it's story and trying to interpret it's events. This is a great survival horror, suspense, mystery which is recommended to any fan of the genre.Overall 9/10.",9,1,3,26 July 2014
Pulp Fiction," An unique and extremely entertaining film.
","For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example: Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall: 9.5/10",10,2,5,22 November 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Great Sci-Fi movie and good performance from Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt
","Edge of Tomorrow is a really fun Sci-Fi flick, which offers both excitement, it will have you hooked to your seat from the beginning to the end and it also has good humor and many funny scenes. But that is not all this film also has some really good action sequences, along with an interesting and intriguing storyline. A guy is reliving 24 hours of his life again, again and again, because when he dies the day the resets, and he wakes up in the camp where he was 24 hours earlier having already witnessed everything before.I am always fascinated by Sci-Fi movies which are based on around time travel, Back to the Future I is one of my favorite films ever, its sequels while not living up to the original were still fun to watch, there are also many other good films based on time travel like Groundhog Day, Source Code and Looper. There are others in which the time travel concept existed but grew tiresome or was just not that interesting, films like Peggy Sue got married, Time Machine (2002) and Midnight in Paris are films based on time travel that failed to hold my interest. Fortunately Edge of tomorrow ranks among the former not the latter and is one of the best films released in 2014 so far.Many actions scenes are brilliantly shot, the fight scenes between the army and the mimics are really well done, the dialog has humor and also carries the plot forward. Tom Cruise is fantastic as Officer Cage, he performs many great action sequences, provides humor to the film and also helps carry the film, Blunt serving as the female lead and his Love Interest also does an excellent job. Blunt's role as Sergeant Vrataski is that of hardened female soldier, who single handedly killed many many mimics in the battle of Verdun she is not your typical female in action films who needs the hero to protect her, she is fighting soldier, Blunt also trained hard for this role and she delivered. The supporting cast is good, it was awesome to see Bill Paxton in this film and the scenes between him and Cruise were really good. The actors who played the J Squad also do a great job.The film's premise about Cruise knowing all of his friends for hundreds of days and them barely knowing him ads a lot to the film and also made the angle between Cage and Rita Vrataski more than your average love angle and also made for some interesting interactions between them. I also applaud the attention to the detail in this movie, many scenes that are repeated are 100% accurate to the last dialog, watching these scenes unfold again and again also makes this film more intriguing. The sound effect and music is also good and suits the film.My minor problems would be that the film starts to drag a little in the middle before Rita and Cage make it to farmhouse, the movie then once again picks up after the farmhouse scene, also seems like by the end the film started skipping many important loops, for example, Cage having already been at the farmhouse before many times, when we first saw him there, he had already been at the General's office many times, when we saw him go there with Rita. This kind of creates some ambiguity and confusion and I feel this film should have at least added some quick scenes of Page's earlier visits to the general's office and the farmhouse rather than just showing the scenes in which he actually succeeds, it would have added to the movie in my opinion. I have a mixed opinion about the ending firstly, it kind of leaves you hanging about the relationship between Cage and Rita, leaves you hanging on the edge of the final battle between Mimics and the soldiers in France, it is also one of those cliché endings where nobody really dies, and everybody is happy, but at least they did not go all the way and have Page and Rita reunite share a passionate kiss at the end of the movie that would have been so cliché, instead they just cut to the credits at their final meeting. Perhaps Page sacrificing himself or somehow surviving and waking up in a hospital bed and being declared a hero would have been a better. But maybe thats the point of the movie to leave you hanging and thinking what is going to happen tomorrow and creating some ambiguity, leaving room for interpretations rather than providing a straightforward ending. Overall Edge of tomorrow is a great action flick, which will keep you on the Edge of your seat from it's start to it's finish, i am shocked to see Cruise in such a great action film at this stage in his career, this is a film which offers humor, entertainment, good acting and storyline, even if you did not read the book, you will find this film entertaining. One of the best films of 2014, and a must watch.",9,0,2,14 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great Story and a Legendary performance from DiCaprio
","Films on real life stories or films based on books are not really 100% accurate as the way the events are portrayed in the movie is not exactly how things turned out in real life or how things are narrated in the book. Would it be fantastic if the real life incident or book portrayed in the film is completely accurately, of course. But that does not mean that changing the way the events unfold makes the film bad. This is where the majority of criticism for this film comes for. I personally do not agree with all that criticism, I watch films as a mode of entertainment and if a film successfully entertains me, grasps my attention, makes me get engaged in the story and characters and overall premise of their film, I will enjoy the film. So whether the films follows the book r the real life story 100% accurately is not a major concern to me. Regardless according to many outlets the films mostly stays very true to the books written by Jordan Belfort.The people who were affected by the real life incident have a right to be upset, no question. But the thing is that the developers of this film wanted to fit the real life scenario in the film in such a way that a variety of audience would enjoy it and find it entertaining, hence some changes.The storyline follows Jordan Belfort journey, as he became a successful stock broker who made tons of money and became rich adopting a different lifestyle. Than this film shows his downfall because of the involvement of the Federal Government leading to another change in his life. That's all about I can say without giving away the whole plot. Honestly the film did not need to go 3 full hours, there were just way to many party and nude scenes, and they did slightly hurt the overall narrative. Also is it even naturally possible for someone to have so much sex and drugs without any major health issues. This film forces you to suspend your disbelief to a level to enjoy it to it's fullest.Honestly skipping several of these sections in favor of progressing the actual story would have done wonders. I mean we get it, Rich people like to party, do drugs, go to strip clubs, drink alcohol what not, so many sections showing that was not needed. From what I know Jordan Belfort, in real life worked inside a Boiler Room office i am not sure abut him having such a large high-end office as shown in the film. However these party scenes are not a bore for several reasons, one of them being comedy, these scenes are the charm of the movie and are very amusing and will bring a smile to your face. Regardless of this the storyline is told well, with Belfort/DiCaprio dictating his past stories and his comments are not only good at progressing the plot but they are also humorous at times. One of my worries before watching this film was that the dialogue would be too cliché but I was wrong, it was kept simple and only tell the viewers what they would easily understand they didn't go too deep in the nature of deals which is a good thing. At times DiCaprio breaks the fourth wall simply stating simple sentences rather than confusing audience with Jargons that would confuse them further. The film also maintains a balance between humor and serious storytelling.The film has a large cast and all of them play their parts well. Leonardo perhaps gives his best performance ever Jordan Belfort, and that is saying something because he always gives a good performance. Everything from Leo's narration to his acting, everything is almost perfect, he was just natural in his role, from his dialogue delivery, voice intonation facial expressions everything was done to perfection. Leo honestly, without question deserves an Oscar for this amazing performance, anybody who says he can't act should just watch him here. Jonah Hill is cast as Leo's supporting character and he does what he does best give a comic relief bring humor t the film and he also does his part to progress the story. The rest of the cast do a serviceable jobs, there are several faces I did not recognize in the film and even they acted well.The film like I said goes for a bit too long, it's story could have been told in a half the time honestly but even then, the 3 hours do not drag because even the filler scenes are kept entertaining with humor and will still draw a reaction out of you, while the storytelling sections are engaging and perfectly progress the plot. In the end we saw a fantastic character development and a good moral message. I would not recommend this film to everyone, it is full f content which could be considered offensive or inappropriate, so it could not be watched with family or kids. The people looking for a 100% accurate portrayal of the Jordan Belfort story and his books perhaps should look elsewhere, as there are some different plot points in this movie, but if you can make do with that, most of the story stays true to Jordan's novels, according to Belfort himself, so those people who read the novel may also like this film. . If you want an entertaining film with a great storyline and good comedy, and great cast and performances, give it a go, you will love this film.In conclusion, I want to say that in my opinion, The Wolf of Wall street is a fantastic film, with a great story and is extremely entertaining from start to finish, without a doubt one of the best films of 2013.

The Green Mile," The Green Mile - Emotional and Mesmerizing
","The Green Mile is a movie based on the Stephan King book by the same name, however unlike some other movies based on his books, not only this is a magnificent movie but the movies stays true to the plot of the novel. The film moves at a slow pace, but it is still very entertaining to watch from it's beginning to the end, it's plot is also engaging and keeps us interested in finding out what will happen next. While the Green Mile has it's share of amusing scenes, it is a completely serious movie. As a matter of fact emotional might be more accurate. This movie has so many scenes that are just sad and may make you tear up. I try my best not to cry during movies, even during very sad scenes, but I just couldn't control myself while watching the Green Mile, many scenes just touch your heart and the tears will start falling down. The ending was also good but also very sad at the same time, but after this film ended I was simply in awe after watching such a magnificent work of art. The Green Mile is a 3 hours long mesmerizing masterpiece.The acting is almost perfect almost all actors play their role perfectly, Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are fantastic in their roles, although i wish Michael got more screen time in the first half of the film. Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison play their villainous characters perfectly and really make you want to hate them. The actors who portray the prisoners and show innocence make you feel sympathy for them, like the guards in this movie, and you realize they really do regret what they did, and when they are executed you can't help but feel sad, at least from the inside. But the casting is almost perfect, the actors portray the characters next to perfection, specially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, as a matter of fact King himself said he had imagined Hanks in the role of Paul Edgecomb.The music and direction is also brilliant, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job of portraying king's other book into film (ShawShank Redemption) and he continues his success with the Green Mile. He is a magnificent director, I just wish he does more movies based on King's book, because King + Darabont simply results in magic on screen. While almost perfect, the Green Mile's slow pace, long duration and large amount of emotional scenes do it's replay value no favors, also I find it hard to believe that all prisoners on death row are so civil and nice towards the guards and vice versa, it maybe explained in the book but I find it unrealistic, also the twist that was revealed near the end, in the flashback, just seemed random and ironic, they could have gone in another direction and used another method to bring more light to the truth. Also John Coffey's goes a little out of character in that scene.Regardless, The Green Mile is mesmerizing and a classic work of art which will make you smile, cry and simply leave you in awe.Overall Rating: 9.5/10",10,1,2,25 November 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent Movie No Doubt. N.o 1 in the IMDb top 250? Not Really.
","The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red 'Ellis Redding', he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall: 9/10",9,0,0,25 November 2013
Identity," The last act ruins what could have been a good film.
","The Identity had a a lot of good things going for it and before I watched it I expected a good suspense/thriller film. First of all John Cusack was in this film and he always puts on good performances in the roles that he is given, he carried the above average horror flick 1408, and made it so much more entertaining and fun to watch with his enthusiastic performance. Identity had John Cusack and also had a large cast of other actors many of which I did not know of. But the basic plot at the premise of the whole film was very appealing. I was expecting something good in the very least. Movie was going in the right direction, not only Cusack but rest of the cast performed well, and the settings and environments seemed appealing and the film was only getting better by the minute, until the last 1/4 portion of the movie where the big twist was revealed.Now don't get me wrong twists are not bad, sometimes they up the status of the film and may make you come back for a second viewing, leave you shocked and leave room for interpretations. Another psychological horror/thriller Sixth Sense had a great twist; another suspense/thriller film like Usual Suspects had a great twist. The Others a horror film also had a great twist. But this film goes with the terrible it was all a dream concept which ruins all the interesting characters this film was trying to make us care about throughout most of the it. This Dream concept can work if executed right but here this concept ruins everything. We come to the realization that it all in the head of a mentally unstable serial killer who has multiple personalities in his brain, each of which is portrayed by the characters in the movie, the serial killer personality is the killing off the other characters (personalities) which represent something good in the killer or a softer side to him.I don't see this as an intelligent concept because it's premise is flawed from the start, personalities co-exist in the brain they don't try to kill each other off as portrayed in the movie, neither they are numbered in a specific order as portrayed in the movie. I thought the film was heading somewhere interesting when we found out all characters had the same birth date and had last names of countries or cities, but apparently all this was to present them as a personality in a psychopath's head. Plus it's laughable who turns out to be the killer/evil personality at the end. We do agree to suspend our disbelief to a point when watching film but this is just unbelievable, I guess they just wanted to SHOCK us by revealing the kid as the killer, they decided to make the whole scenario take place in a psychopath's head to pass off the possibility of the kid as a killer just to SHOCK us. I wrote off the kid as a suspect the second I saw him just like anyone would, because which movie is ridiculous enough to portray a little child as a Serial Killer? I don't see how is this intelligent in anyway, it is nonsensical, ruins the characters and ruins the suspense the movie had. Why should we care Cusack's character left his police job, why should we care about the Detective being a prisoner disguised as a cop, why care about the problems the couple was having , why care about that women's condition after the car accident. Why should we care about a psychopath guy who appears for like 5 minutes in the movie and what happens in his head and why should we care about what is happening in the head of a serial killer in the first place. Why care about anything at all. This twist ruins the whole thing and reveals that caring about anything related to the backstory of the characters is pointless and is not real and represents something in the psychopath's head.Overall, Identity had a good basic premise, good performances and a good setting , and was only getting better but it will all ruined by the film's twist, which ruins everything this film established in its first half. Overall Rating: 4/10.",4,1,4,3 August 2014
The Sixth Sense," A brilliant Psychological Horror film that leaves a HUGE lasting impact...
","The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead. It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot.In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room.The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get.The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising & it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10",9,0,0,19 November 2013
The Truman Show," Ambitious and a great thought provoking film, which is a great combination of social satire and philosophy.
","The Truman Show is a fantastic film, it is about a man whose entire life is a TV show, he has been monitored and been on since the day he was born all the way to his mid thirties. Although he is not aware of this fact all the people around him, his family, his relatives, neighbors and friends are all actors hired by the TV show also to monitor him.The film starts out pretty basic and simple, you wouldn't think anything extraordinary is happening, you will just be seeing an average man going about his daily routine, things keep on going pretty basic until an unforeseen event unfolds in his life, and he becomes confused about what is going on. Some of Truman's actions do not make sense early on as well, tearing the pictures of girls from magazines. Soon after some events Truman finds out something is wrong and there are people following him and monitoring his moments, and soon after the twist is revealed in it's full form, that Truman is in a TV show only he is not aware of it and everyone he knows in that town is a hired actor and the city he lives in is also a film set.This was a wonderful plot twist which not only makes the film so much more interesting and makes you want to re-watch the whole film again, from a different perspective, and closely watch the early scenes and listen to the dialog carefully and see how the actors are behaving around Truman. The ending was also great because it leaves it up to interpretation if Truman will be able to survive in the world out there when he has spent his entire life on the film set, the ending is not something i would call a HAPPY ENDING because it leaves it up to interpretation about Truman's future. Performance wise this film is great, anyone who says Jim Carrey cannot do drama roles should watch this, he plays Truman at his very best, although he does bring humor to some of his scenes he is mostly playing a dramatic character and his antics, dialog delivery is all done well. Ed Harris did not get that much screen time but he played Christof spot on, he was perfect in playing a man who would go as far as he can to make his TV show a success and make sure Truman never leaves. The rest of the actors on the Truman Show did well they were all playing two roles, one of the actors in a TV shows and their characters in the TV show and it was well executed. The direction is also fantastic there are camera which focus closely on Truman with the screen having a background which is the film's way of showing that Truman is on camera and is being watched by people around the world. The other camera angle is the one we see from out perspective. The setting is also done well, the whole island has been designed well to look like a TV set.The music is also good, as it suits most of the scenes the film is in, the music that plays in the intro and the conclusion when Truman is talking to Christof specially suits those scenes perfectly. The only minor issue with Truman Show would be it's slow pacing and slow start and slow development at least during your first watch, by the time the major event start to unfold and the film starts to get interesting and reveal the big twists, you may be kind of bored and may have grown restless. You may want to watch it a second time from a different perspective knowing clearly from the start that Truman is being directed the entire time, but the slow scenes may still put you off. Regardless Truman Show is a fantastic, ambitious in-depth and thought provoking film about social satire which makes you think deeply. The film's storyline music and performances are all well done, and the fact that it's twist makes you watch it from a different perspective completely also makes this film that much better.

Goodfellas," Goodfellas - A Very slow paced film that has not aged well.
","Goodfellas is based on a book which in turn is based on a real life story of Henry Hill, a person who always wanted to be a mobster and this film tells his story about he went from being a criminal to finally turning into a rat and leaving his whole mafia life behind. I think the overall storyline is very good, it is just the way it is told, too many filler scenes that are extremely, slow, boring and do nothing for the overall plot. In particular the Heist sequence was done so terribly, they introduce members of the heist and minutes later the heist ended and members started spending money, moments later they all end up dead. This whole angle was rushed and so poorly handled. . The love story between Henry and Karen was also slow and took too long to develop and the affair angle was so fast you blinked you misses it. When Henry was arrested the second time, they handled it with a series of jumbled up scenes, that could have been handled in half the time.Add to that the constant and annoying narration. Scorsose likes that style of storytelling, the one with narration but it is way too much here, and occasionally they would pause certain scenes and Liotta would narrate which breaks the flow of the movie, many scenes are events are explained with narration.Ray Liotta is decent in his protagonist but the other two protagonists De Niro and Joe Pesci. Pesci is fantastic and extremely charismatic as Tommy, his scenes are fun to watch and whenever he is on the screen he demands your attention, his lines are also pretty funny. De Niro does great with the amount of screen time he gets but he does not get a lot of it and allow his character to properly develop from a rationale person to a paranoid man who thinks everybody is going to get him arrested. Liotta was not bad he gave a decent performance but there are others who could have done better in his role, he is really good in some scenes, but in emotional scenes and even the funny scenes his poor acting clearly shows, his laugh is terrible and looks fake. Some great sequences regardless. The Tommy death scene and him killing a made man was one of the interesting parts.Overall I don't see what is so special about Goodfellas, it is an average movie, which had a great story with potential but was told in a very average and slow manner, the narrative had tons of filler and was not handled well, the main protagonist was decent at best, leaving the other two main actors to make the most of it and carry the film and steal the show. It is definitely no Godfather.Overall: 6/10.",6,1,5,16 May 2014
The Great Gatsby," Hard to watch.
","The Great Gatsby is based on the film in the 70s of the same name and a novel, which was mediocre to begin with so there was no reason to be highly invested in this movie. But since time has passed since the last film you expect them to learn from their mistakes and make a better movie overall. Plus I am always eager to see a Leonardo DiCaprio film, he in my honest opinion is a thrill to watch and always puts on fantastic performances. Since he was the front and center of the Great Gatsby, I was highly anticipated to watch this movie. But unfortunately I was let down, not by his performance but the overall movie. Leonardo actually does the best he can and plays his character well, the movie overall however is not laid out well at all in my opinion. Leon will grasp your attention and make you pay attention the scenes he is in. Toby Maguire on the other hand was OK as the narrator of the plot but he was not doing anything astounding, I actually liked him in his role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman series, but Toby as the narrator here did not do anything special. The rest of the cast was fine, Carey Mulligan was OK, I actually really liked Joel Edgerton character in a antagonistic sort of way unfortunately his role was not extended he might have uplifted this movie with his good performance.The setting was captured well they showed how the rich people back then lived their life. It is one of the positives of this movie.The movie starts out SO slow, and it is not until 30-40 mins that you see Leo and then things SLIGHTLY pick up from there but even after that the whole movie feels cliché and the plot/narrative still doesn't interest me much, it is a love story, of a how far a man would go for a woman, touching for some, but I was not really astounded by it, mainly because the movie has too many songs in between scenes and those songs are not really good and only distract the viewer on the narrative, they just seem filler and go on too long. What was the point of that? To add more extra time to the movie? To drag out the plot which could have been told better in half the time?Gatsby's back-story and the mystery behind him was something i was interested in knowing and was invested in but they took SO long to reveal it that by that time I did not care.The Great Gatsby just like the novel is a mediocre affair, if they had tweaked things in the novel to make for better cinema I would have been all for it, plus reducing the number of unnecessary dance and party could have helped the narrative a lot and would have uplifted this movie. Unfortunately what we get is a long slow and mostly boring film which is just a mediocre affair and hard to watch. Overall Rating: 5/10.",5,4,6,12 May 2014
The Godfather," A Grand Masterpiece....
","Almost every person who sees Hollywood films has at least heard of The Godfather, it is considered by multiple sources as one of the best films ever made in history, many people have also claimed that this is the best film ever made. I am not sure if I agree with the latter point, but I can proudly say is that the Godfather is just a Grand masterpiece which not only a fan of the crime genre but anyone who likes movies in general can enjoy. Now this is a 1972 film some people say it has not aged well, I disagree that film is still entertaining to watch, the plot will still grasp your attention and you will still be on the edge of your seat. The main thing that this movie does different compared to the movies of today's generation that it moves at a very very slow pace not that it's a bad thing, back then almost all films did that, the minor scenes went on for quite long. I mean seriously has there even been a recent movie in which a party or wedding scene went on for over 10 minutes (unless the actual film was based upon it)? Now I will not take away from this movie because of of prolonged scenes because the movie still makes sure to progress its story slowly in such scenes to keep the viewer interested. However these scenes also make the movie go on for 3 hours which kind of hurts its replay value. But even if you watch the Godfather once you will simply be in awe of it's magnificent story, brilliant characters and perfect setting and environment. This film is also a very realistic portrayal of mobs in Italy during that time period. All actors bring the characters to life and very so into the characters that you will feel like they are the characters themselves rather than actual actors. The acting is simply among the best I have seen in any movie, not just from the lead Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but even the supporting characters like Sonny played by James Caan or Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall are fantastically portrayed. Even the minor and the female characters play their part to perfection. There is nothing really bad to say about the acting.The plot is about the Corleone family and how it tries to co-exist with the other mobs. The story is fantastic with many twists and turns throughout and will keep you engaged about what will happen next, the movie does not move rapidly fast but it moves at a very slow pace to allow the viewer to get a better idea of the characters and the plot. The ending is also fantastic and is a perfect example of character development.The soundtrack is also fantastic and fits all the scenes in the movie, the main theme of the film in particular still sounds awesome even to this very day. The movie also takes itself very seriously, it does not do comedy, apart from a very few and rare scenes, this film is very serious and rightfully so it deals with a very serious topic and the events that transpire throughout are very difficult, tragic and severe for this movie to be anything else. The film is violent but it is not what you see throughout 90% of the film, the violence which is there, serves its purpose and progresses the plot in a meaningful way.Apart from the pacing, I felt like this film was a little hard to understand sometimes without subtitles specially when the Italian language is spoken, we are still not completely clueless to what's actually going on but knowing what the characters are actually saying would have helped. But that is only a minor issue which does not take away from the overall film.In the end, I just want to say what has already been said many times, The Godfather one of the best films ever made in history and anyone who likes Hollywood cinema in general and still hasn't watched this masterpiece, should just watch this classic, this is Hollywood at it's very finest.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,0,1,21 November 2013
