Ali," Ali Great Film - Ali is A Great Human Being
","Through the good graces of my dear friend of more than 35 years, Dick Gregory, I had the honor to meet and know The Champ, Ali, for a few visits, mostly at fights but even at his home after his last triumph in winning the world championship. Believe me when I tell you, he is just as great and as charismatic as we all think he is. It was truly hard for him to be in such a position, as champion of the World, only because that much fame and success always means making some choices. Take the big money or risk losing everything because or your total commitment to The Civil Rights Movement? To be for or against and obviously unjust war in Vietnam? He had to choose between the best and easiest life or one of conflict and the worst choice of all, standing up for your beliefs including those which meant going to prison and possibly losing everything. But Ali will always stand as a world champion of people -- whatever that means. That might be why he is possibly the most famous person in the world. The film's entertaining.Dick Gregory is more than a friend and counsel to Ali. They have agreed that African Americans had a calling just as Dr. King did. Though it caused Ali many potentially successful years as an champion. Ali and Gregory made their work part of their calling and they have made an indelible mark on the history and the evolution of The Civil Rights Movement and the truth about what happened to America as a result of our being in Vietnam. This is a film that everyone should see -- particularly if they are confused about racism. This is an historic film as well as one that entertains from the first frame to the last.",10,1,2,24 January 2005
