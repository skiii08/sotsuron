The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant
","This movie was very well crafted.  It is the scariest movie I have ever seen.  I have heard comments that the female lead's acting was not very good; I couldn't disagree more.  Heather Donahue was extremely good in her part.  The other two were also very believable.I have also read reviews that complain that the details of the legend weren't explained very well, and that there wasn't a satisfactory explanation at the end of the movie.  I have to stand up for the filmmakers here and say that the decision to leave a lot of it unexplained was the right choice, and added to the mystery and realism of the film.",10,1,2,11 August 1999
