Raiders of the Lost Ark," Another gem from Spielberg
","Indiana Jones is the quintessal live-action cartoon, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth watching. When I first saw it I was expecting a campy action flick with too many guns and James Bond car chases. Of course, I was completely wrong.This is the first and probably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Henry Jones Jr., commonly known as Indiana Jones, is a professor of archeology who sometimes does... specialty jobs. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, he searches for the Ark of the Covenant, a Biblical relic said to strike down 'armies' in a second. Indy barely hesitates to accept the little stint.Lucas's special effects are unique and CGI-free. From rolling stone balls to snakes - lots of snakes - this flick does an excellent job. The filming is nothing special : just enough to tell the story well. Indy braves a lot of unique traps and obstacles, all of which are of course awesome to watch.The acting is very good. I'm no film critic, but nobody in Raiders was blatantly bad. Belloq is smooth and intimidating as Indiana's Nazi rival. Harrison Ford IS Jones, no doubt about it. Nobody will ever play Indy as well as that.Overall: 9/10. Awesome. DO NOT MISS. If you don't see this movie, you have no idea what you're missing.",9,0,0,17 October 2004
Edward Scissorhands," A good introduction to Tim Burton
","Edward Scissorhands is a superficial movie, but it is definitely not a shallow one. The movie alone would not stand without a few key elements. Music is the first one. The main theme made me cry before I even watched it. The soundtrack is a must-buy. Go get it right now - you won't regret it.And, of course, there's Johnny Depp's acting. Leo DiCaprio couldn't have done it; Brad Pitt probably couldn't have either. Of course, the copious amounts of makeup help, but in general it's Edward that makes the movie.The atmospheres in 'Scissorhands' are liberally juggled with. First there's the foreboding, anti-fairytale into - then the Day-Glo shades of the neighbourhood and the in-betweens of Ed's living there. Back to the black at the end. Whew.Oh, yeah: if you're emotional, you may want to watch this with your boyfriend/hubby. And bring the Kleenexes. I don't cry easy, and I cried a few times. Be warned.8/10. Worth a view; sure, most of it is pretty boring and trite, but the good parts make up for it.",8,1,2,21 November 2004
Van Helsing," Pretty but lacking in substance
","Let's see. All the previous flicks that involved Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll/Hyde, and/or the Tooth Fairy, were hardly known to b cinematic masterpieces. Unfortunately, Van Helsing keeps up the trend: a plastic array of special effects without any message or lasting 'That was COOL!!'.The original characters- Gabe Van Helsing and Anna (my name! mwee!)- were rather cardboardy. Anna's accent has already been commented on, and frankly, it's awful. Helsing himself is the stereotypical action hero: brave, in love with the leading lady, and otherwise completely personality-free. Karl is also a cardboard cutout for the first half of the movie, only getting some backbone once someone needs to make like Tarzan and swing on a rope.Dracula ... well, I haven't seen either him or Richard Roxburg before, but I was a bit unsatisfied with his performance. Sensual? Yes- TOO sensual. You are playing the part of a blood-sucking, 400-year-old vessel of pure evil. You CANNOT BE THAT PRETTY. Rrgh! Drac's 'brides' were indeed very pretty. However, their transition scenes often looked unimpressive.The CGI was eye candy. Being candy, it was gorgeous but left no lasting mark. The werewolves were cute and fluffy (bad move!), and many of the CG scenes were.... well... they were pretty, but fake. So fake. Sighhhh.However, the cow was cool.Overall: 5/10. Good-looking popcorn movie. Still not as good as Indiana Jones.",5,0,1,30 January 2005
The Island," Fun popcorn flick
","This is not a deep movie. It doesn't have knife-edge dialog, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't require lining up more than three brain cells at a time. It is, instead, a pretty and fast-paced action flick.First, let's do looks. It is pretty. There is good use of color (or lack thereof), there are a few very eye-catching shots (some chase scenes at the beginning and a track following a pipeline, for example). I liked how they portrayed the future: incredible technology does exist, but it's not everywhere - there are run-down bars and trashy cars among all the chrome and gigabytes, just like in real life.The story itself is very simple. Clones escape from their institution and try to reveal their story to the world. Insert hour-long chase scenes and disposable bad guys. For some reason, SEALS are a dime a dozen and can easily be killed by clones who are supposed to have a fifteen-year-old's mentality. And you know what? We don't care. We're just here for the explosions.There are a few memorable scenes, and some that reminded me of other movies - the Matrix and Minority Report are the best two examples, bringing on strong senses of Deja Vu. Also, it was nice to see Boromir and Obi-Wan again.It's not supposed to be brilliant, and it's not. But it's not a total waste of 2 hours, and it's hard to sleep through, so I would rate it a 7/10.",7,2,5,23 July 2005
