Walk the Line," Love and Music
","'Walk the Line' is a movie that really explains with detail the story of the life of Johnny Cash, how he struggled getting into the music industry , and still struggling after getting in the music industry. Before watching this movie I did know that Johnny was a big famous artist during the 1950s. The connection this movie has with current events is that many artist to this day fall in the path of drugs, abusing the use of drugs and alcohol. The main characters in this movie are John R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The director of Walk the Line is James Mangold. My favorite part was when June said yes to Johnny because it's a part we all wait for through out the whole movie so then it does finally happen you getting the feeling of relief. What I didn't like about the movie and it kinda got me mad was that he was married with kids and he was trying to marry someone else that was also married! Overall I really liked the movie, I loved the whole romantic drama between June and Johnny.",8,2,2,6 February 2019
Miracle," cool movie
","The director of Miracle is Gavin O'Connor, main characters are Herb brooks, Patti Brooks, Craig Patrick,Jim Craig, Mike Eruzione, Jack O'Callahan, Rob McClanahan, Ralph Cox,Mark Johnson,Dave Slik, Mike Ramsey,etc. I'm not a really big fan of hockey but this was a good movie. I liked how they went from losing every game to winning all and beating the Soviet Union. I liked how they played for different teams and at they end they all got along, and put their differences aside. I was crazy how hard coach Herb was on the team but it was worth it. I've seen this movie before I would watch it again in or outside of school, and I would recommend people to watch it especially if they like hockey or just any sporting event.",9,1,1,8 May 2019

42," Greatest team .
","Director of 42 is Brian Helgeland . Main characters Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), Branch Rickey(Harrison Ford), Rachael Robinson( Nicole Beharie). This movie shows this historic background of baseball and was it was like and what was the reaction of people when a colored person was introduced to a white baseball team. My favorite part of the movie was when pee wee hugged Jackie for the whole stadium to see, and he did it without people telling him to do it for fame . I didn't like when they treated Jackie unfairly and said nasty things to him. It's sad that this is reality. And it's still seen to this day . Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot . And I would watch it again.",8,1,2,6 February 2019

This is a movie I would watch again, in or outside of school. I would also recommend people who haven't seen it to watch it. I was really sad in the end when Gerry had died, but it was nice to now that Garry and Julius remained friends till Garry's death.",10,0,1,20 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Hidden Talent
","The director for Hidden Figures is Theodore Melfi, main characters are Katherine G. Johnson(Taraji P. Henson), Octavia Spencer(Dorothy Vaughan), and Janelle MonÃ¡e(Mary Jackson). This was a really good movie, this movie really showed what women are really capable of doing, the amazing things women can do, it also shows that women can do the same jobs as men. My favorite scene was when they were in the meeting room and she began to do the math and every single man in that room were surprised, this definitely a movie I would recommend to people to watch especially to men.

Selma," Very Sad.
","The director of Selma is Ava DuVernay, main characters are David Oyelowo (Dr.Martin Luther king, Jr.), Carmen Ejogo (Coretta Scott King), Tim Roth( George Wallace), Tom Wilkinson (President Lyndon B. Johnson). I really enjoyed this movie but it was really sad, its sad to see what they had to go to, all the violence and the criticism. But I really like how at the end of the day they get what they always wanted ,the right to vote. After all the beating and patience they were successful and it was all worth it, I like how they stayed together as a race, best part for me was when the white people joined for a stand, loved when they walked down the bridge well and united. This is a movie I would recommend to other people to watch, its a great movie.",8,0,3,28 February 2019
Thirteen Days," The stress is real.
","Roger Donaldson is the director of Thirteen Days, main characters are Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood). I really liked this movie because it really showed the pressure and stress John F. Kennedy was under in such little time he had to come up with a good non-risky plan, to save the United States. The movie also showed how this event affected citizens, and it showed the fear everyone had. This was a good movie but it is not a movie that I would personally watch outside of school, but overall I did like the movie and I would recommend it to people to watch.",8,2,3,21 February 2019
Apollo 13," Out of the World.
","The director of Apollo 13 is Ron Howard, main characters are Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise( Bill Paxton), Jack Swigert(Kevin Bacon), and Ken Mattingly (Gray Sinise). I really liked this movie, I liked the intensity, and I liked the fact that most of the movie was up in space and it really showed how this trip to the moon was a struggle for these men this movie also showed that people down on earth were scared and worried especially the family of these men. My favorite scene was when they took off, this is a movie I would recommend to people to see, in or outside of school.",8,0,1,19 March 2019
Back to the Future," Back to the future
","The director of 'Back to the Future' is Robert Zemecks, main characters are Marty McFly( Michael J. Fox), Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd),Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson), George McFly(Crispin Glover).
