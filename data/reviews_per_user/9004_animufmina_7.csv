The King's Speech," This is the best movie
","This story based on a man becoming King George Ⅵ of the UK. From this film we can learn the history of the UK. He has difficulty to speak in front of many people so he trains how to speak. The way to practice is very unique, funny and stupid. King George Ⅵ has big pride so he is above practice speaking in such a stupid way. During establishing a relationship of trust between him and his speaking teacher, he can speak and he can swallow his stubborn pride. This film is a bit serious but thanks to funny training scene this film is not so heavy. I cannot stop laughing when I watch funny practice scene. I love costumes of this film. These costumes have a meticulous attention to detail so these are very gorgeous and beautiful. Ironically, the end of this film is a speech of the starting WWⅡ. I feel complicate of this end. However, I like this film and I recommend you to watch this film.",Null,0,0,1 October 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," this film makes everyone's dream come true.
","This film is SF movie. A boy meets an alien- Extra-terrestrial. He tries to it go home. Before I watch this film, I know E.T. as one of character. I though it is a little bit clammy. However, after watching this film, I feel it is an adorable existence. I was impressed this story. Elliott is a warm feeling person. A friendship between Elliott and E.T. is very nice. I think this story is good anywhere in this era and the production of this film is a masterly. Therefore, I can't believe that this film was made over 30 years ago. This story never happens in this real world. This story has many dreams that people go to universe in the future and meet extra-terrestrials for most of history. Everyone never gives up coming true this dream. This film makes everyone's dream happen. I highly recommend you to watch this film.",Null,1,2,1 October 2013
Once," everyone should watch.
","I really enjoyed watching this film. I think this film is a peaceful piece of work. All of songs which played in this film are fantastic. Actually, I wasn't impressed this story. However, I really impressed these songs from the bottom of my heart. These songs are beyond my expectations. After watching this film, I can't get these songs out of my head. These lyrics are wonderful, appeal very strong feeling and express heartrending sorrow about love. Not only songs but also singers' voices are so nice. They have painfully sad singing voice but they also have strong and attractive voice. This story is not full of happiness, it always has something feel sad. However, after watching this film, I feel warm-heart feeling. I really recommend you watch this film from the bottom of my heart. I wonder why this film is not popular in Japan. You should watch this film once, otherwise you will lose something important.",Null,1,1,1 October 2013
Enchanted," This is the best film ever in my life.
","This film is produced by Disney. This story is like Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. In this film, there are many points which remind us about these Disney animations. Finding these points is very exciting. This movie is mixed live-action, animation and musical. The heroine, Giselle is so cute and she has a pure heart. Amy Adams starring this film as Giselle, is very beautiful. She is like real princess from Disney animation world. Musical songs are also fantastic. These songs cheer me up. This film is love comedy so there are many points which make us funny. Prince Edward has good character. He is very funny. He only has eyes for Giselle and I am impressed his strong heart. This film has exciting points, laughing points, and impressing points. This film is the best film ever in all of the Disney films. I really enjoyed watching this film. I recommend you to watch this from bottom of my heart.",Null,0,0,1 October 2013
The Artist," I really recommend you watch
","This film is a silent and black-and-white movie. This story is love story. Of course, there are no lines, however, instead of using lines there are much background music. Those music are very nice, I'm deeply moved those. Thanks to a lot of background music, we can feel character's affections. Moreover, even if there is no color, we can feel color through background music and cast's expressions. Those music and expressions show very sensitive feelings. I think those are the special aspect of silent and black-and -white movie. Though cast's acting is awesome, I think the best actor in this film is a dog. I'm really surprised it because it's really look like human actor. I can't call the dog as It, I should call the dog, He. I've never watch such a good dog actor in my life. I think this film is a surely cinematic masterpiece. Everyone should see this film.",Null,1,4,1 October 2013
Inception," This film is mysterious
","This film is a mystery and adventure movie. Actually, I'm not good at an adventure movie but I'm interested in this film from its trailer. I really enjoy watching this film. I'm really surprised at imaging technique in this film. The world of this film is not real world but it looks like real world. I want to go the world once. I respect Ken Watanabe very much because he participates actively all over the world. He stars in this film as Saito. I think Saito is one of the key person in this story. I feel this story is a little bit complicated for me. Sometimes I was confused which world is the dream or which world is the real. This confuse leads me exciting. I can't stop having the racing pulse while I'm watching this film. The end of this film is also mysterious. I'm really excited watching this film from the top to the end. I recommend you to watch this film.",Null,0,1,1 October 2013
The Social Network," I learned many things from this film.
","This film is about Mark Zuckerberg creates Facebook and how to make Facebook. Before watching this film, I've never known about him. After watching this film, I'm not impressed by him. However, I really respect him because he made the most wonderful website in the world. I think everyone watches this movie won't have good impression of him because this film makes him bad man. I don't know what is fact and what is a fiction in this film. However from the directorial technique of this film, everything looks like fact. I think actors in this film are very nice. I really think Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and I dislike him from bottom of my heart in the scene he gets on girl's bad side. From this film I learned that importance of decision and awfulness of desire. I think Mark mistook what he chooses because he wants to make Facebook cool more and more. This film makes us think importance of decision and awfulness of desire.",Null,0,0,1 October 2013
