Blade Runner 2049," The opposite of Blade Runner
","This proves it: Philip K. Dick was the true genius. The movie had no idea regarding editing, action and very little about entertainment.It was just a generic sequel/mediocre cash grab, but with a little bit of Blade Runner label to sell it. Take your favorite restaurant and transplant it into the middle of a Walmart. That would be this movie.The girls were pretty and had nice hair, but the plot was extremely boring and conflicted with the times. I paid $12 and want $7.50 of it back because most of this bored me unlike its prequel.",4,5,9,3 December 2017
