Scarface," Typical De Palma, Typical Pacino
","Bit of a flawed masterpiece, this. Sticking with the flaws first: De Palma's handling (or non-handling) of female roles is apparent, with Elvira and Gina being little more than scantily-clad cardboard cut-outs. The soundtrack is also typical De Palma - tacky. The overall plot is very thin (you can make a lot of money out of drug-dealing, and you'll probably end up dead). However, De Palma's instinct for excess works well in this film, with the tracking-shots and the rich colours being ideally suited to the decadence resulting from having so much cash that you need machines to count it and helpers to carry it in to the bank. It's really Al Pacino that carries the film, though (how often have we said that?). His accent is a bit dodgy but apart from that he does a magnificent job in a multi-faceted role: charismatic male-buddy, charming ladies-man, street-smart operator, vicious tough-guy with a heart. You imagine what a great life he could've led if only he'd picked a different career! The scene in the restaurant where he rants at the 'straight' people is really the closest we get to the message of the film - it's just a shame that he had to be stoned: imagine what a speech he could've made if his mind was clear! I still prefer The Godfather(I & II) and Dog Day Afternoon, but we'll make this Al's 3rd-best performance.",9,0,0,21 July 1999
Citizen Kane," Dumbfounded by mediocrity
","Far and away the most overrated film of all time. Lousy acting, unsympathetic characters, thin plot (power corrupts and money doesn't necessarily bring happiness) which is spoon-fed laboriously to the hapless viewer in an over-long and unevenly paced stream. Mildly interesting for the visual and directorial techniques that were new at the time (but so what?). Just about worth watching on a rainy afternoon if you have nothing better to do and want to find out what all the fuss is about.",5,3,9,2 November 1998
12 Monkeys," Gilliam, Willis and Pitt at their best.
","Time-travel is always a tricky (ridiculous?) element in a film's plot, but, if you don't think about that aspect too much, this film is immensely rewarding.You'll have to concentrate while watching it and probably see it at least twice.This is easily Bruce Willis' best role: he struggles his way through having a thoroughly miserable time, getting beaten up at regular intervals and alternating between bewildered and driven the rest of the time. Brad Pitt is superb as the m-m-mad son-of-a-biologist: he creates a totally believable set of speech and hand-movement tics, and manages to be funny and sympathetic.The switch two-thirds of the way in when Madelaine Stowe starts to believe that Bruce Willis is sane, but he becomes convinced that he's crazy provides extra impetus to keep us thinking (remember when you used to do that while watching a film?) and propel us towards the finale.The ending is thoroughly satisfying, Gilliam's visuals are spot-on (as usual) and the viewer is treated like an adult (hoorah!).",10,0,0,28 July 1999
Barry Lyndon," Most Beautiful Film Ever Made
","Many factors contribute to what makes a good movie. Occasionally, a movie stands out so much in one particular area that it outweighs it's shortcomings in others. Shot-composition, lighting and costume-design combine to make this the most beautiful movie ever made. Many, if not most, scenes could be displayed in art galleries as old masters and no-one would notice. At just over three hours long, the pace rarely seems to drag, because the viewer is so caught up in the mind-boggling beauty being paraded before his/her eyes.From the Thackeray novel of an Irish lad's adventures, rise in society and ultimate demise, Kubrick plays it as a tragi-comedy of manners, which fits well with the narration from the novel and the stagey visuals, but I found myself wishing for better rounded characters: Marisa Berenson should have been a key character, but she is hardly even given a line; Ryan O'Neal is actually rather good, but I'm sure he could have done even better with more script to work with. But characterisation has never been what Kubrick is about anyway, so I guess he was playing to his strengths. A monumental achievement that deserves to be more widely appreciated.",8,2,4,23 January 2001
The Exorcist," No Laughing Matter
","Much (too much?) has been written about this film so I'll restrict this review to my personal response only. It does have flaws: the opening sequence in Iraq, although beautiful to look at, is ultimately superfluous (although it obviously inspires the similar setting at the beginning of 'The Omen',  which is used with much greater relevance); the pacing is very uneven and the young priest couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It makes up for its shortcomings with a superb performance from Ellen Burstyn as the mother and an unparalleled performance from Linda Blair as the girl. The final scenes of the exorcism are some of the most powerful ever put onto film (and MUST BE VIEWED ON A BIG SCREEN to appreciate their full impact). The film is harrowing rather than scary, with repeated visits into the girl's bedroom becoming just as full of dread for the audience as for the characters. The demon-possessed Linda Blair is one of the most memorable icons in cinema history. Still banned on video in the UK (mainly because of how young Linda Blair is than for any other reason), this is the only example of censorship of a mainstream film that I support. See the film and, for goodness sake, watch it with your disbelief suspended (sorry if this is stating the obvious, but there were people around me in the cinema laughing at various scenes when there is NOTHING REMOTELY FUNNY about what goes on). Finally, although I said I was going to keep this brief, this is roughly double the size of my average review for imdb and I've had intermittent goosebumps all the way through writing it.",9,0,0,4 November 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," Why so high?
","This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.",7,1,1,2 November 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Watch Solaris instead!
","I watched this for the first time in years recently, and was hugely disappointed.The acting is abysmal - it would've been better to go over the top and ham it up, as in a film like in Flash Gordon. The script couldn't possibly have taken longer than 20 minutes to write: I know it's supposed to be a 'simple tale of good and evil', but that's no excuse for completely omitting a plot.To give it some credit, some of the sets look good (especially the interior of the death-star) and Darth Vader livens things up a bit whenever he's on screen.How this film has taken on the aura that it has is one of the many phenomena of modern life that beggar belief (like the popularity of mobile phones).Incidentally, I was a 13 year old boy when the film came out in 1977 (a perfect age for being hooked, you would think), but I don't remember liking it much then either.",6,1,3,18 August 1999
Ran," Perfection At Every Level.
","This is one of the few 'perfect' films that I have ever seen. It is staggeringly good on whichever level you choose. Taking the best aspects of the Shakespeare sub-structure, but perfectly satisfying in its own right; Cataclysmic, cast-of-thousands (well, hundreds!) battle scenes; big issues of loyalty, betrayal, revenge, man's destiny to struggle and suffer in a godless universe; intensely personal, immaculately acted scenes to point up character and motivation; exquisite imagery and cinematography (making the sky the real star of the film!).Mieko Harada (playing Lady Kaede) dominates the screen whenever she appears. Her character is so ruthless it almost defies belief. The scene in which she pulls a knife on Lord Jiro is one that gives me goosebumps whenever I think of it, and one of my top 3 scenes in any film.This is a film that treats the viewer as an intelligent adult, and has the density of content to repeatedly reward. This is why we keep going to the cinema: the hope of finding another film this good.",10,1,3,11 October 1999
