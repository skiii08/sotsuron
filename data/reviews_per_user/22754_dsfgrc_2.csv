The Lobster," Bonkers and beautiful
","Somehow I just don't think this will be shown on TV in a holiday viewing period. Utterly bonkers, but beautiful.",Null,0,1,18 May 2019
Rocketman," Mamma Mia on speed
","Slick, polished and hugely gripping, it doesn't slow down for a second. Doesn't really touch on key theme of addiction and brushes away living life sober, but hey, its a good film WTF!",6,1,2,6 June 2019
