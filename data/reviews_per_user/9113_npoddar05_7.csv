Skyfall," Craig sets highest standards for Bond !!.. Truly a Masterpiece !
","Skyfall brings a very good news for old Bond lovers who missed Moneypenny, Q and cool gadgets in previous two movies. Daniel has proved once again himself to be the best Bond ever. Javier was just perfect as Bond villain. Skyfall is more about personal vengeance than any security threat to England. The movie is bit lengthy but works fine with Sam Mendes's cutting edge direction. Daniel has once again showed how physically fit he is with another great chase scene.It's all about things happened between Casino Royale and Dr.No. Skyfall standouts as the perfect homage to 50 years of Bond franchise. The movie feels like classic 60's Bond movie. Highly recommended !!",8,0,6,1 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Just go for a wild ride Agent Hunt !! One more time !!
","Mission Impossible is getting better with every new addition to the franchisee. Rogue Nation comes with an intelligent plot and great action stunts which are also believable at the same time. The under water sequence is really breath taking one. It's total Cruise control and it doesn't matter whether you are a Tom Cruise fan or not, it's a must watch for all action flick lovers. Even at the age of 53, Tom Cruise has performed unbelievable stunts. Jeremy Renner is a great actor, so he deserves a bit more part to play. Simon Pegg has done a great job with his witty lines and by playing more integral role than the last one. Rebecca was sexy and superb. Don't miss it guys !",8,0,2,9 August 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," This web is not strong enough to hold you...
","The next generation Spidey is here to save the world from a scientist turned evil !! Does it excites you ? Not anymore right ! Neither The Amazing Spiderman has got anything new to offer you. Though Andrew Garfield plays great as a new Peter Parker/Spiderman, but director Marc Webb failed to keep up the same adrenaline level the way Sam Raimi did.The movie starts with the childhood of Peter when his parents leave him to his uncle Ben and aunt May when they found themselves in some bad consequences. Peter wants to know the reason behind his parents sudden disappearance which leads him to meet his father's old time friend Dr. Curt Connors, who is working on cross genetic breeding with lizard DNA which (very obvious) later becomes the reason behind his turning into evil Dr. Lizard. However, the secret of Peter's parents has not been disclosed completely and kept for future movies in the series.The Amazing Spiderman is reboot of the Spidey series based on 2nd generation of Stan Lee's Spiderman, who does not exerts spider web naturally from his wrist the way old Spiderman use to do. Instead, the new Spidey goes with the idea of web shooters around his wrist which was actually the part of original Spiderman comics. The only thing Peter got from the bite of radioactive spider is super active alert sense. The thing which The Amazing Spiderman really lacked is something dark and serious stuff like Batman and Iron Man series. Movie goers are now no more interested in exact comical adaptation. Audience is much matured because of the bars raised by movies like The Dark Knight. Moreover, after watching the blockbuster The Avengers, which is the assembly of six superheroes, released in same current year , new Spidey shows no charm to keep you spellbound in his new web.The only best thing about The Amazing Spiderman is the choice of Andrew Garfield as the new Peter Parker/Spiderman. Andrew has done a great job and has proved himself to be the perfect next generation Spidey but, the movie revolves more around Peter Parker's life rather than Spiderman. Moreover, neither Uncle Ben and Aunt May have not shown strong influence on Peter's life nor Uncle Ben has uttered the infamous line 'With great power comes with great responsibility' in the whole movie. However, Andrew's Peter Parker is smart and witty unlike Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker (who was dull and sad most of the time in first two installment of previous series). Andrew doesn't disappoints you, however, we hope he will improve with the series to do the Tobey act of Spiderman 3. Still you would agree with director Marc Webb's words, 'You will love Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker.'Overall you can enjoy only if you do erase the sweet memories of the previous Spiderman series and watch it with no high expectations.",5,2,6,6 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Speechless...
","Wow !! How can a superhero movie be so real yet amazing !! Well you should not doubt when it's made by Christopher Nolan. Chris is now the third name in my list after James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. The Dark Knight Rises is a real dark movie with a very strong message,'Anybody can be hero'. It's very sad that Christopher Nolan ended the series but this trilogy had been the best superhero trilogy till date. Christian Bale did a great job, both as Batman and Bruce Wayne and will remain the best Batman ever. Anne Hathway looked pretty hot as Catwoman and showed her some really good acting skills. Tom Hardy appeared huge and perfect as Bane. Rest all did a wonderful and flawless job. This flick is a must watch before you die. MINDBLOWING...",10,9,18,12 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Magic Re-Awakens
","George Lucas just found the perfect replacement for himself. No one can do it better than J J Abrams. Though the new addition to the Star Wars franchisee is a just a smart and an intelligent remake of the first Star War movie, 'Episode IV: The New Hope', the series gets perfectly re-booted for the new generation of audience. Harrison Ford steals the show as Han Solo. The new character Rey played by Daisy Ridley is someone you will not forget. Daisy really shows some potential to be another legendary character of Star Wars. The magic of Star Wars gets a great restart. Don't miss to witness the war of good & evil in galaxy and to get spellbound ...again!",8,2,25,25 December 2015
Spectre," Wow !! Bond Forever....
","James Bond is back to it's roots and it's still refreshingly classic. Aston Martin DB10, Omega Seamaster 300, Lea Seadoux as Bond girl, Cristoph Waltz as Bond villain and Dave Bautista as villain's henchman makes this movie a perfect old times Bond movie. The exotic locations, high adrenaline action and Daniel Craig's charming act makes it also perfect for new age Bond fans. Whether you are a Bond fan or not, this flick just can't be missed. Go for a wild ride with Mr.Bond and be both shaken and stirred. You will see shades of shades of both Sean Connery and Roger Moore in Daniel Craig's Bond. Cristoph Waltz deserves bit more to be done, but he is just perfect in whatever he did. Lea Sedoux looks elegant & hot and did justice to her role as Bond girl. Ben Whishaw makes it great as the new Q, and this time his job is not just to get Bond ready with gadgets for his new mission but more than that. I wish Daniel will return as Bond for one more time.",10,2,8,18 December 2015
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park + 3D = Mindblowing !! ... the charm is still alive...
","If you call Steven Spielberg as The God of Hollywood, it would be surely not an overstatement. Even after watching Jurassic Park after 20 years it seems like Steven was aware of the 3D revolution going to happen in future. Jurassic Park is anytime a worth watch but after watching it in 3D you will feel like it's a complete refresh. It's still enjoyable, but now more scary with heart pounding special effects. This 3D version of the classic does'nt deserve a miss if you really loved the original one and specially if you are fan of Steven Spielberg. Go and enjoy it again, may be with your children this time ! :-)",10,2,3,7 April 2013
